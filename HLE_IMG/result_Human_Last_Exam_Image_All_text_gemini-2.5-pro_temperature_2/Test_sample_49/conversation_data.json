    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$ and the rest of the ladder network. This forms a first-order RC low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency is determined by the time constant of this RC circuit, which depends on the capacitance $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the network as seen by the capacitor.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency is given by $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$, and the cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C}$. Our main task is to calculate $R_{th}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance looking into the terminals where the capacitor is connected, which are $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). According to Thevenin's theorem, all independent sources in the circuit must be turned off. The input voltage source `IN` at node $g_0$ is an independent voltage source, so it is replaced by a short circuit, effectively grounding node $g_0$.\n\nSo, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $d_0$ (which is the same node as $a_0$) and ground. Note that node $g_0$ is also at ground potential for this calculation.\n\n**3. Simplify the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe network is an infinite ladder of identical sections. A key technique for infinite structures is to recognize that the impedance looking into any section is the same as looking into the next section.\nLet's find the equivalent resistance, $R_x$, of the infinite ladder portion starting from nodes $g_1$ and $d_1$ upwards, as seen looking into these two nodes.\nThis resistance $R_x$ is composed of the rung resistor `r` (between $g_1$ and $d_1$) in parallel with the rest of the ladder path. This path consists of the vertical resistor from $g_1$ to $g_2$ (resistance `r`), the vertical resistor from $d_1$ to $d_2$ (resistance `r`), and the rest of the infinite ladder from nodes $g_2, d_2$ onwards (which has resistance $R_x$).\n\nSo, $R_x$ must satisfy the recursive relationship:\n$R_x = r \\parallel (r + r + R_x) = r \\parallel (2r + R_x)$\nUsing the formula for parallel resistors:\n$R_x = \\frac{r(2r + R_x)}{r + (2r + R_x)} = \\frac{2r^2 + rR_x}{3r + R_x}$\n\nRearranging this gives a quadratic equation for $R_x$:\n$R_x(3r + R_x) = 2r^2 + rR_x$\n$3rR_x + R_x^2 = 2r^2 + rR_x$\n$R_x^2 + 2rR_x - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for $R_x$ using the formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$R_x = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$R_x = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**4. Calculate $R_{th}$ of the simplified circuit**\nNow we can simplify the circuit for calculating $R_{th}$. The entire infinite ladder above nodes $g_1$ and $d_1$ can be replaced by a single resistor $R_x = r(\\sqrt{3}-1)$ connected between $g_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe total equivalent resistance between $g_1$ and $d_1$ is the original rung resistor `r` in parallel with $R_x$. Let's call this $R_1$:\n$R_1 = r \\parallel R_x = r \\parallel r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n$\\frac{1}{R_1} = \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1) + 1}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}$\n$R_1 = \\frac{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\\sqrt{3}} = r(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$\n\nNow we calculate the total Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from node $d_0$ to ground. With $g_0$ grounded, the path from $d_0$ to ground goes through a series of resistors:\n- From $d_0$ to $d_1$: resistor `r`\n- From $d_1$ to $g_1$: resistor $R_1$\n- From $g_1$ to $g_0$ (ground): resistor `r`\n\nThese three resistive elements are in series. Therefore, $R_{th}$ is their sum:\n$R_{th} = r + R_1 + r = 2r + R_1$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_1$:\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = 3r - \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{3}} = r(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$\n\n**5. Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is given by:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C}$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $R_{th}$:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi C [r(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})]} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r C(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}$\n\nThis expression can be rationalized for a cleaner form:\n$3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\nSo, $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r C \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\pi r C (3\\sqrt{3}-1)}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which can refer to angular frequency $\\omega_c$ or frequency in Hz, $f_c$. As $\\omega_c$ provides a more compact expression, we can state it.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r C(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}$\n\n<<<$1 / (2\\pi r C(3 - 1/\\sqrt{3}))$>>>"
