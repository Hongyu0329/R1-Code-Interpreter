    "The plant in the image is a cultivar of *Hebe*, likely *Hebe franciscana 'Variegata'* or a similar hybrid. Hebes are a group of evergreen shrubs, with most species being native to New Zealand. The specific plant in the image, a variegated cultivar, originated from a cross between two New Zealand Hebe species, *Hebe elliptica* and *Hebe speciosa*. Therefore, the parent species of this plant were endemic to New Zealand.\n\nThe genus *Hebe* includes about 90 species, the vast majority of which are found only in New Zealand. Some cultivars, like 'Blue Gem', are noted as being valuable for seaside landscaping and are hardy in many climates. While the hybrid itself originated in cultivation, its parentage is from plants endemic to the islands of New Zealand.\n\n<<<New Zealand>>>"
