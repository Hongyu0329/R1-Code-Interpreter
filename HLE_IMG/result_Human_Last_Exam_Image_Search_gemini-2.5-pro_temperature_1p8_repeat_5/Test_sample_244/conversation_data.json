    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Cystocoleus***.\n\nThis organism is a filamentous lichen, which is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. The appearance of a black, felt-like, or net-like mat on tree bark or shaded rocks is characteristic of this genus.\n\nKey identifying features visible in the image that align with the genus *Cystocoleus* include:\n*   **Color and Texture**: The growth is composed of sooty-brown to black, densely packed, brittle filaments that create a felt-like or cottony appearance.\n*   **Structure**: The thallus (the body of the lichen) is made of fine, thread-like filaments that are branched and form an intricate network on the surface of the bark. The fungal hyphae surround filaments of the green alga *Trentepohlia*. Although the alga contains orange pigments, the dense, dark fungal sheath gives the lichen its overall black appearance.\n*   **Habitat**: *Cystocoleus* is known to grow on the bark of trees in damp, shaded environments, as well as on siliceous rock faces.\n*   **Sterile Nature**: This lichen is considered sterile because it is not known to produce visible reproductive structures (ascomata), so identification relies on its unique filamentous structure.\n\nThe genus *Cystocoleus* is considered monospecific, containing only the species *Cystocoleus ebeneus*. It can be macroscopically indistinguishable from the related genus *Racodium*, but detailed descriptions of its tangled, net-like filaments on bark strongly support the identification as *Cystocoleus*.\n\n<<<Cystocoleus>>>"
