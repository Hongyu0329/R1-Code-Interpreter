    "**Timestamps of synchronized bursts:**\nThe synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of dense firing activity, occur at the following approximate start times:\n*   Burst 1: 2 s\n*   Burst 2: 11 s\n*   Burst 3: 18 s\n*   Burst 4: 26 s\n*   Burst 5: 35 s\n*   Burst 6: 44 s\n\n**Calculation of the average inter-burst interval:**\n1.  The inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time difference between the start of consecutive bursts.\n    *   IBI 1 = 11 s - 2 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 18 s - 11 s = 7 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 26 s - 18 s = 8 s\n    *   IBI 4 = 35 s - 26 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI 5 = 44 s - 35 s = 9 s\n2.  The average inter-burst interval is the sum of the individual intervals divided by the number of intervals.\n    *   Average IBI = (9 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9) s / 5 = 42 s / 5 = 8.4 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, to two significant figures, is 8.4 seconds.\n<<<8.4>>>"
