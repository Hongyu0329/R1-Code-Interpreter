    "Here is the two-move checkmate for White:\n\n**1. Rf3xf4+**\n\nThe first move is for the White Rook on f3 to capture the Black Pawn on f4, which places the Black King in check. Black's only legal response is to move the King out of check. The King's only available safe square is d3.\n\n**2. Qa4-c2#**\n\nFollowing Black's forced move to d3, the White Queen moves from a4 to c2. This is checkmate, as the Black King has no escape squares and the Queen cannot be captured.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why it is checkmate:\n*   The King on d3 is attacked by the Queen on c2.\n*   All potential escape squares are covered by White's other pieces:\n    *   c4 is controlled by the pawn on b4.\n    *   d4, e4, and e2 are controlled by the Rook on f4.\n    *   e3 is controlled by the Bishop on g1.\n    *   d2 is controlled by the Bishop on g2.\n    *   c3 is controlled by the Queen on c2.\n\n<<<1. Rxf4+ Kd3 2. Qc2#>>>"
