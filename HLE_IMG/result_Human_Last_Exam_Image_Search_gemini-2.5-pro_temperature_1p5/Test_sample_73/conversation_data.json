    "Based on the principles of stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms, here is the assignment for the four stereocenters:\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactant 1 (Acyl Chloride):**\n*   The chiral carbon is bonded to a phenyl group (-C6H5), a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3), a methoxy group (-OCH3), and a carbonyl chloride group (-COCl).\n*   Using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, the groups are ranked as follows: (1) -OCH3, (2) -COCl, (3) -CF3, (4) -C6H5.\n*   In the given diagram, the methoxy group (priority 1) is on a wedge, and the trifluoromethyl group (priority 3) is on a dash. To determine the configuration, we can perform a double swap or visualize with the lowest priority group in the back. Swapping the lowest priority group (-C6H5, #4) with the group on the dash (-CF3, #3) places the phenyl group in the back and inverts the stereocenter for our analysis.\n*   After the swap, the path from priority 1 (-OCH3, wedge) to 2 (-COCl, in plane) to 3 (-CF3, now in plane) is counter-clockwise (S).\n*   Since a single swap reverses the configuration, the original stereocenter is **(R)**. This molecule is correctly identified as a derivative of (R)-Mosher's acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of Reactant 2 (Alcohol):**\n*   The chiral carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), an implied hydrogen (-H), a methoxymethyl group (-CH2OCH3), and an isobutyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   The CIP priorities are: (1) -OH, (2) -CH2OCH3, (3) -CH2CH(CH3)2, (4) -H.\n*   The diagram shows the hydroxyl group (priority 1) on a wedge, which implies the hydrogen (priority 4) is on a dash (pointing away).\n*   With the lowest priority group in the back, the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise.\n*   Therefore, the configuration of the alcohol stereocenter is **(S)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Product:**\n*   This reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution (an esterification). The alcohol's oxygen attacks the carbonyl carbon of the acyl chloride.\n*   This type of reaction does not break any bonds directly attached to the chiral centers of either reactant.\n*   Consequently, the stereochemistry of both chiral centers is retained in the final ester product.\n*   The stereocenter that originated from the alcohol remains **(S)** and is located on the left side of the product molecule as drawn.\n*   The stereocenter that originated from the acyl chloride remains **(R)** and is located on the right side of the product molecule as drawn.\n\nFollowing the reaction scheme from left to right, the sequence of stereochemical assignments is:\n\n*   Reactant 1: **(R)**\n*   Reactant 2: **(S)**\n*   Product (left stereocenter): **(S)**\n*   Product (right stereocenter): **(R)**\n\n<<<R, S, S, R>>>"
