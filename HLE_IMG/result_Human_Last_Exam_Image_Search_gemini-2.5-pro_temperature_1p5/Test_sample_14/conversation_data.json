    "Based on a careful analysis of the image provided, the Kenken puzzle is invalid and contains multiple errors that make it unsolvable according to the standard rules. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the numbers on the top horizontal line.\n\nHere are the reasons why the puzzle is unsolvable:\n\n1.  **Impossible Arithmetic Cages:** In a 4x4 Kenken puzzle, each row and column must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   The top-left cage requires two numbers in a column to sum to 8 (`8+`). The highest possible sum of two distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, this cage is impossible.\n    *   There is another cage with the clue `8+`. For the same reason, this is also impossible.\n    *   One cage has the clue `2+` for two horizontally adjacent cells. The only way to get a sum of 2 using positive integers is 1 + 1. However, this would require placing the number 1 twice in the same row, which violates the fundamental rules of Kenken.\n\n2.  **Ambiguous and Contradictory Cage Layout:** The boundaries of the cages, which are indicated by the thicker lines, are not clearly drawn. In several places, clues appear in locations that conflict with each other, or cell boundaries are ambiguous. For example, it is unclear which cells belong to the `6*` cage versus the `2+` cage.\n\nDue to these fundamental flaws in the puzzle's design, no valid solution exists. Any attempt to provide the four numbers for the top row would be speculative and not based on a solvable puzzle.\n\n"
