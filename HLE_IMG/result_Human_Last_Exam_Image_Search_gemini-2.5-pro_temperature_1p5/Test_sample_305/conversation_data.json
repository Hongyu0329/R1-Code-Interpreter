    "The product featured in the advertisement is Tampax.\n\nThis World War II-era advertisement, dated to 1942, promoted the use of tampons as a way for women to contribute more effectively to the war effort. The slogan, \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" directly linked the product to patriotic duty.\n\nBy using this product, women workers in factories and other essential roles could \"overcome inherent limitations,\" a common euphemism for managing menstruation without the discomfort and inconvenience of older, bulkier methods. This allowed them to work more continuously and comfortably, thereby maximizing their contribution to wartime production.\n\nThe brand name Tampax is derived from the word \"tampon,\" which itself has French origins. The word \"tampon\" comes from the medieval French word \"tampion,\" which means a plug, stamp, or stopper.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
