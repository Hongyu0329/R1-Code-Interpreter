    "Based on the architectural style and canal, this image was taken in the Netherlands.\n\nThe photograph is of the Damsterdiep canal in Appingedam, a historic town in the northeastern Netherlands. The building with the prominent red and white stepped gable is a classic example of Dutch architecture.\n\nAppingedam is known for its well-preserved medieval buildings and its \"hanging kitchens,\" where kitchens were extended over the back of houses along the canal due to lack of space. The town, which received city rights in 1327, was once an important seaport and trading competitor to the nearby city of Groningen.\n\n<<<Netherlands>>>"
