    "The image provided is completely black and does not show any molecules. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the relationship between them.\n\nTo answer the question, I would need to see the chemical structures of the molecules in question. Based on their structures, I could determine if they are:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** Different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.\n*   **(c) Identical:** The same molecule, simply oriented differently.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula and connectivity, but a different arrangement of atoms in space.\n\nWithout the image of the molecules, I cannot provide a definitive answer."
