    "An analysis of the four iridium complexes reveals that their core structure, [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, and the ancillary N^N ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) are identical. The variation between them lies in the fluorine substitution on the phenyl rings of the cyclometalating C^N ligands.\n\n*   **Complex 1:** Two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands (four fluorine atoms total).\n*   **Complex 2:** One 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand and one 2-phenylpyridine ligand (two fluorine atoms total).\n*   **Complex 3:** Two 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligands (two fluorine atoms total).\n*   **Complex 4:** Two 2-phenylpyridine ligands (no fluorine atoms).\n\nThe operational lifetime of these emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is closely tied to their chemical stability. It has been a common strategy to add fluorine atoms to the cyclometalating ligands to increase the energy gap and achieve bluer emissions. This is achieved because the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms stabilize the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complex. While this can increase the photoluminescence quantum yield, it can have a negative impact on device lifetime.\n\nSpecifically for green-emitting LECs, studies have shown that increasing the fluorine content in the iridium complex leads to decreased operational stability and thus a shorter lifetime. This degradation is often attributed to the cleavage of the C-F bonds under operational bias.\n\nBased on this trend, the complexes with a higher number of fluorine substituents are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n*   **Complex 1** has the highest fluorine content (four F atoms).\n*   **Complexes 2 and 3** have intermediate fluorine content (two F atoms each).\n*   **Complex 4** has no fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, Complex 1 is expected to have the shortest lifetime, followed by Complexes 2 and 3. Complex 4, being fluorine-free, would be expected to have the longest lifetime of the series. The question asks which are expected to show *shorter* lifetimes. Following the direct correlation found in the literature between increased fluorine content and decreased lifetime for green emitters, the most fluorinated complexes will be the least stable. Complex 1 has the most fluorine atoms, making it a strong candidate for a short lifetime. Between complexes 2 and 3, both having two fluorine atoms, it is less straightforward to predict their relative stability without more specific data, but both will be less stable than the non-fluorinated complex 4. Since the question allows for multiple answers, the complexes with any fluorine content are likely to be less stable than the one without.\n\nA study that directly investigated a series of complexes including these four found that a shorter device lifetime is obtained upon increasing the fluorine content of the emitter. Another study focusing on similar green emitters, including complex 1, also found that LECs based on complexes with fluorine substituents showed high degradation rates. Therefore, the complexes containing fluorine atoms (1, 2, and 3) would be expected to have shorter lifetimes than the fluorine-free complex (4), with complex 1 likely having the shortest. Given the answer choices, the most appropriate selection would encompass the fluorinated complexes as having shorter lifetimes.\n\n<<<K>>>"
