    "Based on the clues provided, the X Y is a **Felt Hat**. Here is the reasoning:\n\n**Clue 1: A process using toxic mercury salts.**\n\nThe creation of felt for hats in the 18th and 19th centuries involved a process called \"carroting\". In this process, animal fur was treated with a solution of mercury(II) nitrate, a toxic mercury salt, to make the fibers easier to mat together. This process was notoriously hazardous to the workers. The vapors produced during felting led to widespread mercury poisoning among hatmakers, a condition known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism. This neurological disorder caused symptoms like tremors (known as the \"Danbury shakes\"), confusion, and emotional instability. The use of mercury in the felt industry was eventually banned in the United States in 1941, fitting the description of a practice that has \"almost ceased to be used\".\n\n**Clue 2: An event pictured on June 20, 2019.**\n\nWhile the image provided shows a man receiving a spherical award, and its specific identification is challenging, the term \"Felt Hat\" is the most direct and historically significant answer to the chemical clue. Riddles of this nature often rely on a strong, well-known primary clue with a more abstract or difficult-to-verify secondary clue. While several awards ceremonies took place on June 20, 2019, including the Libera Awards for independent music in New York and the Fulbright Scholars awards ceremony in Greece, there is no direct visual match or connection to the term \"Felt Hat\". The most logical conclusion is that \"Felt Hat\" is the intended answer based on the strong and specific historical and chemical evidence.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
