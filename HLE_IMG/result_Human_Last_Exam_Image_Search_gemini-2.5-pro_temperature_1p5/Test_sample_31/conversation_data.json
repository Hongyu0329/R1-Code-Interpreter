    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₈ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s, is a powerful tool in knot theory derived from Khovanov homology. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen invariant is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots like 8₁₈, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature, which is also 0 for this particular knot.\n\nThe 8₁₈ knot is one of the 21 prime knots with a crossing number of eight. It is an alternating, amphichiral knot, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n<<<0>>>"
