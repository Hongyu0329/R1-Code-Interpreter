    "The artist of the painting is Jacek Yerka.\n\nThe artwork, a hallmark of surrealism, is created by the Polish artist Jacek Yerka, who was born in Toruń, Poland, in 1952. Yerka is known for his fantastical and dream-like compositions. His parents were also artists, and he graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. His work has been exhibited internationally in countries such as Poland, Germany, Monaco, France, and the United States.\n\nYerka's paintings often explore the juxtaposition of different worlds and strange, imaginary landscapes. Many of his works can be found in Polish museums and have been featured in various publications. In 1995, he was awarded the World Fantasy Award.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
