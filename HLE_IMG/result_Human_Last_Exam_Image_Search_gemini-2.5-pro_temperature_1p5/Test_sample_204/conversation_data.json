    "Based on their visual characteristics and common mineral forms, the specimens are identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen is an aggregate of green, granular crystals, characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which has the simplest silicate structure consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra bonded by ions.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Augite (Pyroxene Group)**\n    This is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal, typical of augite, which is a member of the pyroxene group. Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** with single chains of silica tetrahedra. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Chlorite (Mica Group)**\n    This specimen displays a flaky, green, sheet-like habit. This appearance is characteristic of minerals in the mica group, such as chlorite. Micas are **phyllosilicates**, or sheet silicates, where tetrahedra are linked in two-dimensional sheets. This layered structure is more complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This translucent, light-brown crystal with a hexagonal shape and no apparent cleavage is identifiable as quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate**, or framework silicate, where every corner of each silica tetrahedron is shared, forming a continuous three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\nThe order of the specimens from the simplest to the most complex silicate structure is:\n\n**C, A, B, D**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
