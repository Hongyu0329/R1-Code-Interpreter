    "**Title:** Minor Swing.\n\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz, Swing.\n\n**Country of Origin:** France.\n\n\"Minor Swing\" is a renowned composition in the Gypsy Jazz style, written by the celebrated Belgian-born Romani-French guitarist Django Reinhardt and French jazz violinist St√©phane Grappelli. First recorded in Paris in 1937 by their group, the Quintette du Hot Club de France, the piece is considered a signature work of Reinhardt and a standard of the swing era. The song is characterized by its infectious rhythm and provides a vehicle for virtuosic improvisation over its repeated chord sequence. The Quintette du Hot Club de France, which created this piece, consisted solely of string instruments: three guitars, a violin, and a double bass.<<<**Title:** Minor Swing\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz, Swing\n**Country of Origin:** France>>>"
