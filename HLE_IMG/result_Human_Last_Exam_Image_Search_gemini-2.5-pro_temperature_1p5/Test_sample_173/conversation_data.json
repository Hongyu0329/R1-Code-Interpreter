    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total value of the notes and rests within it. The time signature indicates how many beats are in a measure and what type of note gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Measure:**\n\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The rhythm in the left hand is the most straightforward to count. It consists of four distinct chords/notes.\n    *   The first is a chord (F# and A#) that is a quarter note.\n    *   The second is a single B, which is a quarter note.\n    *   The third is a single E, also a quarter note.\n    *   The fourth is a single A#, another quarter note.\n    *   Adding these up gives a total of four quarter notes.\n\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The rhythm here is more complex, but should add up to the same total as the left hand.\n    *   **Beat 1:** Begins with a sixteenth rest followed by a sixteenth-note chord. These two combine to equal one eighth note. This is followed by a group of four thirty-second notes, which also equals an eighth note. Together, this first beat is equivalent to a quarter note (1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4).\n    *   **Beat 2:** This beat consists of four sixteenth notes beamed together, which equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 3:** This is another group of four sixteenth notes, also equaling one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 4:** The final group consists of four sixteenth-note chords, which equals one quarter note.\n    *   The total duration in the right hand is also four quarter notes.\n\nSince both the treble and bass clef staves contain notes and rests that add up to the value of four quarter notes, the time signature for this measure is 4/4. This is often called \"common time\" and means there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
