    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 9**.\n\nThis runestone is one of the approximately 26 to 30 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The Sö 9 stone is located in Lifsinge, Södermanland, Sweden.\n\nThe inscription on the stone reads: \"Bergviðr/Barkviðr and Helga, they raised this stone in memory of Ulfr, their son. He met his end with Ingvarr. May God help Ulfr's soul.\" A notable feature of this runestone is the prayer, \"Guð hialpi salu Ulfs\" (\"May God help Ulfr's soul\"), which is arranged around the central cross. The stone was discovered broken into five pieces in 1857 and was mended and re-erected in 1934 near its original location.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
