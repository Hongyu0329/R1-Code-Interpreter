    "This image displays the crystal structure of **Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease**.\n\nTEV protease is an enzyme from the Tobacco Etch Virus that is widely used in biotechnology. It is a type of cysteine protease, meaning it uses a cysteine amino acid in its active site to cut other proteins.\n\nKey features of this protein include:\n*   **Function:** In the virus, it cuts a large polyprotein into smaller, functional viral proteins. In the lab, scientists use it to precisely remove tags from recombinant proteins due to its high sequence specificity.\n*   **Structure:** The overall structure consists of two Î²-barrels, which is similar to the chymotrypsin family of proteases. The image shows the main protease enzyme (in dark blue) complexed with a small peptide product (in light blue) in its binding cleft. This particular representation corresponds to the structure entry 1LVM in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n*   **Active Site:** The catalytic triad, essential for its function, is composed of the amino acids Histidine-46, Aspartic acid-81, and Cysteine-151.\n\n<<<Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease>>>"
