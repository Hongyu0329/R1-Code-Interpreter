    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we must first determine the total VMT for both the \"Baseline\" and \"Proposed\" scenarios. The calculation involves using the share of trips for each distance category, the mode share for cars within each category, and the average trip distance. A crucial step is to convert the mode share of person-trips into vehicle-trips by using the provided average carpool occupancy rates.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Baseline Car VMT\n\nWe calculate a weighted VMT for the baseline scenario by summing the VMT from each distance category. The VMT for each category is found by multiplying the share of total trips, the share of vehicle trips for cars, and the average distance. The share of vehicle trips is calculated by dividing the person-trip mode share by the occupancy (1 for single-occupant cars, 2.8 for carpools).\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) * ( (0.25 / 1) + (0.28 / 2.8) ) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.168\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 * ( (0.38 / 1) + (0.43 / 2.8) ) * 4 ≈ 0.470\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 * ( (0.40 / 1) + (0.45 / 2.8) ) * 7.5 ≈ 0.589\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 * ( (0.42 / 1) + (0.47 / 2.8) ) * 20 ≈ 1.881\n*   **Total Baseline VMT (Weighted):** 0.168 + 0.470 + 0.589 + 1.881 = **3.108**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Proposed Car VMT\n\nWe repeat the calculation for the proposed scenario, using the new mode shares and the increased average carpool occupancy of 3.0.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 * ( (0.01 / 1) + (0.02 / 3.0) ) * 1 ≈ 0.008\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 * ( (0.08 / 1) + (0.19 / 3.0) ) * 4 ≈ 0.126\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 * ( (0.14 / 1) + (0.27 / 3.0) ) * 7.5 = 0.2415\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 * ( (0.16 / 1) + (0.33 / 3.0) ) * 20 = 0.864\n*   **Total Proposed VMT (Weighted):** 0.008 + 0.126 + 0.2415 + 0.864 = **1.2395**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction in VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 3.108 (Baseline) - 1.2395 (Proposed) = 1.8685\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (1.8685 / 3.108) * 100% ≈ **60.1%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
