    "The plant in the image is *Hebe chathamica*, also known as *Veronica chathamica*. This species is endemic to the Chatham Islands, an archipelago located about 800 kilometers east of New Zealand's South Island.\n\nCommonly called the Chatham Island koromiko, this plant is a low-growing, spreading shrub. It typically inhabits coastal areas, growing on cliffs, rock outcrops, and along shorelines. The plant is well-adapted to the harsh coastal environment, tolerating salt spray, wind, and drought.\n\nThe Chatham Islands are known for their unique flora, with a significant number of endemic species. *Hebe chathamica* is one of three endemic *Hebe* species found on these islands. While it is the most common of the three, it is still considered a range-restricted island endemic.\n\n<<<Chatham Islands>>>"
