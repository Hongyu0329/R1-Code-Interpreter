    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and established chemical syntheses, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** (a trioxatriangulenium derivative) to compound **2** involves the replacement of one of the oxygen-bridged rings with a nitrogen-containing ring. Specifically, an `N-NH₂` (N-amino) group is incorporated into the molecular structure. This type of reaction, a nucleophilic substitution on the cationic aromatic core, is characteristic of reactions with hydrazine, which serves as the source for the N-N single bond and the amino group.\n\n**Reagent B: Butyraldehyde (Butanal, CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe reaction from compound **2** to compound **3** involves a significant skeletal rearrangement. The N-amino azatriangulenium core of **2** is transformed into the pentacyclic (five-ring) system of a dimethoxy quinacridinium salt (**3**). This specific transformation is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement that occurs in the presence of an aldehyde. The N-propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) seen on one of the nitrogen atoms in product **3** originates from the aldehyde used. Butyraldehyde (also known as butanal) is the four-carbon aldehyde that provides the necessary propyl group for this transformation. The reaction proceeds through the formation of a hydrazone intermediate, which then undergoes a complex cyclization and rearrangement cascade to form the final quinacridinium product.\n\n<<<**A**: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)\n**B**: Butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)>>>"
