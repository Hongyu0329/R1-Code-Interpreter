    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper. The top left corner of the strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. On a standard ECG grid, this means each small 1 mm square represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.20 seconds.\n\nThe R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves, which are the highest peaks in the QRS complex. To find the longest interval, the entire rhythm strip must be visually inspected for the greatest distance between two sequential R-waves.\n\nUpon examining the full ECG strip, a significant pause is evident in the fourth lead, starting after the timestamp `0:06:08`. This pause represents the longest R-R interval.\n\nTo calculate its duration:\n*   **Identify the R-waves** surrounding the longest pause.\n*   **Measure the distance** between the peaks of these two R-waves by counting the number of large and small squares. The distance measures approximately 8 large squares and 2 small squares.\n*   **Convert this distance to time.**\n    *   8 large squares = 8 x 0.20 seconds = 1.60 seconds.\n    *   2 small squares = 2 x 0.04 seconds = 0.08 seconds.\n    *   Total R-R interval = 1.60 s + 0.08 s = 1.68 seconds.\n\n<<<1.68>>>"
