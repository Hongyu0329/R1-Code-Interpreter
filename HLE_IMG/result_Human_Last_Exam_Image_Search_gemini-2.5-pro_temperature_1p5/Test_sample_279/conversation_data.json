    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to a **G.V. Black Class I** caries classification.\n\nThis classification is used for caries affecting the pits and fissures of the occlusal (biting) surfaces of posterior teeth, like the molar shown. The image displays decay on the top surface of the tooth, originating in the grooves.\n\nFurthermore, since the decay is occurring around an existing filling, it is also known as recurrent or secondary caries. Even with this characteristic, its location on the occlusal surface places it within the Class I category.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
