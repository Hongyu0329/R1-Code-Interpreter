    "The provided search results confirm the proposed reaction pathway.\n\n**Step 1: Photochemical Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\nUnder UV irradiation, hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical valence isomerization (also described as a valence tautomerization) to its \"Dewar\" isomer, which is hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene. This type of reaction, which involves the formation of a single bond between the ends of a conjugated system and a decrease in the number of double bonds by one, is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**. Specifically, it is described as a photochemically allowed 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Photochemical Cycloaddition**\nThe resulting Dewar-hexafluorobenzene is highly strained and can then react with other unsaturated molecules. In the presence of cyclobutene, it undergoes a cycloaddition reaction. The reaction involves the π-system of one of the double bonds of Dewar-hexafluorobenzene and the π-system of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring. This is classified as a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed pericyclic reactions. There is evidence that such photochemical cascade reactions, involving a [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an electrocyclic ring-closing, are utilized in synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nThe two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction**: The valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition**: The reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction.>>>"
