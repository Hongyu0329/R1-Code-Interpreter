    "The tiling in the image displays **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be determined by observing the arrangement of the tiles. The pattern is constructed around central dark blue polygons which are regular heptagons (7-sided figures). If you were to rotate the entire pattern around the center of one of these heptagons by 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees), the tiling would perfectly align with its original position. Each element in the pattern would land on an identical element.\n\nThis type of tiling is aperiodic, meaning it does not have translational symmetry (it doesn't repeat in a simple grid-like pattern). Such tilings, which possess rotational symmetries like 5-fold or 7-fold that are forbidden in periodic crystals, are often referred to as quasicrystalline or aperiodic tilings. The specific tiling shown is an example of a heptagonal tiling that can be constructed using a set of specific rules and shapes to fill the plane. These complex patterns often exhibit self-similarity and are built around centers of high rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
