    "This picture was taken in San Diego.\n\nThe photograph shows the distinctive interior of the San Diego Convention Center. The key architectural feature that identifies the location is the ceiling structure. It consists of a white, triangulated truss system under a glass barrel-vaulted ceiling. This glass is patterned with circular designs, often described as \"donut rings,\" which create the unique shadow patterns visible on the support beams.\n\nThe design is part of the convention center's expansion and is a well-documented feature of the building's pre-function lobby and meeting room corridors. The architecture is noted for its nautical theme, incorporating elements like the iconic \"Sails Pavilion\" and these circular glass details to create a light-filled space with views of the San Diego Bay.\n\n<<<San Diego>>>"
