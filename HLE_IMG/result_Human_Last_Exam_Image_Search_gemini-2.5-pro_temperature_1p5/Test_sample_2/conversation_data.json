    "The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting algorithm. To determine its worst-case time complexity, we can analyze the recurrence relation that describes its behavior.\n\nThe algorithm is defined as:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for an input of size `n`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing or returns, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`:\n    1.  The first recursive call is `sort(a, n - 1)`. This takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    2.  The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the potential `swap` operation take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    3.  The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. In the worst-case scenario, we assume this call is always executed. This adds another `T(n - 1)` to the execution time.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n`= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n`= 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c`\n`= 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe recursion stops when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`. Substituting this back:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe geometric series sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, the expression becomes:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^n`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`. This exponential complexity arises because the algorithm solves two subproblems of size `n-1` at each step in the worst case.\n\n<<<E>>>"
