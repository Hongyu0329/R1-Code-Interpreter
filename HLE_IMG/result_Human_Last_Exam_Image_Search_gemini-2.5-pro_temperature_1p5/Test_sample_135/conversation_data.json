    "The author of this detail of the Altarpiece is from the **Workshop of Andrea Della Robbia**.\n\nThe artwork in question is a glazed terracotta roundel, a signature style of the Della Robbia family workshop in Renaissance Florence. Specifically, this relief is identified as \"The Last Communion of Saint Mary Magdalene\" and is dated to around 1490.\n\nThe inscription at the bottom, \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL,\" is in French, which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This linguistic detail can be explained by the fact that Andrea della Robbia's son, Girolamo, spent a significant portion of his career in France, working for the royal court. This suggests the altarpiece may have been a commission for a French patron or church, a common practice for the highly sought-after Della Robbia workshop. The family was known to export their works, which could be disassembled for easier transport.\n\nThe Della Robbia workshop, founded by Luca della Robbia and continued by his nephew Andrea and Andrea's sons, was renowned for its mastery of glazed terracotta sculpture, a technique that allowed for vibrant, durable colors. Their works, including numerous altarpieces, tabernacles, and decorative roundels, were immensely popular throughout Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\n<<<Workshop of Andrea Della Robbia>>>"
