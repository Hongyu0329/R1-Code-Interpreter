The two major products, A and B, are 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate and its constitutional isomer, 1-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate. These compounds result from the iron-catalyzed 1,2-difunctionalization of styrene where a tert-butoxy group and a benzoate group are added across the double bond.
