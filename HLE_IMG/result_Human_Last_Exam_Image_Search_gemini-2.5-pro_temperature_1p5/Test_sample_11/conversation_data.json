    "This flag, with its horizontal stripes of black, white, and red, belonged to two former countries:\n\n*   **The German Empire (1871-1918):** This was the first country to use this black-white-red tricolor. The colors were a combination of the black and white of Prussia and the red and white of the Hanseatic League cities.\n*   **The Republic of Upper Volta (1960-1984):** Now known as Burkina Faso, this West African nation also used an identical flag. The three colors symbolized the country's three main rivers: the Black Volta, the White Volta, and the Red Volta.\n\nWhile both are technically correct, the flag is most famously associated with the German Empire.\n\nMany people confuse this flag with the current flags of countries like Yemen, Egypt, or Syria, but those flags have the stripes in the reverse order: red, white, and black.\n\n<<<German Empire>>>"
