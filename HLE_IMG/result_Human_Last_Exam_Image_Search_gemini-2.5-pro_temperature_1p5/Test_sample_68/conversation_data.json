    "This coin does not originate from a single French colony but was intended for general circulation in several of them.\n\nThe visible text \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" and the crowned \"L\" monogram are characteristic of coins issued by France for its colonial empire. Specifically, the coin in the image is a 9 Deniers coin, minted during the reign of King Louis XV.\n\nThese coins were authorized by an edict in June 1721 to provide small change throughout France's territories in the New World, which at the time included New France (encompassing areas of modern-day Canada and the United States, including Louisiana) and the French West Indies. They were produced at the mints in Rouen (mint mark \"B\") and La Rochelle (mint mark \"H\") in 1721 and 1722.\n\nHowever, the copper coins were unpopular with the colonists, who preferred silver currency. As a result, most of these coins did not circulate widely and many were eventually shipped back to France. Despite their intended general use, they are often referred to as \"Louisiana Copper\" because they did see some successful circulation in that particular colony.\n\n<<<New France (including Louisiana and Canada) and the French West Indies>>>"
