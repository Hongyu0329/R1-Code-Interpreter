    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like noise. If the interrupting sound is loud enough to effectively mask the gap, the human brain perceives the original tone as being continuous and uninterrupted. This \"filling-in\" of the missing sound is a common perceptual ability that helps us, for instance, understand conversation in a noisy environment.\n\nThe illusion reveals the brain's tendency to maintain perceptual continuity by constructing a complete auditory scene even when information is missing. This is conceptually similar to some visual illusions where the brain fills in missing parts of an object that is partially hidden from view. The process involves several brain regions, including the auditory cortex, which essentially \"repairs\" the interrupted sound based on context.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
