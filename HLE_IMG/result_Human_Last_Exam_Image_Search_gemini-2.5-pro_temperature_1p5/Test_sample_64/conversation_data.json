    "The images depict the process of **hyphal buckling** in a filamentous fungus.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process as seen in the images L, M, and N, which likely represent a time sequence:\n\n*   **Image L:** This shows a normal, relatively straight fungal hypha (a single filament of a fungus). The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that divides the hypha into separate cells.\n*   **Image M:** The hypha has started to deform. A lateral swelling or bulge is forming near the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This is the initial stage of buckling.\n*   **Image N:** The deformation is more pronounced. The bulge has enlarged, causing the hypha to bend or buckle significantly at that point.\n\nThis buckling is a mechanical response that can occur in fungi. It happens when the protrusive force of the growing hyphal tip is met with resistance, exceeding the force of adhesion to the surface. To accommodate the continued growth, the elastic cell wall of the hypha bends or buckles, often at a point of potential mechanical weakness, such as near a septum. This phenomenon is particularly observed when fungi are growing through a restrictive or stiff environment.\n\n<<<The process being depicted in the image is hyphal buckling.>>>"
