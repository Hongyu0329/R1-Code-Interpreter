    "The bryophyte shown in the image belongs to the genus ***Hypnum***.\n\nThis is concluded based on the very characteristic appearance of the plant, which is commonly known as \"plait moss\" or \"braid moss\". The stems have a distinct, finely braided look which is created by the small, overlapping, and curved leaves. A well-known and widespread species within this genus is *Hypnum cupressiforme*, often called cypress-leaved plaitmoss, because the arrangement of its leaves gives the impression of a cypress tree.\n\nThe genus *Hypnum* is part of the family Hypnaceae and contains a large number of species. They typically grow in dense, smooth mats on various surfaces like tree trunks, logs, and rocks. The leaves are concave and often sickle-shaped, a feature that contributes to the overall plaited appearance.\n\n<<<Hypnum>>>"
