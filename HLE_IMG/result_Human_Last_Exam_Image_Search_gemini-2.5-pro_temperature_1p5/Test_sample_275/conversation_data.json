    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify and count the number of distinct splice species. A splice species is a unique messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule resulting from the splicing process. Each unique band in the gel electrophoresis images represents one such species amplified by a specific pair of primers.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the splice species identified from each panel:\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This reaction uses a forward primer in the E1 region and a reverse primer in the E4 region. It reveals two distinct bands (190 bp and 159 bp), indicating the presence of **2 splice species**.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This reaction uses the same forward primer as in B but a different reverse primer in the E5 region. It also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). Since the products are different from those in panel B, these represent another **2 splice species**.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This panel uses a specific forward primer (E1F2) that only works if a splice from nucleotide 929 to 3465 has occurred. The resulting 551 bp band corresponds to the 553 bp band in panel C, confirming the splice site for that species but not identifying a new one.\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This reaction was performed with more cycles (30) for higher sensitivity, detecting transcripts connecting the E1 and L1 regions. It clearly shows four distinct bands (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp). These represent **4 different splice species**.\n*   **Panels F and G (E1-L2 region):**\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** Using the primer specific for the `929^3465` splice junction, this reaction identifies one product of 972 bp, representing **1 splice species**.\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** Using a primer specific for a different splice junction (`929^3506`), this reaction shows two products (1003 bp and 931 bp). These are **2 additional splice species** that must be different from the one in Panel F because they utilize a different initial splice event.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This panel uses a general E1 primer and produces a single band of 1005 bp. This size corresponds to the 1003 bp band in Panel G, suggesting it is detecting one of the species already identified in panel G, not a new one.\n\nBy summing the distinct species identified from the definitive experiments, we get the total count:\n*   2 species from Panel B\n*   2 species from Panel C\n*   4 species from Panel I\n*   3 species from Panels F and G combined (1 from F + 2 from G)\n\nTotal = 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\nThe eleven identified splice species are:\n1.  E1-E4 splice variant 1 (190 bp)\n2.  E1-E4 splice variant 2 (159 bp)\n3.  E1-E5 splice variant 1 (584 bp)\n4.  E1-E5 splice variant 2 (553 bp)\n5.  E1-L2 variant with `929^3465` splice (972 bp)\n6.  E1-L2 variant 1 with `929^3506` splice (1,003 bp)\n7.  E1-L2 variant 2 with `929^3506` splice (931 bp)\n8.  E1-L1 splice variant 1 (450 bp)\n9.  E1-L1 splice variant 2 (419 bp)\n10. E1-L1 splice variant 3 (378 bp)\n11. E1-L1 splice variant 4 (187 bp)\n\n<<<11>>>"
