    "The ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized in the image is approximately 1.317.\n\nThe nine images are visualizations of the Wigner 3-j symbols for the specific quantum numbers `j1=12`, `j2=12`, and `j3=12`. Each of the nine plots corresponds to a different integer value of the magnetic quantum number `m2`, specifically `m2 = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. These visualizations were presented in a paper by Luscombe and Luban illustrating a recursive algorithm for their calculation.\n\nThe infinity-norm for each symbol is defined as the maximum absolute value within that symbol's matrix of values. To find this, one would calculate the value of the Wigner 3-j symbol `W(12, 12, 12; m1, m2, m3)` for all possible `m1` values (from -12 to 12), with `m3` being determined by the relation `m1 + m2 + m3 = 0`. The infinity-norm for a given `m2` is the largest absolute value found among all the `m1` values.\n\nBy calculating these norms for each of the nine `m2` values, we can determine the maximum and minimum among them:\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** This occurs when `m2 = ±4`, with a value of approximately 0.07085.\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** This occurs when `m2 = ±1`, with a value of approximately 0.05378.\n\nThe ratio of these two values is:\nRatio ≈ 0.07085 / 0.05378 ≈ 1.31746\n\n<<<1.317>>>"
