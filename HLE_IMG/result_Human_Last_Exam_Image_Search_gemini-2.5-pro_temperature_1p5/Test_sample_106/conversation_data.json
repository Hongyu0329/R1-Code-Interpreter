    "This reaction shows the acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The reaction proceeds through a series of shifts, known as a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement, which is common for this class of molecules. The final product is a rearranged isomer with a new carbon skeleton and a double bond.\n\nTo determine the substituents at the labeled positions, we can analyze the structure of the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1:** The label points to a methyl group (CH₃) on ring A.\n*   **Position 2:** The label indicates a methyl group (CH₃) at the junction of rings A and B.\n*   **Position 3:** The label points to a dashed bond at the junction of rings A and B, which in skeletal structures represents a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 4:** This label shows a methyl group (CH₃) at the junction of rings B and C.\n*   **Position 5:** The label points to a dashed bond at the junction of rings C and D. In the standard representation of this rearranged skeleton (an oleanane-type), this position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H). The methyl group originally at this carbon in the reactant has migrated to an adjacent position during the complex rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, the substituents are as follows:\n1 = CH₃, 2 = CH₃, 3 = H, 4 = CH₃, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
