    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the $9_{42}$ knot. The Jones polynomial, $p(t)$, for this knot is:\n\n$t^{-4} - 2t^{-3} + 3t^{-2} - 4t^{-1} + 5 - 4t + 3t^2 - 2t^3 + t^4$\n\nThis can be rearranged in decreasing degree order as requested:\n\n$t^4 - 2t^3 + 3t^2 - 4t + 5 - 4t^{-1} + 3t^{-2} - 2t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the $9_{42}$ knot is that its Jones polynomial is the same as that of its mirror image, which is not always the case for knots.\n\n<<<t^4 - 2t^3 + 3t^2 - 4t + 5 - 4t^{-1} + 3t^{-2} - 2t^{-3} + t^{-4}>>>"
