    "The title of the 19th-century painting, of which a fragment is presented, is **\"Burning Windmill at Stege\"**. The artwork was painted in **1856** by the Norwegian artist **Johan Christian Dahl**.\n\nThis oil on canvas painting depicts a dramatic scene with a windmill engulfed in flames under a dark, stormy sky. The town of Stege, which is the largest town on the island of MÃ¸n in southeastern Denmark, can be seen in the background. The original painting is housed in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, Norway.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl (1788-1857) was a prominent painter of the Romantic era, and this particular work is considered a \"brandje,\" a sub-genre of painting depicting fires that was popular in the Dutch Golden Age. Although painted before the Impressionist movement, Dahl's use of color, especially in echoing the red of the flames in the surrounding landscape, is a notable feature of the work.\n\n<<<Burning Windmill at Stege>>>"
