    "To determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is required. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\n**Analysis of Measure 30:**\n*   **Key Signature:** C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   **Left Hand:** Plays G octaves on the strong beats.\n*   **Right Hand:** Plays a broken chord consisting of the notes G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp.\n\nThe collective notes (G, B-natural, D, F-sharp) form a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7). In the context of C minor, the G major chord (G-B♮-D) functions as the dominant chord. The raised third of the chord (B-natural instead of the diatonic B-flat) is characteristic of the dominant in a minor key. The F-sharp is the major seventh of the G chord and acts as a chromatic alteration, creating a brief, colorful sonority before the return to the tonic C minor chord in the following measure.\n\nThe foundational harmony of the measure is the G major triad, which is the dominant of C minor. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is **V**. The F-sharp can be considered a chromatic non-chord tone or part of a momentarily altered dominant chord, but the fundamental function of the measure is that of the dominant.\n\n<<<V>>>"
