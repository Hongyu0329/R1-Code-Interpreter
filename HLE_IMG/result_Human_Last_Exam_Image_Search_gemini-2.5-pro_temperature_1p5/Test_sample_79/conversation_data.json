    "The square structure shown in the image is part of the **Loma Alta archaeological site**, a significant historical landmark in Presidio County, Texas. This site is widely identified by archaeologists as the Native American pueblo of **San Juan Evangelista**, which was visited and named by the Spanish explorer Antonio de Espejo during his expedition in 1582.\n\nThe coordinates place the structure within a historically rich area known as La Junta de los Ríos, where the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos meet. This region is recognized as one of the oldest continuously cultivated areas in the United States, with settlements dating back thousands of years.\n\n**About the Structure and the Site:**\n\n*   **Ancient Pithouse:** The faint square outline visible in the aerial photograph is the remains of a large, semi-subterranean pithouse. The village of San Juan Evangelista was described by Spanish chroniclers as having flat-roofed houses on a high ridge, and archaeological excavations have confirmed the presence of rectangular house structures.\n*   **Cultural History:** The Loma Alta site was occupied during what archaeologists call the La Junta phase (circa A.D. 1200–1450) and the Concepción phase (circa A.D. 1450–1700). It is considered a classic example of the Concepción phase village layout. The inhabitants were part of the Bravo Valley culture, known for their settled, agricultural lifestyle.\n*   **Historical Landmark Status:** The area is part of the La Junta Archeological District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Loma Alta site (also designated 41PS15) is a crucial component of this district, confirming its status as a protected and historically significant landmark. The discovery of its remains was important enough to be noted in the Federal Register in connection with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n\nIn summary, the structure is not just a random ruin but the remnant of a house in a named, historically documented pueblo that is a key part of a protected archaeological district.\n\n<<<The square structure is the remains of a pithouse within the Loma Alta archaeological site (41PS15), identified as the historic pueblo of San Juan Evangelista. It is a significant historic landmark located in the La Junta de los Ríos region of Presidio County, Texas.>>>"
