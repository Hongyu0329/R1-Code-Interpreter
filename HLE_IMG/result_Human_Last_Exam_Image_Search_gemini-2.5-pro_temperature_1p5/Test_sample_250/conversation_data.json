    "I have analyzed the key signature, which points to F minor, and transcribed the initial chord progression as F-, E-7b5, Eb-6, Dbmaj7, G7, C7. I have also noted the starting melody notes. My initial searches for the chord progression did not immediately yield a specific song title, but confirmed these types of progressions are common in jazz. The search results also provided lists of jazz standards in F minor.\n\nMy next step should be to cross-reference the characteristics of the music in the image with the known F minor jazz standards. A more targeted search combining the key, the first few chords, and the starting melodic notes should help pinpoint the exact tune. I also noticed that \"Django\" is listed as a well-known standard in F minor, and the chord progression seems plausible for that tune. I need to verify this.The performed searches strongly indicate that the piece of music is \"Django\" by John Lewis. Multiple sources confirm that \"Django\" is a famous jazz standard, is in the key of F minor, and was composed by John Lewis. The search results also provide sheet music and chord progression information which align with the image provided by the user. Specifically, a search for \"Django by John Lewis Real Book â€“ Melody & Chords\" returns an image of the sheet music that visually matches the user's image. Furthermore, the chord progression listed in some search results (Fm, Db7, C7) is consistent with the chords seen in the provided sheet music. I am confident in providing a final answer.\n\n<<<Title: Django\nComposer: John Lewis>>>"
