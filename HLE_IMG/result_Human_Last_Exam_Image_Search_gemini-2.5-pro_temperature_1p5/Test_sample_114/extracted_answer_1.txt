The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a Münchnone intermediate where the N1 and C4 positions are tethered by the proline ring's carbon chain. This structural constraint prevents the ring-opening/re-closing isomerization pathway to an acylamino ketene, a phenomenon revealed by the isotope scrambling experiment in Reaction 2. Since the Münchnone in Reaction 3 cannot isomerize, only a single, stable intermediate exists. This intermediate then undergoes the inherently regioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (as demonstrated in Reaction 1) to yield a single product, Product B.
