    "To determine the two numbers in the top white squares, we must first understand the clue for that specific entry. In Kakuro puzzles, digits from 1 to 9 are placed in white cells so that they sum up to the clue provided in the adjacent black cell. No digit can be repeated within a single sum.\n\nIn the provided puzzle image, there is a clue of \"17\" with a line pointing to the two top white squares. This signifies that the sum of the numbers in these two squares must be 17.\n\nAccording to the rules of Kakuro, there is only one combination of two unique digits from 1 to 9 that can sum to 17. This combination is 8 and 9. Therefore, the two numbers present in the top white squares must be 8 and 9. The specific order of these two numbers would be determined by solving the rest of the puzzle, but the question only asks for the two numbers themselves.\n\n8,9<<<8,9>>>"
