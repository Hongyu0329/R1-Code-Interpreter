    "The reaction pathway involves three sequential steps to transform the starting material into the final product. Let's analyze each step to determine the final molecular structure and its formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n    The first step uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H₂O). CAN is a common and effective oxidizing agent used for the removal of the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the benzylic carbon of the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam with a trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group and a PMB group on the nitrogen. Its core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one structure. The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₄H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** After deprotection, the PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. The resulting structure is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The change in the molecular formula is: C₁₄H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₉O + H = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation of the Alkene**\n    The second step involves the use of Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction selectively reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. Other functional groups like the amide (lactam) and the trifluoromethyl group are stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** C₇H₆F₃NO\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The hydrogenation of the double bond adds two hydrogen atoms to Intermediate 1. The resulting molecule is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. Its molecular formula becomes C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Hydrolysis of the Lactam**\n    The final step is the treatment of Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. These are typical conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or, in this case, a cyclic amide (lactam). The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond by adding a molecule of water (H₂O). The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH₂) and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). In the acidic conditions of the reaction, the amino group will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH₃⁺).\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** C₇H₈F₃NO\n    *   **Product:** The hydrolysis of the lactam ring (an addition of H₂O) leads to an amino acid. The reaction is: C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O → C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂. The product is an amino-trifluoromethyl-cyclopentane-carboxylic acid.\n\n### Determination of the Final Molecular Formula\n\nBy following the transformation of the molecule through each reaction step, we can determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n*   Start with Intermediate 2: **C₇H₈F₃NO**\n*   Add one molecule of water (H₂O) during hydrolysis:\n    *   Carbons: 7\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   Fluorines: 3\n    *   Nitrogens: 1\n    *   Oxygens: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
