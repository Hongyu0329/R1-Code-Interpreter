    "Based on the artifacts discovered with it, this gold medallion is from the 1st century AD. It was unearthed at the archaeological site of Tillya Tepe in modern-day Afghanistan.\n\nThe medallion was part of the \"Bactrian Gold,\" a hoard of about 20,600 objects found in six burial mounds for one man and five women. The graves contained numerous gold items, including jewelry, coins, and a crown. The dating of the site to the 1st century AD is supported by the presence of several coins, including one of the Roman Emperor Tiberius (minted between 16 and 21 AD), a coin of the Parthian king Mithridates II (c. 123â€“88 BCE), and a coin from the Yuezhi chieftain Sapadbizes (20 BCE - 20 CE).\n\n<<<1st century A.D.>>>"
