    "The search results confirm my initial hypothesis. The buildings in the image are part of the Yeouido skyline in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nSpecifically, the search results identify:\n*   **Parc.1 Tower**: This is the tall skyscraper complex. It consists of two office towers (one 69 stories, the other 53), a hotel, and The Hyundai Seoul department store. A key feature mentioned is the red frame, which isn't obvious in the sunset lighting of the photo but the building's overall shape and location match. It is described as a new landmark that reshaped the Yeouido skyline.\n*   **International Finance Center (IFC) Seoul**: Located next to Parc.1, this complex consists of three office towers and the Conrad Seoul Hotel. The sleek, glass exterior of the IFC buildings is visible in the picture.\n*   **LG Twin Towers**: Also part of the Yeouido skyline, these towers are often pictured alongside Parc.1 and IFC.\n*   The general area is identified as the Yeouido financial district in Seoul. Many search results show images of this specific cluster of buildings at sunset, matching the lighting in the provided photo.\n\nBased on this visual evidence and the detailed descriptions from the search results, the city is definitively Seoul.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
