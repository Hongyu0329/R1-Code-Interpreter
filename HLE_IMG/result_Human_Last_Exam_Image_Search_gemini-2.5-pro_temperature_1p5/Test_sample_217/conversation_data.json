    "The cuneiform sign depicted is known as GA₂ (or ĜA₂) in Sumerian. In its third-millennium BCE form, one of its primary meanings is \"house\" or \"enclosure.\"\n\nThe sign is a logogram, representing a word or idea. The specific Sumerian word it represents in this context is `ŋa₂` (pronounced gna), which translates to \"house\" or \"stall,\" closely related to the concept of home. The pictograph is thought to have originated as a drawing of a building, which evolved into this more abstract, wedge-shaped form typical of cuneiform.\n\nOf the choices provided, \"Home\" is the correct meaning. The signs for other concepts like \"deity\" (typically a star-like symbol, AN or DINGIR) and \"bread\" (NINDA) are visually distinct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
