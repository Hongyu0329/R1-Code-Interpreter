    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each chiral center.\n\nFirst, let's identify the chemical structure from the drawing. The molecule is an acyclic amine. By identifying the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine), we can determine the IUPAC name.\n\n1.  **Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    The structure can be written linearly as:\n    `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(NH2)-CH3`\n    The principal functional group is the amine. To give the amine the lowest possible locant, we number the longest carbon chain from right to left. The longest chain is a pentane chain.\n    *   C1: The rightmost methyl group (not part of the main chain).\n    *   C2: The carbon bonded to the NH2 group.\n    *   C3: The carbon bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   C4: The carbon bonded to the OH group.\n    *   C5: The leftmost methyl group.\n\n    The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxypentan-2-amine**. The molecule has three chiral centers at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Assigning Priorities and Determining Configuration:**\n    We will now assign the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center based on the provided 3D representation. We assume the zigzag carbon backbone lies in the plane of the drawing, with wedged bonds pointing out towards the viewer and dashed bonds pointing away.\n\n    *   **Chiral Center C4:**\n        *   Groups attached: -OH, -CH(Et)R (C3), -CH3 (C5), and -H (implicit).\n        *   Assigning priorities (based on atomic number):\n            1.  -OH (highest priority)\n            2.  -CH(Et)R (C3 group)\n            3.  -CH3 (C5 group)\n            4.  -H (lowest priority, implicit)\n        *   In the drawing, the -OH group is pointing away (dashed). The C4-C3 and C4-C5 bonds are in the plane. Therefore, the implicit -H must be pointing towards the viewer (wedged).\n        *   Viewing the molecule with the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards us, the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 (-OH → C3 → C5) is clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, we reverse the result. Clockwise becomes **S**.\n        *   **The configuration at C4 is (4S).**\n\n    *   **Chiral Center C3:**\n        *   Groups attached: -CH(OH)CH3 (C4), -CH(NH2)CH3 (C2), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H (implicit).\n        *   Assigning priorities:\n            1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (C4 group, as O > N)\n            2.  -CH(NH2)CH3 (C2 group)\n            3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n            4.  -H (lowest priority, implicit)\n        *   In the drawing, the ethyl group is pointing towards the viewer (wedged). The C3-C4 and C3-C2 bonds are in the plane. Therefore, the implicit -H must be pointing away (dashed).\n        *   Viewing the molecule with the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away from us, the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 (C4 → C2 → ethyl) is clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group points away, the configuration is **R**.\n        *   **The configuration at C3 is (3R).**\n\n    *   **Chiral Center C2:**\n        *   Groups attached: -NH2, -CH(Et)R (C3), -CH3, and -H (implicit).\n        *   Assigning priorities:\n            1.  -NH2 (highest priority)\n            2.  -CH(Et)R (C3 group)\n            3.  -CH3\n            4.  -H (lowest priority, implicit)\n        *   In the drawing, the -CH3 group attached to C2 is pointing away (dashed). The bond to -NH2 and C3 are shown in the plane. This implies the implicit -H atom must be pointing towards the viewer (wedged).\n        *   Viewing the molecule with the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards us, the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 (-NH2 → C3 → -CH3) is counter-clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, we reverse the result. Counter-clockwise becomes **R**.\n        *   **The configuration at C2 is (2R).**\n\nCombining the results, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
