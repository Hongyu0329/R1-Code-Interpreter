A cornucopia, also known as the horn of plenty, is a symbol of abundance and nourishment and is typically depicted as a container overflowing with produce and flowers. Although the container in the image is somewhat obscured, the sheer volume and mix of items spilling forth strongly suggest this concept. Art history features many depictions of figures, particularly goddesses associated with harvest and prosperity, holding cornucopias filled with fruit and flowers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
