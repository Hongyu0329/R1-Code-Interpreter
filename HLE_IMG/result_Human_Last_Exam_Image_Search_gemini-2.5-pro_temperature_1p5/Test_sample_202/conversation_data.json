    "Based on visual characteristics and supporting information from the search results, here are the identifications for the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria**\n    This specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of bubble-like cavities). Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and has a vesicular texture. It forms when gas-rich magma erupts and cools quickly, trapping the gas bubbles. Its color and texture are characteristic of scoria, sometimes also referred to as cinder.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia**\n    This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture is known as breccia. When the fragments are volcanic in origin, the rock is called volcanic or pyroclastic breccia. Tuff is a similar rock but is defined as being composed of smaller ash fragments (less than 2.5 inches). Since the fragments in specimen I are quite large, volcanic breccia is the more fitting identification.\n\n*   **J: Pumice**\n    This specimen is light-colored and has a frothy, vesicular appearance. Pumice is a lightweight volcanic rock known for its high porosity. Unlike the darker scoria, pumice is typically white, grey, or tan and forms from felsic magmas (rich in silica). The light color and fine, vesicular texture are defining features of pumice.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite**\n    This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals of different colors (light and dark minerals). This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic. When an igneous rock consists of exceptionally large crystals, often larger than 1 cm, it is classified as a pegmatite. Pegmatites are most often similar in composition to granite, consisting of minerals like quartz and feldspar, but are distinguished by their significantly larger crystal size. The very large crystals visible in specimen K are characteristic of a pegmatite.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
