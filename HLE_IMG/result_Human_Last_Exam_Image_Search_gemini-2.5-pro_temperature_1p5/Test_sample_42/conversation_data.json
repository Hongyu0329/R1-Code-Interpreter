    "This icon depicts Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nThe image is a fresco from the Sopoćani Monastery in Serbia, which dates back to the second half of the 13th century. This particular fresco of an unknown holy stylite is located on the north wall of the nave. A \"stylite\" is a type of ascetic saint who lived on a pillar (stylos in Greek) and spent their days in prayer and fasting.\n\nThe inscription visible in the upper right part of the fresco, though partially faded, identifies the saint as Simeon (Симеон Столпник in Cyrillic). Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder, the most famous of the pillar saints, lived for 37 years on a pillar in Syria and was known for performing miracles.\n\n<<<F>>>"
