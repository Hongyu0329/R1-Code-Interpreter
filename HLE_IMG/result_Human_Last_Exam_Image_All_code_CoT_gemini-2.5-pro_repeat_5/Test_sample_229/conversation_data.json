    "This is a challenging piece of sheet music to identify because it appears to be a specific jazz arrangement or a contrafact (a new melody written over existing chords) of a known song. Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Musical Elements**:\n    *   **Style**: The notation, including the syncopated eighth-note lines, arpeggiated figures, and chord symbols (like C, E7, F, G7), is characteristic of the Bebop or Swing jazz idioms. The tempo marking at the top, though partially cut off, appears to be a medium-up tempo (around 128 BPM), which is also typical for this style. Bebop originated in the United States.\n    *   **Key and Melody**: The key signature is C major. The melody in the first two full measures is very distinctive.\n        *   Measure 1: G-E-G-E (The 5th and 3rd of a C major chord).\n        *   Measure 2: C-E-G-B♭ (An arpeggio of a C7 chord).\n    *   **Harmony**: The chord progression is also telling. It starts on C major, then moves to E7, then F. This movement through secondary dominants is common in jazz.\n\n2.  **Identify the Song**:\n    *   The opening melodic phrase is the strongest clue. This specific pattern is the iconic opening of the Brazilian Samba/Bossa Nova song **\"O Pato\"** (which means \"The Duck\"), composed by Jayme Silva and Neuza Teixeira.\n    *   Let's verify by comparing it to the original song. \"O Pato\" is usually played in the key of G major.\n        *   In G major, the melody starts: D-B-D-B (5th and 3rd of G).\n        *   The sheet music is in C major, and the melody starts: G-E-G-E (5th and 3rd of C). The pattern is identical.\n        *   In G major, the second measure of \"O Pato\" is over a G7 chord, with the melody outlining that chord: G-B-D-F♮.\n        *   The sheet music's second measure has the melody C-E-G-B♭, which perfectly outlines the C7 chord. The pattern again is identical (Root-3rd-5th-♭7th).\n    *   While the melody and chords in this sheet music diverge from the original \"O Pato\" after the first couple of bars, this is typical of a jazz arrangement. The arranger has taken the original theme and created a new bebop-style line based on it.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   **Title**: The song is \"O Pato\".\n    *   **Musical Style**: The original song is a Samba/Bossa Nova, but this specific sheet music is a **Bebop/Swing** arrangement of it.\n    *   **Country of Origin**: The song originated in **Brazil**.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the song based on analysis of the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"O Pato (The Duck)\"\n    musical_style = \"Bebop / Swing (arrangement of a Brazilian Samba/Bossa Nova)\"\n    country_of_origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: O Pato (The Duck), Musical Style: Bebop / Swing, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
