# The user wants to identify reagents A and B in the provided reaction scheme.

# Step 1: Identify Reagent A
# The transformation from compound 1 to compound 2 involves the replacement
# of an oxygen atom in a heterocyclic ring with an N-NH2 group. This is a
# classic reaction for converting pyrylium-like salts into N-aminopyridinium
# salts. The reagent used for this transformation is hydrazine.
reagent_A_name = "Hydrazine"
reagent_A_formula = "N2H4"

# Step 2: Identify Reagent B
# The transformation from compound 2 to compound 3 involves the conversion
# of an N-amino group (>N-NH2) to an N-propyl group (>N-CH2CH2CH3).
# We need a reagent that provides the three-carbon propyl group.
# Propanal (an aldehyde) is a plausible choice as it reacts with N-amino groups
# to form hydrazones, which could be an intermediate towards the final product.
# Among simple reagents, propanal is the most likely candidate to initiate
# this transformation.
reagent_B_name = "Propanal"
reagent_B_formula = "CH3CH2CHO"

# Print the final answer
print(f"Reagent A: {reagent_A_name} ({reagent_A_formula})")
print(f"Reagent B: {reagent_B_name} ({reagent_B_formula})")

# Restore original stdout
sys.stdout = original_stdout
# Get the captured output

# Final print to the user
