    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step (1 -> 2) to determine reagent A.**\n    *   I will carefully examine the structural change between compound 1 and compound 2.\n    *   Compound 1 is a polycyclic aromatic cation containing oxygen atoms in heterocyclic rings (a pyrylium or xanthenylium-type structure).\n    *   Compound 2 is a similar polycyclic cation, but one of the oxygen atoms has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is part of an N-amino group (>N-NH2).\n    *   The conversion of a pyrylium-type salt to an N-aminopyridinium-type salt is a standard reaction in heterocyclic chemistry that uses hydrazine (H2N-NH2) as the reagent. This makes hydrazine the most likely candidate for reagent A.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step (2 -> 3) to determine reagent B.**\n    *   I will examine the structural change between compound 2 and compound 3.\n    *   The transformation involves converting the N-amino group (>N-NH2) in compound 2 into an N-propyl group (>N-CH2CH2CH3) in compound 3.\n    *   This is an unusual transformation. A chemically robust method would involve a two-step sequence (deamination followed by alkylation), but the problem asks for a single reagent 'B'.\n    *   I will consider common reagents that contain a three-carbon chain. Propanal (CH3CH2CHO) is a prime candidate because aldehydes are known to react with hydrazine derivatives to form hydrazones.\n    *   The formation of the hydrazone is a plausible initial step. The subsequent conversion to the final N-propyl product, while mechanistically complex, likely follows from this initial reaction. Therefore, propanal is the most reasonable single reagent for B.\n\n3.  **Construct the final response.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, I will conclude that reagent A is Hydrazine and reagent B is Propanal.\n    *   I will then write a Python script to print out these answers clearly, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# The user wants to identify reagents A and B in the provided reaction scheme.\n\n# Step 1: Identify Reagent A\n# The transformation from compound 1 to compound 2 involves the replacement\n# of an oxygen atom in a heterocyclic ring with an N-NH2 group.

The reagent used for this transformation is hydrazine.\nreagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\nreagent_A_formula = \"N2H4\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify Reagent B\n# The transformation from compound 2 to compound 3 involves the conversion\n# of an N-amino group (>N-NH2) to an N-propyl group (>N-CH2CH2CH3).\n# We need a reagent that provides the three-carbon propyl group.\n# Propanal (an aldehyde) is a plausible choice as it reacts with N-amino groups\n# to form hydrazones, which could be an intermediate towards the final product.\n# Among simple reagents, propanal is the most likely candidate to initiate\n# this transformation.\nreagent_B_name = \"Propanal\"\nreagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CHO\"\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"Reagent A: {reagent_A_name} ({reagent_A_formula})\")\nprint(f\"Reagent B: {reagent_B_name} ({reagent_B_formula})\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Final print to the user\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<\nReagent A: Hydrazine (N2H4)\nReagent B: Propanal (CH3CH2CHO)\n>>>"
