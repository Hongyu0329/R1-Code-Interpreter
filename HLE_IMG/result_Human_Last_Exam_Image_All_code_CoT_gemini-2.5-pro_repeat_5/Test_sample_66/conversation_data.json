    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry:** The image displays a large circular sector with a radius `R`. Within this sector, there are two shaded regions, one blue and one red. The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the blue and red regions. Since they only meet at a point, their overlapping area is zero.\n2.  **Determine Key Parameters:**\n    *   The radius of the circular sector is given as `R = 34`.\n    *   A line segment of length `17` is shown. This segment is drawn from a point on the arc perpendicular to a radius. Let's call this length `d = 17`.\n3.  **Find the Angle `theta`:** A right-angled triangle is formed by the center of the circle (O), a point on the arc (P), and a point on another radius (Q), such that PQ is perpendicular to OQ. The hypotenuse is the radius `OP = R = 34`, and the leg opposite to the angle `theta` is `PQ = d = 17`.\n    *   Using trigonometry, we have `sin(theta) = opposite / hypotenuse = d / R = 17 / 34 = 0.5`.\n    *   Therefore, the angle `theta` is `arcsin(0.5) = 30` degrees.\n4.  **Decompose the Shaded Area:** The entire shaded figure is symmetrical and can be divided into four identical sub-regions. Each sub-region corresponds to a sector with an angle of `theta`. The blue region consists of two such sub-regions, and the red region consists of the other two.\n5.  **Use the Quadrature Principle:** In geometry problems of this type, a common clever trick is that the area of a complex-looking region (like one of the four shaded sub-regions) is equal to the area of a much simpler shape. Here, we'll assume the problem is designed such that the area of each shaded sub-region (a \"lune\" bounded by the circular arc and straight lines) is equal to the area of the simple triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the sub-region's arc.\n6.  **Calculate the Area of the Elementary Triangle:** The area of one of these elementary triangles (e.g., the one corresponding to the leftmost `theta`) can be calculated using the formula `Area = 0.5 * a * b * sin(C)`.\n    *   The sides are the radii `R=34`, and the angle between them is `theta`.\n    *   `Area_triangle = 0.5 * R * R * sin(theta)`.\n    *   Since we know `sin(theta) = d/R = 17/34`, the area is `0.5 * 34 * 34 * (17/34) = 0.5 * 34 * 17 = 17 * 17 = 289`.\n7.  **Calculate the Total Area:** The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the four identical sub-regions. Based on our assumption in step 5, this is four times the area of one elementary triangle.\n    *   `Total_Area = 4 * Area_triangle = 4 * 289`.\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Compute the final value. `4 * 289 = 1156`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the image.\nR = 34  # Radius of the circular sector\nd = 17  # Length of the perpendicular line segment\n\n# Step 2: The angle theta can be found using sin(theta) = d / R.\n# We don't need the angle itself, just its sine.\nsin_theta = d / R\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area of one elementary triangle formed by two radii and the angle theta.\n# The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * a * b * sin(C).\n# Here, a = R, b = R, and C = theta.\n# Area_triangle = 0.5 * R * R * sin_theta\n# This simplifies to 0.5 * R * R * (d / R) = 0.5 * R * d\narea_of_one_triangle = 0.5 * R * d\n\n# Step 4: The total shaded region is composed of four such identical regions.\n# Based on the principle of quadrature often used in such geometry puzzles,\n# the area of each shaded \"lune\" is equal to the area of its corresponding triangle.\n# Therefore, the total shaded area is 4 times the area of one elementary triangle.\nnumber_of_regions = 4\ntotal_area = number_of_regions * area_of_one_triangle\n\n# Print the breakdown of the final calculation\nprint(\"The area of one of the four elementary triangles is (1/2) * radius * perpendicular_distance.\")\nprint(f\"Area of one triangle = 0.5 * {R} * {d} = {area_of_one_triangle}\")\nprint(\"The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the four symmetric regions.\")\nprint(f\"Total Shaded Area = {number_of_regions} * {int(area_of_one_triangle)} = {int(total_area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<1156>>>"
