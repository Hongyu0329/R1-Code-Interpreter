    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the task:\n1.  First, I will identify the knot shown in the image by its number of crossings and overall structure. It is a 9-crossing knot. By comparing it with standard knot diagrams, I can identify it as the **9_42 knot**, sometimes called the Celtic button knot.\n2.  Next, I will find the standard Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot. I will consult reliable mathematical sources and databases (like Knot Atlas or computational algebra systems) to obtain the correct polynomial. The Jones polynomial, denoted as $p(t)$, for the 9_42 knot is $t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically constructs this polynomial string from its coefficients and exponents. The script will format the output in decreasing degree order, as requested, and handle the specific formatting for coefficients and powers (e.g., omitting coefficients of 1 and the exponent for power 1). This script will then print the final formatted polynomial.\n\n```python\ndef format_jones_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the formatted Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4.\n    # We represent this as a list of (coefficient, power) tuples in decreasing order of power.\n    poly_terms = [\n        (1, 2),\n        (-1, 1),\n        (1, 0),\n        (-1, -1),\n        (1, -2),\n        (-1, -3),\n        (1, -4)\n    ]\n\n    result_parts = []\n    is_first_term = True\n\n    for coeff, power in poly_terms:\n        # Build the string for the current term\n        term_str = \"\"\n\n        # Determine the sign\n        if is_first_term:\n            if coeff < 0:\n                term_str += \"-\"\n        else:\n            if coeff > 0:\n                term_str += \" + \"\n            else:\n                term_str += \" - \"\n        \n        # Determine the coefficient string\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        if power == 0:\n            term_str += str(abs_coeff)\n        elif abs_coeff != 1:\n            term_str += str(abs_coeff)\n\n        # Determine the variable part (t)\n        if power != 0:\n            if term_str and term_str[-1].isdigit() and not term_str.endswith(\" \"):\n                 # Add multiplication sign if needed, but the requested format omits it.\n                 # Example: 3t^2, not 3*t^2\n                 pass\n            \n            if power == 1:\n                term_str += \"t\"\n            else:\n                term_str += f\"t^{power}\"\n\n        result_parts.append(term_str)\n        is_first_term = False\n\n    print(\"\".join(result_parts))\n\nformat_jones_polynomial()\n```\n<<<$t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$>>>"
