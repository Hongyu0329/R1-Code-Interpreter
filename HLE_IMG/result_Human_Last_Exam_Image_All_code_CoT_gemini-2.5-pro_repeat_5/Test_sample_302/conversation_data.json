    "I will identify the Chinese characters on the seal. The script on the seal is an ancient form called Seal Script (篆書). Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, right to left. However, four-character seals are often read in a Z-pattern, starting from the top right, moving to the top left, then bottom left, and finally bottom right.\n\n1.  **Top Right Character:** This is the seal script for 壽 (shòu), which means \"longevity\".\n2.  **Top Left Character:** This is the character 不 (bù), meaning \"no\" or \"not\".\n3.  **Bottom Left Character:** This character is 聽 (tīng), which means \"to listen\" or \"to heed\". It's composed of radicals for \"ear\", \"king\", and \"heart\".\n4.  **Bottom Right Character:** This character is 慮 (lǜ), meaning \"to worry\" or \"to be anxious\".\n\nReading them in the Z-pattern (top-right -> top-left -> bottom-left -> bottom-right), we get the phrase 壽不聽慮 (shòu bù tīng lǜ). This can be interpreted as a philosophical saying: \"For a long life, do not listen to worries.\"\n\nNow, I will convert these traditional characters to their simplified Chinese equivalents and display them using a Python script.\n\n*   壽 -> 寿\n*   不 -> 不 (same)\n*   聽 -> 听\n*   慮 -> 虑\n\nThe simplified Chinese characters are 寿, 不, 听, 虑.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Ensure the output is encoded in UTF-8 to correctly display Chinese characters.\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\n# The simplified Chinese characters identified from the seal.\n# The phrase is 寿不听虑 (shòu bù tīng lǜ), which means \"For a long life, do not listen to worries.\"\nchar1 = \"寿\"\nchar2 = \"不\"\nchar3 = \"听\"\nchar4 = \"虑\"\n\n# Print the characters.\nprint(f\"The simplified Chinese characters on the seal are: {char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\")\n```\n<<<寿不听虑>>>"
