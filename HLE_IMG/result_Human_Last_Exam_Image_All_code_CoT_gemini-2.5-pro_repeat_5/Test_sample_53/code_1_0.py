  This function identifies the figure in the provided image of a Greek vase.

  # Step 1: Analyze the scene depicted on the vase.
  # The vase shows a complex mythological scene involving a chariot, a fallen man,
  # and divine elements (the large wing).
  # The style is Apulian red-figure, dating to around 380-370 BC.
  # The vase is known as the name-vase of the Talos Painter.
  scene_description = {
      "Fallen Figure": "A naked man lying on the ground, seemingly dead.",
      "Chariot Figures": "Two figures in a chariot, one driving.",
      "Supernatural Element": "A large white wing, indicating divine presence."
  }

  # Step 2: Identify the myth.
  # This specific composition is a famous depiction of the death of Talos.
  # Talos was a giant bronze automaton who guarded Crete.
  # He was defeated by the Argonauts, specifically by the magic of Medea,
  # who removed a pin from his ankle, causing him to lose his vital fluid (ichor) and die.
  myth = "The Death of Talos from the myth of Jason and the Argonauts."

  # Step 3: Identify the figures.
  # The figures in the chariot are Argonauts, identified as the Dioskouroi (Castor and Pollux), escaping after the deed.
  # The figure on the ground is the defeated giant.
  figures = {
      "In Chariot": "The Dioskouroi (Castor and Pollux)",
      "Fallen Figure": "Talos"
  }

  # Step 4: Answer the specific question.
  # The question asks "Who is the figure leaving the chariot?".
  # While the Dioskouroi are departing *with* the chariot, the most dramatic act of
  # "leaving" is performed by Talos, who has been vanquished and is left behind,
  # his body positioned as if having just fallen.
  # Therefore, the figure leaving (or having just left) the chariot is Talos.
