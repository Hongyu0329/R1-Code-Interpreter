    This function identifies the matching bird image.

    By analyzing the feather patterns, specifically the scalloping on the back and
    the white edging on the wings, we can find the identical individual.

    1.  The target bird has a distinct scalloped pattern on its back.
    2.  The white edges of its wing feathers create a clear striped pattern.
    3.  Comparing these features to all options, image C shows an identical pattern,
        pose, and lighting. The specific arrangement of the feathers on the back
        is a direct match.
