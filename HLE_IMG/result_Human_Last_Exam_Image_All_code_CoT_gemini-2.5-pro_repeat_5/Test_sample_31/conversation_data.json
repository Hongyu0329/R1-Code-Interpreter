    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the given knot.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The provided image is a diagram of the **6₂ knot**. This can be confirmed by comparing its structure to a standard knot table, such as the Rolfsen table. It is an alternating knot with 6 crossings.\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** For any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen s-invariant is directly related to its knot signature, σ(K). The formula is:\n    `s(K) = -σ(K)`\n3.  **Find the Signature:** The signature of the 6₂ knot, σ(6₂), is a well-established value in knot theory. Its value is **-4**.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** Using the formula from step 2 and the signature from step 3, we can calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Write a Python script to present these steps and compute the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\n    knot_name = \"6_2\"\n    is_alternating = True\n    \n    print(f\"The knot shown in the image is the '{knot_name}' knot.\")\n    print(f\"This knot is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: State the formula for the Rasmussen s-invariant for alternating knots.\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = -σ(K)\")\n    print(\"where σ(K) is the signature of the knot.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Provide the known signature of the 6_2 knot.\n    signature_6_2 = -4\n    print(f\"The signature of the {knot_name} knot is a known value:\")\n    print(f\"σ({knot_name}) = {signature_6_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant using the formula.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -signature_6_2\n    \n    print(\"Plugging the values into the formula:\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed out\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({signature_6_2})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(f\"Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
