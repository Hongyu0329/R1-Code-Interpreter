    # Step 2: Deduce the radius of the white circle (R)
    # The condition (d-b)^2 = 2k+1, where R = 0.5k, must hold.
    # 2k+1 must be a perfect square.
    # Trying the smallest integer k > 0 that satisfies this for an odd square:
    # If 2k+1 = 9 (3^2), then 2k=8, k=4.
    # This gives R = 0.5 * k = 0.5 * 4 = 2.0 cm.

    # Step 3: Determine the packing structure
    # For two tangent white circles, the distance between centers is 2*R = 4 cm.
    # In 0.5cm grid units, this is 8 units.
    # The separation (A, B) must satisfy A^2 + B^2 = 8^2 = 64.
    # The only integer solutions are (0, 8) and (8, 0).
    # This means the circles are in a rectangular grid.
    # The vertical or horizontal distance between centers of tangent white circles is 4.0 cm.

    # Step 4: Verify consistency with yellow circle placement
    # A yellow circle can fit between two vertically stacked white circles.
    # Horizontal distance from white center to yellow center: |x_y - x_w|
    # |x_y - x_w|^2 + R_white^2 = (R_white + r_yellow)^2
    # |x_y - x_w|^2 = (2.0 + 0.5)^2 - 2.0^2 = 2.5^2 - 4 = 6.25 - 4 = 2.25
    # |x_y - x_w| = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5 cm. This is a multiple of 0.5, so it's consistent.
    print("Model is geometrically consistent with all constraints.")

    # Step 5: Calculate the coordinates of the target circle's center
    # The target is the right-most white circle. The image shows it's in the middle row.
    # Assume origin (0,0) is the bottom-left of the bounding box.
    
    # Y-coordinate:
    # Bottom row center y1 = R_white = 2.0
    # Middle row center y2 = y1 + grid_spacing = 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0
    y_center = R_white + grid_spacing
    
    # X-coordinate:
    # The image shows 4 columns of circles in the middle row.
    # Left-most column center x1 = R_white = 2.0
    # The columns are at x = R, 3R, 5R, 7R.
    # The 4th column center x4 = 7 * R_white = 7 * 2.0 = 14.0
