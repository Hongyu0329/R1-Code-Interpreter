    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will first examine the provided image of the musical score.\n2.  I will identify key clues from the score, such as the instrumentation (the list of instruments on the left), the language of the performance directions, and any unique musical markings.\n3.  The instrumentation includes a large orchestra with woodwinds (\"gr. Fl.\", \"Hob.\", \"engl. Horn\"), and a large string section (\"Viol.\", \"Br.\", \"Celli\").\n4.  The language is German. I can see terms like \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten), \"Br.\" (Bratsche, for viola), \"(die übrigen)\" (the others), \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute), and most importantly, \"1 (Vorhang)\", which means \"1 (Curtain)\". This confirms the music accompanies the curtain rising on a new scene.\n5.  The musical style is lush, complex, and atmospheric, which is characteristic of the late-Romantic period, particularly the works of German composers like Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n6.  By combining these clues—a large orchestra, German language, the specific marking \"Vorhang\" for Act II, and the shimmering, magical quality of the music—I can identify the opera. This passage is famously the prelude to Act II of Richard Wagner's final opera.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print this conclusion and the name of the opera.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the opera from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the sheet music reveals several key clues:\")\n    \n    clue1 = \"The language is German (e.g., 'Vorhang' for 'Curtain', 'Br.' for 'Viola').\"\n    clue2 = \"The orchestration is for a large, late-Romantic orchestra.\"\n    clue3 = \"The marking '1 (Vorhang)' at the start of Act II indicates the curtain is rising.\"\n    clue4 = \"The atmospheric and shimmering musical texture is highly distinctive.\"\n    \n    print(f\"- Clue 1: {clue1}\")\n    print(f\"- Clue 2: {clue2}\")\n    print(f\"- Clue 3: {clue3}\")\n    print(f\"- Clue 4: {clue4}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThese clues strongly point to the work of Richard Wagner.\")\n    \n    opera_name = \"Parsifal\"\n    act_number = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The music is the prelude to Act {act_number} of the opera '{opera_name}', depicting Klingsor's magic garden.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_music_puzzle()\n    print(\"\\n<<<Parsifal>>>\")\n```"
