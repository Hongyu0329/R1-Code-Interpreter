    "This chess puzzle presents a tricky situation. First, it's important to note that the starting position shown in the image is technically illegal because the black king on e4 is already in check by the white bishop on g2. In a real game, it couldn't be white's turn to move.\n\nHowever, assuming this is an oversight in the composition of the puzzle, we can proceed to find the forced mate in two moves. The key is a checking move that creates unstoppable threats regardless of how black responds.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **White's first move is `1. Nc5+`**. The knight from e7 moves to c5, putting the black king in check. This is a forcing move that limits black's options.\n\n2.  Black has two primary legal ways to get out of check:\n    *   **Scenario A: Black plays `1. ... Kd4`**. The king moves from e4 to d4. White responds with **`2. Qc2#`**, which is checkmate. The queen on c2 attacks the king, and all escape squares are covered by the queen, the knight on c5, the pawn on b4, or the bishop on g1.\n    *   **Scenario B: Black plays `1. ... Kxf3`**. The king captures the white rook on f3. White delivers the final blow with **`2. Rh3#`**. The rook from h5 moves to h3, checkmating the king. The king's escape squares are all controlled by the white king, the rook, the knight on c5, and the two bishops.\n\nThe following Python code will print this solution for you.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_two():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the solution to the provided chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- White to Move and Checkmate in 2 ---\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: The initial position is illegal as the Black King on e4 is in check.
