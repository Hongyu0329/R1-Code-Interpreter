    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** Visually inspect the raster plot to identify the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are the dense vertical bands of activity.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** For each identified burst, estimate the center time from the x-axis.\n    *   Burst 1: ~3 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~12 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~18 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~27 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~37 s\n    *   Burst 6: ~48 s\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** Calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of bursts.\n    *   IBI 1: 12 s - 3 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI 2: 18 s - 12 s = 6 s\n    *   IBI 3: 27 s - 18 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI 4: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 5: 48 s - 37 s = 11 s\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** Sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Average = (9 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 11) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9.0 s\n5.  **Format the Output:** Present the result rounded to two significant figures. The value 9.0 already has two significant figures.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the results clearly, including the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from the provided graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the timestamps of the synchronized bursts (in seconds)\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 12, 18, 27, 37, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals\n    # np.diff calculates the difference between consecutive elements in an array\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Step 5 & 6: Format the output and print the full calculation\n    # Create the equation string\n    intervals_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    num_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Format the average to two significant figures\n    # The format specifier '.1f' works for this specific result (9.0)\n    # A more general approach would be needed for other numbers, but this is sufficient here.\n    average_ibi_formatted = f\"{average_ibi:.1f}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculation of the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"({intervals_str}) / {num_intervals} = {average_ibi_formatted} s\")\n    \n    # Print the final numerical answer separately for clarity\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {average_ibi_formatted} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<9.0>>>"
