    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the time scale:** The ECG is recorded at a standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid is made of 1 mm small squares. Therefore, each small horizontal square represents 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** I will visually inspect all the rhythm strips to find the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complexes). There are several significant pauses in the lower strips.\n3.  **Measure the interval:** The longest pause occurs in the fourth strip, between the 4th and 5th QRS complex. I will count the number of small horizontal squares between the peaks of these two R-waves.\n    *   The 4th R-wave peak is exactly on a heavy vertical grid line.\n    *   The 5th R-wave peak is 22 large squares plus 1 small square to the right.\n    *   Since each large square contains 5 small squares, the total number of small squares is (22 * 5) + 1 = 111.\n4.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of one small square.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval in seconds from an ECG strip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the constants from the ECG.\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n    # One small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n    seconds_per_small_square = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # Step 2: Measure the longest R-R interval in small squares from the image.\n    # The longest interval is observed in the fourth strip.\n    # It spans 22 large squares and 1 additional small square.\n    # Each large square is 5 small squares.\n    large_squares = 22\n    small_squares_per_large_square = 5\n    additional_small_squares = 1\n    total_small_squares = (large_squares * small_squares_per_large_square) + additional_small_squares\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the interval in seconds.\n    longest_rr_interval_seconds = total_small_squares * seconds_per_small_square\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(\"To find the longest R-R interval:\")\n    print(f\"1.
