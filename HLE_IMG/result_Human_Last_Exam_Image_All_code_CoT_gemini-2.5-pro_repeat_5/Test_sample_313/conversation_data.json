    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will identify the people and the event in the image. The image features what appears to be a sports award ceremony. The recipient strongly resembles hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The 2019 NHL Awards, where Kucherov was a major winner, took place on June 19, 2019. The date in the prompt is likely off by one day, but the visual evidence is strong.\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This is a classic riddle clue pointing to the historical use of mercury in the felting process for making hats. This led to the phrase \"mad as a hatter\". The clue points to the word \"Hatter\".\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:** At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov won three major awards (Hart Trophy, Art Ross Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award). In hockey, scoring three goals is a \"hat trick\". Winning three major awards is a metaphorical \"hat trick\".\n4.  **Solve the Riddle:** The riddle is a pun. The person pictured (Kucherov) is a metaphorical \"Hatter\" because he achieved a \"hat trick\" of awards. The clue refers to a literal \"Hatter\", the profession that made hats using mercury. Therefore, the answer \"X Y\" is \"Hatter\".\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will create a Python script that outlines this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by analyzing its two main parts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Analyze the clue about mercury salts.\n    # \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    # Mercury salts were historically used in felting, the process of making felt hats.\n    # Workers, known as \"hatters\", often suffered from mercury poisoning.\n    # This clue strongly points to X Y being \"Hatter\".\n    clue_2_answer = \"Hatter\"\n\n    # Part 2: Analyze the image and date clue.\n    # \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    # The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    # At this event, he won 3 major awards (Hart, Art Ross, Ted Lindsay).\n    # In sports, achieving three of something is called a \"hat trick\".\n\n    # Part 3: Connect the clues.\n    # The person who achieves a \"hat trick\" can be metaphorically called a \"Hatter\".\n    # The riddle connects the metaphorical \"Hatter\" (pictured) with the\n    # literal \"Hatter\" (from the mercury clue).\n    \n    final_answer = clue_2_answer\n    print(f\"The clue about mercury salts points to the profession of a 'Hatter'.\")\n    print(f\"The image from June 2019 (or a day earlier) shows a 'hat trick' of awards being won.\")\n    print(f\"The common term that links both clues is 'Hatter'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe solution is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hatter>>>"
