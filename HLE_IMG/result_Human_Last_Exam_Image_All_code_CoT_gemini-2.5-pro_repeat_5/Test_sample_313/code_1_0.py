    This script solves the riddle by analyzing its two main parts.

    # Part 1: Analyze the clue about mercury salts.
    # "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts."
    # Mercury salts were historically used in felting, the process of making felt hats.
    # Workers, known as "hatters", often suffered from mercury poisoning.
    # This clue strongly points to X Y being "Hatter".
    clue_2_answer = "Hatter"

    # Part 2: Analyze the image and date clue.
    # "X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019."
    # The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.
    # At this event, he won 3 major awards (Hart, Art Ross, Ted Lindsay).
    # In sports, achieving three of something is called a "hat trick".

    # Part 3: Connect the clues.
    # The person who achieves a "hat trick" can be metaphorically called a "Hatter".
    # The riddle connects the metaphorical "Hatter" (pictured) with the
    # literal "Hatter" (from the mercury clue).
