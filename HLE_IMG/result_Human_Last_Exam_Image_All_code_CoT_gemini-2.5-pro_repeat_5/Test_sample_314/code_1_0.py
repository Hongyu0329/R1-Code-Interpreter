    This function determines the order of simulation indices based on the analysis of their band structures.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The hopping parameter 't' scales the overall bandwidth. Plot 2 has the smallest bandwidth, so it has the minimum 't'.
        - Condition 1 (min t) -> Simulation 2
    2.  The sign of the overlap 's' determines the asymmetry. Plots 1, 2, 3 have a deep valence band (s<0), while Plot 4 has a tall conduction band (s>0). Thus, Plot 4 has a unique sign.
        - Condition 3 (unique sign(s)) -> Simulation 4
    3.  The magnitude '|s|' determines the degree of asymmetry. Plot 1 has extremely strong asymmetry, indicating the largest '|s|'. To avoid a conflict where Plot 4 satisfies two conditions (unique sign and max value), "maximum s" is interpreted as having the maximum magnitude |s|.
        - Condition 4 (max s) -> Simulation 1
    4.  By elimination, the remaining condition, minimum '|s|', must correspond to the remaining plot.
        - Condition 2 (min |s|) -> Simulation 3

    The final answer is the sequence of indices ordered by the conditions (1, 2, 3, 4).
