def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function holds the solution to the vortex trajectory puzzle.

    The analysis for each plot is as follows:
    1: Green is central and acts as a pivot. -> G (Green, twice)
    2: Blue is central and acts as a pivot. -> B (Blue, twice)
    3: Red and Blue form a chaotic pair; Green is pushed to the periphery. -> g (Green, half)
    4: Red is central and acts as a pivot. -> R (Red, twice)
    5: Blue has the tightest inner loop, acting as a pivot. -> B (Blue, twice)
    6: Red is central and acts as a pivot. -> R (Red, twice)
    7: Blue and Green form a chaotic pair; Red is pushed around. -> r (Red, half)
    8: Green is central and acts as a pivot. -> G (Green, twice)
    9: Red and Blue move in large arcs; Green is dragged along a small path. -> g (Green, half)
    10: Blue has a tight central spiral, acting as a pivot. -> B (Blue, twice)
    11: Red and Green form a chaotic pair; Blue is pushed to the periphery. -> b (Blue, half)
    12: Red is central and acts as a pivot. -> R (Red, twice)
    13: Red and Green move in large arcs; Blue is dragged along a small path. -> b (Blue, half)
    14: Green and Blue move in large arcs; Red is dragged along a small path. -> r (Red, half)
    15: Blue and Green form a chaotic pair; Red is pushed around. -> r (Red, half)
    16: Blue has the tightest inner spiral, acting as a pivot. -> B (Blue, twice)
