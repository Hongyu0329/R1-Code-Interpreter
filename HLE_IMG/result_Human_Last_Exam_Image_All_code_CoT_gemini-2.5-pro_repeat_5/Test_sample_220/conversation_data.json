    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will determine the theoretical two-dimensional (2D) projection of a three-dimensional (3D) Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. This is a standard problem in crystallography.\n2.  The resulting 2D pattern for an FCC [110] projection is known to be a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the projected atoms form a repeating rectangular unit cell with atoms at the corners and a single atom in the center of the rectangle.\n3.  Next, I will analyze each of the four images (A, B, C, and D) to see which one matches this expected centered rectangular pattern.\n4.  I will systematically eliminate the incorrect options by identifying their corresponding crystal structures or viewing directions.\n    *   Image C shows a face-centered square, which is the classic FCC [100] view.\n    *   Image D shows a simple rectangular grid, which is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice.\n    *   Image A shows a pattern that is not a simple centered rectangle; it is actually characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along [110].\n    *   Image B shows a repeating pattern of centered parallelograms (a parallelogram is a 2D projection of a rectangle viewed from an angle), which perfectly matches the expected pattern for FCC [110].\n5.  Based on this analysis, I will conclude that Image B is the correct answer and write a Python script to print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_fcc_110_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided images and identifies the one corresponding\n    to an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction by explaining the\n    expected crystallographic pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the theoretical pattern for an FCC [110] projection.\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face.\")\n    print(\"When this 3D structure is projected along the [110] direction onto a 2D plane, the atoms form a specific repeating pattern.\")\n    print(\"The resulting pattern is a 'centered rectangular lattice'.
