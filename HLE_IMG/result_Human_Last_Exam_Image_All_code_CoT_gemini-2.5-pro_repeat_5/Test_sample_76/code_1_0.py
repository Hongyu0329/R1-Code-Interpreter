    This function calculates the four theoretically possible positions for the
    two carboxylic acid groups on the cubane product resulting from the
    double Favorskii rearrangement.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The first rearrangement involves carbons 2 and 6. The resulting
       carboxylic acid can be attached to either C2 or C6.
    2. The second rearrangement involves carbons 7 and 8. The resulting
       carboxylic acid can be attached to either C7 or C8.
    3. We generate all possible combinations of one position from the first
       rearrangement and one from the second.
