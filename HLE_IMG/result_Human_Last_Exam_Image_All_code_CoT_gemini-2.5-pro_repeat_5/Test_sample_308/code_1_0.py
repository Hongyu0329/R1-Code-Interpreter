def solve_roller_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the roller drive matching puzzle.

    The reasoning for the pairings is as follows:
    1.  The number of oscillations in the displacement plot generally corresponds to the number of lobes on the driving roller.
    2.  The "character" of the plot (smoothness, amplitude of variation) must match the geometry of the rollers (rounded vs. sharp features).
    3.  Some configurations exhibit more complex behavior where the number of oscillations might be related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lobe counts or other interactions.
    4.  The final mapping is derived by matching the clearest cases first, then using these secondary rules and process of elimination.

    - Plot A (2 osc, low min speed) -> Config 3 (D2, concave driven): A=3
    - Plot B (3 osc, smooth) -> Config 2 (D6, d3, smooth): B=2 (Special case, likely N_osc = GCD(6,3)=3)
    - Plot C (4 osc, aggressive) -> Config 4 (D4, pointy driven): C=4
    - Plot D (2 osc, aggressive) -> Config 1 (D6, d2, pointy): D=1 (Special case, likely N_osc = GCD(6,2)=2)
    - Plot E (3 osc, aggressive) -> Config 8 (D3, pointy driven): E=8
    - Plot F (6 osc, very smooth) -> Config 5 (D6, d4, smooth): F=5
    - Plot G (4 osc, smooth) -> Config 6 (D4, d2-oval, smooth): G=6
    - Plot H (5 osc, oddball) -> Config 7 (D4, d3): H=7 (By elimination)
