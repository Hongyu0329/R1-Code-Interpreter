    # Step 1: Analyze the polygons in the image.
    # The image contains three polygons that are identical in shape and size.
    # Therefore, we only need to determine the Heesch number for one, and the
    # result will be the same for all three.

    # Step 2: Determine the geometric properties of the polygon.
    # The polygon is a dodecagon (12-sided figure) whose vertices lie on the
    # vertices of an underlying triangular grid.
    # By inspecting its features, we can see that the polygon is centrally symmetric.
    # A shape is centrally symmetric if it remains unchanged after a 180-degree rotation
    # about its center. For this polygon:
    # - The upward-pointing peak at the top becomes the downward-pointing indentation at the bottom.
    # - The outward-pointing feature on the upper-left side becomes the outward-pointing
    #   feature on the lower-right side.
    # - The inward-pointing notch on the upper-right side becomes the inward-pointing
    #   notch on the lower-left side.
    # This confirms the polygon has central symmetry.

    # Step 3: Apply tiling theory.
    # A fundamental theorem in geometry states that any centrally symmetric polygon
    # is capable of tiling the plane. Such a tiling can be formed by arranging the
    # polygon with 180-degree rotated copies of itself, where the protrusions of one
    # tile fit perfectly into the corresponding indentations of its neighbor.

    # Step 4: Define the Heesch number.
    # The problem statement specifies that if a polygon tiles the plane, its
    # Heesch number is considered to be infinity.

    # Step 5: Conclude the Heesch number for each polygon.
    # Since the polygon is centrally symmetric, it tiles the plane.
    # Therefore, its Heesch number is infinity. As all three polygons are
    # identical, this applies to each of them.
    
    # In Python, we can represent infinity using math.inf or the unicode character.
    # For display purposes, the symbol '∞' is most appropriate.
    heesch_number_1 = "∞"
    heesch_number_2 = "∞"
    heesch_number_3 = "∞"

    # The problem asks for the answers to be separated by commas.
    print(f"{heesch_number_1}, {heesch_number_2}, {heesch_number_3}")
