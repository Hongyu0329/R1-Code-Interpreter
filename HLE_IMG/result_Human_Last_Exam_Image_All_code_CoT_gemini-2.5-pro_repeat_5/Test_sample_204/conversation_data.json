    "To solve this, I will first identify each mineral specimen based on its visual characteristics (crystal habit, color, luster, cleavage/fracture). Then, I will determine the silicate structural class for each identified mineral. Finally, I will order the specimens from the simplest silicate structure (isolated tetrahedra) to the most complex (framework silicates).\n\n1.  **Identify Specimens and their Silicate Structures:**\n    *   **Specimen C:** This is a granular mass of green crystals. This is characteristic of **Olivine**, which is a **Nesosilicate** (isolated SiO₄ tetrahedra). This is the simplest structure.\n    *   **Specimen A:** This is a dark, stubby prismatic crystal. This habit is typical of **Pyroxene** (e.g., Augite), which is an **Inosilicate** (single chain of SiO₃ tetrahedra). This structure is more complex than isolated tetrahedra.\n    *   **Specimen B:** This specimen is flaky and shows one perfect direction of cleavage, resulting in thin sheets. This is characteristic of a **Mica** or **Chlorite**, which are **Phyllosilicates** (sheets of Si₂O₅ tetrahedra). This structure, formed by linking chains, is more complex than single chains.\n    *   **Specimen D:** This is a transparent, glassy crystal with no visible cleavage planes and evidence of conchoidal fracture. This is a classic example of **Quartz**, which is a **Tectosilicate** (a 3D framework of SiO₂). This is the most complex silicate structure.\n\n2.  **Order by Increasing Complexity:**\n    *   1st (Simplest): **C** (Olivine - Nesosilicate)\n    *   2nd: **A** (Pyroxene - Inosilicate)\n    *   3rd: **B** (Mica/Chlorite - Phyllosilicate)\n    *   4th (Most Complex): **D** (Quartz - Tectosilicate)\n\nThe final order of increasing silicate structure complexity is C, A, B, D.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this process and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens, classifies their silicate structures,\n    and orders them by increasing structural complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the specimens with their identified mineral and silicate structure class.\n    specimens = {\n        'A': {'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)'},\n        'B': {'mineral': 'Mica/Chlorite', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)'},\n        'C': {'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)'},\n        'D': {'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)'}\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the order of silicate structures from simplest to most complex.\n    complexity_order = [\n        'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)',\n        'Inosilicate (Single Chain)',\n        'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)',\n        'Tectosilicate (Framework)'\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the specimens based on the complexity of their silicate structure.\n    # The key for sorting is the index of the structure type in the complexity_order list.\n    sorted_specimen_keys = sorted(\n        specimens.keys(),\n        key=lambda k: complexity_order.index(specimens[k]['structure'])\n    )\n\n    # Step 4: Print the identification and the final ordered result.\n    print(\"Identifying and ordering specimens by increasing silicate structure complexity:\\n\")\n    for key in sorted_specimen_keys:\n        mineral_info = specimens[key]\n        print(f\"Specimen {key}: {mineral_info['mineral']} is a {mineral_info['structure']}.\")\n\n    final_order_str = ', '.join(sorted_specimen_keys)\n    print(f\"\\nThe final order from simplest to most complex structure is: {final_order_str}\")\n\nsolve_mineral_complexity()\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>\n```"
