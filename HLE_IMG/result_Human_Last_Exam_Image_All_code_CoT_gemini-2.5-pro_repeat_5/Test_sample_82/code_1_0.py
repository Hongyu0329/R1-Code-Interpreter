# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves several steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C-Br bond at C9.
# 2. Carbopalladation: The C9 atom attacks the C5 of the alkene,
#    forming a new C5-C9 bond. The Pd atom becomes attached to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to C4 is eliminated.
#    The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. C5 has no hydrogens to eliminate.
#    Therefore, a hydrogen from C3 is eliminated.
# 4. This elimination creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.
