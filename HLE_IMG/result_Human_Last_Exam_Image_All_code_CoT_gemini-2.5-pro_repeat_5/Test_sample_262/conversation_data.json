    "The stability and, consequently, the operational lifetime of iridium(III) complexes used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) are highly dependent on the strength of the bonds between the iridium metal center and its ligands. The question asks which of the four depicted complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure:** All four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes of the type `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`. They share the same ancillary diimine ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The difference lies in the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Ligand Variations:**\n    *   **Complex 2** has unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligands. This complex serves as a benchmark.\n    *   **Complex 1, 3, and 4** have fluorinated 2-phenylpyridine ligands. Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom and acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n\n3.  **Relate Ligand Electronics to Bond Strength:** The electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms pull electron density away from the phenyl ring. This reduces the electron density on the carbon atom that forms the cyclometalating bond with the iridium center (the Ir-C bond). A lower electron density on this carbon atom weakens the Ir-C bond.\n\n4.  **Relate Bond Strength to Lifetime:** A weaker Ir-C bond makes the complex less stable. Under the electrical and thermal stress of LEC operation, a weaker bond is more likely to break, leading to the decomposition of the emitter and a shorter device lifetime. Therefore, the fluorinated complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes than the non-fluorinated Complex 2.\n\n5.  **Consider the Position of the Fluorine Substituent:** The position of the fluorine atom has a significant impact.\n    *   **Complex 4** has fluorine at the 4'-position (*para* to the Ir-C bond). This position effectively withdraws electron density, weakening the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 3** has fluorine at the 2'-position (*ortho* to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 1** has fluorines at both the 2'- and 4'-positions.\n\n    Studies on this class of complexes have consistently shown that fluorination at the 2'-(*ortho*) position is particularly detrimental to the complex's stability and device lifetime. This is because, in addition to weakening the Ir-C bond, the substituent's proximity to the metal center can introduce steric strain or facilitate specific degradation pathways.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The complexes containing a fluorine atom at the 2'-position are the most susceptible to degradation.\n    *   **Complex 1** has a 2'-fluoro substituent.\n    *   **Complex 3** has a 2'-fluoro substituent.\n\n    Therefore, Complex 1 and Complex 3 are expected to show the shortest lifetimes among the four.\n\nThe following Python code identifies the complexes with this destabilizing feature.\n\n```python\ndef find_short_lifetime_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies iridium complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes based on ligand substitution.\n\n    The stability of these Ir(III) complexes in LECs is largely dictated by the strength of the\n    cyclometalating Ir-C bond. Electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorine, on the phenyl\n    ring weaken this bond, leading to faster degradation and shorter device lifetimes.\n\n    The position of the fluorine is critical. Fluorination at the 2'-position (ortho to the\n    Ir-C bond) is known to be particularly destabilizing.\n\n    This program will identify which of the four complexes contain this 2'-fluoro feature.\n    \"\"\"\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'name': 'Complex 1', 'substituents': ['2-F', '4-F']},\n        2: {'name': 'Complex 2', 'substituents': []},\n        3: {'name': 'Complex 3', 'substituents': ['2-F']},\n        4: {'name': 'Complex 4', 'substituents': ['4-F']}\n    }\n\n    short_lifetime_complex_ids = []\n    print(\"Analysis of Complexes for Lifetime Stability:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(\"Key Destabilizing Feature: Fluorine at the 2'-position (ortho-position).\\n\")\n\n    for i, data in complexes.items():\n        if '2-F' in data['substituents']:\n            short_lifetime_complex_ids.append(i)\n            print(f\"- {data['name']} [ID: {i}]: Contains a 2'-fluoro substituent.
