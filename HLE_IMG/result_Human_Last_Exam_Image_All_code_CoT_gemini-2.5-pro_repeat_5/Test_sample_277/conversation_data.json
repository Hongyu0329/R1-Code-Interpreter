    "An analysis of the user's request reveals that the provided image is black and does not contain any molecules to compare. Without the chemical structures, it is impossible to determine their relationship (e.g., molecular formula, connectivity, spatial arrangement). Therefore, we cannot classify them as identical, constitutional isomers, or stereoisomers. The most logical conclusion is that none of the given options can be confirmed as correct.\n\nThe following Python script outlines this reasoning process.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_molecules():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function analyzes the relationship between molecules based on provided data.\n  In this case, no data is provided.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Representing the molecules from the image.\n  # Since the image is black and shows nothing, we represent them as None.\n  molecule_1 = None\n  molecule_2 = None\n  \n  print(\"Analysis Steps:\")\n  print(\"1. The input image is observed to be empty/black. No molecular structures are visible.\")\n  \n  if molecule_1 is None or molecule_2 is None:\n    print(\"2. Because no molecules are provided, their properties (like molecular formula, atom connectivity, and 3D arrangement) cannot be compared.\")\n    print(\"3. As a result, it is impossible to determine if they are identical, constitutional isomers, or stereoisomers.\")\n    print(\"4. Given the options, we cannot select (a), (b), (c), or (d) with any certainty.\")\n    print(\"5. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is (e), as none of the specific relationships can be established from the given information.\")\n    \n  # The final answer is determined by the logic above.\n  final_answer_option = \"(e)\"\n  final_answer_text = \"None of these\"\n  \n  print(f\"\\nFinal Conclusion: The relationship cannot be determined.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
