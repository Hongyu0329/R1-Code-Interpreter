    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the authors of the nine artworks:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The main goal is to identify the artist for each of the 9 artworks presented in a 3x3 grid. The order of identification must be from left to right, then top to bottom. The final output should be a Python script that prints this list.\n\n2.  **Analyze Image 1 (Top-Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** Four cartoonish fish, one with a human face, around a fishhook. The style is modern, whimsical, and uses ink outlines with color washes.\n    *   **Identification:** This style is highly characteristic of the contemporary Chinese artist **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, who is famous for his modern interpretations of traditional subjects, especially animals. A quick reverse image search confirms this attribution.\n\n3.  **Analyze Image 2 (Top-Center):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A classic Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums by a rock. There's a red artist's seal in the top right.\n    *   **Identification:** The subject (flowers), the bold brushwork, and the overall composition are hallmarks of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese painters. The seal also corresponds to those he used. This is a classic Qi Baishi piece.\n\n4.  **Analyze Image 3 (Top-Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A realistic portrait of an elderly woman wearing a pink headscarf and red vest. The style is academic realism (oil on canvas).\n    *   **Identification:** This is a very famous painting in modern Chinese art history. It's titled \"Yi Nationality Old Man\" (彝族老人) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a pivotal figure in Chinese oil painting and realism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Image 4 (Middle-Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** Chinese calligraphy in a fluid, connected, and dynamic cursive script (草书).\n    *   **Identification:** This style is recognizable as that of **Mi Fu (米芾)**, one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Song Dynasty. This specific piece is a well-known excerpt from his masterpiece, the \"Shu Su Tie\" (蜀素帖).\n\n6.  **Analyze Image 5 (Middle-Center):**\n    *   **Visuals:** An abstract painting featuring a large red circle above an orange half-circle, with a black and white landscape-like element in between.\n    *   **Identification:** The fusion of abstract forms with elements reminiscent of traditional Chinese landscape and cosmology (sun/moon) points to modern artists exploring new ink painting styles. This work is by **Irene Chou (周綠雲)**, a key figure in Hong Kong's New Ink Painting movement.\n\n7.  **Analyze Image 6 (Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** Chinese calligraphy in a more structured, elegant, and slender Regular Script (楷书). The OCR text provided relates to this piece, mentioning historical figures and steles.\n    *   **Identification:** The script's style—graceful yet strong—is the signature of **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)**, a master calligrapher of the early Tang Dynasty. The text likely comes from a rubbing of a famous stele he inscribed, such as the \"Preface to the Sacred Teachings of the Wild Goose Pagoda.\"\n\n8.  **Analyze Image 7 (Bottom-Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** Highly energetic and wild cursive calligraphy (狂草). The characters are barely distinguishable and flow into one another with immense speed and power.\n    *   **Identification:** This explosive style is the trademark of the Tang Dynasty monk **Huaisu (怀素)**, the undisputed master of \"wild cursive.\" This is an excerpt from his \"Autobiography\" (自叙帖).\n\n9.  **Analyze Image 8 (Bottom-Center):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A realistic oil portrait of a young woman with a thoughtful expression, set against a dark, leafy background.\n    *   **Identification:** This is another iconic work of Chinese contemporary realism. The painting is \"Northern Girl\" (北方姑娘) by **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, a leading member of the Chinese Neoclassical school.\n\n10. **Analyze Image 9 (Bottom-Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A portrait of a woman in ornate, exotic clothing and headdress. The style combines fine-line drawing (*gongbi*) with watercolor washes, creating a decorative and detailed effect.\n    *   **Identification:** This style is associated with the contemporary artist **Jiang Guofang (姜国芳)**, who is famous for his \"Forbidden City\" series, which often depicts court ladies and figures in elaborate historical costumes.\n\n11. **Synthesize and Format:** I have now identified all nine artists. I will create a Python script to present the list clearly, as requested, mapping each position to its author.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the author of each of the 9 artworks,\n    ordered from left to right, top to bottom.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"1.
