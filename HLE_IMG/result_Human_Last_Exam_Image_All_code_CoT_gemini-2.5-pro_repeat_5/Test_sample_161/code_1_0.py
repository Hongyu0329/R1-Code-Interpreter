  This function determines and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.
  
  The synthesis involves two steps:
  1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.
  2. Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis. The alpha-haloketone reacts with an unknown reactant to form 
     tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.

  By comparing the atoms in the alpha-haloketone and the final imidazole product, we can deduce the 
  structure of the missing reactant. The core N-C(NH2)-N fragment points to a guanidine derivative.
  The presence of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the N1 position of the final product indicates
  that the reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine.
