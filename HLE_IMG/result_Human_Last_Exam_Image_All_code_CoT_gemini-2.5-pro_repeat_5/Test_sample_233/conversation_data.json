    "My plan to identify the runestone is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Runic Inscription**: I will examine the runes carved on the stone fragment. The most important clue is the name \"Ingvar\" mentioned in the prompt. I will look for the runic spelling of this name.\n2.  **Identify Key Sequences**: I will transliterate the runes in the image to Latin characters. The bottom row clearly shows the sequence `... ᛅᛏ : ᛁᚴᚢᛅᚱ ...`, which reads `... at : ikuar ...` (\"... in memory of Ingvar\"). This confirms it is one of the Ingvar runestones.\n3.  **Use Contextual Clues**: I will transliterate the lines above the \"Ingvar\" sequence to get more text for a precise match. The line directly above reads `... ᚠᛅᚦᚢᚱ : ᛋᛁᚾ ...`, which is `... faþur : sin ...` (\"... his father\").\n4.  **Match with Database**: I will use the distinctive grid-like carving style and the identified text fragment `... faþur : sin : ... at : ikuar ...` to search through catalogs of Swedish runestones.\n5.  **Confirm the ID**: This process leads to the identification of the stone as **Sö 279**, located in Strängnäs Cathedral. The \"Sö\" stands for the province of Södermanland, and 279 is its catalog number.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this identified ID.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image.\n    \n    The identification is based on several key features:\n    1. The inscription contains the runes for \"... at : ikuar ...\" (... in memory of Ingvar).\n    2. The inscription contains the runes for \"... faþur : sin ...\" (... his father) on the line above.\n    3. The stone has a unique grid-like pattern for its inscription bands.\n    \n    These features uniquely identify the runestone as Sö 279 from Strängnäs Cathedral.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    runestone_number = 279\n    \n    print(f\"The runestone is from the province of Södermanland, abbreviated as '{province_code}'.\")\n    print(f\"Its catalog number is {runestone_number}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the full ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {province_code} {runestone_number}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 279>>>"
