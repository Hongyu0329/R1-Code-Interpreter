# Step 1: Calculate the total local power generation from the diagram
p_ga = 2 * 180  # MW
p_gb = 2 * 180  # MW
p_gc = 2 * 180  # MW
p_gd = 3 * 15   # MW
p_ge = 3 * 15   # MW
p_gf = 3 * 15   # MW

p_local_total = p_ga + p_gb + p_gc + p_gd + p_ge + p_gf
print(f"Total local power generation (P_local): ({p_ga} + {p_gb} + {p_gc} + {p_gd} + {p_ge} + {p_gf}) = {p_local_total} MW")

# Step 2: Define loss percentages based on the problem description and Option D
# Base resistive loss percentage
loss_resistive_rate = 0.02  # 2%
# Power factor related loss, taken from the 3% variation figure
loss_pf_rate = 0.03  # 3%
# Harmonic resonance impact from Option D
harmonic_increase_rate = 0.085  # 8.5%

print(f"Power factor related loss rate: {loss_pf_rate*100}%")
print(f"Harmonic resonance loss increase: {harmonic_increase_rate*100}%")

# Step 3: Calculate total system power based on the model
# The model assumes the harmonic increase applies to the resistive part of the loss.
# Total Loss Rate = (Resistive Loss * (1 + Harmonic Increase)) + Power Factor Loss
total_loss_rate = loss_resistive_rate * (1 + harmonic_increase_rate) + loss_pf_rate

# Calculate total losses in MW
total_losses_mw = p_local_total * total_loss_rate

# Calculate total system power
# Assuming "Total real power supplied by the external network" refers to the total system power requirement
# P_total = P_local + P_losses
total_power = p_local_total + total_losses_mw

print(f"Total loss rate = ({loss_resistive_rate} * (1 + {harmonic_increase_rate})) + {loss_pf_rate} = {total_loss_rate:.4f} or {total_loss_rate*100:.2f}%")
print(f"Total losses = {p_local_total} MW * {total_loss_rate:.4f} = {total_losses_mw:.2f} MW")
print(f"Calculated Total Power = P_local + Total Losses")
print(f"Calculated Total Power = {p_local_total} MW + {total_losses_mw:.2f} MW = {total_power:.2f} MW")
