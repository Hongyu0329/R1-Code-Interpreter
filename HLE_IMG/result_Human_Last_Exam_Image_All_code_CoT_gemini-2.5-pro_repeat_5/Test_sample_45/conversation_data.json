    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the largest number of times the pattern can be rotated around a central point within a full 360-degree turn and still look identical. This number is called the 'order' of the rotational symmetry.\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**: We can look for points in the pattern around which the surrounding shapes are arranged symmetrically. The centers of the dark blue regular hexagons are excellent candidates.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Symmetry around a Hexagon**:\n    *   A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry. This means if you rotate it by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around its center, it looks the same.\n    *   Now, let's examine the shapes surrounding one of these blue hexagons. It is surrounded by a ring of six identical light-yellow pentagons.\n    *   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60 degrees around the center of the blue hexagon, the hexagon maps onto itself, and each of the six surrounding pentagons moves into the position of the next one.\n    *   Observing the pattern further out, we can see that this 60-degree rotation maps the entire tiling onto itself perfectly.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Since the tiling maps onto itself after a rotation of 60 degrees, it has 6-fold rotational symmetry. While there are other points of symmetry (like 4-fold symmetry at the center of the squares), the question of \"the\" rotational symmetry typically refers to the highest order present in the pattern. The highest order is 6.\n\nThe following Python code explains and calculates this.\n\n```python\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The order of rotational symmetry 'n' is the number of times a pattern\n    # maps onto itself during a full 360-degree rotation.\n    # The angle of rotation is 360 / n.\n\n    # By observing the tiling, we can identify a center of rotation at the\n    # center of each dark blue hexagon.\n    # A regular hexagon has 6 sides.\n    num_sides_hexagon = 6\n\n    # The pattern around the hexagon repeats 6 times.\n    # Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry is 6.\n    order_of_symmetry = num_sides_hexagon\n\n    # The smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged can be calculated.\n    angle_of_rotation = 360 / order_of_symmetry\n\n    print(\"The tiling has points of 6-fold rotational symmetry at the center of each blue hexagon.\")\n    print(f\"This is because rotating the entire pattern by 360 / {order_of_symmetry} = {angle_of_rotation} degrees maps the tiling onto itself.\")\n    print(f\"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is therefore {order_of_symmetry}.\")\n\nsolve_symmetry()\n<<<6>>>\n```"
