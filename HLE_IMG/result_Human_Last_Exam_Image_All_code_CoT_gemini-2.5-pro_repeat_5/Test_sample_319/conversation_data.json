    "This image illustrates the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n1.  **Initial State (Left):** The image starts with a single pure tone, represented by the single horizontal line in the top spectrogram and the regular sine wave in the bottom waveform.\n2.  **Interruption (Middle):** A brief, different sound (like a burst of noise or another tone) is introduced. This is shown by the vertical blur in the spectrogram and the complex, irregular part of the waveform. Crucially, the original tone is physically stopped during this interruption.\n3.  **Post-Interruption (Right):** After the interruption, two distinct tones are present, shown by the two separate horizontal lines in the spectrogram and the more complex, superimposed waveform.\n\nThe **illusion** occurs when a person listens to this sequence. Instead of hearing the first tone stop and then be replaced by two new tones, the brain perceives the original tone as *continuing uninterrupted* through the noise burst. The interrupting sound is perceived as a separate event that momentarily masks the continuous tone. This demonstrates the brain's powerful ability to \"fill in the gaps\" and maintain perceptual continuity based on context and expectation, a process similar to how we perceive phonemes in speech even if they are obscured by noise (phonemic restoration).\n\nThis is analogous to the Necker Cube's ambiguity because there are two possible interpretations of the sensory data (a tone that stops and restarts vs. a continuous tone masked by noise), but the brain strongly prefers one interpretation over the other.\n\nSince no calculation is needed, I cannot provide a code block.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
