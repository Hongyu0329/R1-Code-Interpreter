    1.  The description explicitly mentions a "lost small deity of the past," which points directly to the theme of the "fading of religious beliefs."
    2.  The visual style—a ghostly, translucent figure, a faded and aged photographic effect—and the poem's line "Velvet fades" both strongly convey the idea of impermanence and the "transient, passing nature of existence."
    
    Therefore, the two key themes are the transient nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs. This corresponds to option B.
