    Analyzes the visual and textual elements of the collage to identify the influential theorist.
    
    1.  **Artistic Style:** The image is a collage, a technique favored by Dadaists and Surrealists.
    2.  **Content Analysis:**
        -   **Hybrid Figure:** A human body with an animal head is a classic surrealist trope, creating a dream-like or uncanny effect.
        -   **Juxtaposition:** Disparate elements are combined (a luxury hotel postcard in a wild landscape, fragmented text, mythological references like "Persephone"). This is a hallmark of Surrealism.
        -   **Psychological Themes:** The overall effect is one of a dream, exploring themes of identity, the subconscious, and irrationality.
    3.  **Theoretical Connection:** The Surrealist movement was explicitly and heavily influenced by the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, particularly his work on dreams, the unconscious mind, and the uncanny. The techniques used in the collage are direct visual translations of Freudian concepts.
