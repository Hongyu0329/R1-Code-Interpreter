    print("- The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead in a very rigid structure.")
    print("- This geometry forces the amide group to be non-planar, which completely prevents stabilizing amide resonance.")
    print("- This loss of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic and the molecule highly reactive.")
    print("- Conclusion: Molecule C is the MOST reactive.")

    print("\nMolecule A (a beta-lactam):")
    print("- Contains a four-membered ring (Î²-lactam), which is under immense angle strain.")
    print("- Reactions that open the ring release this strain, providing a large driving force.")
    print("- This high ring strain makes the molecule very reactive.")
    print("- Conclusion: Molecule A is MORE reactive than B but LESS reactive than C.")

    print("\nMolecule B (a pyrrolizidinone):")
    print("- The nitrogen is also at a bridgehead, leading to a non-planar amide and disrupted resonance.")
    print("- However, the ring system (two fused 5-membered rings) is more flexible than in C, so the resonance disruption is less severe.")
    print("- The ring strain is also much lower than in the four-membered ring of A.")
