Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The large white, fuzzy ball is an oak gall, which formed after an insect (likely a gall wasp) laid its egg on the twig. The gall serves as a protective nursery for the developing larva. Therefore, the egg was laid inside the gall structure itself. Additionally, a separate cluster of insect eggs is visible on the underside of one of the leaves.
