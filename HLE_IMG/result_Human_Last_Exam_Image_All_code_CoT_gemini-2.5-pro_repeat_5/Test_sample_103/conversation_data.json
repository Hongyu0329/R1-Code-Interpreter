    "This is a complex chess position where White has a strong attack. Let's break down the best move step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position**: White's knight on f7 is extremely powerful, putting immense pressure on the Black king on g8 and the rook on f8. However, Black's queen on h4 poses a significant counter-threat to White's king. White must act decisively to convert their advantage.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves**: We need to find a move that is both forceful and deals with Black's threats.\n    *   **Nh6+ (I)** is a very strong move. If Black plays `...gxh6`, White plays `Qxh4`, winning the queen and the game. If Black plays `...Kh8`, the game gets more complex, but White is still winning.\n    *   **Qxe4 (C)** is another powerful move. It eliminates Black's active bishop, attacks the Black queen, and opens up lines for White's queen.\n\n3.  **Find the Forcing Mate**: While both moves are good, one of them leads to a forced checkmate. Let's analyze the `Qxe4` line in detail, as it contains a brilliant and decisive idea.\n\nThe Python code below will print the step-by-step analysis of the winning sequence after `Qxe4`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and prints the best move sequence for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The best move for White is Qxe4, which leads to a forced checkmate.\")\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the winning line:\\n\")\n    \n    # The final equation is the sequence of moves leading to a win.\n    print(\"Winning Sequence:\")\n    \n    # Move 1\n    print(\"1.
