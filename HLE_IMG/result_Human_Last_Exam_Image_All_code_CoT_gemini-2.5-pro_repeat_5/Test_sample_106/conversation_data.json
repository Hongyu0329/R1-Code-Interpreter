    "This problem describes the acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a triterpenoid, specifically β-amyrin. The reaction proceeds through a series of [1,2] shifts, a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement, to form a more stable alkene, olean-12-ene.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the final substituents:\n1.  **Protonation and Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group is protonated by the acid catalyst (HCl) and leaves as a water molecule, creating an initial carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement:** A cascade of [1,2] shifts of neighboring hydride (H⁻) and methyl (CH₃⁻) groups occurs to move the positive charge across the carbon skeleton, seeking a more stable position. The sequence of shifts for this specific rearrangement is well-established:\n    *   The methyl group at C-10 migrates to C-5.\n    *   A hydride from C-9 migrates to C-10.\n    *   The methyl group at C-8 migrates to C-9.\n    *   The methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8.\n    *   A hydride from C-13 migrates to C-14.\n3.  **Final Carbocation:** This cascade results in the positive charge being located at C-13.\n4.  **Elimination:** A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-12, forming a stable trisubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13.\n5.  **Identify Final Substituents:** By tracking the movement of each group, we can determine what substituent (H or CH₃) ends up at each numbered position on the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (original C-10):** The original methyl group moves away, and a hydride from C-9 moves in. Thus, **1 = H**.\n*   **Position 2 (original C-9):** The original hydride moves away, and a methyl group from C-8 moves in. Thus, **2 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 3 (original C-8):** The original methyl group moves away, and a methyl group from C-14 moves in. Thus, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (original C-14):** The original methyl group moves away, and a hydride from C-13 moves in. Thus, **4 = H**.\n*   **Position 5 (original C-13):** The original hydride at C-13 moves to C-14 (position 4). The carbon at C-13 then becomes part of the final double bond and has no simple H or CH₃ substituent. The label '5' is ambiguous. However, the most chemically reasonable interpretation is that it points to the nearby C-18 position, whose hydrogen is unaffected by the rearrangement. Thus, **5 = H**.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this analysis and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at labeled positions after the acid-catalyzed\n    rearrangement of β-amyrin to olean-12-ene.\n    \n    The reaction proceeds via a Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement, which\n    involves a cascade of 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts.
