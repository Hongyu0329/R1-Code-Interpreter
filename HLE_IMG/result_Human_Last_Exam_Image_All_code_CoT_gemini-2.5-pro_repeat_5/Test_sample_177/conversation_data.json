    "Of course. Here is the plan to calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled):\n\n1.  **Calculate Baseline Car VMT**: For each trip distance category in Table 1, we will calculate a relative VMT. This is done by multiplying the `share of total trips` for that category by the total `car mode share` (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and the `average trip distance`. Summing these values across all four distance categories gives the total relative VMT for the baseline scenario.\n\n2.  **Calculate Proposed Car VMT**: We will repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2 (Proposed) to find the total relative VMT for the proposed scenario.\n\n3.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**: The reduction is calculated using the formula:\n    `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe 'Average Carpool Occupancy' is not needed for this calculation, as VMT refers to the miles traveled by the *vehicle*, not by each person.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = {\n        \"0-3 miles\": 0.48,\n        \"3-5 miles\": 0.22,\n        \"5-10 miles\": 0.14,\n        \"10+ miles\": 0.16\n    }\n\n    average_trip_distance = {\n        \"0-3 miles\": 1,\n        \"3-5 miles\": 4,\n        \"5-10 miles\": 7.5,\n        \"10+ miles\": 20\n    }\n\n    # Baseline scenario data (Table 1)\n    baseline_car_share = {\n        \"0-3 miles\": 0.25 + 0.28,\n        \"3-5 miles\": 0.38 + 0.43,\n        \"5-10 miles\": 0.40 + 0.45,\n        \"10+ miles\": 0.42 + 0.47\n    }\n\n    # Proposed scenario data (Table 2)\n    proposed_car_share = {\n        \"0-3 miles\": 0.01 + 0.02,\n        \"3-5 miles\": 0.08 + 0.19,\n        \"5-10 miles\": 0.14 + 0.27,\n        \"10+ miles\": 0.16 + 0.33\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate total VMT for the Baseline scenario ---\n    total_vmt_baseline = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Baseline Car VMT (relative):\")\n    for category in share_of_total_trips:\n        share = share_of_total_trips[category]\n        car_share = baseline_car_share[category]\n        distance = average_trip_distance[category]\n        vmt_contribution = share * car_share * distance\n        total_vmt_baseline += vmt_contribution\n        print(f\"  - Category '{category}': {share:.2f} (trip share) * {car_share:.2f} (car share) * {distance:.1f} (miles) = {vmt_contribution:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Baseline Car VMT (relative) = {total_vmt_baseline:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate total VMT for the Proposed scenario ---\n    total_vmt_proposed = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Proposed Car VMT (relative):\")\n    for category in share_of_total_trips:\n        share = share_of_total_trips[category]\n        car_share = proposed_car_share[category]\n        distance = average_trip_distance[category]\n        vmt_contribution = share * car_share * distance\n        total_vmt_proposed += vmt_contribution\n        print(f\"  - Category '{category}': {share:.2f} (trip share) * {car_share:.2f} (car share) * {distance:.1f} (miles) = {vmt_contribution:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Proposed Car VMT (relative) = {total_vmt_proposed:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the percentage reduction ---\n    vmt_reduction = total_vmt_baseline - total_vmt_proposed\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / total_vmt_baseline) * 100\n\n    print(\"Calculating Percentage Reduction:\")\n    print(f\"Reduction Amount = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = {total_vmt_baseline:.4f} - {total_vmt_proposed:.4f} = {vmt_reduction:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (Reduction Amount / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {total_vmt_baseline:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Execute the calculation and print the result\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n# The final answer is wrapped as requested\n# print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer:.1f} >>>\") # This line is for the final answer format but let's just print the number\nprint(f\"\\nBy changing the mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by {final_answer:.1f}%.\")\n```\n<<<52.2>>>"
