# Step 1: Identify the parameters for the calculation.
# From the logical deduction, the base plot is n_0 = 2.
# The omitted simulation has parameters m=1, d=2.
n0 = 2
m = 1
d = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the transmission probability |t|^2.
# The problem asks for the calculation under the condition V=2E.
# In the limit where the particle energy E approaches its mass m,
# the transmission probability |t|^2 simplifies to 1 / (1 + (m*d/2)^2).
t_squared = 1 / (1 + (m * d / 2)**2)

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
result = n0 / t_squared

# Step 4: Print the equation and the result.
print(f"The value is given by n0 / |t^2|.")
print(f"From the analysis of the plots, we found n0 = {n0}.")
print(f"The parameters of the omitted simulation are m = {m} and d = {d}.")
print(f"Under the condition V=2E, in the limit E->m, |t^2| = 1 / (1 + (m*d/2)^2) = 1 / (1 + ({m}*{d}/2)^2) = {t_squared}.")
print(f"Therefore, the final value is {n0} / {t_squared} = {result}.")
