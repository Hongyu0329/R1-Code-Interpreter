# The user wants me to act as a physician and provide a diagnosis.
# The clinical vignette describes a 67-year-old female with a one-month history of
# low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, and diarrhea. She has a history of
# uveitis and arthritis. Her exam shows right-sided abdominal tenderness.
# Labs show leukocytosis (WBC 13,000) and a positive fecal occult blood test.
# The CT scan shows marked circumferential thickening of the bowel in the
# right lower quadrant, consistent with ileocecal inflammation.

# Let's analyze the options:
# A. Crohn's Disease: Classically involves the ileocecal region. Presents with
#    chronic GI symptoms and constitutional symptoms. Crucially, it is associated
#    with extraintestinal manifestations like uveitis and arthritis. This fits perfectly.
# B. Yersinia Colitis: Can mimic Crohn's but is an infection. The chronicity and
#    especially the history of uveitis/arthritis make this less likely.
# C. Ileocecal Tuberculosis: A great mimic of Crohn's, but Crohn's is more common
#    in this demographic without specific TB risk factors. The extraintestinal
#    manifestations strongly favor Crohn's.
# D. Salmonella Enteritis: Usually an acute illness.
# E. C. difficile Colitis: Typically follows antibiotic use and is more diffuse.
# F. Cecal Volvulus: An acute surgical emergency with a different presentation.
# G. Ischemic Colitis: Usually affects different areas (watershed zones).
# H. Pneumoperitoneum: A finding of free air, which is not present.
# I. Ovarian Torsion: An acute GYN emergency.
# J. Celiac Disease: Affects the proximal small bowel.
# K. Gastrointestinal Lymphoma: A consideration, but the specific extraintestinal
#    manifestations point more strongly to an inflammatory disease.

# The most unifying diagnosis that explains the bowel inflammation, constitutional
# symptoms, and the history of uveitis and arthritis is Crohn's Disease.
