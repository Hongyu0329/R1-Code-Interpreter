    "My thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland. Therefore, the primary differential diagnosis includes tumors of the pituitary gland (pituitary adenoma) and other structures in that region, such as craniopharyngioma, meningioma, germinoma, etc. The sample is an intraoperative crush smear, a rapid diagnostic technique.\n\n2.  **Examine the Microscopic Image (Cytology):**\n    *   **Cellularity and Arrangement:** The smear shows cohesive clusters of epithelial cells against a granular, somewhat \"dirty\" background.\n    *   **Epithelial Clusters:** The main cluster shows large, polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders, forming a syncytial arrangement. A key feature is seen at the periphery of this cluster: the nuclei are arranged in a \"palisading\" fashion, lined up neatly along the edge.\n    *   **Nuclear Features:** The nuclei are generally oval to round with some mild variation in size. The chromatin pattern is relatively bland, not overtly malignant.\n    *   **Pathognomonic Findings:** The most crucial diagnostic clues are scattered throughout the image and highlighted in the crops:\n        *   **\"Wet Keratin\":** These are anucleated, whorled nodules of squamous cells. They appear pale and ghost-like. This feature is highly specific.\n        *   **Calcification:** There are irregular, dark purple-black clumps, which represent dystrophic calcification. This is very common in this type of tumor.\n    *   **Background:** The background is fibrillary and contains stripped nuclei and cellular debris.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Form a Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** While common in this location, classic pituitary adenomas consist of monotonous sheets of endocrine cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. They typically lack wet keratin, palisading squamous epithelium, and extensive calcification.\n    *   **Meningioma:** Sellar meningiomas can show syncytial clusters and psammoma bodies (a form of calcification), but they do not feature \"wet keratin\" or the specific type of peripheral palisading seen here.\n    *   **Craniopharyngioma:** This diagnosis fits all the features perfectly. There are two main types:\n        *   **Papillary Craniopharyngioma:** Occurs mainly in adults and is composed of non-keratinizing squamous epithelium, but it lacks wet keratin and calcification.\n        *   **Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP):** This is the classic type seen in children and young adults. Its hallmark features, all present in the image, are:\n            1.  Nests of squamous epithelium.\n            2.  **Peripheral nuclear palisading**.\n            3.  **\"Wet keratin\"** (lamellar keratin).\n            4.  **Dystrophic calcification**.\n            5.  Often associated with cysts containing \"machine-oil\" fluid (cholesterol crystals).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of a sellar mass in a young adult with cytological findings of cohesive epithelial nests showing peripheral palisading, \"wet keratin,\" and calcification is diagnostic of Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_sellar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step pathological analysis of the provided image\n    to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the clinical information provided.\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_sex = \"female\"\n    location = \"mass in the sella turcica\"\n    sample_type = \"intraoperative crush smear\"\n\n    print(f\"Clinical Context: A {patient_age}-year-old {patient_sex} with a {location}.\")\n    print(f\"The sample is an {sample_type}, used for rapid intraoperative diagnosis.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Describe the microscopic findings from the image.\n    print(\"Microscopic Findings:\")\n    print(\"- Cohesive clusters of epithelial cells are present.\")\n    print(\"- The cells at the edge of the clusters show 'peripheral palisading' (nuclei lining up in a row).\")\n    print(\"- There are nodules of 'wet keratin', which are anucleated, ghost-like squamous cells.
