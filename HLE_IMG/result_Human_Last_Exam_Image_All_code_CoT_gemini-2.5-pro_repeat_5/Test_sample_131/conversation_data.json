    "This task requires me to identify the chemical compound from the provided image.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will analyze the chemical structure shown in the image. It is a tetracyclic (four-ring) system.\n2.  I will note the key functional groups: it contains two nitrogen atoms (making it an amine, and specifically an alkaloid) and one carbonyl group (C=O) as part of a lactam ring.\n3.  I will search my knowledge base for this specific structure, paying attention to the arrangement of the rings and the stereochemistry (the solid and dashed wedges).\n4.  The structure corresponds to a well-known lupin alkaloid.\n5.  I will then write a simple Python script to print the name of this compound, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef get_alkaloid_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the alkaloid compound\n    shown in the image. The structure is identified as Matrine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_alkaloid_name()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
