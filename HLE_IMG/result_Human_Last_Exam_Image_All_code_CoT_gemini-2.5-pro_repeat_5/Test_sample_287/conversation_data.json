    "My plan is to identify the city by analyzing the unique architectural features of the buildings in the image.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will closely examine the skyscrapers in the provided image and its crops. The building in the center-left with a distinctive wavy or curved glass facade is the most prominent and unique feature.\n2.  **Identify the Landmark:** I will use this unique building as a key search term to identify its name and location. A search for \"skyscraper with wavy glass facade\" or similar terms should help pinpoint the building.\n3.  **Confirm the Location:** Once the building is identified, I will confirm its location, which will give me the city's name. I will cross-reference with other buildings visible in the image to ensure accuracy. The prominent wavy building is the GT Tower East, located in the Seocho District of Seoul, South Korea, near Gangnam Station.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** As requested, I will provide a Python script that prints the name of the identified city.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the city where the photo was taken.\n# By analyzing the architecture, specifically the building with the wavy facade,\n# we can identify it as the GT Tower East.\n# This building is a famous landmark in Seoul, South Korea.\n# This script will print the name of the city.\n\ncity = \"Seoul\"\nprint(f\"The city in the image is: {city}\")\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2024.
