    "The image provided shows the emission spectrum of an element. Each bright line corresponds to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element's excited atoms. To identify the element, we need to compare this unique pattern of lines to the known spectra of different elements.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Visually analyze the provided spectrum, noting the prominent lines in different color regions (blue, green, yellow, red).\n2.  I will access a database of known atomic spectral lines for common elements.\n3.  I will compare the pattern in the image to the known patterns. The spectrum in the image has several strong lines distributed across the visible range: multiple lines in the blue/violet, several in the green/cyan, a very prominent yellow-orange line, and a couple of distinct red lines.\n4.  This pattern is characteristic of the element Helium (He). For instance, Hydrogen has only four visible lines, and Neon is heavily dominated by red and orange lines. The spectrum shown is a classic match for Helium.\n5.  I will write a Python script that contains the prominent visible spectral lines of Helium and prints them out to confirm the identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by its characteristic spectral lines.\n\n    The provided image shows a spectrum with prominent lines across the visible\n    range.
