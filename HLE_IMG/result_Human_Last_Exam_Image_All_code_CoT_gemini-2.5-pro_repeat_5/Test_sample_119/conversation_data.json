    "This is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 135.\n    *   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. I'll assume one nitrogen atom.\n    *   The molecular formula is likely C₉H₁₃N. Let's check the mass: (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + (1 × 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4. This value is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The pair of peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H bonds, and peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H bonds.\n    *   Peaks around 1600 and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   The pattern in the fingerprint region (e.g., strong peaks around 700 and 750 cm⁻¹) suggests a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound contains a primary amine and a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   There are 7 carbon signals: [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2].\n    *   The four signals from 126.3 to 145.1 ppm are in the aromatic region, consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl group which has 4 unique carbon environments (ipso-, ortho-, meta-, para-).\n    *   The three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the C₃H₈N side chain.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   The five positive signals must be the three CH carbons of the benzene ring plus two aliphatic carbons (one CH and one CH₃).\n    *   Conclusion: The side chain is composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A multiplet signal from ~7.2-7.4 ppm with an integration of 5H confirms the monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A doublet at ~1.2 ppm (3H) indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-).\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.8 ppm (2H) corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.6-3.0 ppm (1H) corresponds to the methine proton (-CH-).\n\n5.  **Assemble the Structure using all data (including HSQC):**\n    *   From the fragments identified (C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, -NH₂), we can propose structures.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows a -CH-CH₃ fragment (from the 1H multiplet and 3H doublet).\n    *   This leaves the C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂ groups to be placed. The only logical arrangement is C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's verify this with the HSQC data which correlates protons to their attached carbons:\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm. This is our CH₂ group (negative in DEPT).\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~2.6-3.0 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm. This is our CH group (positive in DEPT).\n    *   All spectroscopic data consistently point to the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The main carbon chain containing the functional group (amine) is three carbons long (propane).\n    *   The amine group is on carbon #2 (propan-2-amine).\n    *   A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon #1.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound_and_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the analysis of spectroscopic data to identify a chemical compound and provides its IUPAC name.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\")\n    print(\"==============================\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
