    "This is a task of identifying the biological sexes of insects. I will analyze the morphological characteristics of each pair to determine whether they are male or female.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A:** I will identify the type of insect and look for common sexual dimorphism traits. For bees and wasps, these often include antenna length, abdominal shape, and facial markings. These insects appear to be *Coelioxys* (cuckoo bees). Female *Coelioxys* are known for their distinctly long, pointed, conical abdomens, used for oviposition. The insect on the right clearly exhibits this trait, while the one on the left does not. Therefore, the right insect is female and the left is male.\n2.  **Analyze Pair B:** These are paper wasps (*Polistes*). Male wasps can often be distinguished from females by their longer antennae, which are frequently curled at the tip. The wasp on the left has long, curled antennae, indicating it is a male. The wasp on the right has shorter, straighter antennae, characteristic of a female.\n3.  **Analyze Pair C:** These are bees. A common telltale sign for male bees in many species is having much longer antennae than females. Additionally, males often have yellow or white markings on their faces (clypeus) that females lack. The bee on the left has visibly longer antennae and a pale patch on its face, making it a male. The bee on the right has shorter antennae and a darker face, making it a female.\n4.  **Consolidate Results:** Based on the analysis, pairs A, B, and C all show a male on the left and a female on the right. This corresponds to option 3 (M, F) for all three pairs. I will then format the answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sexing puzzle based on morphological analysis.\n    \n    The options are:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n    \n    Analysis:\n    - Pair A: Left insect is a male cuckoo bee, right insect is a female cuckoo bee (pointed abdomen). This is M, F. Index is 3.\n    - Pair B: Left insect is a male paper wasp (long, curled antennae), right insect is a female. This is M, F.
