# Step 1: Define the number of splice species identified by each unique primer pair based on the text.

# Panel B (Primer pair E1F1/E4R)
species_from_B = 2

# Panel C (Primer pair E1F1/E5R)
species_from_C = 2

# Panel D (Primer pair E1F2/E5R)
species_from_D = 1

# Panel E (Primer pair E1F1/L2R)
species_from_E = 1

# Panel F (Primer pair E1F2/L2R)
species_from_F = 1

# Panel G (Primer pair E1F3/L2R)
species_from_G = 2

# Panels H and I (Primer pair E1F1/L1R)
# Panel I is the more sensitive assay and reveals all species detectable by this primer pair.
species_from_HI = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of splice species by summing the counts from each distinct experimental setup.
total_species = species_from_B + species_from_C + species_from_D + species_from_E + species_from_F + species_from_G + species_from_HI

# Step 3: Print the final calculation and the result.
print("To find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species identified by each primer pair:")
