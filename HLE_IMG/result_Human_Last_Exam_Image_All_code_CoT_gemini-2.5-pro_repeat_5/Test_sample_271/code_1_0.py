# Define the given physical constants
m1 = 1  # mass at the end of the rod (kg)
m2 = 2  # mass of the colliding projectile (kg)
R = 3   # length of the rod, position of m1 (m)
d = 1   # distance from pivot to collision point (m)
g = 10  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

# The derived equation for v0 is:
# v0 = (2 / (m2 * d)) * sqrt(g * (m1 * R + m2 * d) * (m1 * R^2 + m2 * d^2))

# We are asked to propose an equation for v0 with the given values.
# The Python f-string will substitute the variable values into the equation string.
# Note: In the f-string, expressions like R**2 will be evaluated to their numerical result.
# This fulfills the requirement to show each number in the final equation.
