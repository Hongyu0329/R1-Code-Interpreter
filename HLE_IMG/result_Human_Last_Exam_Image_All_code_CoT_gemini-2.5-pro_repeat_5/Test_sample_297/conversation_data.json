    "The secret word is hidden within the colorful vertical bar on the right edge of the image. This bar encodes a message using a simple binary scheme.\n\nHere is the plan to decode it:\n1.  **Analyze the Encoding:** The bar consists of blocks of distinct colors (Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, White, Black). This palette of 8 colors suggests that each color represents a 3-bit number (since 2^3 = 8).\n2.  **Establish a Mapping:** We can map each color to a 3-bit binary value. A standard mapping would be based on a palette index: Black='000', Red='001', Green='010', Yellow='011', Blue='100', Magenta='101', Cyan='110', White='111'.\n3.  **Extract the Data:** A script will scan the pixels of the color bar from top to bottom, recording the sequence of colors.\n4.  **Find the Message:** The bar starts with a \"header\" that displays the palette colors in order. The actual secret message begins after this header.\n5.  **Decode:** The script will convert the sequence of message colors into a continuous stream of bits. It will then group these bits into 8-bit chunks (bytes), convert each byte into its corresponding ASCII character, and assemble them to reveal the secret word.\n\nThe following Python script automates this entire process.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\ndef find_secret_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Downloads the image, extracts the color data from the right border,\n    and decodes the hidden message.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
