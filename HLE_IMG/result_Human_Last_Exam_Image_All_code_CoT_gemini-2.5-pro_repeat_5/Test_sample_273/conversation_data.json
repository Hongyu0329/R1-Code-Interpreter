    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, I will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** Locate all stereocenters in the molecule.\n2.  **Determine IUPAC Name and Numbering:** Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the alcohol, -OH) to correctly number the chiral centers.\n3.  **Address Drawing Ambiguity:** The stereocenter on the left (C2) has two dashed bonds, which is not standard. I will assume this is a typo and that the hydroxyl (-OH) group is wedged (pointing out of the page), as this is a more common and stable conformation representation.\n4.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n5.  **Determine R/S Configuration:** For each center, orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer. Trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. A clockwise path is 'R', and a counter-clockwise path is 'S'.\n6.  **Combine Results:** State the full absolute configuration by combining the assignments for all chiral centers.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script that programmatically prints out this step-by-step analysis and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and explains the absolute configuration of the given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Naming and Identification of Chiral Centers\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH).
