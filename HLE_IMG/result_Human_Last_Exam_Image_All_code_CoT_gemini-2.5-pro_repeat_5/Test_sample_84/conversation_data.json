    "Based on the heraldic elements present in the image, I will identify the city with the most similar coat of arms.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The coat of arms features a shield divided horizontally (per fess). The top half is blue (azure) with a yellow crescent moon (or). The bottom half is yellow (or) with a black crab (sable). It is topped with a crown and flanked by an olive branch on the left and an oak branch on the right.\n2.  **Identify the Core Design:** The most distinctive part is the shield's design: a blue field with a crescent above a gold field with a crab.\n3.  **Research:** I will search for coats of arms matching this specific design.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The coat of arms of the town of **Hrvatska Kostajnica, Croatia**, perfectly matches the shield's design (per fess azure a crescent or and or a crab sable). While the crown and wreath in the image are artistic embellishments, the core shield is a direct match.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to print the name of this city.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the city whose coat of arms is most similar to the one depicted.\n\n    The image shows a coat of arms with the following key features on its shield:\n    - Divided horizontally (per fess).\n    - The top part is blue (azure) and contains a yellow/gold crescent moon.\n    - The bottom part is yellow/gold (or) and contains a black crab.\n\n    This specific design directly matches the coat of arms of a town in Croatia.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Hrvatska Kostajnica\"\n    country = \"Croatia\"\n    \n    print(f\"The coat of arms in the image is very similar to that of the city: {city_name}, {country}.\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Hrvatska Kostajnica>>>"
