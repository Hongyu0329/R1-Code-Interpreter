    "This is a problem of identifying a chemical structure from its mass spectrum. Here is a step-by-step plan to deduce the compound's identity:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) in the spectrum is at m/z 225. We will examine its isotopic pattern to identify any halogens present in this fragment.\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion Peak:** We will look for the peak cluster at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), which corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺). We'll analyze its isotopic pattern to determine the halogen content of the entire molecule and its molecular weight.\n3.  **Determine Fragmentation Pattern:** By comparing the molecular ion and the base peak (and other major fragments), we can deduce the fragmentation pathway, which gives clues about the molecule's structure.\n4.  **Deduce the Molecular Formula:** Using the molecular weight and the elemental composition derived from the fragmentation and isotope patterns, we will determine the molecular formula of the compound.\n5.  **Identify the Compound:** Based on the molecular formula, degree of unsaturation, and characteristic fragments, we will propose a structure and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the unknown compound.\n    This function will print the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze Key Peaks and Isotope Patterns ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Base Peak and Molecular Ion\")\n    \n    # Data from the table for key peaks\n    base_peak = {'mz': 225, 'intensity': 100}\n    base_peak_m_plus_2 = {'mz': 227, 'intensity': 66.7}\n    \n    molecular_ion_cluster = {\n        258: 17.4,\n        260: 34.8,\n        262: 29.0,\n        264: 12.9,\n        266: 3.22\n    }\n    \n    # Theoretical isotope ratios for Chlorine\n    # For 2 Cl atoms, M:(M+2) ratio is approx. 100:64\n    # For 3 Cl atoms, M:(M+2):(M+4) ratio is approx. 100:96:31\n    \n    # Analysis of the base peak at m/z 225\n    ratio_base_peak = base_peak_m_plus_2['intensity'] / base_peak['intensity']\n    print(f\"The base peak is at m/z = {base_peak['mz']}.\")\n    print(f\"The peak at m/z = {base_peak_m_plus_2['mz']} has an intensity of {base_peak_m_plus_2['intensity']}%.\")\n    print(f\"The intensity ratio I(227)/I(225) is {ratio_base_peak:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"This is very close to the theoretical ratio of ~0.64 for a fragment containing two Chlorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The fragment at m/z 225 contains 2 Chlorine atoms.\\n\")\n    \n    # Analysis of the molecular ion cluster\n    # Let's assume the molecular ion M+ is the first peak of the highest-mass cluster, m/z 260.\n    m_ion_mz = 260\n    m_plus_2_mz = 262\n    m_plus_4_mz = 264\n    \n    m_ion_intensity = molecular_ion_cluster[m_ion_mz]\n    m_plus_2_intensity = molecular_ion_cluster[m_plus_2_mz]\n    m_plus_4_intensity = molecular_ion_cluster[m_plus_4_mz]\n\n    # Normalize to the M+ peak at 260\n    normalized_m_plus_2 = (m_plus_2_intensity / m_ion_intensity) * 100\n    normalized_m_plus_4 = (m_plus_4_intensity / m_ion_intensity) * 100\n\n    print(f\"The highest significant mass cluster starts at m/z = {m_ion_mz}.\")\n    print(f\"The observed isotope pattern for this cluster (normalized to {m_ion_mz}=100) is roughly:\")\n    print(f\"I({m_ion_mz}):100, I({m_plus_2_mz}):{normalized_m_plus_2:.0f}, I({m_plus_4_mz}):{normalized_m_plus_4:.0f}\")\n    print(\"This pattern (100:83:37) is a reasonable match for a molecule containing three Chlorine atoms (theoretical ~100:96:31).\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The molecular ion is at m/z 260 and the molecule contains 3 Chlorine atoms.\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Determine Fragmentation ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the Fragmentation Pattern\")\n    mass_loss = m_ion_mz -
