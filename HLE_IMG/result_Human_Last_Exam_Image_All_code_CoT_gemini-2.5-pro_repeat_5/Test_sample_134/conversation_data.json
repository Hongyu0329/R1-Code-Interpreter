    "Here is my plan to identify the molecule and generate the required code:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:** I will first examine the provided image of the molecule. It is a large, ring-shaped organic molecule composed of carbon (grey) and hydrogen (white) atoms. The structure consists of repeating units.\n2.  **Identify the Repeating Units:** By looking closely at the structure and the provided crops, I will identify the two types of alternating units that make up the ring. These units appear to be aromatic rings and short carbon chains with triple bonds.\n    *   The aromatic ring is a benzene ring substituted at two opposite positions (para-), making it a 1,4-phenylene group (C₆H₄).\n    *   The linker is a two-carbon unit with a triple bond, known as an ethynylene group (-C≡C-).\n3.  **Count the Units:** I will count the number of phenylene-ethynylene repeating units in the macrocycle. This number, 'n', is crucial for the specific name of the molecule.\n4.  **Name the Molecule:** Based on the identified repeating units and their count, I will determine the systematic name. Molecules of this class are called cycloparaphenyleneethynylenes, abbreviated as CPPE. The specific name will be in the format [n]cycloparaphenyleneethynylene.\n5.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:** I will calculate the molecular formula by summing the atoms from all the repeating units.\n    *   Formula of one repeating unit (C₆H₄ + C₂) = C₈H₄.\n    *   Total formula = n * (C₈H₄).\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that formalizes the steps above. The script will:\n    *   Define the number of repeating units.\n    *   Calculate the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Print the name of the molecule and the step-by-step derivation of its chemical formula, ensuring that all numbers involved in the calculation are explicitly printed as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the molecule in the image, calculates its chemical formula,\n    and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
