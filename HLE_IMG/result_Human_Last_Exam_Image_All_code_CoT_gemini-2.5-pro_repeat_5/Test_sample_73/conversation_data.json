    "To determine the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction, we will analyze each center one by one from left to right according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**1. Stereocenter in the Acyl Chloride (First Reactant)**\n\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom bonded to -OMe, -COCl, -CF3, and -Ph.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -OMe (attached atom is O, atomic number 8)\n    2.  -COCl (attached atom is C, which is bonded to Cl, atomic number 17)\n    3.  -CF3 (attached atom is C, which is bonded to F, atomic number 9)\n    4.  -Ph (attached atom is C, which is bonded to C, atomic number 6)\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) is in the plane. The group in the back is -CF3 (#3). We can mentally swap these two groups. The new arrangement has -Ph in the back. Now, looking at the remaining groups 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-OMe -> -COCl -> -CF3), the direction is clockwise (R). Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Thus, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**2. Stereocenter in the Alcohol (Second Reactant)**\n\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom bonded to -OH, -H, -CH2OMe, and -CH2CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (O, atomic number 8)\n    2.  -CH2OMe (C bonded to O)\n    3.  -CH2CH(CH3)2 (C bonded to C)\n    4.  -H (H, atomic number 1)\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The -OH group (#1) is on a wedge (front), which means the lowest priority group (-H, #4) is in the back (dash). We can directly look at the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path from -OH (front) -> -CH2OMe (up) -> -CH2CH(CH3)2 (down) is counter-clockwise. Thus, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**3. First Stereocenter in the Product (from Acyl Chloride)**\n\nThe esterification reaction does not change the spatial arrangement of the groups around this stereocenter, but the identity of one group changes (-COCl becomes -COOR'), which can change the CIP priorities.\n\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom bonded to -OMe, -COOR', -CF3, and -Ph.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -OMe (O, atomic number 8)\n    2.  -CF3 (C bonded to F, atomic number 9)\n    3.  -COOR' (C bonded to O, atomic number 8)\n    4.  -Ph (C bonded to C, atomic number 6)\n    *Note: The priorities of the -CF3 and the carbonyl-containing group have swapped compared to the reactant.*\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The spatial arrangement is the same. We have -OMe (#1, wedge), -CF3 (#2, dash), -COOR' (#3, left), and -Ph (#4, right). We swap the lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) with the group in the back (-CF3, #2). In the new arrangement, the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-OMe -> -CF3 -> -COOR') is counter-clockwise (S). Since we swapped, the original configuration is **(R)**.\n\n**4. Second Stereocenter in the Product (from Alcohol)**\n\nThis center is also unaffected in its spatial arrangement by the reaction.\n\n*   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom bonded to -O-CO-R, -H, -CH2OMe, and -CH2CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -O-CO-R (O, atomic number 8)\n    2.  -CH2OMe (C bonded to O)\n    3.  -CH2CH(CH3)2 (C bonded to C)\n    4.  -H (H, atomic number 1)\n    *The priorities are the same as in the alcohol reactant.*\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The arrangement is unchanged, and the lowest priority group (-H, #4) is in the back. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise. Thus, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\nThe final sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is (S), (S), (R), (S).\n\n```python\ndef get_stereochemical_assignments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the reaction scheme from left to right.\n    \"\"\"\n    assignments = [\"S\", \"S\", \"R\", \"S\"]\n    print(\"The stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters from left to right are:\")\n    print(f\"1st (Acyl Chloride): {assignments[0]}\")\n    print(f\"2nd (Alcohol): {assignments[1]}\")\n    print(f\"3rd (Product center 1): {assignments[2]}\")\n    print(f\"4th (Product center 2): {assignments[3]}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal sequence: {', '.join(assignments)}\")\n\nget_stereochemical_assignments()\n```\n<<<(S), (S), (R), (S)>>>"
