    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction principle. The principle states that for any graph G and any edge e in G, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n\nHere, G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e. We will apply this method systematically to break down the graph into simpler ones whose chromatic polynomials are easier to compute.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph (G):**\n    *   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (n=5)\n    *   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)} (m=7). Note that vertices {2,3,4,5} form a K4 minus an edge (2,5), and vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\n2.  **Apply Deletion-Contraction:**\n    Let's choose the edge `e = (4, 5)`.\n    P(G, k) = P(G - (4,5), k) - P(G / (4,5), k)\n\n3.  **Compute P(G / (4,5), k):**\n    *   Let G₁ = G / (4,5). We merge vertices 4 and 5 into a new vertex '45'.\n    *   The new vertex '45' is connected to everything 4 or 5 was connected to: {1, 2, 3}.\n    *   The graph G₁ has vertices {1, 2, 3, '45'}.\n    *   The edges are (1,2), (2,3), (1,'45'), (2,'45'), (3,'45').\n    *   This graph is a wheel graph W₄, which is also K₄ (a complete graph on 4 vertices).\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    *   **Error in analysis**: Let's re-check the edges of G / (4,5). Original edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n        *   (1,2) -> (1,2)\n        *   (1,5) -> (1,'45')\n        *   (2,3) -> (2,3)\n        *   (2,4) -> (2,'45')\n        *   (3,4) -> (3,'45')\n        *   (3,5) -> (3,'45') (This is a duplicate edge)\n    *   The edges of G / (4,5) are {(1,2), (2,3), (1,'45'), (2,'45'), (3,'45')}.\n    *   This graph is a K₄ missing the edge (1,3). Let's call this K₄-e.\n    *   To color K₄-e: Color 2 and '45' first: k(k-1) choices. Vertex 1 must differ from 2 and '45', so it has (k-2) choices. Vertex 3 must also differ from 2 and '45', giving (k-2) choices.\n    *   So, P(G / (4,5), k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n\n4.  **Compute P(G - (4,5), k):**\n    *   Let G₂ = G - (4,5). This graph is still complex, so we apply deletion-contraction again. Let's choose `e' = (3,5)`.\n    *   P(G₂, k) = P(G₂ - (3,5), k) - P(G₂ / (3,5), k).\n    *   **G₂ / (3,5):** Merge 3 and 5. The resulting graph is a K₄ minus an edge, identical in structure to G₁. So P(G₂ / (3,5), k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    *   **G₂ - (3,5):** The remaining edges are {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)}. This graph consists of a triangle K₃ on vertices {2,3,4}, with vertex 1 attached to 2, and vertex 5 attached to 1.\n    *   To color this graph: Color the K₃ {2,3,4} first: P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) ways. Now, color vertex 1, which is only adjacent to 2. It has (k-1) choices. Finally, color vertex 5, which is only adjacent to 1. It also has (k-1) choices.\n    *   So, P(G₂ - (3,5), k) = P(K₃,k) * (k-1) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1)² = k(k-1)³(k-2).\n    *   Now, P(G₂, k) = k(k-1)³(k-2) - k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    *   P(G₂, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1)² - (k-2)] = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k² - 2k + 1 - k + 2] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 3k + 3).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P(G, k) = P(G₂, k) - P(G₁, k)\n    *   P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 3k + 3)] - [k(k-1)(k-2)²]\n    *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k² - 3k + 3) - (k-2)]\n    *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n    *   Expanding this gives: P(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\n    *   P(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\n    *   P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the expansion and prints the final polynomial with all its numerical components.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and formats the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The derivation results in the factored form: k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n    This function expands it and prints it in a specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # The chromatic polynomial in factored form, from the deletion-contraction derivation\n    poly_factored = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k**2 - 4*k + 5)\n\n    # Expand the polynomial\n    poly_expanded = sympy.expand(poly_factored)\n\n    # Get the polynomial as a dictionary of {power: coefficient}\n    poly_dict = poly_expanded.as_poly(k).as_dict()\n\n    # Format the polynomial string to show all numbers\n    terms = []\n    # Sort terms by power in descending order\n    sorted_coeffs = sorted(poly_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[0][0], reverse=True)\n\n    for i, (power_tuple, coeff) in enumerate(sorted_coeffs):\n        power = power_tuple[0]\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Determine the sign for the term\n        sign = \"\"\n        if i == 0:\n            if coeff < 0:\n                sign = \"-\"\n        else:\n            if coeff > 0:\n                sign = \" + \"\n            else:\n                sign = \" - \"\n\n        # Get the absolute value of the coefficient\n        abs_coeff = str(abs(coeff))\n\n        # Format the variable part (k with its power)\n        if power == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            var_str = \"k\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"k^{power}\"\n        \n        # Combine coefficient and variable, adding a '*' if both exist\n        if var_str:\n            term = f\"{abs_coeff}*{var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term = abs_coeff\n\n        terms.append(f\"{sign}{term}\")\n    \n    final_polynomial_str = \"\".join(terms)\n    \n    print(f\"The chromatic polynomial is P(k) = {final_polynomial_str}\")\n\nget_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1*k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
