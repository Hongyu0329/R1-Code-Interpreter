    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:** The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive sorting algorithm. Its core logic is:\n    *   **Base Case:** If the array slice has one or zero elements (`n <= 1`), it's considered sorted, and the function returns.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`:\n        1.  It first calls `sort(a, n - 1)` to sort the prefix of the array, `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  It then compares the last element, `a[n-1]`, with the element before it, `a[n-2]`.\n        3.  If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it swaps them.\n        4.  Crucially, if a swap occurred, the prefix `a[0...n-2]` might no longer be sorted. Therefore, it calls `sort(a, n - 1)` a *second time* to re-sort the prefix.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario:** The worst-case performance occurs when the second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is executed at every step of the main recursion. This happens when the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition is always true. A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) is a perfect example of a worst-case input. After the first `sort(a, n-1)` call sorts the prefix, the smallest element of the original array will be at `a[n-1]`, guaranteeing it's smaller than `a[n-2]` (which is now the largest element of the prefix), thus triggering the swap and the second recursive call.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` represent the number of operations for an input of size `n` in the worst case. The function performs two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1`, plus a constant amount of work `c` for the comparison and swap. This gives the recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c`\n    This simplifies to the final equation for complexity analysis:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence:** Solving this relation shows exponential growth. Expanding the relation reveals the pattern:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 3c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n    *   The general form reveals that `T(n)` is proportional to `2^n`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The worst-case time complexity is **O(2^n)**.\n\nThe following Python script empirically demonstrates this by counting the recursive calls for a worst-case input. The number of calls grows exponentially, matching the `2^n - 1` pattern derived from the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1`.\n\n```python\n# A global counter to track the number of calls\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Swaps two elements in an array.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort_instrumented(a, n):\n    \"\"\"The sorting algorithm with an instrumented call counter.\"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the exponential complexity by running the algorithm\n    on worst-case inputs of increasing size.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation is T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c.\")\n    print(\"This leads to O(2^n) complexity.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Demonstration by counting recursive calls ---\")\n    \n    # Test for n from 1 to 10\n    for n in range(1, 11):\n        global call_count\n        call_count = 0\n        \n        # Worst-case input: a reverse-sorted array\n        arr = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        \n        sort_instrumented(arr, n)\n        \n        # The number of calls for the recurrence C(n) = 2*C(n-1) + 1 is 2^n - 1.\n        # Let's show this equation with the actual numbers.\n        expected_calls = 2**n - 1\n        \n        print(f\"\\nFor n = {n}:\")\n        print(f\"  Total calls: {call_count}\")\n        print(f\"  Equation: 2^{n} - 1 = {expected_calls}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
