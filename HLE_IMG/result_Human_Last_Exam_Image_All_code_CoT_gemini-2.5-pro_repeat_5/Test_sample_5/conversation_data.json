    "This is a famous and virtuosic piece for piano. Here's a step-by-step analysis to identify it:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis**: The sheet music is for piano, written on a grand staff. The initial key signature is C major / A minor. The tempo is marked at a moderate ♩ = 80. The piece begins quietly (*p*) with simple chords and notes.\n\n2.  **The Main Section**: At measure 3, the character changes dramatically. The dynamic becomes forte (*f*), and the right hand begins a torrent of fast, descending sixteenth-note figures, while the left hand plays powerful, rhythmic chords. This type of writing is characteristic of a virtuosic piece from the Romantic era.\n\n3.  **Harmonic Progression**: The fast section begins in C minor (indicated by the E-flat in the right hand). It then moves through a series of related keys:\n    *   Measure 3: C minor\n    *   Measure 4: F minor\n    *   Measure 5: Appears to be centered on A major, functioning as the dominant of D minor.\n    *   Measure 8: G minor\n    *   Measure 9: C minor again.\n    This logical and dramatic progression through minor keys is a strong clue.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Piece**: The specific pattern—fast descending arpeggios in the right hand against forceful chords in the left, combined with the specific harmonic sequence—is a signature passage from **Franz Liszt's \"Mephisto Waltz No. 1\" (S.514)**. This excerpt corresponds to the *Presto* section that begins around measure 735 of the original score. While some accidentals and the tempo marking in this version might differ slightly from standard editions (this may be a specific arrangement or edition), the musical passage is unmistakable.\n\nThe introductory two measures and the slower tempo might be an editorial addition to make this technically demanding passage more accessible for study.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the piece of music from the provided sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  composer = \"Franz Liszt\"\n  piece_title = \"Mephisto Waltz No. 1\"\n  catalogue_number = \"S.514\"\n  \n  print(f\"The music is from '{piece_title}' by {composer}.\")\n  print(f\"This famous and fiendishly difficult piano piece is also known by its catalogue number, {catalogue_number}.\")\n  print(\"The excerpt shown is from a fast section (originally marked Presto) near the end of the work.\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Mephisto Waltz No. 1 by Franz Liszt>>>"
