    "Based on the visual evidence in the images, the process being depicted is the initiation and development of a new branch from a hypha (a filamentous cell, characteristic of fungi or oomycetes).\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of the process shown in the images L, M, and N:\n\n1.  **Image L:** This image shows a segment of a hypha. The black arrowhead points to a septum (cross-wall) between two cells. The hypha is relatively straight and uniform in diameter.\n2.  **Image M:** This image shows a later time point. At the location previously near the septum, the side of the hyphal cell has started to bulge outwards. The arrowhead points to this initial swelling, which is the beginning of a new branch.\n3.  **Image N:** At an even later time point, the bulge has grown larger and started to elongate, forming a distinct new branch that is growing out from the parent hypha. The arrowhead continues to highlight this developing structure.\n\nThis sequence illustrates **hyphal branching**, a fundamental process in the vegetative growth of filamentous fungi and oomycetes, allowing them to explore their environment and form a complex network called a mycelium.\n\nI will now provide the answer in the requested format. This is a biological identification task, so no code is necessary.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
