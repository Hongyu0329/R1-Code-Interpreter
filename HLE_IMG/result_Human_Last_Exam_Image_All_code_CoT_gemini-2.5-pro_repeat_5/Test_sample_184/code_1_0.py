    This function identifies the two products of the described reaction.

    The reaction proceeds in two steps:
    1. A 4Ï€ electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene starting material. This is a thermal reaction, so it proceeds in a conrotatory fashion. This opening can lead to a mixture of E/Z diastereomeric dienes.
    2. A Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the generated diene and ethyl acrylate. The problem specifies an 'endo' approach.

    Analysis Steps:
    1.  Deduce the structure of the intermediate diene by performing a retro-Diels-Alder analysis on the given product structures. This leads to the diene: CH2=C(Me,OMe)-C(MeO)=CH.
    2.  Identify the stereochemical outcome of an 'endo' Diels-Alder reaction. For this cyclohexene system, the endo product corresponds to a 'trans' relationship between the substituent at C6 (from the diene) and the substituent at C3 (from the dienophile). In the given drawings, this means one group is represented by a wedge and the other by a dash.
    3.  Filter the product options based on the endo rule. Products B, C, and G show this 'trans' relationship.
    4.  The starting material is a single enantiomer with the methyl group at C4 shown as a wedge. This stereocenter becomes C6 in the product, so the methyl group at C6 must also be a wedge. This filters our options down to C and G.
    5.  The formation of two products can be explained by the initial electrocyclic opening, which can form two different diastereomeric dienes (E/Z isomers). Each of these dienes then undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction to form a different diastereomeric product.

    Therefore, the two endo products formed from the single enantiomer starting material are C and G.
