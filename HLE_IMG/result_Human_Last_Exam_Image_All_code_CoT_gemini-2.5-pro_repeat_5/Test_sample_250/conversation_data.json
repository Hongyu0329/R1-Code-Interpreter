    "This is a music identification task. Based on my analysis of the melody and chord progression, I can identify the jazz standard.\n\n**My step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:** The sheet music has a key signature of four flats (F minor / Ab Major) and is in 4/4 time. The structure appears to be a 32-bar AABA form, which is common in jazz standards. The piece is in F minor.\n2.  **Examine the \"A\" Section:** The first four measures are the most distinctive clue. The chord progression is `F- | E-øb5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7`. This features a chromatically descending bass line (F, E, Eb, Db) under changing chord qualities. The melody also follows this descent, with the first note of each of these measures being F, Eb, Eb, and Db respectively. This unique harmonic and melodic movement is characteristic of a specific composer's style.\n3.  **Examine the Bridge (\"B\" Section):** The bridge starts with a `D-øb5` (a ii chord in C minor) followed by a `G7` (the V chord). It continues with a series of ii-V progressions (`C7 | F7`, `Bb-7 | Eb7`) that modulate through different keys before returning to the home key of F minor.\n4.  **Identify the Composer and Title:** The combination of the chromatic A-section and the modulating bridge strongly points to the work of composer Tadd Dameron. Searching for a Tadd Dameron composition in F minor with these characteristics leads to the title \"On a Misty Night\". The chord changes and melody in the provided sheet music are a perfect match for this tune (with some common chord substitutions, like using G7 instead of Gm7b5).\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will now write a Python script to present this information as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a jazz standard based on its musical characteristics.\n    Analysis of the provided sheet music's melody and chord progression reveals the title and composer.\n\n    Key Features Identified:\n    - Key: F minor\n    - A-Section Chords: F- | E-øb5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 ...\n    - Melodic Contour: Descending line in the A-section.\n    - Composer Style: Characteristic of Tadd Dameron's writing.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"On a Misty Night\"\n    composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
