    "I will identify the insect in the image and then provide a Python script to print its scientific name.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the visual characteristics of the insect in the image, noting its color pattern (black and orange/red), body shape, and antennae.\n2.  The insect is perched on what appears to be a goldenrod flower (*Solidago*).\n3.  The specific markings, particularly the red-orange lines bordering the wings and the V-shape near the head, are characteristic of the Boxelder Bug.\n4.  The scientific name for the Boxelder Bug is *Boisea trivittata*.\n5.  I will write a simple Python script that stores this name in a variable and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n  The animal is identified as a Boxelder Bug.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the animal is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
