    "Here is my thinking process to identify the country from the Google Trends graph:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:** The graph displays search interest over time for three different topics (represented by the red, yellow, and blue lines) from December 2019 to mid-2023. The key feature is the presence of recurring, sharp peaks for each color at specific times of the year, every year. This pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as national holidays or anniversaries.\n\n2.  **Identify the Timing of the Peaks for Each Color:**\n    *   **Blue Line:** The blue line consistently peaks in late May or very early June each year.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** The yellow line consistently peaks in early July each year. It has the highest peak on the chart, reaching 100 in July 2023.\n    *   **Red Line:** The red line consistently peaks in mid-to-late January each year.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize Events Based on Peak Timings:** Now, I'll try to match these annual timings to significant national events in a single country. The United States is a strong candidate.\n    *   **Blue Peak (late May/early June):** This timing perfectly matches **Memorial Day** in the United States, which is a federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor and mourn the U.S. military personnel who died while serving.\n    *   **Yellow Peak (early July):** This timing perfectly matches **Independence Day (the 4th of July)** in the United States. It is a major national holiday celebrating the Declaration of Independence and would generate significant, recurring search interest.\n    *   **Red Peak (mid-to-late January):** This timing perfectly matches **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a U.S. federal holiday marking the birthday of the civil rights leader. It is observed on the third Monday of January.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The annual search interest peaks for all three lines align perfectly with three major American holidays: Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January), Memorial Day (May), and Independence Day (July). This unique combination of nationally significant dates points conclusively to the United States.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the country based on the analysis of Google Trends data\n    for three major national holidays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The peaks in the graph correspond to annual US holidays:\n    # Red Line Peak (January) -> Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n    # Blue Line Peak (Late May) -> Memorial Day\n    # Yellow Line Peak (July) -> Independence Day\n    # This specific combination of holidays is unique to one country.\n    \n    country = \"United States\"\n    \n    print(f\"The country where these three historic events are observed is: {country}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
