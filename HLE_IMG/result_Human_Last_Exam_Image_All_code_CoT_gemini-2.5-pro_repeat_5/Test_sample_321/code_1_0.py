    This function outlines the thinking process and provides the final answer
    to the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle.

    The core of the task is to identify which parameter is varied in each of the nine plots.
    This is done by qualitative analysis of the system of equations and the plot shapes.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Plot 1: Shows S(t). The wide, fanning curves suggest a parameter with a strong, direct impact on transmission. This is characteristic of beta_h (ID 9).
    2.  Plot 2: Shows S(t). The curves have a complex interaction, suggesting an indirect effect that alters the timing of key epidemic events (like hospitals filling up). This matches the effect of mu_n (ID 3).
    3.  Plot 3: Shows S(t). The different slopes during the quarantine period point directly to q_f (ID 15), the quarantine reduction factor.
    4.  Plot 4: Shows S(t). The varying length of the flattened section corresponds to varying the quarantine duration, q_l (ID 14).
    5.  Plot 5: Shows an increasing, S-shaped variable like R(t) or D(t). The horizontal shift of the curves is a classic result of varying a parameter that controls the epidemic's speed, like the incubation period a_i (ID 5).
    6.  Plot 6: Shows S(t). The shift in the start time of the quarantine effect indicates a variation in the quarantine start day, q_s (ID 13).
    7.  Plot 7: Shows an increasing variable. The curves are scaled versions of each other, which uniquely identifies a cost parameter variation. This corresponds to C_l(t) with c_l (ID 7) varied.
    8.  Plot 8: Shows S(t). The curves are very close together, implying a parameter with a weak effect. The baseline mortality rate mu (ID 1) fits this description.
    9.  Plot 9: Shows an S-shaped cumulative variable, D(t). The large variation in the final number of deaths points to f_s (ID 6), the fraction of infected developing severe symptoms.

    Based on this detailed analysis, the sequence of parameter identifiers is determined.
    The code below will print this final sequence.
