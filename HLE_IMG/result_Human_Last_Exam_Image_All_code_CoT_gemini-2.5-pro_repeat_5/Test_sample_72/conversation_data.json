    "Of course, I can help you solve this chemistry problem. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall reaction:** The transformation shows hexafluorobenzene reacting with cyclobutene under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a complex tricyclic product. It's highly unlikely this happens in a single step. Pericyclic reactions often occur in a sequence.\n\n2.  **Identify the first reaction:** Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo photochemical isomerizations to form valence isomers. A well-known example is the conversion of benzene to Dewar benzene. In this case, hexafluorobenzene (a 6π-electron system) likely undergoes a photo-induced ring closure to form hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This type of intramolecular cyclization, where a conjugated π-system forms a ring by converting a π-bond into a σ-bond, is known as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n3.  **Identify the second reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, is highly reactive and contains two double bonds. It then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene, which contains one double bond. The final product is formed by creating a new four-membered ring that fuses the Dewar benzene and cyclobutene molecules. This is achieved by reacting one of the double bonds from the Dewar benzene with the double bond from cyclobutene. A reaction where two unsaturated molecules combine to form a new ring is called a **cycloaddition**. Since a 2π-electron system (the alkene in Dewar benzene) reacts with another 2π-electron system (cyclobutene), this is specifically a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules and are consistent with the reaction conditions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The overall transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions: an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines this solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pericyclic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given chemical transformation and identifies the\n    two pericyclic reactions involved.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the proposed two-step mechanism.\n    print(\"The transformation occurs in two sequential photochemical steps.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Describe the first pericyclic reaction.\n    print(\"Reaction 1: Photoisomerization of Hexafluorobenzene\")\n    print(\"Description: Hexafluorobenzene first undergoes a photo-induced valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: This is an Electrocyclic Reaction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Describe the second pericyclic reaction.\n    print(\"Reaction 2: Cycloaddition of the intermediate with Cyclobutene\")\n    print(\"Description: The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, reacts with cyclobutene.
