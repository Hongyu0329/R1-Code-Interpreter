    "An analysis of the molecular structure is required to determine which peripheral phenyl rings can rotate freely. Free rotation about a single C-C bond is possible only if there is no significant steric hindrance from nearby atoms or groups.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Ligands and Attachment Points:** The central Iridium (Ir) atom is coordinated by three ligands. Two are cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligands (A-B and C-D), and one is a bipyridine-type ligand (E-F). We need to examine the attachment points of the peripheral phenyl rings G, H, J, K, and L.\n2.  **Analyze Ring H and J:** Ring H is attached to C4 of phenyl ring A. Ring J is attached to C4 of phenyl ring C. The C4 position (para position) on the main phenyl ligand points away from the bulky metal center and the rest of the coordination sphere. Therefore, there is minimal steric hindrance, and rings H and J can rotate freely.\n3.  **Analyze Ring K and L:** Ring K is attached to C6 of phenyl ring A. Ring L is attached to C6 of phenyl ring C. These C6 carbons are the points of cyclometalation, meaning they are directly bonded to the Iridium center. This creates an extremely crowded environment. The phenyl rings K and L are \"buttressed\" against the metal atom and the adjacent pyridine rings (B and D). This severe steric clash prevents free rotation.\n4.  **Analyze Ring G:** Ring G is attached to C6 of pyridine ring F. Ring F is part of the bidentate bipyridine ligand (E-F). When this ligand chelates to the metal, the C6 position of ring F is brought into close proximity with ring E. The ortho-hydrogens of ring G would clash severely with the C3-hydrogen of ring E, thus preventing free rotation.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, only rings H and J are free from significant steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to identify the freely rotating rings.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational freedom of peripheral phenyl rings in the given\n    Iridium complex based on steric hindrance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of each peripheral phenyl ring based on the diagram.\n    # 'name': The label of the ring (G, H, J, K, L).\n    # 'attachment_pos': The position on the ring it's attached to.\n    # 'attachment_type': A description of the chemical environment at the attachment point.\n    Ring = collections.namedtuple('Ring', ['name', 'attachment_pos', 'attachment_type'])\n    rings = [\n        Ring(name='G', attachment_pos=6, attachment_type='pyridine_in_bipyridine_ligand'),\n        Ring(name='H', attachment_pos=4, attachment_type='remote_on_phenyl_ligand'),\n        Ring(name='J', attachment_pos=4, attachment_type='remote_on_phenyl_ligand'),\n        Ring(name='K', attachment_pos=6, attachment_type='cyclometalated_carbon'),\n        Ring(name='L', attachment_pos=6, attachment_type='cyclometalated_carbon'),\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing steric hindrance for each phenyl ring to determine rotational freedom:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    \n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n\n    for ring in rings:\n        can_rotate = False\n        reason = \"\"\n        # Rule 1: Rings attached at a remote position (4) can rotate freely.\n        if ring.attachment_pos == 4:\n            can_rotate = True\n            reason = f\"Ring {ring.name} is at position 4, which is remote from the crowded metal center.
