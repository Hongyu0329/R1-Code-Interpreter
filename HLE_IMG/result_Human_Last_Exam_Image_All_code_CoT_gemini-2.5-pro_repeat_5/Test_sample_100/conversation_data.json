    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first determine the molecular formula of the initial reactant by carefully counting the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms in its structure.\n2.  **Track Changes in Reaction 1**: The first step uses CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate), a reagent known for removing the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group. I will calculate the change in atomic composition by subtracting the atoms of the PMB group and adding a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen, resulting in the formula for **Intermediate 1**.\n3.  **Track Changes in Reaction 2**: The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H₂), which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond. This adds two hydrogen atoms. I will update the formula of Intermediate 1 to get the formula for **Intermediate 2**.\n4.  **Track Changes in Reaction 3**: The final step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (the cyclic amide) using HCl at high temperature. This reaction opens the ring by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). I will add the atoms of water to the formula of Intermediate 2 to determine the molecular formula of the final **Product**.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to automate these calculations. The script will define the atomic composition of the starting material and then apply the changes for each reaction step, printing the results at each stage. For the final step, as requested, the code will explicitly show how the atoms are summed to reach the final molecular formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n```python\ndef find_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the molecular formula of the product through the given reaction series.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Structure: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one\n    # Let's count the atoms:\n    # - Bicyclic core (C6H5NO): 6 C, 5 H, 1 N, 1 O\n    # - Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): 1 C, 3 F\n    # - p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB, C8H9O): 8 C, 9 H, 1 O\n    # Total: C(6+1+8), H(5+9), F(3), N(1), O(1+1)\n    start_material = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(f\"Starting Material Formula: C{start_material['C']}H{start_material['H']}F{start_material['F']}N{start_material['N']}O{start_material['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 -> Intermediate 1 (Deprotection of PMB)\n    # Remove PMB group (C8H9O) and add one H to the nitrogen.\n    intermediate1 = start_material.copy()\n    intermediate1['C'] -= 8\n    intermediate1['H'] -= 9\n    intermediate1['O'] -= 1\n    intermediate1['H'] += 1\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: C{intermediate1['C']}H{intermediate1['H']}F{intermediate1['F']}N{intermediate1['N']}O{intermediate1['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 -> Intermediate 2 (Hydrogenation)\n    # Add H2 to the double bond.\n    intermediate2 = intermediate1.copy()\n    intermediate2['H'] += 2\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: C{intermediate2['C']}H{intermediate2['H']}F{intermediate2['F']}N{intermediate2['N']}O{intermediate2['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 -> Final Product (Hydrolysis)\n    # Add H2O to hydrolyze the lactam.\n    final_product = intermediate2.copy()\n    final_product['H'] += 2\n    final_product['O'] += 1\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Step: Hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) with water (H2O)\")\n    print(\"The final molecular formula is calculated by adding the atoms:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C):   {intermediate2['C']} + 0 = {final_product['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {intermediate2['H']} + 2 = {final_product['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {intermediate2['F']} + 0 = {final_product['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {intermediate2['N']} + 0 = {final_product['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O):   {intermediate2['O']} + 1 = {final_product['O']}\")\n\n    # Print the final molecular formula in standard notation.\n    product_formula_str = f\"C{final_product['C']}H{final_product['H']}F{final_product['F']}N{final_product['N']}O{final_product['O']}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the final product is: {product_formula_str}\")\n\nfind_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
