# Step 1: Analyze the starting compound for the final transformation, Compound B.
# Compound A is given as a complex cationic structure. Let's analyze it.
# It consists of a dibenzo[d,g][1,3]dioxocine core. The carbon at position 6 is a carbocation (C+).
# This core structure has 4 methoxy groups (-OCH3).
# The C+ at position 6 is also attached to a 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl group, which contains 3 methoxy groups.
# In total, Compound A has 4 + 3 = 7 methoxy groups.
#
# Compound A reacts with excess diethylamine. Diethylamine, a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic C+ center.
# This forms Compound B, a neutral molecule where a diethylamino group is attached to the C6 position.
# The structure of Compound B is 6-(diethylamino)-6-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4,8,10-tetramethoxydibenzo[d,g][1,3]dioxocine.
# Compound B therefore has 7 methoxy groups.

# Step 2: Analyze the final transformation from B to C.
# Compound B is reacted with 10 equivalents of LiI in NMP at 170Â°C.
# LiI is a reagent used for the demethylation of aryl methyl ethers. The iodide ion (I-) attacks the methyl group of an ether in an SN2 reaction.
# Since a large excess of LiI is used at high temperature, it's expected that all aryl methyl ether groups will be cleaved.
# Compound B has 7 methoxy groups. All of them will be converted to hydroxyl (-OH) groups (assuming a final aqueous workup to protonate the resulting phenoxides).

# Step 3: Determine the final structure of Compound C.
# By replacing all 7 methoxy groups in Compound B with hydroxyl groups, we get the structure of Compound C.
# The core skeleton remains the same.
