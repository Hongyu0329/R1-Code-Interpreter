def solve_thermosiphon_dynamics():
    """
    Analyzes the six plots of coupled thermosiphon dynamics and determines the parameter
    change for each plot relative to a baseline simulation.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Identify the reference plot (code '0'). Plot 3 appears to be a standard, well-defined
        coupled chaotic attractor, making it a good candidate for the reference simulation.
    2.  Identify changes in initial conditions (code 'Z' or 'z'). Plot 1 is visually very
        similar to Plot 3. In a chaotic system, changing only the initial condition results
        in a different trajectory on the same attractor. Thus, the plot looks almost identical.
        So, Plot 1 corresponds to a change in Z0. We'll use 'Z'.
    3.  Identify changes in the Rayleigh number (codes 'R'/'r'), the primary driving force.
        - Plot 2 shows a much larger, denser, and more chaotic attractor than the reference.
          This corresponds to an increased driving force. So, Plot 2 is 'R' (Rayleigh doubled).
        - Plot 5 shows the dynamics decaying to a stable point, meaning chaos is suppressed.
          This corresponds to a decreased driving force. So, Plot 5 is 'r' (Rayleigh halved).
    4.  Identify changes in the Biot number (codes 'B'/'b'), the coupling strength.
        - Plot 4 exhibits strong anti-phase synchronization between the two systems (see the
          time series), indicating a very strong coupling. So, Plot 4 is 'B' (Biot doubled).
    5.  Identify changes in the mu parameter (codes 'M'/'m'), which controls asymmetry.
        - Plot 6 shows a significant asymmetry: the blue system is large and chaotic, while
          the orange system is small and suppressed. This is explained by an asymmetric
          parameter change. Doubling mu ('M') enhances the drive and influence of the first
          system over the second, matching the plot. So, Plot 6 is 'M'.

    This leads to the following assignments:
    - Plot 1: Changed initial condition -> Z
    - Plot 2: Increased chaos -> R
    - Plot 3: Reference simulation -> 0
    - Plot 4: Increased synchronization -> B
    - Plot 5: Decaying chaos -> r
    - Plot 6: Increased asymmetry -> M
