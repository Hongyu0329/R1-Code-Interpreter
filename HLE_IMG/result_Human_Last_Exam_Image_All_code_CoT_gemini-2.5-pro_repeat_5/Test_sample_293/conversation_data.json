    "This image displays a kidney glomerulus with a prominent crescent-shaped proliferation of cells within Bowman's space, compressing the glomerular tuft. This feature is the hallmark of crescentic glomerulonephritis. The crescent appears cellular, indicating an active and rapidly progressive disease process. The glomerular tuft itself shows signs of injury, including hypercellularity and possibly fibrinoid necrosis.\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis is a severe form of glomerular injury characterized by extensive crescent formation, which, if left untreated, rapidly leads to end-stage kidney disease. It is the histopathological correlate of the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\nTherefore, the histopathological diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
