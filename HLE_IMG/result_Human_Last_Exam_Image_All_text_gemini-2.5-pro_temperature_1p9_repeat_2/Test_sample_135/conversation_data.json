    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the artwork's medium and style:** The image displays a sculptural relief, appearing to be made of glazed terracotta. This specific medium, characterized by its white and sometimes blue-glazed finish, was famously perfected and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in 15th and 16th-century Florence. The artistic style is clearly that of the Italian Renaissance, visible in the classical composition, the naturalistic depiction of the human figures, and the flowing drapery.\n\n2.  **Analyze the subject matter:** The scene is enclosed in a circular frame, known as a tondo. It depicts a Christian religious rite. A priest, standing by an altar with a lit candle, is administering a wafer to a kneeling child. Other figures, both children and adults, are kneeling in prayer, waiting their turn. This scene represents the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion or the Sacrament of the Altar.\n\n3.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, a small banner (cartouche) contains an inscription. Though partially obscured, the words appear to be \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic Italian spelling for \"Sacramento dell'Altare,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject of the artwork.\n\n4.  **Connect the elements to an artist:** The combination of glazed terracotta, a Renaissance style, and a religious theme strongly points to the Della Robbia workshop. The main artists associated with this workshop are Luca della Robbia (the founder), his nephew Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's son, Giovanni della Robbia. While Luca and Andrea are known for their serene and graceful compositions, Giovanni's work is often characterized by more complex, crowded scenes, greater use of color (though this is a monochrome photo), and more expressive, sometimes dramatic, figures. The busy composition in this tondo, with its multiple interacting figures, is very characteristic of Giovanni's style.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific artwork:** By searching for \"Della Robbia altarpiece Sacrament of the Altar\" or the specific inscription, we can identify this piece. This tondo is a detail from the predella (the base section) of the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments\". This major work is attributed to Giovanni della Robbia and is dated to around 1520. It was originally made for the church of San Pierino in Fiesole and is now housed in the Church of San Girolamo in Fiesole, near Florence, Italy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinctive glazed terracotta medium, the Florentine Renaissance style, the inscription, and the compositional characteristics, the author of this detail from the Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments is Giovanni della Robbia.\n\n<<<Giovanni della Robbia>>>"
