    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Initial Visual Assessment:** The image displays a circular metal object, likely a gold medallion, with a suspension loop at the top, indicating it was meant to be worn or displayed as a pendant. The central image is in high relief, showing two human busts facing each other.\n\n2.  **Artistic Style Analysis:** The style of the figures deviates significantly from the naturalism of the classical Roman period. Key features to note are:\n    *   **Large, Staring Eyes:** The eyes are disproportionately large and gaze forward, giving the figures a remote, spiritual, or authoritative expression.\n    *   **Stylized Hair:** The hair is not rendered realistically with individual strands but as a patterned, cap-like mass.\n    *   **Rigid and Frontal Poses:** The figures are depicted in stiff, formal poses, emphasizing their status rather than capturing a moment of natural interaction.\n    *   These characteristics—abstract formalism, frontality, and a focus on spiritual or imperial authority over realism—are hallmarks of Late Roman or Early Byzantine art.\n\n3.  **Iconographic Identification:** The medallion depicts a confronting male and female bust, likely representing an imperial couple. This type of object often served as an imperial gift (*donativum*) to high-ranking officials or foreign dignitaries. The grandeur and material (implied gold) support its connection to imperial patronage.\n\n4.  **Comparison and Contextualization:** This specific medallion is a very famous artifact known to archaeologists and art historians. It is the large gold medallion from the **Szilágysomlyó Treasure** (also known as the Şimleu Silvaniei Treasure), found in modern-day Romania. This treasure contains a wealth of Late Roman and Migration Period objects.\n\n5.  **Specific Dating:** The objects within the Szilágysomlyó Treasure have been extensively studied. Based on stylistic comparisons with imperial coinage and other dated works of art, this medallion is confidently dated to the **4th century A.D.** More specifically, many scholars attribute it to the reign of Emperor Constantius II (337–361 A.D.), possibly created to commemorate his marriage to Empress Eusebia around 353 A.D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Combining the stylistic analysis, which points to the Late Roman period, with the specific identification of the object as a key piece from the Szilágysomlyó Treasure, archaeologists firmly ascribe this medallion to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
