    "This is an alkaloid compound. Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify its name:\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and core structure:**\n    *   The molecule is polycyclic, meaning it has multiple fused rings. Specifically, it has a tetracyclic (four-ring) system.\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of many alkaloids. Both nitrogen atoms are part of the ring system.\n    *   There is a carbonyl group (C=O) present. This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring, which means it is part of a lactam functional group (a cyclic amide).\n    *   The overall structure consists of two fused quinolizidine moieties. A quinolizidine is a system of two fused six-membered rings that share a nitrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Identify the parent skeleton:**\n    *   This specific tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms is known as the lupinane skeleton. This class of alkaloids is commonly found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n\n3.  **Identify the specific compound:**\n    *   The parent compound without the carbonyl group is called sparteine.\n    *   The presence of the carbonyl group (ketone/lactam) at position C-2 (standard numbering for this class) on the lupinane skeleton makes the compound **lupanine**.\n\n4.  **Consider the stereochemistry:**\n    *   The structure shown includes specific stereochemistry, indicated by the wedged (coming out of the page) and dashed (going into the page) bonds.\n    *   Natural products often exist as specific stereoisomers. The stereochemistry depicted is that of the most common and naturally occurring isomer of lupanine, which is (+)-lupanine.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the tetracyclic lupinane core, the presence of the lactam group, and the specific stereochemical configuration, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
