**Product A** is N-(pent-4-en-1-yl)acetamide.
**Product B** is hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one.
**Product C** is N-acetylpyrrolidine.

**Structures:**

*   **A**: A five-carbon chain with a double bond between C4 and C5, and an acetamido group (`-NHCOCH₃`) at C1.
    `CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH-C(=O)-CH₃`
*   **B**: A bicyclic lactam consisting of two fused five-membered rings sharing a common nitrogen atom and an adjacent carbon atom (pyrrolizidine skeleton), with a carbonyl group at the 3-position.
*   **C**: A five-membered saturated ring containing a nitrogen atom (pyrrolidine), with an acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) attached to the nitrogen.
