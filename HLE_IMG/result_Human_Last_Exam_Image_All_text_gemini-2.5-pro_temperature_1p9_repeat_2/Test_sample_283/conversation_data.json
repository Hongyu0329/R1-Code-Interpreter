    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country based on the Google Trends graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph's Structure**\nThe image provided is a Google Trends graph. This type of graph shows the relative search interest for one or more terms over a specific period. The y-axis represents the search interest on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is the point in time with the highest search volume for the given terms and region. The x-axis represents time, in this case, from December 2019 to sometime after May 2023. There are three distinct lines (red, blue, and yellow), each representing a different search term related to a historic event. The key clue is that all three events took place in the same country.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Pattern for Each Colored Line**\nThe most noticeable feature of the graph is the cyclical, repeating peaks for each color. This strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as national holidays or anniversaries. Let's analyze the timing of these peaks for each line.\n\n*   **Red Line:** This line shows a high peak every year around late January or early February. We can see these peaks at the beginning of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. This timing corresponds perfectly with the Lunar New Year (or Spring Festival), which falls on a different date each year within this period.\n\n*   **Blue Line:** This line shows smaller, but still consistent, annual peaks in early May. We can see these peaks in May 2020, May 2021, May 2022, and around May 2023. This suggests an event that is commemorated annually around May 1st, such as International Workers' Day (Labour Day).\n\n*   **Yellow Line:** This line shows sharp, high peaks every year in early October. We can observe these spikes in October 2020, October 2021, October 2022, and a very prominent one in October 2023. This points to a major annual event that occurs on or around October 1st.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information and Form a Hypothesis**\nWe are looking for a single country that has three major historical events/holidays that align with these three annual patterns:\n1.  **Red:** A major holiday in late January/early February (Lunar New Year).\n2.  **Blue:** A holiday in early May (around May 1st).\n3.  **Yellow:** A major holiday in early October (around October 1st).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the national holidays of a prominent country. The People's Republic of China fits this pattern perfectly:\n\n1.  **Spring Festival (春节 - Chūn Jié):** This is the Chinese New Year, the most important traditional festival in China. Its date is based on the lunar calendar, causing it to fall in late January or early February, matching the red line's peaks.\n2.  **Labour Day (劳动节 - Láodòng Jié):** Celebrated on May 1st. It is a major public holiday in China, often extended into a multi-day \"Golden Week\" holiday, which would generate significant search interest around that time, matching the blue line's peaks.\n3.  **National Day (国庆节 - Guóqìng Jié):** Commemorates the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. This is another week-long \"Golden Week\" holiday, explaining the massive search interest peaks in early October, matching the yellow line.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Evidence**\nThe combination of these three major annual events—Spring Festival, Labour Day, and National Day—is uniquely characteristic of the public holiday schedule in the People's Republic of China. For a historian, recognizing this pattern of national commemoration would make the country's identity evident. The graph clearly visualizes the country's main holiday seasons.\n\n<<<China>>>"
