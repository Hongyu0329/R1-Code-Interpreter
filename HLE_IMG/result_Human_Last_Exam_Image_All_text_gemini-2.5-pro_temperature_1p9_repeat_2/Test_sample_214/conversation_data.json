    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic form.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and identify key information.**\nThe question asks for the poetic form of a sequence of erasure poems. The provided information is:\n*   The sequence is a \"four-line stanza\". This means we are looking for a poetic form with four lines or units.\n*   The provided image represents the third line of this stanza.\n*   The fourth and final line/poem in the sequence consists of the words \"nacreous wavers\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the final line.**\nThe most concrete piece of information is the text of the final line: \"nacreous wavers\". To identify a poetic form, we should analyze its syllabic structure.\n*   \"nacreous\" is pronounced na-cre-ous, which has 3 syllables.\n*   \"wavers\" is pronounced wa-vers, which has 2 syllables.\n*   Total syllables for the fourth line = 3 + 2 = **5 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize a poetic form based on the final line.**\nWe are looking for a four-line poetic form where the last line has 5 syllables. A notable form that fits this description is the **Dodoitsu**, a form of Japanese folk song. The syllabic structure of a Dodoitsu is **7-7-7-5**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the hypothesis using the third line.**\nAccording to the Dodoitsu form, the third line should have 7 syllables. The image provides the words for the third line. These words, taken from an erasure poem, are arranged artistically: `ghostly`, `velum`, `form s`, `like a`, `dance`, and `, a vortex`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the words in the third line to find a 7-syllable phrase.**\nErasure and visual poetry often require the reader to form a line from a \"field\" of available words. We need to find a coherent phrase using the words in the image that adds up to 7 syllables.\n*   Let's test a combination: **\"ghostly velum forms a dance\"**.\n*   Let's count the syllables for this phrase:\n    *   `ghostly` (ghost-ly) = 2 syllables\n    *   `velum` (ve-lum) = 2 syllables\n    *   `forms` = 1 syllable\n    *   `a` = 1 syllable\n    *   `dance` = 1 syllable\n*   The total syllable count for this phrase is 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **7 syllables**.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe structure of the last two lines of the sequence is 7 syllables and 5 syllables. This perfectly matches the pattern of a Dodoitsu (7-7-7-5). Although we don't know the first two lines, the evidence from the third and fourth lines strongly points to this specific poetic form. The artistic arrangement of the erasure poem in the image allows for the construction of a 7-syllable line, confirming the pattern.\n\n<<<Dodoitsu>>>"
