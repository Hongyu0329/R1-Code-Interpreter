    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's first determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms.\n    *   The core structure is a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n    *   Core atoms: C1(CH), C2(C=O), C3(CH2), C4(CH), C5(C=), C6(CH), N7. This gives C6H5N.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   A carbonyl oxygen at C2: O.\n        *   A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) at C5: CF3.\n        *   A para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group at N7. The PMB group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. Its formula is C8H9O.\n    *   Total atoms count:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14.\n        *   Fluorine (F): 3.\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 (ketone) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n    *   Although the drawing shows the carbonyl at C2 and the nitrogen at N7, which are not directly bonded, the most plausible interpretation for the subsequent reactions (especially hydrolysis) is that this structure represents a lactam (a cyclic amide), where the C=O group is adjacent to the nitrogen atom. This is likely a schematic drawing or represents an isomer like 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, which has the same molecular formula. We will proceed with the assumption that this molecule behaves as a lactam.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction: Starting Material to Intermediate 1.**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Reaction:** CAN is a common oxidizing agent used for the deprotection of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. The PMB group is oxidatively cleaved from the nitrogen atom, and the nitrogen is left with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Change in molecular formula:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add a hydrogen atom (H). The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   **Change in molecular formula:** The reaction adds two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the double bond.\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the third reaction: Intermediate 2 to Product.**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Reaction:** These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or a lactam. Intermediate 2 is a saturated bicyclic lactam. The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond (C-N bond within the lactam ring) by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   **Reaction process:** R-CO-NR' + H2O --(H+)--> R-COOH + R'-NH2. The bicyclic ring opens to form a single molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amine group (-NH2). In the acidic medium, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+).\n    *   **Change in molecular formula:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the structure of Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Formula of the Product:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**. This represents the neutral amino acid molecule.\n\n**Summary of the calculation:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (- C8H8O): Intermediate 1 -> C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (+ H2): Intermediate 2 -> C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (+ H2O): Product -> C7H10F3NO2\n\n**Final Answer determination:**\nThe question asks for the molecular formula of the product. Based on the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence, the final product is the result of the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2.\nFormula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\nFormula of water added: H2O\nFormula of Product: C(7) H(8+2) F(3) N(1) O(1+1) = C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
