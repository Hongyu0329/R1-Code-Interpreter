    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image displays an insect positioned on a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a natural, outdoor environment like a meadow or field.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Morphology and Coloration**\n*   **Order:** The insect has features characteristic of a \"true bug\" (order Hemiptera), including forewings (hemelytra) that are hardened at the base and membranous at the tips, which overlap when at rest.\n*   **Color Pattern:** The insect exhibits a striking aposematic (warning) coloration of orange-red and black.\n*   **Head:** The head is black, with prominent compound eyes and a pair of long, black antennae.\n*   **Thorax:** Directly behind the head is the pronotum, which is marked with a distinct, solid orange-red band that stretches across its width.\n*   **Wings:** The wings are predominantly black. However, there are orange-red markings on them. The angle makes it slightly difficult to see the full pattern, but the visible portions at the base and sides of the wings suggest a pattern that forms an \"X\" shape against the black background when the wings are folded.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Plant**\nThe insect is on a plant with dense clusters of small, star-like yellow flowers. This morphology is highly characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common flowering plant in late summer and fall in North America.\n\n**Step 4: Comparison with Potential Species and Elimination of Incorrect Candidates**\nSeveral common black and orange/red insects could be considered:\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*)**: This bug has a different pattern, typically a large orange body with a black band across the wings and a black diamond shape on its scutellum (the triangular plate behind the pronotum). This does not match the insect in the photo.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: This bug has more defined red/orange lines or outlines on its black body, rather than the broad band on the pronotum and the \"X\" pattern seen here.\n*   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*)**: While found on goldenrod and having similar colors, this is a beetle (Coleoptera), not a true bug. Beetles have hardened elytra that meet in a straight line down the back, unlike the overlapping hemelytra of the bug in the picture.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusive Identification**\nThe combination of a black head, a broad orange-red band across the pronotum, and an orange-red \"X\" pattern on the black wings is the classic and definitive marking for the **Small Milkweed Bug**. Although their primary host plants for reproduction are milkweeds, they are frequently found on other plants, such as goldenrod, to feed on nectar. The scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\nThe question asks for the scientific name of the animal. Based on the conclusive identification in the previous steps, the scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
