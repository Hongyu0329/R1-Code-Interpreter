Based on the diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-type immunoglobulin domain** of the RAGE receptor, as indicated by the arrow pointing specifically to this domain.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** for neurological disorders. This is because its function goes beyond simply being present during the disease (which would make it an adjunct marker). According to the diagram, S100B is an active participant that triggers key pathological pathways (via RAGE, JNK/JUN, and NFκβ) leading directly to **neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration**. Therefore, the level of S100B expression would directly correlate with the rate and severity of disease progression, allowing clinicians to predict the patient's future outcome, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
