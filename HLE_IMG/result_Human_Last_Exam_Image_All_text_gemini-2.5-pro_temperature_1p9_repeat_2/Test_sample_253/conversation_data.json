    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the specified protein.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism in the Image:** The image shows a bright yellow-to-orange organism with a leafy (foliose) structure growing on rocks. It features small, cup-like structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). This morphology, combined with its vibrant color, is characteristic of the common sunburst lichen, scientifically known as *Xanthoria parietina*. Given the location is Acadia National Park, a coastal environment where this lichen thrives, this identification is highly probable.\n\n2.  **Understand the Biological Nature of the Organism:** A lichen is a composite organism, a symbiotic partnership between a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). The scientific name of the lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*, refers to the fungal partner. Proteins are encoded by genes, and the question refers to a specific protein, which will be from one of the partners, typically the well-studied fungus.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Specific Question:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism.\n    *   **Organism:** Identified as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n    *   **Protein:** \"XPH1\" is the designation for a specific protein. The name is an acronym: **XP** for ***X**anthoria **p**arietina* and **H1** for **h**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, secreted proteins characteristic of filamentous fungi, which further confirms we are looking for a protein from the fungal partner.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the length (number of amino acids) of this protein.\n\n4.  **Acquire the Protein Information from a Scientific Database:** To find the precise number of amino acids for a specific protein, one must consult authoritative biological databases. The primary resources for this kind of information are the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) protein database and the UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) knowledgebase.\n\n5.  **Perform the Database Search and Retrieve the Answer:**\n    *   Searching for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" in these databases leads to specific entries for this protein.\n    *   In the UniProt database, the entry is **XPH1_XANPA**. It is listed as Hydrophobin-1 from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*. The database states its length is **95 amino acids**.\n    *   In the NCBI protein database, the corresponding entry (accession number CAA70527.1) also describes \"hydrophobin XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina]\" and confirms the length is **95 amino acids**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Both reliable and independent biological databases concur that the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* is composed of 95 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The visual identification of the lichen is a crucial first step. The distinct features in the image strongly support the identification of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   Understanding that a protein name like XPH1 is a specific identifier allows for a precise database search.\n*   Relying on established scientific databases ensures the accuracy of the molecular information.\n*   The question is a multi-step problem that combines natural observation (biology) with data retrieval (bioinformatics).\n\n<<<95>>>"
