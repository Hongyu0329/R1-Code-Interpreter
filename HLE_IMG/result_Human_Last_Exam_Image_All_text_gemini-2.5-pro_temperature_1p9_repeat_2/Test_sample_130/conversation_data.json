    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the type of spectrum:** The image shows a set of bright, discrete vertical lines of different colors against a dark background. This is known as an **emission spectrum**. Emission spectra are produced when atoms of a gas are excited (e.g., by an electric current or heat) and then emit light at specific, characteristic wavelengths.\n\n2.  **Understand the significance of a spectral pattern:** Every chemical element has a unique emission spectrum. The pattern of lines—their position (wavelength/color) and relative brightness—acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. By comparing the observed pattern to known reference spectra, we can identify the element.\n\n3.  **Examine the prominent features of the given spectrum:** We will look at the most noticeable lines across the color range, from right (longer wavelength, red) to left (shorter wavelength, violet).\n    *   **Red Region:** There is a very bright, prominent red line.\n    *   **Yellow/Orange Region:** There is a distinct bright line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Green/Cyan Region:** There is a particularly bright line in the green-cyan (turquoise) area. There are also other, less intense green lines nearby.\n    *   **Blue/Violet Region:** There is a complex series of several lines in the blue and violet portions of the spectrum.\n\n4.  **Compare the observed spectrum with known spectra of elements:**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** Hydrogen has a simple visible spectrum (the Balmer series) with a strong red line, a cyan line, and a couple of violet lines. The spectrum in the image is significantly more complex, so it is not hydrogen.\n    *   **Sodium:** Sodium is famous for its very strong pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow part of the spectrum, which dominates its emission. While the given spectrum has a yellow-orange line, it also has many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue, which is not characteristic of sodium.\n    *   **Neon:** Neon is known for its abundance of bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum, giving neon signs their characteristic reddish-orange glow. The spectrum shown has strong lines across the entire visible range, not just concentrated in the red-orange region.\n    *   **Helium:** The known emission spectrum for Helium has several prominent lines that match the image very well:\n        *   A strong red line (~668 nm).\n        *   A strong yellow line (~587 nm).\n        *   A very bright green-cyan line (~501 nm).\n        *   Multiple other lines in the blue and violet regions (~492 nm, ~471 nm, ~447 nm).\n    The pattern of many lines, with prominent ones in the red, yellow, and green-cyan regions, is the distinct fingerprint of Helium.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The pattern of spectral lines presented in the image, with its specific strong emissions in the red, yellow, green-cyan, and blue-violet ranges, perfectly matches the established emission spectrum of the element **Helium**.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
