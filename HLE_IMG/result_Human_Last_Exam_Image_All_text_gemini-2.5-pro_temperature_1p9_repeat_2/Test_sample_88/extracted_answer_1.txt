*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** A product formed from the starting material via a sequence of decarboxylation, [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, and subsequent acetylation by acetic anhydride.
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** A polycyclic product resulting from the Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization with the elimination of one molecule of methanol.
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** The mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material with acetic anhydride.
