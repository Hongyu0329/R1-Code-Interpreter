    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to determine the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Kakuro Rules**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the diagonally split black squares are \"clues.\" The number in a clue square indicates the sum of the digits in the consecutive white squares either to its right (a horizontal run) or below it (a vertical run). A key rule is that within any single run (horizontal or vertical block), each digit from 1 to 9 can appear only once.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Clue Notation**\nThe puzzle uses a non-standard notation with single diagonal lines. We must determine the meaning of the `\\` and `/` symbols. There are two common possibilities:\n1.  `\\` signifies a horizontal run (to the right), and `/` signifies a vertical run (downwards).\n2.  `\\` signifies a vertical run, and `/` signifies a horizontal run.\n\nWe will test these interpretations by checking for logical impossibilities. An impossibility occurs if a sum is required that cannot be achieved with unique digits from 1-9 (e.g., a sum of 5 in 2 cells, where the minimum is 1+2=3, or a sum of 18 in 2 cells, where the maximum is 9+8=17).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Puzzle Structure and Clues with Convention 1 (`\\`=H, `/`=V)**\n\nLet's check for impossible sums under this convention.\n*   **Horizontal clue `27 \\`**: This clue is on the upper left. The run to its right seems to consist of three white squares. The maximum sum for three distinct digits is 9 + 8 + 7 = 24. A sum of 27 is impossible.\n*   **Horizontal clue `28 \\`**: This clue is on the lower left. The run to its right appears to have three white squares. Again, the maximum sum is 24, so a sum of 28 is impossible.\n\nSince this interpretation leads to multiple immediate contradictions, it is likely incorrect, or the puzzle itself is flawed.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Puzzle Structure and Clues with Convention 2 (`\\`=V, `/`=H)**\n\nLet's test the alternative rule set.\n*   **Horizontal clue `22 /`**: This clue is on the left side of the grid. The row of white squares next to it has only two cells before being interrupted by a black clue box. The maximum sum for two distinct digits is 9 + 8 = 17. A sum of 22 is impossible for a 2-cell run.\n\nThis convention also leads to a contradiction. Both standard interpretations result in impossibilities, suggesting the puzzle diagram contains errors.\n\n**Step 5: Isolate the Clue Relevant to the Question**\n\nThe question specifically asks for the two numbers in the **two top white squares**. Let's focus exclusively on the clues directly associated with these two squares, assuming they might be solvable even if other parts of the puzzle are flawed.\n*   The top two white squares are positioned next to each other, forming a row of two.\n*   Above the left square is a clue `17 \\`.\n*   Above the right square is a clue `29 \\`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate how these clues might apply.\n*   **Interpretation A (Vertical Clues):** The `17 \\` is a clue for the column below the first square, and `29 \\` is a clue for the column below the second square. This doesn't directly tell us the values of the top squares themselves, only the sum of the columns they belong to. While this is a plausible geometric interpretation, we have seen that it leads to contradictions elsewhere.\n*   **Interpretation B (Horizontal Clue):** The `17 \\` clue applies to the horizontal run starting immediately after it. In this layout, that run is the two top squares themselves. The `29 \\` clue next to it is problematic, as there are no squares to its right. It is common in flawed puzzles for some clues to be nonsensical. If we accept the most straightforward reading, `17 \\` is the clue for the top row of two squares.\n\n**Step 6: Solve Based on the Most Plausible Interpretation**\nAssuming Interpretation B is the intended logic for this specific part of the puzzle (as it's a very common pattern in valid Kakuro puzzles):\n*   The two top squares form a horizontal run of 2 cells.\n*   The clue for this run is 17.\n*   We need to find two distinct digits from 1 to 9 that sum to 17.\n*   The only possible combination is 8 and 9 (since 8 + 9 = 17).\n\nWhile the overall puzzle is demonstrably flawed due to multiple impossible sums, the question is specific to the top two squares, and the clue `17` for a 2-cell run provides a direct and unique solution for those two cells.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9"
