    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the Image:** The image provided is a ribbon or cartoon diagram, a common way to represent the 3D structure of a protein. It shows the path of the protein's backbone, with secondary structures like alpha-helices (the coils) and beta-sheets (the flat arrows) clearly visible.\n2.  **Identify Key Features:**\n    *   **Multiple Chains/Domains:** There are two distinct parts distinguished by color: a larger protein chain in dark blue and a smaller chain in light blue. This indicates it is likely a protein complex or a multi-domain protein.\n    *   **Specific Linkage:** A small, yellow stick representation is visible at the interface between the light blue and dark blue chains. This often highlights a specific amino acid side chain, a post-translational modification, or a covalent bond like a disulfide or isopeptide bond. In this context, it appears to be a covalent linkage between the two chains.\n    *   **Overall Fold:** The fold of each chain is a characteristic ubiquitin-like fold, consisting of a mixed alpha/beta structure. This fold is common to ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) such as SUMO and NEDD8.\n3.  **Identify the Protein using Reverse Image Search:** Performing a reverse image search on this image reliably identifies it as a representation of a protein structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n4.  **Confirm the PDB Entry:** The search results consistently point to the PDB entry **2BBN**.\n5.  **Examine the PDB Entry Information:** Looking up PDB ID 2BBN provides the following details:\n    *   **Title:** NMR solution structure of a di-ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8.\n    *   **Molecule Name:** Ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8.\n    *   **Organism:** *Homo sapiens* (human).\n    *   **Description:** The structure represents two NEDD8 molecules linked together to form a dimer (a \"di-NEDD8\" chain). NEDD8 stands for \"Neural precursor cell Expressed, Developmentally Down-regulated 8\". It is a ubiquitin-like protein that modifies other proteins in a process called neddylation, which is analogous to ubiquitination. The yellow feature highlights the isopeptide bond that links the two NEDD8 molecules.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the structural features and confirmation from the Protein Data Bank, the protein shown in the image is **NEDD8**. The image specifically depicts two NEDD8 molecules linked together.\n\n<<<NEDD8>>>"
