    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\nThe image fragment shows a section of a runestone. The key features are:\n*   The runes are carved in the Younger Futhark script, typical of the Viking Age.\n*   The inscription is organized into straight, horizontal bands, separated by carved lines. This is a specific style that differs from the more common snake-band or dragon-band designs.\n*   The text uses small 'x' characters as word separators.\n*   The stone has a grainy or mottled texture.\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate visible runes to gather clues.**\nLet's attempt to transliterate the runes in each band, reading from left to right. Transliteration can be tricky due to potential damage and variations in carving.\n\n*   **Top Row:** The most legible sequence seems to be `...ᚱ : ᛋᚢᚾ : ᚦ...`. This transliterates to `...r : sun : þ...`. The word `sun` means \"son\".\n*   **Middle Row:** Starting from the left separator, we see `ᚼ` (h), `ᛅ` (a), `ᚾ` (n). This spells `han`, which means \"he\".\n*   **Bottom Row:** Starting from the left separator, we see `ᚬ` (o), `ᚦ` (þ), `ᛅ` (a), `ᛚ` (l), `ᛁ` (i). This spells `oþali`, which could be part of a word like *óðali* meaning \"patrimony\" or \"inheritance\".\n\nSo we have fragments of words: `...r : sun : þ...`, `han...`, and `oþali...` appearing in three consecutive rows.\n\n**Step 3: Use the context of \"Ingvar runestone\" to narrow the search.**\nThe question specifies this is an \"Ingvar runestone,\" one of about 30 stones erected in memory of those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland (around the Caspian Sea) in the early 11th century. We need to find an Ingvar stone whose inscription matches our fragments.\n\n**Step 4: Search for a matching Ingvar runestone.**\nWe can now search through the inscriptions of the known Ingvar runestones, looking for one with our identified sequences (`...r sun þ...`, `han...`, `oþali...`) in consecutive lines. We also need to find one with the distinctive horizontal band layout.\n\n*   Many famous Ingvar stones, like the Gripsholm Runestone (Sö 179), have serpent designs and can be eliminated. We must focus on those with a banded layout.\n*   The Bröta runestone, cataloged as **Sö 281**, is an Ingvar runestone known for its text being arranged in horizontal bands.\n*   Let's check the inscription of Sö 281. The normalized Old Norse text is:\n    *Ulfr lét rétta stein þenna ok brú gera at Ônunda, son sinn, ok at Þrúði, móður sína. Ingfasts son var systurson þess es á Hákon(a) átti. Hann endaðist í Serklandi með Ingvari á óðali sínu.*\n*   The runic text is transliterated as:\n    `... : uaʀ : systur : sun : þahs : is : a : hakuna : ati : han : entaþis : i : srklati : miþ : ikuari : o : oþali sinu`\n\n**Step 5: Compare the fragment to the Sö 281 inscription.**\nLet's align the text bands from Sö 281 with our fragment:\n\n*   **Band 4 of Sö 281:** `...systu**r : sun : þ**ahs...`\n    *   This perfectly matches the top row of our fragment: `...r : sun : þ...`\n*   **Band 5 of Sö 281:** `**han : entaþis** : i : srklati...`\n    *   This perfectly matches the middle row of our fragment, which begins with `han...`\n*   **Band 6 of Sö 281:** `o : **oþali** sinu`\n    *   This perfectly matches the bottom row of our fragment, which begins with `oþali`.\n\nThe visual style, the layout in bands, and the specific rune sequences across three consecutive lines are a perfect match. The image is a fragment of the lower-left portion of the Sö 281 runestone.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Ingvar runestone depicted in the fragment is the Bröta runestone, whose catalogue ID is Sö 281.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
