The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect and upright. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or to hang downwards.
