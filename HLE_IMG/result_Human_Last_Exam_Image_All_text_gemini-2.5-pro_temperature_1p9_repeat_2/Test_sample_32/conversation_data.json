    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and key terms.**\nThe question asks for the primary visual difference in the **sporophyte** of two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. A moss sporophyte consists of a foot, a **seta** (the stalk), and a **capsule** (which contains the spores). The phrase \"at a glance\" implies a feature that is obvious without microscopic examination.\n\n**Step 2: Look for clues in the species names.**\nA major clue is in the name *Grimmia curviseta*. The specific epithet *curviseta* is derived from Latin: *curvus* meaning \"curved\" and *seta* referring to the stalk of the sporophyte. This strongly suggests that a curved seta is a key characteristic of this species. The name *Grimmia montana* simply refers to its typical mountain habitat and offers no morphological clues.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   Botanical descriptions and field guides for *Grimmia montana* consistently describe its sporophyte as having a **straight seta**.\n*   Because the seta is straight and relatively short, the capsule is held in an **erect or upright position**.\n*   The capsule is typically \"emergent,\" meaning it just pokes out from the tips of the surrounding leaves, as is suggested by the provided image.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   As its name indicates, the defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its **strongly curved or arcuate seta**.\n*   This pronounced curve in the seta causes the capsule to be oriented downwards. The capsule is often described as **cernuous (nodding)** or **pendulous (hanging)**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the main difference.**\nThe main, and most easily observed, difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **shape of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **straight seta**, which results in an **erect (upright) capsule**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a **distinctly curved seta**, which results in a **nodding or hanging capsule**.\n\nThis difference in the posture of the capsule, dictated by the shape of the seta, is the key feature for distinguishing the two species at a glance when they are producing spores. The moss shown in the image, with its erect capsules, is consistent with the appearance of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n<<<The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect and upright. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or to hang downwards.>>>"
