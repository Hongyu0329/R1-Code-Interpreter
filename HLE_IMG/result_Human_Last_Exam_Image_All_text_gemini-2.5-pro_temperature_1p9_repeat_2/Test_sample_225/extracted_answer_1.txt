The final product, A, is 9,9-bis(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-hydroxy-9H-xanthene. It is formed through a two-step sequence: first, the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the three isopropylidene ketal bridges of the starting material to yield tris(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium cation and three molecules of acetone. Second, this intermediate undergoes a rapid intramolecular cyclization where one of the ortho-hydroxyl groups attacks the central carbocation to form the stable, neutral xanthene derivative.

The structure of compound A is:
