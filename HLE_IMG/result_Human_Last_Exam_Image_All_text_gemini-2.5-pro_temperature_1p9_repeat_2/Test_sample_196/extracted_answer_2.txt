1. **[6π+4π] cycloaddition**: This describes the reaction based on one molecule acting as a 6π component (reacting at C2 and C6) and the other as a 4π component (the diene system from C2 to C5).
2. **[6πs+4πa] cycloaddition**: This is a more specific description of a thermally allowed pathway under Woodward-Hoffmann rules, where the 6π component reacts suprafacially and the 4π component reacts antarafacially.
3. **[6πa+4s] cycloaddition**: This is the other thermally allowed pathway, with the 6π component reacting antarafacially and the 4π component reacting suprafacially.
4. **[8π+2π] cycloaddition**: This is an alternative formal classification, where the 10 delocalized electrons involved in the reaction are partitioned as an 8π component and a 2π component.
