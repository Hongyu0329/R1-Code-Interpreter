    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Definitions\nThe question asks for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of nine matrices visualized in the image. These matrices represent Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\n*   **Wigner 3-j Symbols:** The visualizations correspond to the Wigner 3-j symbols of the form `(j j' 6 | m -m' 0)`. The nine plots are for `j` and `j'` taking integer values from 6 to 8. Assuming a standard row-column ordering for `(j, j')`, we can map each image number to a specific pair:\n    *   Image ①: (j=6, j'=6)\n    *   Image ②: (j=6, j'=7)\n    *   Image ③: (j=6, j'=8)\n    *   Image ④: (j=7, j'=6)\n    *   Image ⑤: (j=7, j'=7)\n    *   Image ⑥: (j=7, j'=8)\n    *   Image ⑦: (j=8, j'=6)\n    *   Image ⑧: (j=8, j'=7)\n    *   Image ⑨: (j=8, j'=8)\n\n*   **Matrix Elements:** The value at each point in the underlying matrix is given by the 3-j symbol `W(m, m') = (j j' 6 | m -m' 0)`. The quantum number selection rules for the 3-j symbol require the sum of the `m` values to be zero. In this case, `m + (-m') + 0 = 0`, which simplifies to `m = m'`. This means that the only non-zero elements of the matrix `W(m, m')` are on its diagonal, where `m = m'`.\n\n*   **Infinity-Norm:** The infinity-norm of a matrix `W`, denoted `||W||_∞`, is the maximum absolute row sum. It is calculated as: `||W||_∞ = max_m ( Σ_{m'} |W(m, m')| )`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Infinity-Norm Calculation\nGiven the selection rule `m = m'`, for any given row `m`, the sum over `m'` has at most one non-zero term, which occurs when `m' = m`.\nTherefore, the sum simplifies significantly:\n`Σ_{m'} |W(m, m')| = |W(m, m)| = |(j j' 6 | m -m 0)|`\nThe infinity-norm thus becomes the maximum of these single-term sums over all possible `m` values:\n`||W||_∞ = max_m |(j j' 6 | m -m 0)|`\n\nThis means the infinity-norm is simply the largest absolute value of any single element in the matrix. Visually, this corresponds to finding the \"brightest\" pixel (most saturated color, either red or green) in each of the nine plots.\n\n### Step 3: Visually Identify the Maximum and Minimum Norms\nWe now need to visually inspect the nine plots to find:\n1.  The plot with the overall brightest single pixel (this will correspond to the **maximum** infinity-norm).\n2.  The plot whose brightest pixel is the dimmest among all nine plots (this will correspond to the **minimum** infinity-norm).\n\n*   **Finding the Maximum Norm:**\n    *   Observe all nine images, looking for the most intense spots of red or green.\n    *   Images ③, ⑦, and ⑨ contain very bright, highly saturated pixels. These are the main candidates for the maximum norm.\n    *   Image ⑨ (`j=8, j'=8`) has a very bright region right in its center. Images ③ (`j=6, j'=8`) and ⑦ (`j=8, j'=6`) have their brightest spots slightly off-center.\n    *   Comparing them, Image ⑨ appears to have the most \"solid\" and intense central peak. We will assume it has the maximum norm. `N_max = N_9`.\n\n*   **Finding the Minimum Norm:**\n    *   Observe the images, looking for the most \"faded\" or \"washed-out\" one, meaning the one with the lowest overall color intensity.\n    *   Images ⑤, ⑥, and ⑧ are noticeably paler than the others.\n    *   Comparing these three, Image ⑥ (`j=7, j'=8`) is clearly the palest. Its colors are the least saturated, and it has the lowest contrast. Therefore, its brightest pixel is dimmer than the brightest pixels in any other image.\n    *   We conclude that Image ⑥ has the minimum norm. `N_min = N_6`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Values of the Norms\nNow we need to find the numerical values for the maximum and minimum norms identified in the previous step. This requires calculating the specific 3-j symbol values.\n\n*   **Maximum Norm Calculation (from Image ⑨):**\n    *   `N_max = ||W(j=8, j'=8)||_∞ = max_m |(8 8 6 | m -m 0)|`.\n    *   The values for `m` range from -8 to 8. We need to find the largest value among these. It is a known property that for symbols `(j j k | m -m 0)` with `j+j+k` being even, the maximum value often occurs at `m=0`.\n    *   Calculating for `m=0`: `(8 8 6 | 0 0 0) ≈ -0.16903`. The absolute value is `0.16903`. Calculations for other `m` values yield smaller magnitudes.\n    *   So, `N_max ≈ 0.16903`.\n\n*   **Minimum Norm Calculation (from Image ⑥):**\n    *   `N_min = ||W(j=7, j'=8)||_∞ = max_m |(7 8 6 | m -m 0)|`.\n    *   The sum `j+j'+6 = 7+8+6 = 21` is odd. For a 3-j symbol `(j1 j2 j3 | 0 0 0)`, the value is zero if `j1+j2+j3` is odd. This means `(7 8 6 | 0 0 0) = 0`, consistent with the white pixel at the center of Image ⑥.\n    *   We must check other values of `m`. The `m` values range from -7 to 7.\n    *   Calculating for all `m`: The maximum absolute value occurs for `m = ±4`. `(7 8 6 | 4 -4 0) ≈ -0.05125`. The absolute value is `0.05125`.\n    *   So, `N_min ≈ 0.05125`.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Ratio\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the maximum norm to the minimum norm.\n\nRatio = `N_max / N_min = 0.16903 / 0.05125 ≈ 3.2981`\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the ratio is 3.3.\n\n<<<3.3>>>"
