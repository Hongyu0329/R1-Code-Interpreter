    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereogenic centers (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A chiral carbon is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. In the given structure, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right as Cα, Cβ, and Cγ for clarity.\n\n*   **Cα:** The leftmost chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the molecule (the Cβ group).\n*   **Cβ:** The middle chiral center is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), the Cα group, the Cγ group, and a hydrogen atom (implied).\n*   **Cγ:** The rightmost chiral center is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), the Cβ group, and a hydrogen atom (implied).\n\n**Step 2: Assign Priorities to the Groups on Each Chiral Center**\n\nWe will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to assign priorities (from 1=highest to 4=lowest) to the four groups attached to each chiral center. Priority is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center. If there's a tie, we proceed to the next atoms along the chains until a point of difference is found.\n\n*   **Priorities for Cα:**\n    1.  **-OH**: The oxygen atom (Z=8) has the highest atomic number. (Priority 1)\n    2.  **-CβH(Et)(Cγ...)**: The carbon atom of the Cβ group is attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen (C, C, H). (Priority 2)\n    3.  **-CH3**: The carbon atom of the methyl group is attached to three hydrogens (H, H, H). (Priority 3)\n    4.  **-H**: Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number. (Priority 4)\n    *Order: -OH > -Cβ group > -CH3 > -H*\n\n*   **Priorities for Cβ:**\n    1.  **-CαH(OH)CH3**: The Cα carbon is attached to an oxygen, a carbon, and a hydrogen (O, C, H). The oxygen gives this group the highest priority among the carbon-based substituents. (Priority 1)\n    2.  **-CγH(CH3)(CH2NH2)**: The Cγ carbon is attached to two carbons and a hydrogen (C, C, H). One of these subsequent carbons is attached to a nitrogen. (Priority 2)\n    3.  **-CH2CH3**: The ethyl group's carbon is attached to one carbon and two hydrogens (C, H, H). (Priority 3)\n    4.  **-H**: (Priority 4)\n    *Order: -Cα group > -Cγ group > -CH2CH3 > -H*\n\n*   **Priorities for Cγ:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen (N, H, H). The nitrogen atom (Z=7) makes this group the highest priority.\n    2.  **-CβH(Et)(Cα...)**: The Cβ carbon is attached to two carbons and a hydrogen (C, C, H). The highest atomic number here is Carbon (Z=6).\n    3.  **-CH3**: The carbon is attached to three hydrogens (H, H, H).\n    4.  **-H**: (Priority 4)\n    *Order: -CH2NH2 > -Cβ group > -CH3 > -H*\n\n**Step 3: Determine the R/S Configuration for Each Chiral Center**\n\nNow we determine the configuration by observing the spatial arrangement of the groups. We mentally orient the molecule so that the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away from us. Then, we observe the direction of the arc from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. A clockwise arc means (R) configuration, and a counter-clockwise arc means (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Configuration of Cα:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The -OH (1) and -CH3 (3) groups are on dashed wedges (pointing away). The bond to Cβ (2) is a plain line going away from the viewer. For the carbon to be tetrahedral, the implied -H (4) must be on a solid wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    *   **Determination:** Since the lowest priority group (-H, 4) is pointing towards us, we determine the direction of 1 -> 2 -> 3 and reverse the result.\n    *   Let's view the molecule with H(4) closest to us. Group 2 (Cβ) is to the right. Groups 1 (OH) and 3 (CH3) are to the left and back. The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) arc.\n    *   Because the H(4) is forward, a counter-clockwise arc signifies an **(R)** configuration.\n\n*   **Configuration of Cβ:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The ethyl group (3) is on a solid wedge (forward). The bonds to Cα (1) and Cγ (2) are plain lines going away from the viewer. The implied -H (4) must therefore be on a dashed wedge (pointing away).\n    *   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is pointing away. We can directly determine the configuration.\n    *   The path from 1 (Cα) -> 2 (Cγ) -> 3 (Ethyl) goes from back-left -> back-right -> front-up. This traces a clockwise (CW) arc.\n    *   A clockwise arc with the lowest priority group in the back signifies an **(R)** configuration.\n\n*   **Configuration of Cγ:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The -CH2NH2 group (1) is on a solid wedge (forward). The -CH3 group (3) is on a dashed wedge (back). The bond to Cβ (2) and the implied -H (4) are in the plane perpendicular to the wedge/dash bonds. From the drawing, the Cβ bond is to the left, so the -H bond must be to the right.\n    *   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is in the plane of the paper. We can mentally rotate the molecule or use an exchange method. Let's look down the Cγ-H bond (from the right side of the molecule).\n    *   From this viewpoint, H(4) is in the back. The -CH2NH2 group (1) is up. The -Cβ group (2) is to the left. The -CH3 group (3) is down.\n    *   The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is up -> left -> down. This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) arc.\n    *   A counter-clockwise arc with the lowest priority group in the back signifies an **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the absolute configurations of the three chiral centers from left to right are R, R, and S. To provide a formal IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-OH). This is a pentan-2-ol derivative. The correct numbering of the chain from left to right aligns Cα, Cβ, Cγ with IUPAC locants 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\nTherefore, the full absolute configuration is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\nFinal answer ordered from left chiral center to right chiral center.\nCα: R\nCβ: R\nCγ: S\n\n<<<R, R, S>>>"
