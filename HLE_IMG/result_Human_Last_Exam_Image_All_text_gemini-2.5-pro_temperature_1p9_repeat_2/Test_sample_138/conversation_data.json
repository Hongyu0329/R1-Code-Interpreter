    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Order Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13 segments) than females (typically 12 segments). In many wasps, male antennae are also curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments and a stinger (a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying tube). Males have 7 visible abdominal segments and lack a stinger. The tip of the male abdomen is often blunter. In some species, like cuckoo bees, the female abdomen is specially shaped for laying eggs in other bees' nests.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (especially the clypeus, the \"upper lip\" area), while females have dark faces.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** In many bee families, only females collect pollen and thus have dense brushes of hair (scopae) for carrying it, usually on the hind legs or the underside of the abdomen. Males lack scopae. The question specifies that the taxa shown lack *leg* scopae, which is a key hint for identification.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Pair A:**\n*   These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are kleptoparasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Because they don't collect pollen to provision their own nests, females lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee exhibits relatively long antennae, a common trait for male bees.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee has a distinctly tapered and sharply pointed abdomen. This is the characteristic shape of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses her pointed abdomen to pierce the nest material of a host bee (like a leafcutter bee) to lay her egg.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n**Pair B:**\n*   These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they do not have scopae for collecting pollen, though adults frequently visit flowers for nectar and act as pollinators.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** This wasp has relatively short, straight antennae. This is typical for a female wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This wasp has noticeably longer antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic identifying feature of a male paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is a Female, and the right insect is a Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Pair C:**\n*   These are hairy bees. The premise that they are from taxa without leg scopae is a crucial clue, suggesting they might be leafcutter bees (family Megachilidae), which carry pollen on hairs on the underside of their abdomen, not their legs. Regardless of the exact species, standard sexing features are visible.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has very long antennae and a prominent patch of light-colored (yellow or white) hair on its face (clypeus). Both are strong indicators that this is a male bee.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae compared to the one on the left. Its face is entirely dark. These features are characteristic of a female of this type of bee. The yellow coloration is pollen, which in this case appears to be gathered on dense hairs.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Male, Female -> **3**\n*   **Pair B:** Female, Male -> **4**\n*   **Pair C:** Male, Female -> **3**\n\nCombining the indices for A, B, and C gives the final answer.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
