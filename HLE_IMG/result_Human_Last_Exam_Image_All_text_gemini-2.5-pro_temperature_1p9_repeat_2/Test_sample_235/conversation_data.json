    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is constructed from words and phrases cut out and pasted onto the image. Reading them in a logical sequence, from top to bottom and left to right, we can assemble a single line or phrase. The words are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". When combined, they form the sentence:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Determine the syllable count of the line.**\nTo analyze the meter, we first need to count the number of syllables in the line.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable (/ruːlz/)\n*   **and**: 1 syllable (/ænd/)\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable (/laɪnz/)\n*   **an**: 1 syllable (/ən/)\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables (/ˈɪn.trɪ.kət/)\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables (/ˈspaɪ.dərz/)\n*   **web**: 1 syllable (/wɛb/)\n*   **work**: 1 syllable (/wɜːrk/)\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables. The line is a hendecasyllabic line (a line of eleven syllables).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on syllable count.**\n*   **A. free verse**: Poetry that does not have a regular meter or rhyme scheme. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: A line of ten syllables (penta-) with an iambic (da-DUM) meter. Our line has 11 syllables. While iambic pentameter can have an 11th unstressed syllable (a feminine ending), we must also check the stress pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: A line of twelve syllables. Our line has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: A specific poetic form. The main line in a Sapphic stanza is hendecasyllabic (11 syllables) with a distinctive meter. This is a strong possibility.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: A line with three metrical feet (tri-), usually about six syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence**: A form invented by Allen Ginsberg consisting of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our line has 11, so this is incorrect.\n\nBased on the syllable count, \"iambic pentameter\" (with a feminine ending) and \"sapphic\" are the most plausible options. Free verse remains a default if no specific meter is found.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stress pattern (scansion) of the line.**\nWe now need to determine the pattern of stressed (–) and unstressed (u) syllables in the line. We read the line with natural speech emphasis:\n\"**RULES** and **LINES**, an **IN**-tri-cate **SPI**-der's **WEB** **WORK**\"\n\nLet's represent this pattern:\n`– u | – u | – u u | – u | – –`\nrules and | lines, an | in-tri-cate | spi-der's | web work\n\nNow let's compare this pattern to the options:\n*   **Iambic Pentameter (u –)**: The pattern would be `u – | u – | u – | u – | u –`. Our line starts with a stressed syllable (`– u`), which is a trochee, not an iamb. Thus, it is not iambic pentameter.\n*   **Sapphic meter**: The Sapphic hendecasyllabic line has a very specific structure: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee/Trochee.\n    *   Trochee: a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one (– u)\n    *   Dactyl: a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed ones (– u u)\n    *   Spondee: two stressed syllables (– –)\n\nLet's map our line to the Sapphic pattern:\n*   `RULES and` -> **Trochee** (– u)\n*   `LINES, an` -> **Trochee** (– u)\n*   `IN-tri-cate` -> **Dactyl** (– u u)\n*   `SPI-der's` -> **Trochee** (– u)\n*   `WEB work` -> **Spondee** (– –)\n\nThe line \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\" fits the classical Sapphic hendecasyllabic meter perfectly. The chance of this happening randomly is extremely low, indicating it was a deliberate choice by the artist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe erasure poem consists of a single 11-syllable line. A detailed analysis of its stress pattern reveals that it precisely matches the meter of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line. Therefore, the metric pattern the words follow is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
