    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure looks the same during a full 360-degree rotation around a central point. The number of times it matches is called the \"order\" or \"fold\" of the symmetry. We are looking for the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components and repeating motifs**\nThe tiling is composed of three types of polygons (tiles):\n*   Large, dark blue, regular hexagons.\n*   Medium-sized, yellow squares.\n*   Smaller, orange rhombuses (a quadrilateral with four equal sides).\n\nThese tiles are arranged in a repeating pattern. A prominent motif is a central blue hexagon surrounded by a ring of six yellow squares and six orange rhombuses, forming a star-like shape.\n\n**Step 3: Find potential centers of rotation and test them**\nWe need to find points in the tiling which can serve as a center of rotation. We'll test the points at the center of the different shapes.\n\n*   **Center of a blue hexagon:**\n    *   Let's pick the center of any blue hexagon. A single regular hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, etc.).\n    *   Now, let's examine the surrounding pattern. The hexagon is bordered by six squares and six rhombuses.\n    *   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° (360° / 6) around the center of the hexagon, the hexagon itself maps onto its original position. Each of the six surrounding squares moves into the position of the next square, and each of the six rhombuses moves into the position of the next rhombus.\n    *   Since the entire tiling is a repetition of this arrangement, a 60° rotation around the center of any hexagon will map the entire pattern onto itself.\n    *   This confirms that the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry** about the centers of the hexagons.\n\n*   **Center of a yellow square:**\n    *   Let's pick the center of any yellow square. A single square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (rotations of 90°).\n    *   Let's test a 90° rotation on the tiling. The square is surrounded by two blue hexagons and two orange rhombuses at its corners. If we rotate by 90°, a position originally occupied by a hexagon would be taken over by a rhombus, and vice-versa. The pattern would not look the same.\n    *   However, if we rotate by 180° (a 2-fold rotation), the opposite hexagons would swap places, and the opposite rhombuses would swap places. The pattern would look identical.\n    *   Therefore, the centers of the squares are points of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Center of an orange rhombus:**\n    *   Similarly to the square, a 180° rotation (2-fold symmetry) around the center of a rhombus will map the pattern onto itself.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall rotational symmetry**\nThe rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the *highest order* of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\n*   We have found points with 6-fold rotational symmetry (at the centers of the hexagons).\n*   We have found points with 2-fold rotational symmetry (at the centers of the squares and rhombuses).\n\nThe highest order we found is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry. It can be rotated by an angle of 360°/6 = 60° around the center of any of the blue hexagons and remain unchanged.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Distinguish between the symmetry of a single tile and the symmetry of the entire arrangement. For example, while the yellow squares have 4-fold symmetry, their arrangement within the tiling only supports 2-fold symmetry.\n*   The rotational symmetry of the entire pattern is determined by the highest order of symmetry found anywhere in the pattern. The existence of lower-order symmetry points does not change this.\n*   The pattern must map perfectly onto itself for a symmetry operation to be valid. This includes both the shapes and colors of the tiles.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
