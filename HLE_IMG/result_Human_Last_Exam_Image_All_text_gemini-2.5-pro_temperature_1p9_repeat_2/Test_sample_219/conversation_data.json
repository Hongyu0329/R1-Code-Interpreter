    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot.\n*   **Y-axis (Electrode Number):** Represents the output from 129 different electrodes (numbered 0 to 128), each recording activity from neurons nearby. Each horizontal line corresponds to a single electrode's recording over time.\n*   **X-axis (Time (s)):** Represents time measured in seconds, from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   **Black Dots:** Each dot represents an action potential, or \"firing,\" detected by an electrode at a specific point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA synchronized burst is a short period where many neurons across the culture fire together. In the raster plot, these appear as dense, vertical columns of black dots, indicating that many electrodes detected high levels of activity at roughly the same time.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph, we can identify four major synchronized bursts.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the Timestamps of Each Burst**\nWe need to estimate the time at which each burst occurs. A reasonable way to do this is to identify the center of the dense vertical activity for each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first burst occurs between 0 and 10 seconds. The activity seems to peak around **t1 = 4 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is located between 10 and 20 seconds. Its center appears to be at approximately **t2 = 17 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is between 30 and 40 seconds. Its densest part is centered around **t3 = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The final burst is near the end of the recording, between 40 and 50 seconds. It is centered around **t4 = 48 s**.\n\nThe identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: 4 s, 17 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between consecutive bursts. We have four bursts, so we can calculate three inter-burst intervals.\n\n*   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and Burst 2):**\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 17 s - 4 s = 13 s\n\n*   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and Burst 3):**\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n\n*   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and Burst 4):**\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\nThe calculated intervals are 13 s, 19 s, and 12 s.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 13 s + 19 s + 12 s = 44 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = 44 s / 3 ≈ 14.667 s\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 14.667... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 4.\n*   The next digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we must round up the last significant digit (4).\n*   Rounding 14.667... to two significant figures gives 15.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Visual Estimation:** The timestamps of the bursts are estimated visually, which introduces some uncertainty. However, small variations in these estimates (e.g., using 3.5s instead of 4s for the first burst) do not change the final answer when rounded to the required precision.\n*   **Definition of Burst Time:** We used the center of the burst as its timestamp. Using the start or end time would shift all timestamps but would likely result in similar intervals.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the required number of significant figures is a crucial final step.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe average inter-burst interval is approximately 14.667 s, which when rounded to two significant figures is 15 s.\n\n<<<15>>>"
