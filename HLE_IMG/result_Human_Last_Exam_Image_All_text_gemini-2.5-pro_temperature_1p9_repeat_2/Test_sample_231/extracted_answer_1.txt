Final Answer structure:
A xanthene core (a tricyclic system with two outer benzene rings and a central six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom) has four hydroxyl groups attached to the outer rings at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8. The central carbon of the xanthene core (C9) is bonded to two substituents: a diethylamino group (-N(CH₂CH₃)₂) and a 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl group.
