    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Tonality**\n*   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). This indicates the key of Ab major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The piece begins and ends with an F minor chord (labeled F-), and the harmony frequently revolves around F minor as the tonic center. Therefore, the key is F minor.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe and Analyze the Melody of the A Section**\n*   **Bar 1:** The notes are C, F, and Eb over an F minor chord. This is a very characteristic opening phrase.\n*   **Bar 2:** The notes are Db and C over an E-7b5 (E half-diminished) chord.\n*   **Bar 3:** The notes are Bb and A over an Eb-6 chord.\n*   **Bar 4:** The note is G over Dbmaj7, and F over G7.\n*   The opening melodic line `C-F-Eb | Db-C | ...` is one of the most recognizable phrases in bebop literature. This melody is the primary identifier for the tune.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression of the A Section**\n*   The progression begins: `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | ...`\n*   The move from the tonic minor chord (Fm) to a half-diminished chord a semitone below (E-7b5) is the harmonic signature of Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\". Many bebop tunes, called contrafacts, were written over these chord changes.\n*   The melody and this initial harmonic movement strongly point to the jazz standard \"Hot House\".\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Tune and Composer**\n*   Based on the iconic melody and the characteristic opening harmony, the tune is \"Hot House\".\n*   The composer of \"Hot House\" is Tadd Dameron. It was famously recorded by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the Bridge (B Section)**\n*   The B section starts on the third line of the music. The chord progression is: `| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n*   It's important to note that the bridge on this particular lead sheet is not the standard bridge for \"Hot House\". The standard \"Hot House\" bridge has a different, more complex progression.\n*   However, in the world of jazz and fake books, variations are common. A different bridge might be used, or this could be from a specific arrangement or a transcription that is not standard.\n*   Despite the non-standard bridge, the A section is so unmistakably \"Hot House\" that it remains the correct identification. The identity of a jazz standard is most often tied to its A section melody.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Handwriting:** The music is handwritten, so chord symbols like `Eb-6` could be interpreted differently, but the melodic context supports the notes played.\n2.  **Chord Variations:** Real Book and Fake Book charts for the same tune can vary significantly in their chord changes. The version presented here is one specific arrangement.\n3.  **Form:** The repeat structure is written a bit unconventionally but indicates a repeating A section before moving to the bridge (AABA form).\n4.  **Bridge Discrepancy:** Do not be thrown off by the bridge not matching the \"standard\" version of the tune. The A-section melody is the definitive clue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the melody and harmony of the A section, the piece is conclusively identified.\n\nThe title is **Hot House** and the composer is **Tadd Dameron**.\n\n<<<Hot House, Tadd Dameron>>>"
