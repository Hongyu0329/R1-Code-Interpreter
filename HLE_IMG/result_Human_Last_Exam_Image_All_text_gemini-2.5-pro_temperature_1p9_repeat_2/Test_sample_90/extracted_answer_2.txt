A: The structure has a 5,6,7-trihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core, substituted on the pyrrole ring by a methyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group. Attached to the core is a 4-aminobutanoyl side chain (-CO(CH2)3NH2).
B: A tricyclic structure composed of the original pyrrolidine and pyrroline rings fused with a seven-membered ring. The seven-membered ring contains the structure -N-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-.
C: N-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
