    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G, where k is the number of available colors.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Graph\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- The set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- By inspecting the connections in the figure, we list the neighbors for each vertex:\n    - N(1) = {2, 5}\n    - N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n    - N(3) = {2, 4, 5}\n    - N(4) = {2, 3, 5}\n    - N(5) = {1, 3, 4}\nThe graph can be viewed as having a central part and a peripheral vertex.\n- The subgraph G' induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} contains the edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This structure is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) from which the edge (2,5) has been removed. This is commonly known as a diamond graph.\n- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. Notice that 2 and 5 are the only pair of vertices in G' that are not connected by an edge.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for Calculation\nWe can compute the chromatic polynomial by first considering the subgraph G' and then extending the coloring to vertex 1. This requires us to know how many ways G' can be colored based on the colors of vertices 2 and 5.\nWe will calculate the number of valid k-colorings of G' under two separate conditions:\n1.  Colorings where vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.\n2.  Colorings where vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.\n\n### Step 3: Coloring the Subgraph G'\nLet's find the number of ways to color G' (the diamond graph on {2,3,4,5}) with k colors. We can count this directly by choosing an order to color the vertices. A good order is 3, 4, 2, 5.\n- Let C(v) denote the color assigned to vertex v.\n- The neighbors of vertex 2 in G' are {3, 4}.\n- The neighbors of vertex 5 in G' are {3, 4}.\n- Vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent.\n\n**Case A: C(2) = C(5)**\nLet's count the number of colorings, N_same(k), where C(2) = C(5).\n1.  Color vertex 3: k choices.\n2.  Color vertex 4: It must be different from C(3). k-1 choices.\n3.  Color vertex 2: It must be different from C(3) and C(4). Since C(3) and C(4) are different, this leaves k-2 choices.\n4.  Color vertex 5: It must be the same color as vertex 2. This choice is valid since vertex 5 has the same neighbors (3 and 4) as vertex 2 in G', and C(2) is already different from C(3) and C(4). So, there is 1 choice.\nNumber of ways for this case: N_same(k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n**Case B: C(2) ≠ C(5)**\nLet's count the number of colorings, N_diff(k), where C(2) ≠ C(5).\n1.  Color vertex 3: k choices.\n2.  Color vertex 4: k-1 choices.\n3.  Color vertex 2: k-2 choices.\n4.  Color vertex 5: It must be different from C(3) and C(4). Additionally, for this case, it must be different from C(2). Since C(2), C(3), and C(4) are all distinct, this leaves k-3 choices for C(5).\nNumber of ways for this case: N_diff(k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3).\n\n### Step 4: Extending the Coloring to the Full Graph G\nNow, we extend these colorings to vertex 1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n- For the N_same(k) colorings where C(2) = C(5), vertex 1 is connected to two vertices sharing the same color. Thus, vertex 1 must avoid this one color. There are k-1 available colors for vertex 1.\nThe total number of colorings in this scenario is: N_same(k) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2).\n\n- For the N_diff(k) colorings where C(2) ≠ C(5), vertex 1 is connected to two vertices with different colors. Thus, vertex 1 must avoid these two colors. There are k-2 available colors for vertex 1.\nThe total number of colorings in this scenario is: N_diff(k) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3).\n\n### Step 5: Final Chromatic Polynomial\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the colorings from both cases.\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\nNow, we simplify this expression. Let's factor out the common terms k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\n\nLet's simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k² - 3k - 2k + 6) = (k-1) + (k² - 5k + 6) = k² - 4k + 5\n\nSubstitute this back into the polynomial expression:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nFinally, we expand this to the standard polynomial form:\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)) * ((k-2)(k² - 4k + 5))\nP(G, k) = (k² - k) * (k³ - 4k² + 5k - 2k² + 8k - 10)\nP(G, k) = (k² - k) * (k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = k²(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10) - k(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 10k²) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ - k⁴ + 13k³ + 6k³ - 10k² - 13k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
