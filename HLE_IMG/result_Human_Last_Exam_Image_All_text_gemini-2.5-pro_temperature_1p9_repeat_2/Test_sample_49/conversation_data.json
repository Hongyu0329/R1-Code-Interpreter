    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency of the filter circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network and a capacitor $C$. The output is the voltage at node $a_0$, taken across the capacitor $C$ to ground. This configuration forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency is determined by the time constant formed by the capacitor $C$ and the Thévenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Cutoff Frequency Definition**\nFor a simple RC low-pass filter, the cutoff angular frequency is $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau$, where the time constant is $\\tau = R_{th}C$. The cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi) = 1 / (2\\pi R_{th}C)$. The problem boils down to finding the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Thévenin Resistance $R_{th}$**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$. According to Thévenin's theorem, we must turn off all independent sources. The input signal `IN` at node $c_0$ is a voltage source referenced to ground. Turning it off means shorting node $c_0$ to ground. Node $b_0$ is already ground. Thus, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, which is now the resistance between node $a_0$ and node $c_0$. Node $a_0$ is the termination of the right rail of the ladder, so we label it as $d_0$. We need to find the resistance $R_{d_0, c_0}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Ladder Network Structure**\nA careful examination of the schematic, including the zoomed-in crops, reveals the following connections:\n*   The ladder is infinite, extending upwards (`c_\\infty`, `d_\\infty`).\n*   All resistors have the same value, $r$.\n*   For any section $n \\ge 1$, node $c_n$ is connected to nodes $c_{n-1}$, $c_{n+1}$, and $d_n$.\n*   For any section $n \\ge 1$, node $d_n$ is connected to nodes $d_{n-1}$, $d_{n+1}$, and $c_n$.\n*   The first stage connects node $c_1$ to $c_0$ and node $d_1$ to $d_0$. There is no horizontal resistor connecting $c_0$ and $d_0$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Correct Structural Interpretation**\nThe structure is not a simple T or Pi ladder. The most reliable analysis method is using nodal analysis (Kirchhoff's Current Law, KCL).\n\n**Step 4: Setting up and Solving Nodal Equations**\nTo find $R_{th} = R_{d_0, c_0}$, we can conceptually inject a current $I$ at node $d_0$ and extract it at node $c_0$, then find the resulting voltage difference $V_{d_0} - V_{c_0}$. Since $c_0$ is grounded, $V_{c_0}=0$, and we need to find $R_{th} = V_{d_0} / I$.\n\nThe KCL equations at any internal node $c_n$ and $d_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$) are:\n(KCL at $c_n$): $\\frac{V_{c_n}-V_{c_{n-1}}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c_n}-V_{d_n}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c_n}-V_{c_{n+1}}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{c_{n-1}} + V_{d_n} + V_{c_{n+1}} - 3V_{c_n} = 0$\n(KCL at $d_n$): $\\frac{V_{d_n}-V_{d_{n-1}}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d_n}-V_{c_n}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d_n}-V_{d_{n+1}}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{d_{n-1}} + V_{c_n} + V_{d_{n+1}} - 3V_{d_n} = 0$\n\nWe define sum and difference voltages: $U_n = V_{c_n} + V_{d_n}$ and $W_n = V_{c_n} - V_{d_n}$. Adding and subtracting the KCL equations leads to two simpler linear recurrence relations:\n1.  $U_{n+1} - 2U_n + U_{n-1} = 0$\n2.  $W_{n+1} - 4W_n + W_{n-1} = 0$\n\nFor an infinite ladder, we need solutions that decay as $n \\to \\infty$.\n1.  The solution for $U_n$ is $U_n = A n + B$. For it to not diverge, $A=0$. Thus $U_n = B$ (constant) for $n \\ge 1$.\n2.  The characteristic equation for $W_n$ is $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, with roots $k = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. For a decaying solution, we must choose the root $|k| < 1$, so $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. The solution is $W_n = W_1 k^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, we apply KCL at the boundary nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$, using the known conditions $V_{c_0}=0$ and the recursion results.\nKCL at $c_1$: $V_{c_0} + V_{d_1} + V_{c_2} - 3V_{c_1} = 0 \\implies V_{d_1} + V_{c_2} - 3V_{c_1} = 0$.\nWe can express $V_{c_2}$ in terms of $V_{c_1}$ and $V_{d_1}$ using $U_2=U_1$ and $W_2=kW_1$. This leads to the relation:\n$V_{d_1} = \\sqrt{3} V_{c_1}$.\n\nNext, we relate the input current $I$ to the voltages.\nCurrent $I$ enters at $d_0$: $I = (V_{d_0} - V_{d_1}) / r$.\nCurrent $I$ leaves at $c_0$: $I = (V_{c_1} - V_{c_0}) / r = V_{c_1} / r$.\n\nFrom the current equations, we get $V_{c_1} = V_{d_0} - V_{d_1}$.\nSubstituting $V_{d_1} = \\sqrt{3} V_{c_1}$ into this gives:\n$V_{c_1} = V_{d_0} - \\sqrt{3} V_{c_1} \\implies V_{d_0} = V_{c_1} (1 + \\sqrt{3})$.\n\nWe want to find $R_{th} = V_{d_0}/I$. We have $V_{d_0}$ in terms of $V_{c_1}$ and also $I$ in terms of $V_{c_1}$.\n$I = V_{c_1}/r$.\nSo, $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{d_0}}{I} = \\frac{V_{c_1}(1+\\sqrt{3})}{V_{c_1}/r} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Final Calculation and Expression**\nThe derivation for $R_{th}$ involves several algebraic steps. Each step must be checked carefully to ensure correctness. The derived Thévenin resistance is $R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer for Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expression. Both forms are correct, but the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ provides a slightly cleaner expression, often preferred in theoretical problems. Let's provide the angular frequency.\n\n<<<1 / (r(1+sqrt(3))C)>>>"
