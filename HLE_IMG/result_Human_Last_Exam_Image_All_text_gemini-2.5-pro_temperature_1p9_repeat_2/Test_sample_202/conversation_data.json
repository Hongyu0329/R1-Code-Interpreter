    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Visual Characteristics:** This specimen is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy appearance. It is covered in small, bubble-like cavities known as vesicles. The rock itself appears to be fine-grained.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a key feature, indicating the rock is volcanic (extrusive igneous) and formed when gas bubbles were trapped in rapidly cooling lava. The reddish color often comes from the oxidation of iron-rich minerals. A vesicular, mafic to intermediate volcanic rock like this is known as scoria.\n    *   **Identification:** **Scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Visual Characteristics:** This rock is very light in color (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is extremely vesicular, giving it a frothy texture. It appears to be very low in density.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The highly vesicular and fine-grained texture again points to an extrusive igneous rock that cooled very quickly from a gas-rich magma. Light-colored igneous rocks are typically felsic (rich in silica). A felsic, highly vesicular volcanic rock with a very low density (often able to float on water) is called pumice.\n    *   **Identification:** **Pumice**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Visual Characteristics:** This rock is composed of many distinct fragments, or clasts, of various colors and sizes. These clasts are notably angular and are cemented together in a lighter-colored, fine-grained matrix.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A rock made up of cemented-together fragments is a clastic rock. Because the fragments are angular rather than rounded, the rock is classified as a breccia. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. The angularity suggests the pieces did not travel far from their source before being consolidated into rock.\n    *   **Identification:** **Breccia**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Visual Characteristics:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. There are crystals of different colors, including white, pinkish-gray, and dark specks.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture, with large, interlocking crystals, indicates the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. This makes it an intrusive igneous rock. The mix of light-colored minerals (like feldspar and quartz) and dark minerals (like biotite or hornblende) is characteristic of granite.\n    *   **Identification:** **Granite**.\n\n**Final Identifications**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
