    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Style of the Painting**\nThe painting depicts a room that seamlessly merges with multiple, disparate outdoor environments. The rendering is highly detailed and realistic, but the subject matter is fantastical and dream-like. This combination of realistic execution and illogical, imaginative content is a hallmark of Surrealism.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Elements in the Composition**\nThe scene is packed with symbolic and unusual elements that help in its identification:\n*   **The Room:** An ordinary room with wooden floors, a fireplace, and a bookshelf.\n*   **The Left \"Wall\":** It's completely open to an outdoor scene with a large, bare tree, a hot air balloon, and a vast, fissured landscape that resembles a frozen sea or a field of white fabric.\n*   **The Right Doorway:** This opens to a stormy sea with a large ship. The water from the sea flows into the room, creating a shoreline on the floorboards.\n*   **The Fireplace:** Instead of wood, books are being burned in the fireplace. More books are on the floor, being read by a girl.\n*   **The Central Doorway:** A large bust with green leaves for hair peeks from this doorway, behind which is a nighttime city scene.\n*   **The Figures:** Two young, slender figures are in the room. One stands looking out at the barren landscape, while the other sits on the floor, absorbed in reading.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Style and Elements to an Artist**\nThe specific style, featuring meticulously detailed worlds-within-worlds and architectural fantasies, is highly characteristic of a particular artist. The fusion of domestic interiors with vast, impossible landscapes is a recurring theme in this artist's work. By searching for \"surrealist painting room with ocean flowing in\" or \"surrealist artist painting fantasy rooms,\" we can narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Step 4: Final Identification**\nThese distinctive features strongly point to the Polish surrealist painter **Jacek Yerka**. This specific painting is one of his most famous works, commonly known as \"Eruption\" or \"Living Room\". His art is celebrated for creating these kinds of intricate, mind-bending visual paradoxes.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
