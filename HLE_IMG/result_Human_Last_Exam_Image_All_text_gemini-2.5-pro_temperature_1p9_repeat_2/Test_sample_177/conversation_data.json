    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in total Car VMT when moving from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario. The formula for percentage reduction is:\n    `( (Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT ) * 100%`\n\n2.  **Define Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** VMT is the total mileage traveled by vehicles. In this problem, it specifically refers to cars. For each trip distance category, the VMT contribution is determined by the number of car trips multiplied by the average trip length. We can calculate a proportional VMT index without knowing the absolute total number of trips, as this constant will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\n3.  **Formulate the VMT Index Calculation:**\n    The VMT index is a weighted sum over all distance categories.\n    `VMT Index = Σ [ (Share of Total Trips) × (Share of Car Trips) × (Average Trip Distance) ]`\n    We need to calculate this index for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n4.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Car VMT:** We must only consider trips made by car. This means summing the shares for 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n    *   **Vehicle, not Person:** The question asks for *Vehicle* Miles Traveled, not Person Miles Traveled. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed for this calculation, as a car with multiple occupants still counts as a single vehicle trip.\n    *   **Weighting:** The total VMT is a sum of the VMT from four different distance categories, each with a different share of total trips and a different average mileage. We must calculate the VMT for each category separately before summing them.\n\n### **Calculation for Baseline Car VMT (Table 1)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Baseline scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles:** Car share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** Car share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** Car share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** Car share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT index for the Baseline scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** `0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (miles) = 0.2544`\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** `0.22 (share of trips) * 0.81 (car share) * 4 (miles) = 0.7128`\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** `0.14 (share of trips) * 0.85 (car share) * 7.5 (miles) = 0.8925`\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** `0.16 (share of trips) * 0.89 (car share) * 20 (miles) = 2.8480`\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index** = `0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n### **Calculation for Proposed Car VMT (Table 2)**\n\nNext, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Proposed scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles:** Car share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** Car share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** Car share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** Car share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT index for the Proposed scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** `0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (miles) = 0.0144`\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** `0.22 (share of trips) * 0.27 (car share) * 4 (miles) = 0.2376`\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** `0.14 (share of trips) * 0.41 (car share) * 7.5 (miles) = 0.4305`\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** `0.16 (share of trips) * 0.49 (car share) * 20 (miles) = 1.5680`\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index** = `0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n### **Final Calculation of Percentage Reduction**\n\n1.  **VMT Reduction (Index):** `Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n2.  **Percentage Reduction:** `(VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) * 100%`\n    `= (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100%`\n    `≈ 0.52195 * 100%`\n    `≈ 52.2%`\n\nBy changing the mode share composition, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
