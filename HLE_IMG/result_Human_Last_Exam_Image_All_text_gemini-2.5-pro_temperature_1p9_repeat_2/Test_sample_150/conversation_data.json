    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺). This electrophile then attacks the electron-rich benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** A phenyl group attached to a propanoyl group (C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position. The FeBr₃ catalyst polarizes the Br₂ molecule to generate the Br⁺ electrophile.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is added to the meta position of the phenyl ring. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** A propanoyl group attached to a phenyl ring that is substituted with a bromine atom at the meta (position 3) position.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a Palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. In the case of aryl ketones (a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation (e.g., with H₂/Pd-C) is a common method to reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This is a standard procedure that complements Friedel-Crafts acylation to produce alkylbenzenes.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone group is reduced to a CH₂ group, forming an alkyl chain. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure:** A propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to a phenyl ring that is substituted with a bromine atom at the meta position.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) solvent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical halogenation. NBS is a specific reagent used to brominate at the allylic or **benzylic** position. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator to start the reaction. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is particularly reactive because the radical intermediate formed is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Final Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure:** A (3-bromophenyl) group is attached to a propane chain at position 1. This same carbon atom (position 1) is also attached to a bromine atom.\n    *   **Name:** The final product is named **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
