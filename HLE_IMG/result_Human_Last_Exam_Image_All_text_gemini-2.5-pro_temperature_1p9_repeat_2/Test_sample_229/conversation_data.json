    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song's details:\n\n**1. Analyze the Musical Style:**\n*   **Tempo and Style Marking:** At the very top left of the sheet music, the marking \"MOD. BOSSA\" is visible. \"BOSSA\" is short for Bossa Nova. \"MOD.\" is likely \"Moderato,\" indicating a medium tempo. This is a primary clue.\n*   **Rhythm:** The melody consists heavily of syncopated eighth notes and ties. This syncopation, especially against a steady underlying pulse (implied by the style), is a hallmark of Bossa Nova.\n*   **Harmony:** The chords used (C, E7, F, C-, D-, G7, Am) are typical of the harmonic language of Bossa Nova, which draws from both Brazilian samba and American cool jazz. The use of dominant seventh chords (E7, G7), minor chords (C-, D-, A-), and major chords creates the characteristic \"Saudade\" (longing) feel.\n*   **Conclusion on Style:** Based on the explicit marking, rhythm, and harmony, the musical style is **Bossa Nova**.\n\n**2. Determine the Country of Origin:**\n*   Bossa Nova is a musical genre that originated and was popularized in **Brazil** in the late 1950s and 1960s. Composers like Antônio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, and João Gilberto were the primary architects of the style.\n*   Therefore, the country of origin associated with this style of music is **Brazil**.\n\n**3. Identify the Song Title:**\n*   This requires analyzing the melody, as the title is not clearly written on the sheet music.\n*   The main theme begins on the second line of the music. The pickup notes are F# and G.\n*   The melody in the very first full measure of the main theme is crucial. The notes are: **A - G - A - C - B - A - G**.\n*   This specific melodic phrase is the highly recognizable opening line of the famous Bossa Nova song **\"Água de Beber\"** (translated as \"Water to Drink\"), composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim with lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes.\n*   **Careful Point/Discrepancy:** It's important to note that while this opening bar is a direct match, the subsequent bars in this handwritten chart feature chords and melodic notes that differ significantly from standard published versions of \"Água de Beber\". For example, the second bar's harmony (C minor) and melody are not typical. This suggests that the sheet music is a unique or personalized arrangement, a reharmonization, or possibly a practice etude based on the song's main theme. However, the opening melodic phrase is so iconic and identical that \"Água de Beber\" is the most logical identification.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nCombining these points, the analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n\n*   **Title:** Água de Beber\n*   **Musical Style:** Bossa Nova\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: Água de Beber, Musical Style: Bossa Nova, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
