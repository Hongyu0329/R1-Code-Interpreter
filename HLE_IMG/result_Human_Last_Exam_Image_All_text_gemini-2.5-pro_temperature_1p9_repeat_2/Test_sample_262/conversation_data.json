    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four given iridium complexes, used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. A shorter lifetime implies lower chemical stability of the complex under the operating conditions of the LEC.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) coordination compounds with a general structure [Ir(C^N)₂2(N^N)]⁺[PF₆]⁻.\n*   **Central Metal Ion:** Iridium (Ir) in the +3 oxidation state. This is constant for all four complexes.\n*   **Counterion:** Hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻). This is constant for all four complexes.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** This is the bidentate nitrogen-donating ligand. In all four complexes, it is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The bulky tert-butyl groups mainly improve solubility and prevent intermolecular quenching. Since this ligand is identical in all four complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their relative stability.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligand (C^N):** This is the bidentate ligand that binds to the iridium center through one carbon atom and one nitrogen atom. The variation in this ligand among the four complexes is the key to answering the question. The stability of the complex is strongly dependent on the properties of this ligand.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has no fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability and Lifetime**\nThe operational lifetime of these iridium emitters is often limited by their chemical degradation. A major degradation pathway involves the cleavage of the cyclometalating Ir-C bond, which is typically the weakest bond in the coordination sphere. The strength of this bond can be modulated by introducing substituents onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand.\n\n*   **Role of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom and acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group via the sigma inductive effect.\n*   **Effect on Bond Strength:** Placing electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring pulls electron density away from the ring and from the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This increases the covalent character and strength of the Ir-C bond.\n*   **Conclusion on Stability:** A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a more robust and chemically stable complex. A more stable complex is less prone to degradation during device operation, resulting in a longer lifetime. Therefore, the stability and lifetime of the complexes are expected to increase with the degree of fluorination of the C^N ligand.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Complexes by Expected Lifetime**\nWe can rank the complexes based on the number of fluorine atoms on their C^N ligands.\n*   **Complex 2 (ppy):** 0 fluorine atoms. This complex is expected to have the weakest Ir-C bond among the four. Consequently, it should be the least stable and exhibit the shortest lifetime.\n*   **Complex 3 (2-F-ppy):** 1 fluorine atom. The single fluorine atom strengthens the Ir-C bond relative to Complex 2. Its lifetime should be longer than that of Complex 2, but shorter than the complexes with two fluorine atoms.\n*   **Complex 1 (2,4-dfppy) & Complex 4 (3,5-dfppy):** Both have 2 fluorine atoms. These complexes are expected to have the strongest Ir-C bonds and be the most stable. They should exhibit the longest lifetimes among the four. The relative stability between Complex 1 and 4 is high for both, and they are certainly more stable than Complexes 2 and 3.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Complexes with \"Shorter Lifetimes\"**\nThe question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". This is a relative comparison within the given set. Based on the ranking above, Complexes 2 and 3 are significantly less stable (and thus have shorter lifetimes) than Complexes 1 and 4.\n*   Shortest Lifetime: Complex 2\n*   Second Shortest Lifetime: Complex 3\n*   Longest Lifetimes: Complexes 1 and 4\n\nTherefore, the group of complexes with shorter lifetimes is {Complex 2, Complex 3}.\n\n**Step 6: Match with Answer Choices**\nThe choice that corresponds to the set containing Complex 2 and Complex 3 is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
