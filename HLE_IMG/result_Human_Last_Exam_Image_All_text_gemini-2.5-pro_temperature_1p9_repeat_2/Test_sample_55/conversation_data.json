    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in the circled measure:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor. The key signature has one flat (B♭), which corresponds to the keys of F major or D minor. Given the title and the harmonic content of the opening measures, the home key is D minor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measure and the Notes:** The question asks for the circled notes in measure 8. We must identify all the notes sounding at that specific beat.\n    *   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes are D (on the fourth line) and B-natural (on the middle line). The natural sign on the B is important as it cancels the B-flat from the key signature.\n    *   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The notes are G-sharp (on the top line, with a sharp accidental) and E (in the third space).\n\n3.  **Combine and Spell the Chord:** Combining all the notes gives us E, G♯, B, and D. To identify the chord, we stack these notes in thirds starting from the root.\n    *   Root: E\n    *   Third: G♯ (a major third above E)\n    *   Fifth: B (a perfect fifth above E)\n    *   Seventh: D (a minor seventh above E)\n    This spelling (root, major third, perfect fifth, minor seventh) forms a dominant seventh chord. The chord is E dominant 7th, or E7.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chord's Function (Roman Numeral Analysis):** Now, we relate this E7 chord to our home key of D minor.\n    *   In D minor, the tonic (i) is D minor.\n    *   The dominant (V) is A major. The dominant chord is often made major by raising the leading tone (C to C♯), which creates a stronger pull back to the tonic.\n    *   The E7 chord is not diatonic (naturally occurring) in the key of D minor. A chord built on the second scale degree (E) would typically be a diminished chord (E-G-B♭).\n    *   However, the E7 chord is the dominant (V7) of the key of A. Since the A major chord is the dominant (V) of D minor, the E7 chord is functioning as the \"dominant of the dominant.\" This is called a **secondary dominant**.\n\n5.  **Write the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   A secondary dominant is notated as \"V of...\" or \"V/...\"\n    *   In this case, it is the V7 chord of the V chord.\n    *   Therefore, the Roman numeral is written as **V7/V**.\n\n6.  **Confirm with Musical Context:** The chord in the following measure (measure 9) is an A major chord (notes are A-C♯-E). The E7 (V7/V) chord in measure 8 resolves perfectly to the A major (V) chord in measure 9, confirming its function as a secondary dominant.\n\n7.  **Check for Inversion:** The lowest note sounding in the chord is E, which is the root of the E7 chord. This means the chord is in root position, so no inversion figures are needed for the Roman numeral.\n\n<<<V7/V>>>"
