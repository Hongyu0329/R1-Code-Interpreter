    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the subject of the image.**\nThe image displays three micrographs, labeled L, M, and N. Each micrograph shows a long, thin, tube-like structure. This structure is segmented by cross-walls, which are clearly visible as transverse lines. These features are characteristic of a hypha, the filamentous structure of a fungus, or a similar filamentous organism. The inside of the structure contains granular material, which is the cytoplasm.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the changes across the panels L, M, and N.**\nThe letters L, M, and N likely represent a time sequence or different stages of a single biological process. Let's examine what changes are occurring, paying close attention to the areas indicated by the black arrowheads.\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively straight hypha. The arrowhead points to a specific location on the side of a cell, near a septum (cross-wall). At this stage, there is no significant structural change at the indicated point.\n*   **Panel M:** The hypha has started to curve. The arrowhead now points to a distinct, small, rounded outgrowth or bulge on the side of the hypha. This bulge is forming at the same relative position as indicated in panel L. This suggests the initiation of a new structure.\n*   **Panel N:** The curvature of the hypha is more pronounced. The outgrowth pointed to by the arrowhead has elongated significantly compared to panel M. It has developed into a new, smaller filament extending from the side of the original one. This is clearly a new branch.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the observations to identify the process.**\nThe sequence from L to M to N demonstrates the formation of a new lateral (side) structure from an existing filament. This process begins with the formation of a small bulge which then elongates to form a new filament. This method of growth, where a new hypha emerges from the side of an existing one, is known as **hyphal branching**.\n\n**Step 4: List careful points to consider.**\n*   **Filamentous and Septate Nature:** The structure is a filament divided into cells by septa. This is key to identifying it as likely being a fungal hypha.\n*   **Role of the Arrowheads:** The arrowheads are crucial for drawing attention to the site of action. They consistently point to the origin of the new growth.\n*   **Progressive Change:** The change from no bulge (L), to a small bulge (M), to an elongated branch (N) is progressive and clearly shows a developmental process.\n*   **Mode of Growth:** This is a form of vegetative growth, allowing the organism to spread and form a network of filaments (a mycelium). It is distinct from apical growth (elongation at the tip) and from sexual or asexual spore formation, which involve different specialized structures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the visual evidence of a new filament growing out from the side of an existing septate filament, the process depicted is hyphal branching.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
