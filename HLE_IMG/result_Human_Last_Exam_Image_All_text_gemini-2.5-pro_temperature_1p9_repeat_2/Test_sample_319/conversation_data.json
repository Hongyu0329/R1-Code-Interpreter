    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Clues**\n\nThe question provides several key pieces of information about the phenomenon in question:\n*   It is an **illusion**.\n*   It is compared to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. This comparison suggests that the brain is presented with a stimulus that can be interpreted in more than one way, and it settles on one stable perception (or alternates between them). In the context of continuity, the brain can perceive a sound as stopping and restarting, or as continuing behind an interruption. It almost always chooses the latter.\n*   It reveals a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, **perceptual ability**\". This points to a fundamental process of perception that happens automatically, often without our awareness, such as our ability to understand speech in a noisy environment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Visual Information**\n\nThe image consists of two plots representing a sound signal over time.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This shows the frequency content of the sound over time.\n    *   It begins with a single, stable horizontal line, indicating a **pure tone** of a constant frequency.\n    *   There is a brief vertical line/smear. This represents a sound that has energy across a wide range of frequencies, which is characteristic of a **burst of noise** (like static or a cough).\n    *   After the noise burst, the sound continues. Crucially, the original tone is physically absent during the noise burst.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time.\n    *   It starts as a regular, repeating sine wave, which is the waveform of a **pure tone**.\n    *   There is a brief, chaotic-looking section corresponding to the **noise burst**.\n    *   The waveform continues after the burst, becoming more complex than the initial sine wave, consistent with the spectrogram showing multiple frequencies after the interruption.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues**\n\nCombining the textual and visual analysis, we are looking for the name of an auditory illusion where a tone (or other sound) that is interrupted by a burst of noise is perceived by the listener as being continuous. The listener's brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, perceiving it as continuing \"behind\" the noise.\n\nThis \"filling-in\" is the \"unconscious perceptual ability\" mentioned. The brain prefers the interpretation of a single, continuous auditory object being momentarily occluded over the interpretation of one object stopping and a new one starting. This preference for continuity and perceptual grouping is a principle of Gestalt psychology, similar to how the brain resolves the ambiguity of the 2D lines of a Necker Cube into a coherent 3D object.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Phenomenon**\n\nThis specific and well-documented auditory illusion is known as the **Auditory continuity illusion**.\n\n*   It was extensively studied by researchers like Richard M. Warren.\n*   A famous variant, which specifically deals with filling in missing speech sounds (phonemes), is called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n*   The general principle, applying to tones and other non-speech sounds as depicted in the image, is the Auditory continuity illusion.\n\nThe image is a classic visual representation of the stimulus used to demonstrate this effect. The phenomenon itself is the listener's perceptual experience, not the physical sound wave.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
