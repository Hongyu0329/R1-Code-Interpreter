    "This is an analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks shown in the image grid, ordered from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** This is a Chinese ink and color painting depicting women in ethnic minority costumes. The style is characterized by dynamic lines and realistic figures. The signature and seal are in the upper right. This is a classic work by **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**, who was famous for his depictions of the lives of China's ethnic minorities and his masterful, energetic brushwork.\n2.  **Artwork 2 (Top Middle):** This is a black ink sketch of a village landscape. The style is abstract with strong, expressive lines representing buildings and trees. This fusion of Chinese ink tradition with Western modernist abstraction is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. This work is one of his many landscape sketches.\n3.  **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very energetic and unrestrained cursive script (known as \"wild cursive\" or 狂草). The style is highly recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. The text is from one of his poems.\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy. The characters are elegant, well-structured, and slender, written in a flowing semi-cursive script. There are seals on the left, and the calligraphic style is the distinct and famous style of **Qi Gong (启功)**, a renowned 20th-century calligrapher and scholar.\n5.  **Artwork 5 (Middle Center):** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman in a white T-shirt, holding a sketchbook and pencil. This is one of the most famous works of modern Chinese art, titled \"Youth\" (青春). The artist is **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a master of the Chinese realist school of oil painting.\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** This painting shows a woman in stylized traditional attire with an elaborate hairdo. The style combines traditional Chinese ink painting techniques with modern Western influences, featuring elongated forms, rich colors, and a slightly melancholic atmosphere. These are all hallmarks of the artist **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**.\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This is a colorful painting of a rural scene featuring a trellis with hanging loofah gourds and laundry. The work uses bright colors, flattened planes, and decorative patterns, creating a vibrant, semi-abstract composition. This is another work by **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, showcasing his distinct style in depicting rural landscapes and scenes from everyday life.\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a powerful landscape painting (山水画) of a river gorge with boats. The mountains are rendered with bold, textured \"axe-cut\" brushstrokes (斧劈皴) and enveloped in mist, creating a sense of majesty and atmosphere. This iconic style and subject matter are characteristic of the great 20th-century landscape painter **Fu Baoshi (傅抱石)**.\n9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The artwork is simple but masterfully captures the creature's essence with economical yet powerful brushstrokes. The translucent quality of the body and the energetic lines of the antennae are trademarks of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, who is arguably the most famous modern painter of \"small life\" subjects like shrimp, crabs, and insects.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Order:** The question asks for the authors from left to right, top to bottom.\n*   **Identification:** Each identification relies on recognizing the unique and famous style of a major figure in modern Chinese art.\n*   **Artwork 1 (Huang Zhou):** Known for dynamic figures of ethnic minorities.\n*   **Artwork 2 (Wu Guanzhong):** Known for abstracting landscapes with strong linear elements.\n*   **Artwork 3 (Mao Zedong):** Known for his distinctive \"wild cursive\" calligraphy.\n*   **Artwork 4 (Qi Gong):** Known for his slender, elegant, and scholarly style of calligraphy.\n*   **Artwork 5 (Jin Shangyi):** A leading figure in modern Chinese realism; this is his iconic painting \"Youth\".\n*   **Artwork 6 (Lin Fengmian):** Known for blending Chinese and Western styles, especially in his paintings of elegant, melancholic women.\n*   **Artwork 7 (Wu Guanzhong):** Shows his other main style—colorful, decorative, semi-abstract depictions of rural life.\n*   **Artwork 8 (Fu Baoshi):** Famous for his monumental landscapes and unique \"axe-cut\" texture strokes.\n*   **Artwork 9 (Qi Baishi):** The undisputed master of painting subjects like shrimp and lobsters with simplicity and vitality.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors for each of the 9 works are determined.\n\n<<<1. Huang Zhou, 2. Wu Guanzhong, 3. Mao Zedong, 4. Qi Gong, 5. Jin Shangyi, 6. Lin Fengmian, 7. Wu Guanzhong, 8. Fu Baoshi, 9. Qi Baishi>>>"
