    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction:**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. Its complex and strained ring structure identifies it as belonging to the friedelane family, specifically **friedelan-3β-ol**.\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 °C. These are the conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration, which typically proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. The high temperature favors elimination and complex rearrangements to form a more stable product.\n*   **Product:** The product shown is a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₃₀H₅₀, which is consistent with the loss of one molecule of water (H₂O) from the reactant (C₃₀H₅₂O). The product's skeleton is that of the oleanane family, with a double bond between carbons C-12 and C-13. This overall transformation is a well-known process in natural product chemistry called the **Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement**.\n\n**2. Trace the Rearrangement Mechanism:**\nThe mechanism involves a cascade of [1,2]-shifts (migration of a group to an adjacent atom). This \"zipper-like\" reaction relieves the significant strain in the friedelane skeleton and leads to the more stable oleanane skeleton. The driving force is the formation of progressively more stable carbocations, culminating in the formation of a very stable final alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the initial carbocation.** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This leaves as water, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n*   **Step 2: Cascade of [1,2]-shifts.** The carbocation triggers a sequence of shifts to move the positive charge across the molecular backbone towards the C/D ring system. Let's track the groups that migrate and the final occupants of the key carbon positions.\n\n    We will denote the original methyl groups and hydrogens with their carbon numbers.\n    1.  **C-3(+)** is formed.\n    2.  A methyl group from **C-4** migrates to C-3. The cation is now at C-4 (tertiary, more stable).\n    3.  The hydrogen from **C-5** migrates to C-4. The cation moves to C-5 (tertiary).\n    4.  The methyl group from **C-10** migrates to C-5. The cation moves to C-10 (tertiary).\n    5.  The hydrogen from **C-9** migrates to C-10. The cation moves to C-9 (tertiary).\n    6.  The methyl group from **C-8** migrates to C-9. The cation moves to C-8 (tertiary).\n    7.  The methyl group from **C-14** migrates to C-8. The cation moves to C-14 (tertiary).\n    8.  The hydrogen from **C-13** migrates to C-14. The cation moves to C-13 (tertiary).\n\n*   **Step 3: Elimination.** The final carbocation at C-13 is stabilized by the elimination of a proton from the adjacent C-12, forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13, as shown in the product.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Substituents:**\nNow, we determine which group (H or CH₃) ends up at each key position after the rearrangement.\n\n*   **At C-4:** Started with two CH₃ groups. It loses one CH₃ (to C-3) and gains one H (from C-5). **Final state: one CH₃ and one H.**\n*   **At C-5:** Started with one H. It loses its H (to C-4) and gains one CH₃ (from C-10). **Final state: one CH₃.**\n*   **At C-10:** Started with one CH₃. It loses its CH₃ (to C-5) and gains one H (from C-9). **Final state: one H.**\n*   **At C-9:** Started with one H. It loses its H (to C-10) and gains one CH₃ (from C-8). **Final state: one CH₃.**\n*   **At C-8:** Started with one CH₃. It loses its CH₃ (to C-9) and gains one CH₃ (from C-14). **Final state: one CH₃.**\n\n**4. Map the Labels to the Final Substituents:**\nWe must map the numbered labels in the product drawing to the correct carbon positions and determine the identity of the substituent at that position. Although the drawing of the product skeleton contains some schematic simplifications (e.g., it incorrectly shows a gem-dimethyl group at C-4, which would not be the case after this rearrangement), the problem intends for us to deduce the correct substituents from the mechanism.\n\n*   **Label 1:** This points to a substituent on C-4. After the rearrangement, C-4 has one CH₃ and one H. The label most likely refers to the methyl group that remained. Therefore, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Label 2:** This points to the substituent on C-10. After the rearrangement, C-10 has a hydrogen atom. Therefore, **2 = H**.\n*   **Label 3:** This points to the substituent on C-5. After the rearrangement, C-5 has a methyl group. Therefore, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Label 4:** This points to the substituent on C-8. C-8 ends up with a methyl group (the one that migrated from C-14). Therefore, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Label 5:** This points to the substituent on C-9. After the rearrangement, C-9 has a methyl group (the one that migrated from C-8). Therefore, **5 = CH₃**.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Position 1 (at C-4): Starts with 2xCH₃, ends with 1xCH₃ and 1xH. -> CH₃\n*   Position 2 (at C-10): Starts with CH₃, ends with H. -> H\n*   Position 3 (at C-5): Starts with H, ends with CH₃. -> CH₃\n*   Position 4 (at C-8): Starts with CH₃, ends with a different CH₃. -> CH₃\n*   Position 5 (at C-9): Starts with H, ends with CH₃. -> CH₃\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
