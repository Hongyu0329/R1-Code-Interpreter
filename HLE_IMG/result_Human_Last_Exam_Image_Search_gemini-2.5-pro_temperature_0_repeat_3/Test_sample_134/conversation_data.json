    "The molecule shown is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nIt is a recently synthesized allotrope of carbon with the molecular formula C₁₈. This molecule consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds. This specific bonding arrangement is known as a polyynic structure.\n\nThe existence of cyclocarbons, which are rings of two-coordinate carbon atoms, had been a subject of fascination for chemists for many years due to their high reactivity. Cyclocarbon was the smallest of these rings predicted to be relatively stable.\n\nIn 2019, a team of scientists from IBM and the University of Oxford successfully generated and imaged cyclocarbon for the first time. They accomplished this by manipulating a larger precursor molecule (C₂₄O₆) on a sodium chloride surface at extremely low temperatures (5 Kelvin). High-resolution atomic force microscopy confirmed its structure of alternating single and triple bonds, ruling out an alternative cumulenic structure with equalized double bonds. The formal IUPAC name for this molecule is cyclooctadeca-1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17-nonayne.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
