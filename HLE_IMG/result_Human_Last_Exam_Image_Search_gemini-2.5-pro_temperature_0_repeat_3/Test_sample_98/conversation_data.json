    "This medallion is from the 1st century A.D.\n\nThe artifact is a gold belt medallion discovered at the archaeological site of Tillya Tepe in Afghanistan. It was found in Tomb IV, which belonged to a male warrior. The site of Tillya Tepe, also known as the \"Hill of Gold,\" contained six burial mounds with about 20,600 artifacts made of gold, silver, and ivory.\n\nThe dating of the burials to the 1st century A.D. is supported by coins found at the site, including one of the Roman Emperor Tiberius minted between 16 and 21 A.D. and others of the Yuezhi ruler Sapadbizes (20 B.C. - 20 A.D.). No coins dated later than the early 1st century A.D. were found, suggesting this period for the burials. The collection of artifacts, often referred to as the Bactrian Gold, displays a mix of cultural influences, including Greek, Roman, Scythian, Indian, and Chinese.\n\n<<<1st century A.D.>>>"
