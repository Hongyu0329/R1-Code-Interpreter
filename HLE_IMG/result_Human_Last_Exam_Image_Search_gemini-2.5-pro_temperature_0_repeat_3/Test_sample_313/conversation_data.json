    "The two clues point to the idiom \"Carrot and stick.\"\n\nThe first clue describes a \"carrot\" in the metaphorical sense of a reward. The image provided shows the Puerto Rican singer Yandel receiving an award. This event took place on June 20, 2019, at the 34th annual ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in Los Angeles. An award is a form of incentive or reward, often referred to as a \"carrot.\"\n\nThe second clue refers to a historical process known as \"carroting\". This technique was used in the manufacturing of felt hats from the 17th to the 20th century and involved treating animal fur with a solution of mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate. The process was named \"carroting\" because the mercury solution would turn the fur an orange color, similar to a carrot. Due to the high toxicity of mercury and the resulting health problems for hat makers (leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\"), this process has been discontinued.\n\nThus, \"X Y\" represents the two parts of the idiom \"carrot and stick,\" which describes a policy of offering a combination of rewards (\"carrot\") and punishments (\"stick\") to induce a desired behavior.\n\n<<<Carrot and stick>>>"
