    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. Based on its distinctive scale pattern, it is a Pineapplefish. Its scientific name is *Cleidopus gloriamaris*.\n\nThis fish is known for its yellow to whitish scales that have black rear margins, creating a striking pattern similar to a pineapple. It is also referred to as the Knightfish or the coat-of-mail fish because of its armor-like scales. The name *gloriamaris* is Latin for \"glory of the sea\".\n\nThe Pineapplefish is the only member of its genus, *Cleidopus*. It is native to the waters near Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia. This species can be distinguished from the similar Japanese Pineapplefish by its more rounded snout. Another fish with a somewhat similar hexagonal pattern is the Honeycomb Cowfish (*Acanthostracion polygonius*), but the specific pattern and coloration in the image are a clear match for the Pineapplefish.\n\n<<<*Cleidopus gloriamaris*>>>"
