    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type:** The first reactant is a substituted cyclobutene: 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene. The stereochemistry at the C4 position is specified, with the methyl group (Me) on a wedge and the methoxy group (OMe) on a dash. The reaction is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening.\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For a thermal 4π electron process, the ring opening is **conrotatory**. This means the substituents on the breaking C3-C4 sigma bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate Dienes:** The conrotatory opening of the chiral starting material can proceed in two ways, leading to two different diastereomeric dienes. The breaking of the C3-C4 bond and rearrangement of the π system results in a conjugated diene of the structure `(Me,OMe)C=C(OMe)-CH=CH2`. The stereochemistry of the C1=C2 double bond in this diene depends on the direction of rotation.\n    *   **Rotation Mode 1 (e.g., outward rotation of the bulkier Me group):** This leads to the formation of the (E)-diene, where the methyl group is *trans* to the main diene chain. Let's call this **Diene E'**.\n    *   **Rotation Mode 2 (e.g., inward rotation of the Me group):** This leads to the formation of the (Z)-diene, where the methyl group is *cis* to the main diene chain. Let's call this **Diene Z'**.\n\nSince both conrotatory pathways are possible, a mixture of the two diastereomeric dienes (E' and Z') will be formed as intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The dienes formed in Step 1 react with ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`), which is the dienophile. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The problem specifies that the reaction proceeds in an *endo* fashion.\n2.  **Determine Regiochemistry:** The diene is electron-rich due to the methoxy groups, while the dienophile is electron-poor. The C2-methoxy group strongly activates the C4 position of the diene, making it the most nucleophilic center (highest HOMO coefficient). The Cβ of the ethyl acrylate (`CH2`) is the most electrophilic center (largest LUMO coefficient). The major regioisomer results from the formation of a bond between C4 of the diene and Cβ of the dienophile. This places the ester group (`CO2Et`) on the carbon atom adjacent to the quaternary center in the product. This corresponds to the structures shown in options A, B, C, and D.\n3.  **Determine Stereochemistry from Endo Addition:** The *endo* rule states that the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (`CO2Et`) is oriented towards the π-system of the diene in the transition state. This places it on the same side as the \"inside\" substituents of the diene. The stereochemistry of the starting cyclobutene (Me-wedge, OMe-dash) is retained at the quaternary center of the products. This eliminates options B, D, F, and H. We only need to consider A, C, E, and G. Based on the regiochemistry, we focus on A and C.\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical outcome for each diene intermediate:\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene E':** In this diene, the Me group is \"outside\" (trans), and the OMe group on the same carbon is \"inside\" (cis). In the endo transition state, the `CO2Et` group is also \"inside\". Therefore, the `CO2Et` group and the OMe group will be *cis* to each other in the product, while the Me group will be *trans* to the `CO2Et` group.\n    *   Let's examine **Product A**: Me is wedge, OMe is dash, and `CO2Et` is dash. Here, OMe and `CO2Et` are *cis* (both dash), and Me is *trans* to `CO2Et` (wedge vs. dash). This matches the expected outcome from Diene E'.\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene Z':** In this diene, the Me group is \"inside\" (cis), and the OMe group on the same carbon is \"outside\" (trans). In the endo transition state, the `CO2Et` group is also \"inside\". Therefore, the `CO2Et` group and the Me group will be *cis* to each other in the product, while the OMe group will be *trans* to the `CO2Et` group.\n    *   Let's examine **Product C**: Me is wedge, OMe is dash, and `CO2Et` is wedge. Here, Me and `CO2Et` are *cis* (both wedge), and OMe is *trans* to `CO2Et` (dash vs. wedge). This matches the expected outcome from Diene Z'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence produces two diastereomeric products because the initial ring opening creates two diastereomeric dienes (E' and Z'), and each reacts stereospecifically in the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction to form a different diastereomeric product.\n\n*   The pathway via **Diene E'** leads to **Product A**.\n*   The pathway via **Diene Z'** leads to **Product C**.\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are A and C.\n\n<<<A, C>>>"
