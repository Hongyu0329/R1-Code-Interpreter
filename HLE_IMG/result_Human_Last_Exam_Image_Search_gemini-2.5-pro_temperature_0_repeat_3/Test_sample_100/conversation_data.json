    "The molecular formula of the final product is determined by analyzing the three consecutive reactions shown in the provided scheme.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n    The starting material is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is C15H14F3NO2. The first reaction uses ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), a reagent commonly used for the oxidative removal of the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom. The PMB group itself is converted to p-methoxybenzaldehyde. This results in Intermediate 1, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, with a molecular formula of C7H6F3NO.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation of the alkene**\n    The second step involves the reaction of Intermediate 1 with hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. This converts the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene ring system to a saturated bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system. The resulting product is Intermediate 2, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one, and its molecular formula is C7H8F3NO.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Hydrolysis of the lactam**\n    The final step is the treatment of Intermediate 2 with aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl) at 70 Â°C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide). During hydrolysis, a water molecule is added across the amide bond (N-C=O), causing the ring to open. This reaction transforms the bicyclic lactam into a substituted cyclopentane containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The molecular formula of the final product is obtained by adding the atoms of one water molecule (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is as follows:\n*   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Addition of water (H2O) for hydrolysis\n*   Final Product Formula: C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
