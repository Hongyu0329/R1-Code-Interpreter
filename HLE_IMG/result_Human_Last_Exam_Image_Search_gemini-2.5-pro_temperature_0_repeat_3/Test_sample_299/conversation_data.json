    "The two-move checkmate is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rhf5+**: The white rook from f3 moves to f5, placing the black king in check. Black has two possible responses:\n    *   The black king captures the rook (Kxf5).\n    *   The black queen captures the rook (Qxf5).\n\n2.  **Ng6#**: Regardless of black's move, the white knight from e7 moves to g6, resulting in a checkmate.\n    *   If black played Kxf5, the king on f5 is trapped. All adjacent squares are either attacked by the white queen, king, or the checking knight.\n    *   If black played Qxf5, the king on e4 is trapped. All of its escape squares are attacked by other white pieces, and the knight's check cannot be blocked or captured.\n\n<<<1. Rhf5+ 2. Ng6#>>>"
