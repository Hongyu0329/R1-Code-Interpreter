    "The black organisms in the photo are a type of parasitic fungus, likely *Spinellus fusiger*, growing on a host bracket fungus.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like structures are a type of fungus called a polypore or bracket fungus. These fungi are commonly found on trees and play a role in decomposing wood. The specific host fungus in the image appears to be a species of *Trametes*, possibly *Trametes versicolor* (Turkey Tail), or a related species, given its zoned, fan-like appearance.\n\nGrowing on the surface of this host fungus are tiny, black, hair-like stalks with a pin-head structure at the top. This is characteristic of *Spinellus fusiger*, a species of mold that is parasitic on other fungi. This phenomenon is known as mycophilia, where one fungus grows on another. The hair-like structures are the reproductive part of the parasitic fungus, which have emerged from the host's cap to produce and release spores.\n\n<<<*Spinellus fusiger* (a parasitic fungus)>>>"
