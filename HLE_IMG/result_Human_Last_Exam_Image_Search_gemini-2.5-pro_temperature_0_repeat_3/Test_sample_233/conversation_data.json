    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis runestone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription on Sö 281 mentions Ingvar and his journey to \"Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens).\n\nA notable feature of this runestone is its unusual grid pattern, which is clearly visible in the image. The stone is fragmented and is now embedded in a wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. The image provided is a well-known detail from this specific stone, often used to illustrate the mention of Ingvar's name in runes.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
