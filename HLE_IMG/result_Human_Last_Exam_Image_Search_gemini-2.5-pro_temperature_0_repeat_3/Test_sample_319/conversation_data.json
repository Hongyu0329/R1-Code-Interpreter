    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or, more generally, **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a short burst of noise. If the noise is loud enough to have masked the tone had it continued, the listener's brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, creating the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted tone. The spectrogram and waveform in the image depict exactly this stimulus: a steady tone (the horizontal line in the spectrogram and the regular sine wave) is physically replaced by a burst of broadband noise (the vertical bar in the spectrogram and the irregular waveform), yet it is often perceived as continuous.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of how the brain actively interprets and constructs our perception of the world from ambiguous or incomplete sensory information. The Necker Cube presents a 2D image with ambiguous depth cues, leading to a bistable perception where the cube's orientation appears to flip back and forth. Similarly, in the auditory continuity illusion, the brain resolves the ambiguity of the interrupted sound by inferring that the original sound likely continued behind the interfering noise. This \"filling-in\" is a common and typically unconscious perceptual ability that helps us maintain a stable understanding of sounds in noisy environments, such as following a conversation in a crowded room. A well-known variant of this effect applied to speech is called the phonemic restoration effect.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
