    "The title of the 19th-century painting, a fragment of which is presented, is **\"Burning Windmill at Stege\"**.\n\nThe artwork was painted in **1856** by the Norwegian artist **Johan Christian Dahl**. This painting is a notable example of the \"brandje\" sub-genre, which involves the depiction of fires and was popular in Dutch art. The original oil on canvas now resides in a museum in Norway.\n\nThe scene captures a dramatic moment with a windmill engulfed in flames under a dark, turbulent sky. The town of Stege, depicted in the painting, is the largest town on the island of MÃ¸n in southeastern Denmark and was historically a prosperous herring fishing port. Dahl's work is recognized for its atmospheric and emotional intensity, echoing the traditions of the Dutch Golden Age while incorporating the artistic sensibilities of the 19th century.\n\n<<<Burning Windmill at Stege>>>"
