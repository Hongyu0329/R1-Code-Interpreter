    "### Fluorinated Iridium Complexes Exhibit Shorter Lifetimes in LECs\n\nBased on studies of iridium(III) complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), the complexes containing fluorine atoms on the cyclometalating ligands are expected to show shorter operational lifetimes. This is contrary to the expectation in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), where fluorination typically enhances stability.\n\nThe four complexes are all cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where the ancillary ligand (`N^N`) is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, and the cyclometalating ligands (`C^N`) are varied:\n*   **Complex 1:** 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy)\n*   **Complex 2:** 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine (4-F-ppy)\n*   **Complex 3:** 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (2-F-ppy)\n*   **Complex 4:** 2-phenylpyridine (ppy)\n\nIn the specific context of LECs, several studies have shown that increasing the fluorine content on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligand leads to a decrease in device stability and shorter lifetimes. This has been attributed to degradation pathways involving the C-F bonds under the harsher operating conditions of an LEC, which include mobile ions and high electric fields. One proposed mechanism is a defluorination reaction that degrades the emitter.\n\nFollowing this trend, the expected order of lifetime would be:\n**Complex 4 (no F) > Complex 2 (one F) â‰ˆ Complex 3 (one F) > Complex 1 (two Fs)**\n\nTherefore, the complexes with more fluorine substituents are predicted to have shorter lifetimes. Complex 1, with two fluorine atoms per ligand, is expected to be the least stable. Complexes 2 and 3, each with one fluorine atom, would also be less stable than the fluorine-free Complex 4. The question asks which complexes are expected to show *shorter* lifetimes, implying a comparison against the most stable complex in the set. In this case, Complexes 1, 2, and 3 are all expected to have shorter lifetimes than the non-fluorinated Complex 4.\n\nGiven the provided options, the choice that includes all the fluorinated complexes is the most comprehensive answer based on this counterintuitive trend observed in LECs.\n\n<<<K>>>"
