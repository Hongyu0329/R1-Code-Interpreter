    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is the United States. The three historical events represented by the trend lines correspond to major American commemorative days.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events corresponding to each colored line on the graph:\n*   **The Blue Line:** The consistent peaks at the end of May correspond to **Memorial Day**. This is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the armed forces. It is observed on the last Monday of May.\n\n*   **The Red Line:** The sharp spikes in interest in early December point to **National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day**. Observed annually on December 7, this day commemorates the 2,403 Americans killed in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line:** The highest peaks, which occur annually around the beginning of July, represent **Independence Day**, commonly known as the Fourth of July. This federal holiday celebrates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The graph shows this event has the highest search interest among the three.\n\nThe combination of these three specific commemorative dates strongly indicates that the country is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
