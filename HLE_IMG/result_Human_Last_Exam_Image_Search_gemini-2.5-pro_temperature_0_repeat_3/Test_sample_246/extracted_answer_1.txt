Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy ball is a wool sower gall created by the cynipid wasp, *Callirhytis seminator*. The adult female wasp that created this gall laid her eggs in the leaf buds of the oak tree in the spring. The next generation of wasps that emerge from this gall will lay their eggs in the stems of the oak tree.
