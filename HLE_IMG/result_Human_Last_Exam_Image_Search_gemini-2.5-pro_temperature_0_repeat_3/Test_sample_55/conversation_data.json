    "An accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, is **III+**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The circled chord on the third beat of measure 8 contains the notes F♮, A, and C♯.\n*   **Chord Quality:** These notes form an F augmented triad.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The chord is built on the third scale degree (mediant) of D minor, which is F. In a minor key, a chord built on the mediant is typically major (III) or minor (iii). However, in this case, the fifth of the chord (C) is raised to C♯, creating an augmented triad. An augmented chord on the mediant is represented by the Roman numeral III+. This chord is derived from the harmonic and melodic minor scales.\n\nThe progression in measure 8 moves from the tonic (i, D minor) to the subdominant (iv, G minor), and then to this altered mediant chord (III+, F augmented). While the augmented mediant chord is used infrequently in the Classical period, its function here creates tension that leads forward in the music.\n\n<<<III+>>>"
