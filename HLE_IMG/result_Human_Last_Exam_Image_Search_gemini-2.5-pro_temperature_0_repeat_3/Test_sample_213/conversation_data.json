    "The piece of sheet music is from the opera **Wozzeck** by the Austrian composer Alban Berg.\n\nThis specific musical passage is the beginning of Act II. The German instruction \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the curtain rising at the start of the act. The opera, composed between 1914 and 1922, is a seminal work of the early 20th century, known for its atonal musical language and expressionist style. The instrumentation seen in the score—including parts for two flutes, oboe, English horn, bassoon, and a full string section with specific divisions and a solo viola—is characteristic of the large orchestra Berg employed for the opera.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
