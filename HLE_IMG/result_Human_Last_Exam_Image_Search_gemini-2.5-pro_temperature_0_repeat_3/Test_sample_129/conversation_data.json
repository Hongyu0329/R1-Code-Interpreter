    "Based on the image provided, the protein is the **human Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S (UBE2S)**. This identification is confirmed by its structural representation in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the entry code 1J7O.\n\nUBE2S is a key enzyme in the ubiquitination process, which targets proteins for degradation. Specifically, it functions as an essential component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a critical regulator of the cell cycle. UBE2S is responsible for elongating 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, marking them for destruction by the proteasome and thereby facilitating progression through mitosis.\n\nThe structure of UBE2S features a catalytic domain and, in some representations, a notable N-terminal extension. The enzyme works by accepting a ubiquitin molecule from an E1 activating enzyme and then transferring it to a target protein, a process that can be assisted by an E3 ligase. Dysregulation of UBE2S has been linked to various diseases, including cancer, making it a subject of significant research interest.\n\n<<<human Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S (UBE2S)>>>"
