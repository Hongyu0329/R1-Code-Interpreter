    "Based on the analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **dimethyl 4,5-dichlorobenzene-1,2-dicarboxylate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak**: The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion and its isotopes. In the given spectrum, this cluster is observed around m/z 262. The peaks are at m/z 260 (34.8%), 262 (29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%). The highest nominal mass peak is at m/z 262.\n\n2.  **Presence of Chlorine**: The pattern of peaks in the molecular ion cluster, with signals at M+, M+2, and M+4, is characteristic of a compound containing chlorine atoms. The relative intensity of these peaks can help determine the number of chlorine atoms. The spectrum also shows peaks at m/z 35 and 37, which correspond to the two isotopes of chlorine, further confirming its presence.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Molecular Formula**: The molecular ion peak for the isotopologue with the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl) is at m/z 262. The isotope pattern suggests the presence of two chlorine atoms. The theoretical intensity ratio for a compound with two chlorine atoms is approximately 9:6:1 for the M+, M+2, and M+4 peaks, respectively. The observed intensities for the peaks at m/z 262, 264, and 266 are 29.0, 12.9, and 3.22, which gives a ratio of roughly 9:4:1. While not a perfect match, it strongly suggests two chlorine atoms. Assuming the molecular formula is C₁₀H₈Cl₂O₄, the calculated molecular weight for the isotopologue with two ³⁵Cl atoms is 262.0 g/mol, which perfectly matches the observed molecular ion peak.\n\n4.  **Fragmentation Analysis**:\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak in the spectrum) is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n    *   A very intense peak is present at **m/z 227** (I=66.7%). This peak corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl) from the molecular ion (262 - 35 = 227).\n    *   The base peak at m/z 225 can be explained by the loss of a ³⁷Cl atom (262 - 37 = 225) or, more likely, by the subsequent loss of two hydrogen atoms from the m/z 227 fragment ([M-Cl-H₂]⁺). This subsequent fragmentation would enhance the intensity of the m/z 225 peak, making it the base peak.\n    *   Another significant peak at **m/z 231** (I=3.70%) corresponds to the loss of a methoxy group (-OCH₃, mass 31) from the molecular ion (262 - 31 = 231).\n\n5.  **Compound Identification**: The molecular formula C₁₀H₈Cl₂O₄, combined with the fragmentation pattern, points towards a dichlorinated dimethyl ester of a benzene dicarboxylic acid. Based on information from chemical databases and literature, this spectrum corresponds to dimethyl 4,5-dichlorophthalate.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **dimethyl 4,5-dichlorobenzene-1,2-dicarboxylate**.\n\n<<<dimethyl 4,5-dichlorobenzene-1,2-dicarboxylate>>>"
