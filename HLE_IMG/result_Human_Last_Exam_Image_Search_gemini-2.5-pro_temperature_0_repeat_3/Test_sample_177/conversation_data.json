    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.\n2.  Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.\n3.  Calculate the percentage reduction using the results from the first two steps.\n\n### **1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nFirst, we calculate the VMT for each trip distance category in the Baseline scenario. The VMT for each category is the product of the share of total trips, the average trip distance, and the share of vehicle trips made by car.\n\nThe share of vehicle trips by car is calculated by adding the share of single-occupant cars to the share of carpool trips divided by the average carpool occupancy.\n\n**Data from Table 1 (Baseline):**\n*   **Share of total trips:**\n    *   0-3 miles: 48%\n    *   3-5 miles: 22%\n    *   5-10 miles: 14%\n    *   10+ miles: 16%\n*   **Average trip distance:**\n    *   0-3 miles: 1 mile\n    *   3-5 miles: 4 miles\n    *   5-10 miles: 7.5 miles\n    *   10+ miles: 20 miles\n*   **Average Carpool Occupancy:** 2.8\n\n**VMT Calculation (Baseline):**\n\nWe calculate a weighted VMT contribution for each distance category. Let's assume a total of 100 trips for simplicity.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (25% for 1 occupant) + (28% for carpool / 2.8 occupancy) = 25% + 10% = 35% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (48% of total trips) * 1 mile * 35% = 0.48 * 1 * 0.35 = **0.168** (weighted miles)\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (38% for 1 occupant) + (43% for carpool / 2.8 occupancy) = 38% + 15.36% = 53.36% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (22% of total trips) * 4 miles * 53.36% = 0.22 * 4 * 0.5336 = **0.4695** (weighted miles)\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (40% for 1 occupant) + (45% for carpool / 2.8 occupancy) = 40% + 16.07% = 56.07% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (14% of total trips) * 7.5 miles * 56.07% = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.5607 = **0.5887** (weighted miles)\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (42% for 1 occupant) + (47% for carpool / 2.8 occupancy) = 42% + 16.79% = 58.79% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (16% of total trips) * 20 miles * 58.79% = 0.16 * 20 * 0.5879 = **1.8813** (weighted miles)\n\n**Total Baseline VMT** = 0.168 + 0.4695 + 0.5887 + 1.8813 = **3.1075** (total weighted miles per 100 trips)\n\n### **2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nNext, we repeat the calculation using the data from the Proposed scenario.\n\n**Data from Table 2 (Proposed):**\n*   **Average Carpool Occupancy:** 3.0\n\n**VMT Calculation (Proposed):**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (1% for 1 occupant) + (2% for carpool / 3.0 occupancy) = 1% + 0.67% = 1.67% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (48% of total trips) * 1 mile * 1.67% = 0.48 * 1 * 0.0167 = **0.0080** (weighted miles)\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (8% for 1 occupant) + (19% for carpool / 3.0 occupancy) = 8% + 6.33% = 14.33% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (22% of total trips) * 4 miles * 14.33% = 0.22 * 4 * 0.1433 = **0.1261** (weighted miles)\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (14% for 1 occupant) + (27% for carpool / 3.0 occupancy) = 14% + 9% = 23% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (14% of total trips) * 7.5 miles * 23% = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.23 = **0.2415** (weighted miles)\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car trips = (16% for 1 occupant) + (33% for carpool / 3.0 occupancy) = 16% + 11% = 27% of vehicle trips.\n    *   VMT = (16% of total trips) * 20 miles * 27% = 0.16 * 20 * 0.27 = **0.8640** (weighted miles)\n\n**Total Proposed VMT** = 0.0080 + 0.1261 + 0.2415 + 0.8640 = **1.2396** (total weighted miles per 100 trips)\n\n### **3. Calculate Percentage Reduction**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 3.1075 - 1.2396 = **1.8679**\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (1.8679 / 3.1075) * 100 = **60.11%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
