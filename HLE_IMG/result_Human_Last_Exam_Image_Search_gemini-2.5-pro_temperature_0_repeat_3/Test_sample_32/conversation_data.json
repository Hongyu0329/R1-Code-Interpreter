    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the orientation of the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by having an arcuate, or curved, seta. This causes the capsule to be bent over rather than sitting upright. This distinct difference in the curvature of the seta is the most reliable and immediate visual feature to tell the two species apart when their sporophytes are present.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
