    "Based on the provided graph of neuronal firing activity, the synchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously.\n\nThe timestamps for the approximate center of each synchronized burst are:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~2 seconds\n*   **Burst 2:** ~16 seconds\n*   **Burst 3:** ~26 seconds\n*   **Burst 4:** ~36 seconds\n*   **Burst 5:** ~49 seconds\n\nNext, the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts) are calculated:\n*   Interval 1 (Burst 2 - Burst 1): 16 s - 2 s = 14 s\n*   Interval 2 (Burst 3 - Burst 2): 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 3 (Burst 4 - Burst 3): 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 4 (Burst 5 - Burst 4): 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nFinally, the average inter-burst interval is calculated by summing the intervals and dividing by the number of intervals:\n*   Average Interval = (14 + 10 + 10 + 13) / 4 = 47 / 4 = 11.75 seconds.\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12>>>"
