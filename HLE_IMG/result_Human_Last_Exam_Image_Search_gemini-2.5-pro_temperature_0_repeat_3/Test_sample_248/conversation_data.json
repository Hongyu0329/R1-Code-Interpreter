    "The organisms in the image are characteristic of a North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone. Several species are present, but the one that most definitively indicates an Atlantic, rather than a Pacific, coast location is the common periwinkle.\n\nThe small, dark, spiral-shelled snails visible in the photograph are identifiable as the common periwinkle. Its native range is the northeastern Atlantic, and it is an introduced, invasive species in the northwestern Atlantic, found from Labrador, Canada, to Delaware, USA. It is not established on the Pacific Coast of North America.\n\nAnother species present that points to an Atlantic location is the dog whelk, which is likely the larger, whitish snail. This species is found on both sides of the North Atlantic but is absent from the Pacific. The barnacles are likely the northern rock barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. While this species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, its association in the photo with the common periwinkle and dog whelk strongly supports an Atlantic setting.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
