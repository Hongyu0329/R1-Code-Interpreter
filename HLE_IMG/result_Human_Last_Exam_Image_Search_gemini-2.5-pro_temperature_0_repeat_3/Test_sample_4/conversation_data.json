    "The knot in the image is identified as the prime knot 9_42. This is one of the 49 knots with a crossing number of nine.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, V(t), for the 9_42 knot is given by:\n$t^{-12} - t^{-11} + 2t^{-10} - 2t^{-9} + 2t^{-8} - 3t^{-7} + 3t^{-6} - 2t^{-5} + 2t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2}$\n\nHowever, the question asks for the polynomial p(t) in decreasing degree order. To achieve this, we can perform a variable substitution. The Jones polynomial for the mirror image of a knot is obtained by substituting t with t⁻¹. Let's denote the provided polynomial as V(t). The requested polynomial p(t) is V(t⁻¹).\n\np(t) = $(t^{-1})^{-12} - (t^{-1})^{-11} + 2(t^{-1})^{-10} - 2(t^{-1})^{-9} + 2(t^{-1})^{-8} - 3(t^{-1})^{-7} + 3(t^{-1})^{-6} - 2(t^{-1})^{-5} + 2(t^{-1})^{-4} - (t^{-1})^{-3} + (t^{-1})^{-2}$\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n$p(t) = t^{12} - t^{11} + 2t^{10} - 2t^9 + 2t^8 - 3t^7 + 3t^6 - 2t^5 + 2t^4 - t^3 + t^2$\n\nInterestingly, the knot 9_42 and its mirror image have the same Kauffman polynomial, and the Jones polynomial is a specialization of the Kauffman polynomial. Research has shown that while many polynomial invariants do not distinguish 9_42 from its mirror image, generalized knot invariants from Chern-Simons theory can.\n\nTherefore, the Jones polynomial of the knot 9_42 in decreasing degree order is:\n$t^{12} - t^{11} + 2t^{10} - 2t^9 + 2t^8 - 3t^7 + 3t^6 - 2t^5 + 2t^4 - t^3 + t^2$\n\n<<<$t^{12} - t^{11} + 2t^{10} - 2t^9 + 2t^8 - 3t^7 + 3t^6 - 2t^5 + 2t^4 - t^3 + t^2$>>>"
