    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we need to analyze the grid and the paper speed.\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed:** The strip indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Grid Calibration:** On standard ECG paper at this speed, one small square (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds, and one large square (5 mm) represents 0.20 seconds.\n3.  **Identifying the Longest Interval:** By visually scanning the entire rhythm strip, the most significant pause occurs on the fourth line of the tracing, between the 4th and 5th QRS complexes.\n4.  **Measuring the Interval:** To measure this longest R-R interval, we count the number of large squares between the peaks of the two consecutive R-waves surrounding the pause. The distance between these two R-waves is approximately 9 large squares.\n5.  **Calculating the Time:**\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) x (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 9 large squares x 0.20 seconds/large square\n    *   Duration = 1.8 seconds\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.8 seconds.\n\n<<<1.8>>>"
