    "Based on the visual evidence and entomological knowledge, the biological sexes for the three pairs of insects are as follows:\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the right has a distinctly conical, pointed abdomen, which is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys* (cuckoo) bee. The insect on the left has a less pointed abdomen tip with multiple spines, which is characteristic of a male of this genus. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. The individual on the right displays distinctly curled antennae at the tips, a key feature of males in this genus. The individual on the left has straight antennae, indicating it is a female. Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n*   **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The bee on the left has very long antennae and a pale, hairy face, which are classic traits of a male. The bee on the right has shorter antennae and is a female. While females of this group do have scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs, males do not. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\nThe corresponding indices for pairs A, B, and C are 3, 4, and 3.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
