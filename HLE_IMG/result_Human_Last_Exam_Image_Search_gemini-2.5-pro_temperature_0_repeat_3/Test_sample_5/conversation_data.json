    "This is the Étude Op. 2, No. 1, composed by Alexander Scriabin.\n\nComposed in 1887 when Scriabin was just 15 years old, this piece is in the key of C-sharp minor. It is the first of his 26 études and reflects his early, romantic style, which often drew comparisons to Frédéric Chopin. The piece features a passionate and melancholic melody in the right hand, set against a backdrop of arpeggiated chords in the left hand. Its structure is characterized by a simple melody with rhythmic repetition and variety achieved through modulations.\n\n<<<Alexander Scriabin - Étude Op. 2, No. 1>>>"
