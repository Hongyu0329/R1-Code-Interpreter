    "The word in the manuscript is a misspelling of the common Ancient Greek adverb **μᾶλλον** (mâllon).\n\nA direct transcription of the letters in the image is `μθᾶλων` (mthâlon). However, this is not a recognized word in Ancient Greek, and its accentuation is irregular. The image shows a form of the very common adverb `μᾶλλον`, which means \"more\" or \"rather\".\n\nThe reasons for this identification are:\n*   The beginning of the word, `μᾶ-` (mu with a circumflex accent over the alpha), is a strong indicator of `μᾶλλον`.\n*   The substitution of an omega (`ω`) for an omicron (`ο`) was a frequent phonetic spelling variation in later and Byzantine Greek, as both letters came to be pronounced identically.\n*   The letter theta (`θ`) appears to be a scribal error for the first lambda (`λ`). Such mistakes were not uncommon in manuscripts.\n\nTherefore, the scribe intended to write `μᾶλλον`, a word used extensively in Greek literature to indicate a greater degree or preference.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
