    "The reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of friedelan-3β-ol, which proceeds via a complex series of shifts of methyl groups (CH3) and hydride ions (H⁻). This type of reaction is known as a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement, which is common in triterpenoid chemistry. The final product is an isomer of the starting material with a new carbon skeleton and a double bond.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following key steps:\n1.  Protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) and loss of water to form a secondary carbocation at carbon 3 (C-3).\n2.  A cascade of sequential shifts of neighboring methyl groups and hydrogens occurs, moving the positive charge across the molecule's backbone. Each shift aims to form a more stable (usually tertiary) carbocation.\n3.  The rearrangement stops when the carbocation is at C-13.\n4.  A proton is eliminated from C-12 to form the stable C-12 to C-13 double bond, resulting in the final product, which has an oleanane-type skeleton.\n\nBy tracing the movement of the specific methyl and hydrogen groups during this cascade, we can determine the final substituents at the indicated positions:\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** This carbon initially has two methyl groups. One of these methyls remains in its original position throughout the reaction. Thus, the substituent at position 1 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 2 (on C-5):** This position starts with a hydrogen, which migrates. It then receives a methyl group that was originally on C-10. Therefore, the substituent at position 2 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 3 (on C-10):** This position starts with a methyl group, which migrates away. It then receives a hydrogen that was originally on C-9. Thus, the substituent at position 3 is a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Position 4 (on C-9):** This position starts with a hydrogen, which migrates. It then receives a methyl group that was originally on C-8. Therefore, the substituent at position 4 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 5 (on C-14):** This position starts with a methyl group, which migrates away. It then receives a hydrogen that was originally on C-13. Thus, the substituent at position 5 is a hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
