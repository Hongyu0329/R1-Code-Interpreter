    "The tiling in the image displays a complex pattern with multiple types of rotational symmetry. By closely examining the arrangement of the tiles, two principal orders of rotational symmetry can be identified.\n\nFirstly, the dark blue, regular hexagonal tiles each form a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**. If the tiling is rotated by 60 degrees (360/6) around the center of any of these hexagons, the entire pattern aligns perfectly with its original position.\n\nSecondly, the light orange square tiles are centers of **4-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the tiling by 90 degrees (360/4) around the center of any square will also result in the pattern mapping onto itself.\n\nThe presence of both 4-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetry in the same tiling is noteworthy. According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, a periodic tiling (one that repeats in a regular grid, like standard wallpaper) cannot possess both of these symmetries simultaneously. This indicates that the pattern is a quasi-periodic tiling, which has long-range order but does not repeat periodically. Such tilings are known for exhibiting rotational symmetries that are forbidden in periodic crystals.\n\nIn addition to these, points of 2-fold rotational symmetry can also be found within the pattern, for instance, at the meeting point of two of the light-yellow, bowtie-shaped tiles and an orange rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the tiling exhibits a combination of rotational symmetries.\n\n<<<The tiling has 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry.>>>"
