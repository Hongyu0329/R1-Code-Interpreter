    "Based on the visual analysis and the search results, here is the identification of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **Specimen H: Scoria**\n    This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly vesicular (bubbly) texture. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano. The reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption. Scoria is typically denser than pumice and will sink in water.\n\n*   **Specimen I: Volcanic Breccia**\n    This specimen is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture identifies it as a breccia. Given that the fragments are of volcanic origin, it is a volcanic breccia. These rocks can form from explosive volcanic eruptions that shatter existing rock and then re-cement the fragments.\n\n*   **Specimen J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, vesicular rock. Its appearance is consistent with pumice, a volcanic rock created from super-heated, highly pressurized rock that is violently ejected from a volcano. The rapid cooling and depressurization create a foamy texture. Pumice is typically light in color, ranging from white to yellow or brown, and is very lightweight due to its high porosity.\n\n*   **Specimen K: Pegmatite**\n    This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites are igneous rocks that form during the final stages of magma crystallization from water-rich fluids, which allows the crystals to grow to exceptionally large sizes. The most common minerals found in pegmatites are quartz, feldspar, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
