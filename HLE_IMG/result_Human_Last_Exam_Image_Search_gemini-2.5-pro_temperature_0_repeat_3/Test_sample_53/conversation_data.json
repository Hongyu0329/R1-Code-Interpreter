    "This Apulian red-figure pelike, attributed to the Darius Painter and dated to around 330 B.C., depicts a scene from the Greek myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n\nThe figure leaving the chariot, in the sense of being defeated and left behind on the ground, is **King Oenomaus**.\n\nIn the myth, King Oenomaus of Pisa challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. He would give the suitor a head start and then pursue them; if caught, the suitor was killed. The figure on the ground is Oenomaus, who has just been defeated and killed in the race against his daughter's final suitor, Pelops.\n\nThe other figures depicted are:\n*   **Pelops**: The hero driving the chariot, identifiable by his Eastern-style Phrygian cap and patterned clothing.\n*   **Hippodamia**: The daughter of Oenomaus, who is being carried away by her new husband, Pelops.\n*   **Nike**: The winged goddess of victory, flying above the chariot to signify Pelops's triumph.\n\n<<<King Oenomaus>>>"
