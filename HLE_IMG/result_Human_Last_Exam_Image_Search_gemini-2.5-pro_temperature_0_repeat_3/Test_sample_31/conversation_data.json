    "The knot in the picture is the **8₁₉ knot**. A visual comparison with standard knot diagrams confirms this identification.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a numerical value assigned to a knot, derived from Khovanov homology, which is a powerful tool in knot theory. For the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **-6**.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
