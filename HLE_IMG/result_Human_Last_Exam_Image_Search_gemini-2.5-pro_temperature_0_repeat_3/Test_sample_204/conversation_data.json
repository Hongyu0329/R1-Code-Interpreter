    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and information from mineralogical resources, the minerals are identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine** - This specimen displays a granular mass of olive-green crystals, a characteristic appearance of olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, which has the simplest silicate structure consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene** - This is a dark green to black, stubby prismatic crystal, which is a common habit for pyroxenes. Pyroxenes are single-chain silicates (inosilicates), where silica tetrahedra link to form long chains. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica** - This mineral is green and exhibits perfect basal cleavage, allowing it to be split into thin, flexible sheets. This physical property is the hallmark of the mica group minerals, which are phyllosilicates (sheet silicates). In this structure, tetrahedra are linked in two-dimensional sheets, representing a higher level of polymerization than chain silicates.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz** - This is a translucent, smoky-colored crystal with a hexagonal shape and conchoidal fracture, all of which are identifying features of quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate (framework silicate), where every oxygen atom of a silica tetrahedron is shared with a neighboring tetrahedron, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\nThe final order of the specimens from the simplest to the most complex silicate structure is:\n\n**C, A, B, D**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
