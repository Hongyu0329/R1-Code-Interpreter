    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Measure and Identify the Key**\n*   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find measure 28 at the beginning of the second system. Counting forward, the third measure of this system is measure 30. This measure is circled in the provided image.\n*   The overall key of the first movement of the \"Pathétique\" Sonata is C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   We need to read the notes in both the treble (right hand) and bass (left hand) clefs for this measure.\n*   **Right Hand:** The notes played are a repeating pattern of sixteenth notes: G♯, B, D, F.\n*   **Left Hand:** The chord played consists of a G♯ octave with a D in between.\n*   **Combined Pitches:** Combining all the notes played simultaneously in measure 30, we have the pitches G♯, B, D, and F.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Chord and its Quality**\n*   To identify the chord, we stack the pitches (G♯, B, D, F) into thirds.\n*   Starting with G♯ as the root:\n    *   G♯ to B is a minor third.\n    *   G♯ to D is a diminished fifth.\n    *   G♯ to F is a diminished seventh.\n*   A chord with a root, minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh is a **diminished seventh chord**. Therefore, the chord in measure 30 is a G♯ diminished seventh chord, written as G♯°7.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Harmonic Function of the Chord**\n*   Diminished seventh chords most commonly function as leading-tone chords, creating strong tension that resolves to a tonic chord a half-step above the root of the diminished chord.\n*   The G♯°7 chord has G♯ as its root. The note a half-step above G♯ is A. This suggests the G♯°7 chord will resolve to an A chord (either major or minor).\n*   Looking at the next measure, **measure 31**, the left hand plays an A-C-E chord, which is an **A minor triad**. The right hand plays arpeggios based on this A minor chord.\n*   Therefore, the G♯°7 in measure 30 is functioning as the leading-tone seventh chord to the A minor chord in measure 31.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Roman Numeral in the Context of the Home Key (C Minor)**\n*   The chord in measure 30 (G♯°7) is not diatonic to the home key of C minor. It is an *applied* or *secondary* leading-tone chord.\n*   To write the Roman numeral, we first need to identify the function of the chord it resolves to (A minor) within the key of C minor.\n*   The sixth degree of the C minor scale is A♭, so the diatonic submediant chord (vi) is A♭ major.\n*   However, Beethoven uses an A minor chord. This is a common chromatic alteration, often seen as borrowing the submediant from the parallel major key (C major, where vi is A minor). In analysis, this chromatically altered chord is still typically labeled as the submediant, **vi**.\n*   Since the G♯°7 chord is functioning as the leading-tone seventh chord (vii°7) of the vi chord (A minor), we use slash notation to indicate this secondary function.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chord is a leading-tone diminished seventh (vii°7) of the following A minor chord. The A minor chord functions as a chromatic submediant (vi) in the key of C minor. Therefore, the Roman numeral for measure 30 is **vii°7/vi**.\n\n<<<vii°7/vi>>>"
