    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image consists of three panels labeled L, M, and N. Each panel shows a close-up micrograph of a long, thin, segmented biological structure. This structure appears to be composed of individual cells joined end-to-end, forming a filament. The presence of cross-walls, or septa, is visible, dividing the filament into compartments or cells. The overall appearance is characteristic of a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing Each Panel Sequentially**\nAssuming the panels represent a time sequence or different stages of a single process, let's analyze them in order.\n\n*   **Panel L:** This panel shows a relatively straight filament. The cells appear turgid and filled with cytoplasm. An arrowhead points to a septum, the division between two adjacent cells. This panel likely represents the initial state before the process begins.\n*   **Panel M:** In this panel, the filament shows a change. A distinct, localized swelling or bulge is emerging from the side of one of the cells, near a septum. An arrowhead is pointing directly at this new outgrowth. This indicates the initiation of a new structure.\n*   **Panel N:** This panel shows a more advanced stage. The bulge seen in panel M has elongated and developed into a new, smaller filament that projects sideways from the main filament. This new structure is a side branch. The arrowhead points to the base of this newly formed branch. The original filament is now bent at the point of branching.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesizing the Observations into a Process**\nBy observing the progression from L to M to N, we can conclude that the image documents the formation of a side branch from an existing filament.\n\n*   The process starts with a stable filament (L).\n*   It is initiated by a localized outgrowth from the cell wall (M).\n*   It culminates in the development of a new, growing branch (N).\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Biological Term for the Process**\nThis method of growth, where a new filament emerges from the side of an existing one, is a fundamental biological process known as **branching**. In the context of fungi, where the filaments are called hyphae, this specific process is called **hyphal branching**. It is the primary way that a fungal mycelium (the network of hyphae) grows, expands, and explores its environment for nutrients.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Structure Identification:** The object is a multicellular filament, not a single cell. The segments are cells separated by septa.\n*   **Dynamic Process:** The three panels are not just random images but depict stages of a dynamic biological process.\n*   **Role of Arrowheads:** The arrowheads are crucial clues, drawing attention to the key features at each stage: the septum in L, the initial bulge in M, and the base of the new branch in N.\n*   **Mechanism:** The process involves localized weakening or remodeling of the cell wall, followed by polarized growth to form the new branch.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sequence of images clearly illustrates the formation of a new branch from a main filament. This process is known as branching, and more specifically in fungi, as hyphal branching.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
