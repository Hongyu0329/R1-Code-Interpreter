The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its longer, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which holds the capsule well above the leaves (exserted).
