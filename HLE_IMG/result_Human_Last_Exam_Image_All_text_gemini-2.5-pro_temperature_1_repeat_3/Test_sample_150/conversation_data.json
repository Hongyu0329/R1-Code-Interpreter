    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation electrophile (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. The structure is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br⁺, generated from Br₂ and FeBr₃) will add to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one or *m*-bromopropiophenone. The bromine atom is attached to carbon-3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a common method for reducing ketones to secondary alcohols. The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-CHOH). The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br on the benzene ring) is generally stable under these conditions and is not reduced.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and CCl₄ solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** These are classic conditions for a Wohl-Ziegler bromination, which is a free-radical reaction that selectively brominates at the allylic or benzylic position. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In Intermediate-3, this is the carbon atom that also bears the hydroxyl group. This benzylic C-H bond is weaker than other C-H bonds in the molecule because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized by the aromatic ring.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Starting structure (Intermediate-3): (3-Br-C₆H₄)-CH(OH)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   Final Product structure: (3-Br-C₆H₄)-C(Br)(OH)-CH₂CH₃\n*   **Naming the Final Product:**\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (alcohol) is three carbons long (propane).\n    2.  The alcohol (-OH) is on carbon-1, so the parent name is propan-1-ol.\n    3.  The substituents on carbon-1 are a bromo group and a (3-bromophenyl) group.\n    4.  Alphabetizing the substituents gives the name: 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol>>>"
