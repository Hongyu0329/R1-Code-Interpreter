    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the image.**\nThe image displays a fragment of a runestone with several distinct features:\n*   **Runic Inscription:** The carvings are runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet, typical of the late Viking Age.\n*   **Grid Layout:** The most striking feature is that the runes are arranged in a strict grid pattern, with horizontal and vertical lines creating individual boxes for runes or groups of runes. This is a very unusual and distinctive style for a runestone.\n*   **Word Dividers:** The inscription uses 'x' symbols as word dividers, which is common on runestones.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the context provided by the question.**\nThe question specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This is a crucial piece of information. The Ingvar runestones are a specific group of about 30 runestones raised in memory of those who participated in Ingvar the Far-Travelled's disastrous Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland) around 1041 AD. Each of these stones has a unique identifier in the Rundata database, typically a code indicating the province and a number (e.g., U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland).\n\n**Step 3: Transliterate the visible runes.**\nTo identify the specific stone, we can transliterate the runes in the clearest part of the image. The runes are read from left to right.\n\n*   **Second full row from the top:** This row begins with a word divider (`x`), followed by the runes `ᛋ` (s), `ᚢ` (u), and `ᚾ` (n), and ends with another word divider (`x`). This transliterates to `* sun *`, which is the Old Norse word for \"son\".\n*   **Third full row from the top:** This row also starts and ends with a word divider (`x`). The runes in between are `ᚢ` (u), `ᛚ` (l), `ᚠ` (f), and `ᛋ` (s). This transliterates to `* ulfs *`, which is the genitive case of the name *UlfR* (Ulf), meaning \"Ulf's\" or \"of Ulf\".\n\nSo, the visible text fragment reads `* sun * * ulfs *`, meaning \"... son ... of Ulf ...\".\n\n**Step 4: Combine the clues to identify the runestone.**\nWe are looking for an Ingvar runestone that:\n1.  Has a unique grid or \"waffle\" pattern.\n2.  Contains the text fragment `sun * ulfs` (\"son of Ulf\").\n\nSearching for Ingvar runestones with a grid layout quickly points to one specific stone: the Tillinge Runestone.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the identification.**\nThe Tillinge Runestone is cataloged in the Rundata database with the ID **U 785**.\n*   **Is it an Ingvar runestone?** Yes, its inscription explicitly mentions Ingvar (`... farin * miþ * inkari ...`, \"... travelled with Ingvar...\").\n*   **Does it have a grid pattern?** Yes, it is famous for its unique grid design.\n*   **Does it contain the text `sun * ulfs`?** Yes, the full inscription includes the line `...auk * sun * ulfs * i skultuna...` (\"...and Ulf's son in Skultuna...\").\n\nThe visual evidence from the image perfectly matches the known characteristics and inscription of the Tillinge Runestone. Therefore, the ID of the runestone is U 785.\n\n<<<U 785>>>"
