    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image content**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is produced when atoms of an element are excited (e.g., by heating or an electric current) and then release that energy as light. The light is not a continuous rainbow but consists of a series of bright, discrete colored lines on a dark background. Each line corresponds to a specific wavelength (and thus a specific energy) of light. The pattern of these lines is unique to each chemical element, acting like a \"fingerprint.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key features of the spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we must carefully observe the pattern of the lines—their colors, positions, and relative intensities (brightness).\n*   **Red Region (right side):** There are several distinct red lines.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very prominent and bright yellow-orange line. This is a major clue.\n*   **Green Region:** There are multiple bright lines in the green part of the spectrum.\n*   **Cyan (Blue-Green) Region:** There is a noticeable bright line between the green and blue regions.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region (left side):** There are numerous lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n\nThe overall impression is of a complex spectrum with many lines, but with several very prominent ones spread across the entire visible range.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed pattern with known elemental spectra**\nWe can now compare this observed pattern with the known spectra of some common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, containing only four main lines: a red line (656 nm), a cyan line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is far more complex than this. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** The spectrum of sodium is overwhelmingly dominated by a very strong pair of yellow lines (a doublet) at 589 nm. While the image shows a strong yellow line, it also displays many other bright lines in the red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum. The sodium spectrum does not have such prominent lines in other colors. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for producing a bright reddish-orange glow. Its spectrum has a large number of very strong lines concentrated in the red, orange, and yellow parts of the spectrum, with very few significant lines in the green or blue. The spectrum in the image shows strong lines across all colors, including green and blue. Therefore, it is not neon.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of helium is known to have several strong, distinct lines spread across the visible range. Its most characteristic lines are:\n    *   A strong red line (~668 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (~587 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~502 nm)\n    *   A bright cyan line (~492 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-violet line (~471 nm)\n    *   A strong violet line (~447 nm)\n\nThis pattern—a collection of prominent lines in the red, yellow, green, cyan, and violet regions—is an excellent match for the spectrum shown in the image. The number, color, and relative placement of the lines in the image are characteristic of helium.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBy comparing the visual evidence from the provided emission spectrum with the known spectral fingerprints of various elements, the pattern of lines perfectly matches that of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
