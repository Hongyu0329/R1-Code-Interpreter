    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image provided is a raster plot. The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents time in seconds (s), ranging from 0 to 50 s. The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the electrode number, from 0 to 128, with each row corresponding to a different recording channel. Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing event (a \"spike\") at a specific time on a specific electrode.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period of high-frequency, coordinated firing across a large population of neurons. In the raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands, where many dots are clustered together in a narrow time window across many electrode channels. By visually inspecting the graph, we can identify four prominent, major synchronized bursts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Timestamps of the Bursts:** We need to estimate the time for each major burst. A common practice is to use the center of the burst as its timestamp.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense vertical band is centered at approximately **t₁ = 13 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The second major burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 23 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third, and very prominent, burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 35 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The fourth major burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 45 s**.\n    The timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 13 s, 23 s, 35 s, and 45 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the peaks of two consecutive bursts. We can calculate three IBIs from the four bursts identified.\n    *   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and 2):** 23 s - 13 s = **10 s**\n    *   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and 3):** 35 s - 23 s = **12 s**\n    *   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and 4):** 45 s - 35 s = **10 s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 10 s + 12 s + 10 s = 32 s\n    *   Number of intervals = 3\n    *   Average IBI = 32 s / 3 ≈ 10.667 s\n\n6.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated value is 10.667... s.\n    *   The first significant figure is 1. The second is 0.\n    *   The third digit is 6. Since 6 is 5 or greater, we round up the preceding digit (0).\n    *   Rounding up 10 gives 11.\n    *   Therefore, the average inter-burst interval is **11 s**.\n\n<<<11>>>"
