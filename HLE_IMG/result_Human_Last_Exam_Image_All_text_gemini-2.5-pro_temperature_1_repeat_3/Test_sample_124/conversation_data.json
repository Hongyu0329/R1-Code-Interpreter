    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total current flowing out of the voltage source V2. To find this, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit as seen by the source, and then use Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Circuit Layout and Identify Nodes**\nLet's label the main connection points (nodes) in the circuit to make the analysis clearer.\n*   Let **Node A** be the top wire, connected to the positive terminal of the 1V source.\n*   Let **Node B** be the bottom wire, connected to the negative terminal of the source (ground). The voltage difference between Node A and Node B is 1 V.\n*   Let **Node C** be the point between resistor R1 and resistor R2.\n*   Let **Node D** be the point between resistor R2 and resistor R3.\n*   Let **Node E** be the point between resistor R7 and resistor R8.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Short Circuits**\nNow, let's carefully examine the connections, especially the wires that seem to bypass components.\n1.  There is a wire connecting Node C directly to Node A. Since a wire is assumed to have zero resistance, it forces Node C to be at the same voltage as Node A. Resistor R1 is connected between Node A and Node C. As both its ends are at the same potential, no current will flow through R1. R1 is **short-circuited**.\n2.  Similarly, there is a wire connecting Node D directly to Node B (ground). This forces Node D to be at the same voltage as Node B. Resistor R3 is connected between Node D and Node B. As both its ends are at the same potential, no current will flow through R3. R3 is also **short-circuited**.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Circuit**\nWith R1 and R3 short-circuited, we can analyze the paths for the remaining components:\n*   **Resistor R2:** Its top is connected to Node C, which is equivalent to Node A. Its bottom is connected to Node D, which is equivalent to Node B. Therefore, R2 (7 Ω) is connected directly in parallel with the voltage source V2.\n*   **Resistors R7 and R8:** R8 is connected between Node A and Node E. R7 is connected between Node E and Node B. This means R7 and R8 are connected in series. This series combination is connected across Node A and Node B, so it is also in parallel with the voltage source V2.\n\nThe complex-looking circuit simplifies to two parallel branches connected to the 1V source:\n*   **Branch 1:** Contains only resistor R2 = 7 Ω.\n*   **Branch 2:** Contains resistors R7 and R8 in series. The total resistance of this branch is R_series = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Current in Each Branch**\nWe can now calculate the current flowing through each parallel branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n*   Current through Branch 1 (I₁):\n    I₁ = V2 / R2 = 1 V / 7 Ω ≈ 0.1429 A\n*   Current through Branch 2 (I₂):\n    I₂ = V2 / R_series = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Current**\nThe total current flowing from the source (V2) is the sum of the currents in the two parallel branches (according to Kirchhoff's Current Law).\n*   I_total = I₁ + I₂\n*   I_total = (1/7) A + (1/200) A\n*   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 1400.\n*   I_total = (200/1400) A + (7/1400) A\n*   I_total = 207 / 1400 A\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives:\n*   I_total ≈ 0.147857... A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.148 A.\n\n<<<0.148 A>>>"
