    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\nLet's break down the function `sort(a, n)`:\n1.  **Base Case:** `if n > 1:` The recursion stops when `n` is 1 or less, as an array with one or zero elements is already sorted.\n2.  **First Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`. This line recursively calls the function to sort the sub-array consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n3.  **Comparison and Swap:** `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`. After the first `n-1` elements are presumably sorted, this step compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the last element of the sorted sub-array (`a[n-2]`). If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`.\n4.  **Second Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`. This is the most critical part. If a swap occurred in the previous step, it means the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements might have been disrupted (by introducing a new, smaller element at position `n-2`). To fix this, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again* to re-sort the entire sub-array of the first `n-1` elements.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. The work done inside a single call (excluding recursive calls) is constant, let's call it `c`. This includes the `if` condition and the `swap`.\n\nThe total time `T(n)` is the sum of the time for the non-recursive part and the time for the recursive calls.\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + c + (time for the second recursive call if it happens)`\n\nWe need to analyze the worst-case scenario. The worst case occurs when the second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is executed at every step of the recursion for `n > 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Worst-Case Input\n\nThe second recursive call happens if the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true after the first `sort(a, n - 1)` call. Let's see if we can find an input that always triggers this.\n\nConsider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]` with `n=4`.\n\n1.  `sort(a, 4)` is called.\n2.  It calls `sort(a, 3)` on the prefix `[4, 3, 2]`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the prefix. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n3.  The condition `if a[3] < a[2]` is checked. This is `if 1 < 4`, which is true.\n4.  A swap occurs. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n5.  The second `sort(a, 3)` is called on the prefix `[2, 3, 1]`.\n\nNotice that the input to this second recursive call, `[2, 3, 1]`, is also a \"bad\" case where the smallest element is at the end. This pattern suggests that a reverse-sorted array is indeed the worst-case input, as it will trigger the second recursive call at every level of the main recursion.\n\n### Step 4: Write and Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation\n\nIn the worst case, the `if` condition is always met, and the second recursive call is always made. The recurrence relation becomes:\n\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\nThe base case is `T(1) = c'` (a constant amount of work).\n\nLet's solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n`T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n`T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n...\nAfter `k` steps:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\nThe sum `2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0` is a geometric series which equals `2^k - 1`.\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nTo reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This is an exponential time complexity, making the algorithm highly inefficient for all but the smallest inputs. The algorithm does terminate because `n` decreases in each recursive call.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
