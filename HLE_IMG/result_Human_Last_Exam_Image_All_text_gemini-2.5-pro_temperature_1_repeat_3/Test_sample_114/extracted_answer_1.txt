The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the starting material, N-acetyl-proline, has a cyclic structure. This rigid five-membered ring covalently tethers the nitrogen atom and the α-carbon, which form the N3 and C4 positions of the intermediate münchnone dipole, respectively. This structural constraint physically prevents a substituent-scrambling process that occurs in the flexible, acyclic systems of Reactions 1 and 2.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial to this rationale. Reaction 1, which produces a single product A, establishes that the [3+2] cycloaddition step is itself inherently regioselective. However, the ¹³C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 reveals that for the acyclic starting material, the identities of the substituents that become attached to C2 and C5 of the final pyrrole product are scrambled in a 1:1 ratio prior to the cycloaddition. This explains the comment that "no regioselectivity" is observed in the labeling, as the label's final position does not reflect its origin.

In Reaction 3, because the scrambling pathway is blocked by the proline ring, the unambiguous and asymmetric münchnone intermediate can only react via the intrinsically favored regiochemical pathway established in Reaction 1. This results in the exclusive formation of a single regioisomer, Product B.
