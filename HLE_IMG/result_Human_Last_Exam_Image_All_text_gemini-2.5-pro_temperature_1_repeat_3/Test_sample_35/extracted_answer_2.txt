The protein S100B binds to the V, C1, and C2 domains of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels are directly linked to the activation of pathways causing neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis, which allows it to predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.
