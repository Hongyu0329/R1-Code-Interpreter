    "This problem describes the acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a triterpenoid alcohol, specifically friedelan-3β-ol. This reaction is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, often referred to as a \"backbone rearrangement\" in steroid and terpene chemistry. The reaction proceeds through a series of consecutive [1,2] shifts of methyl groups and hydride ions. To determine the substituents at the indicated positions (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in the final product, we must trace the movement of these groups throughout the reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Formation of the Initial Carbocation:** The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group at carbon C3 by the acid catalyst (HCl). This converts the -OH group into a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺). The departure of a water molecule generates a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n2.  **The [1,2] Shift Cascade (Backbone Rearrangement):** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of rearrangements to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This cascade propagates the positive charge across the fused ring system.\n\n    *   **Shift 1: [1,2]-methyl shift.** A methyl group from the adjacent quaternary carbon C4 migrates to the C3 carbocation. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n        *   *Result:* C4 now has one methyl group and a positive charge. C3 now has a methyl group that has migrated.\n\n    *   **Shift 2: [1,2]-hydride shift.** A hydride ion (H⁻) from C5 migrates to the C4 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C5, which is also a tertiary position.\n        *   *Result:* C4 now has one methyl group and one hydrogen. The original substituent at C5 (H) has moved.\n\n    *   **Shift 3: [1,2]-methyl shift.** The methyl group at C10 migrates to the C5 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C10 (tertiary).\n        *   *Result:* C5 now has a methyl group. The original substituent at C10 (CH₃) has moved.\n\n    *   **Shift 4: [1,2]-hydride shift.** A hydride from C9 migrates to the C10 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C9 (tertiary).\n        *   *Result:* C10 now has a hydrogen. The original substituent at C9 (H) has moved.\n\n    *   **Shift 5: [1,2]-methyl shift.** The methyl group at C8 migrates to the C9 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C8 (tertiary).\n        *   *Result:* C9 now has a methyl group. The original substituent at C8 (CH₃) has moved.\n\n    *   **Shift 6: [1,2]-methyl shift.** The methyl group at C14 migrates to the C8 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C14 (tertiary).\n        *   *Result:* C8 now has a methyl group. The original substituent at C14 (CH₃) has moved.\n\n    *   **Shift 7: [1,2]-hydride shift.** A hydride from C13 migrates to the C14 carbocation. The positive charge moves to C13 (tertiary).\n        *   *Result:* C14 now has a hydrogen. The original substituent at C13 (H) has moved.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Final Product (Elimination):** The rearrangement cascade terminates with the carbocation at C13. A proton is then eliminated from an adjacent carbon to form a stable alkene. The product shown has a double bond between C12 and C13, which is formed by the removal of a proton from C12.\n\n**Determination of the Substituents:**\n\nNow we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position by considering which group moved away and which group moved in.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 started with two methyl groups. One methyl group migrated to C3 in the first shift. A hydrogen atom then migrated from C5 to C4. Thus, the final substituents at C4 are one methyl group and one hydrogen atom. The label \"1\" points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C10):** C10 started with a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C5. A hydrogen atom then migrated from C9 to C10. Thus, the final substituent at C10 is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C5):** C5 started with a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen atom migrated to C4. A methyl group then migrated from C10 to C5. Thus, the final substituent at C5 is a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C8):** C8 started with a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C9. A methyl group then migrated from C14 to C8. Thus, the final substituent at C8 is a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C14):** C14 started with a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C8. A hydrogen atom then migrated from C13 to C14. Thus, the final substituent at C14 is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nCombining these results gives the final answer.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
