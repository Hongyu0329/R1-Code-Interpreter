Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy ball on the twig is a wool sower gall, which is caused by a gall wasp. The female wasp lays her eggs by injecting them into the woody tissue of the oak twig. The gall then forms around the developing larvae. Therefore, the eggs are laid inside the oak twig itself.
