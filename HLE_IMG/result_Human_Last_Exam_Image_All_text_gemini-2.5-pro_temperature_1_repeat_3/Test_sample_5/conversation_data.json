    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece:\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Form:** The music is written on a grand staff, which consists of a treble clef and a bass clef, indicating it is for piano. The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80, a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature has no sharps or flats, which typically signifies C major or its relative minor, A minor. The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Opening (Measures 1-2):**\n    *   The piece begins with a *p* (piano) dynamic, meaning it should be played softly.\n    *   The right hand plays a very distinct and famous lyrical melody: G-A-B-C-B-A-G.\n    *   The left hand provides a gentle, chordal accompaniment based on a C major chord.\n    *   This serene and memorable opening is a major clue.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Development (Measures 3 onwards):**\n    *   In measure 3, there is a sudden, dramatic shift. The dynamic changes to *f* (forte), and the texture becomes much more virtuosic. The right hand plays fast sixteenth-note arpeggios, while the left hand plays powerful broken octaves. This contrast between a gentle, song-like theme and a passionate, virtuosic outburst is a hallmark of the Romantic era.\n    *   From measure 4, the dynamic softens to *mp* (mezzo-piano), and the music continues with a flowing, arpeggiated texture in both hands.\n    *   The piece continues to build in intensity and complexity, as seen in the dense chords and intricate passagework in the later measures.\n\n5.  **Putting the Clues Together:**\n    *   The primary clue is the opening melody. It is the iconic theme from Franz Liszt's **\"Liebestraum No. 3\"**.\n    *   The structure of the piece, which alternates between a tender, lyrical theme and highly virtuosic, passionate sections, is perfectly consistent with Liszt's composition.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While the original composition by Liszt is in the key of A-flat major, this sheet music is a transposition to C major. This is a very common practice, especially for arrangements intended to be easier to read or play, as C major has no sharps or flats in its key signature. The fundamental musical identity of the piece remains the same despite the change in key.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe piece is unmistakably \"Liebestraum No. 3\" by Franz Liszt, presented here in a C major arrangement.\n\n<<<Franz Liszt - Liebestraum No. 3>>>"
