    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Data**\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1).\n2.  **Definition of VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It is the total miles traveled by vehicles. To calculate this, we need to consider the number of trips made by cars and the distance of those trips.\n3.  **Key Data Points:**\n    *   **Share of total trips by distance:** This tells us the distribution of all trips across different distance brackets (0-3 miles, 3-5 miles, etc.). This distribution is the same for both scenarios (48%, 22%, 14%, 16%).\n    *   **Mode share by distance:** For each distance bracket, this tells us what percentage of trips are taken by each mode (e.g., car, transit, walk).\n    *   **Average trip distance:** This gives the average mileage for a trip within each distance bracket (1, 4, 7.5, and 20 miles).\n    *   **Car Trip Share:** The total percentage of trips made by car is the sum of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), not PMT (Person Miles Traveled). Therefore, the data on \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is irrelevant for this calculation, as it relates to the number of people in the car, not the miles the car itself travels.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** We cannot simply average the percentages. We must perform a weighted calculation for each distance bracket and then sum the results to get a total VMT index. The VMT contribution of each bracket is `(Share of Total Trips) × (Car Mode Share) × (Average Trip Distance)`.\n*   **Using Correct Data:** The calculation must be done for each distance bracket separately before summing. Using the \"Total\" column for mode share directly would lead to an incorrect result as it does not account for the varying trip distances.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nTo compare the two scenarios, we will calculate a relative VMT index for each. This index represents the average miles traveled by car per trip across the entire system.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Car VMT Index for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe calculate the VMT for each distance bracket and sum them up.\n\n*   **Bracket 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 25% + 28% = 53% (or 0.53)\n    *   VMT Contribution = (48% of total trips) × (53% by car) × (1 mile/trip) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = **0.2544**\n*   **Bracket 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n    *   VMT Contribution = (22% of total trips) × (81% by car) × (4 miles/trip) = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = **0.7128**\n*   **Bracket 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n    *   VMT Contribution = (14% of total trips) × (85% by car) × (7.5 miles/trip) = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = **0.8925**\n*   **Bracket 10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n    *   VMT Contribution = (16% of total trips) × (89% by car) × (20 miles/trip) = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Car VMT Index for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation with the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **Bracket 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = **0.0144**\n*   **Bracket 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = **0.2376**\n*   **Bracket 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = **0.4305**\n*   **Bracket 10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    *   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) × 100%\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
