    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image is a depiction on an ancient Greek vase, specifically an Apulian red-figure volute-krater from Southern Italy, dating to the 4th century BCE. The scene is dramatic and involves several figures.\n    *   **The Chariot and Driver:** A chariot is central to the scene. The driver is a figure wearing elaborate, non-Greek (\"oriental\") attire, including a spotted long-sleeved garment and a Phrygian cap. This type of dress in Greek art typically signifies a person from the East, such as Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), Thrace, or Persia. The driver is actively controlling the horse(s).\n    *   **The Passenger:** To the right of the driver is another figure, wrapped in a large white cloak (himation). This figure appears to be a passenger being carried away. The question refers to this figure as \"leaving the chariot,\" which can be interpreted as being carried away from their home or origin in the chariot.\n    *   **The Figure on the Ground:** Beneath the chariot and horse is a nude male figure lying on the ground. His posture suggests he is dead or dying, having been defeated or run over during the action.\n    *   **The Wing:** A large white wing is visible above the chariot, suggesting the presence of a divine or mythological winged being, such as Nike (Victory) or Eros (Love), influencing the event.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Mythological Context:** The combination of these elements points to a specific Greek myth: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oinomaos.\n    *   **The Myth:** King Oinomaos of Pisa would challenge suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. If the suitor won, he would marry Hippodamia; if he lost, Oinomaos would kill him. Pelops, a prince from Lydia (in Anatolia), took on the challenge. He won the race through a combination of divine help and by bribing Oinomaos's charioteer, Myrtilos, to sabotage the king's chariot. As a result, Oinomaos's chariot crashed, and the king was killed.\n    *   **Matching the Myth to the Scene:**\n        *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Pelops**. His \"oriental\" dress reflects his Lydian origin.\n        *   The defeated man on the ground is King **Oinomaos**, killed as his chariot crashed.\n        *   The wing belongs to **Nike**, the goddess of Victory, who would be shown crowning Pelops for his victory.\n        *   Therefore, the passenger being carried away by the victorious Pelops is his prize and new bride, **Hippodamia**. She is \"leaving\" her father's kingdom with Pelops.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the iconographic evidence and the well-known myth of Pelops, the figure leaving the chariot (the passenger) is Hippodamia.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
