    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure**\nAn FCC crystal lattice consists of atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. Let the side length of the cube (the lattice parameter) be 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction corresponds to looking along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. When we view the 3D lattice from this direction, all atoms are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Projected Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nTo find the pattern, we can analyze the positions of atoms in planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These are the {110} planes.\n1.  In an FCC lattice, the (110) planes are stacked in an alternating ABAB... sequence.\n2.  **Layer A:** The atoms in one (110) plane form a rectangular array. The primitive unit cell of this layer is a rectangle with side lengths of `a` and `a√2 / 2`.\n3.  **Layer B:** The atoms in the next (110) plane are also arranged in an identical rectangular array, but they are shifted so that they lie directly above the centers of the rectangles in Layer A.\n4.  **Superposition:** When these two layers are projected on top of each other, the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means there are atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the center of the rectangle.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Aspect Ratio of the Projected Unit Cell**\nThe primitive unit cell of the projected pattern is a rectangle with side lengths `a` and `a√2 / 2`. The aspect ratio (the ratio of the side lengths) is:\n`a / (a√2 / 2) = 2 / √2 = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\nAlternatively, if we consider the larger conventional projected cell, its sides are `a` and `a√2`, which also gives an aspect ratio of `√2` (or `1/√2` depending on orientation).\nSo, we are looking for an image that shows a **centered rectangle pattern** with an aspect ratio of approximately **1.414** or its reciprocal **0.707**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Four Given Images**\nLet's examine each image to see if it matches the expected pattern and aspect ratio.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image clearly shows a centered rectangle pattern. Let's measure the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the corner atoms.\n    *   Width (W) ≈ 4.5 - 1.5 = 3 units.\n    *   Height (H) ≈ 12.5 - 6.5 = 6 units.\n    *   Aspect Ratio = H / W = 6 / 3 = 2.\n    *   This aspect ratio of 2 does not match the required `√2 ≈ 1.414`. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in this image are more scattered, but a centered rectangle pattern can be identified.\n    *   Let's identify the corners and the center of a potential unit cell. The atoms at approximately (2.2, 8.8) and (6.0, 8.8) can form the top edge. The atom at (1.5, 3.2) can be a bottom corner. The central atom is at (4.0, 6.5).\n    *   Let's estimate the rectangle dimensions based on these points. The center should be halfway between the top and bottom edges. `z_center = (z_top + z_bottom)/2`. `6.5 = (8.8 + z_bottom)/2` => `z_bottom = 13 - 8.8 = 4.2`. This is reasonably close to the point at `z=3.2`.\n    *   Width (W) ≈ 6.0 - 2.2 = 3.8 units.\n    *   Height (H) ≈ 8.8 - 4.2 = 4.6 units.\n    *   Aspect Ratio = H / W ≈ 4.6 / 3.8 ≈ 1.21.\n    *   Let's try the other orientation, `W/H`: Aspect Ratio = W / H ≈ 3.8 / 5.6 (using `z_bottom=3.2`) ≈ 0.68.\n    *   This value of 0.68 is very close to the theoretical value of `1/√2 ≈ 0.707`. The small discrepancy can be attributed to plotting inaccuracies or reading the points from the graph. This makes B a strong candidate.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern is not a simple centered rectangle. It has a more complex arrangement with eight distinct projected points in its unit cell (a rectangle with atoms at the corners, midpoints of the vertical sides, and two interior atoms). This does not match the standard primitive cell projection.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image shows two offset rectangular grids of atoms, stacked in an ABAB pattern. This is the characteristic projection of a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure along its c-axis ([0001]), or potentially an FCC structure along [111] (though that should be ABC stacking). It is not the centered rectangle pattern of a [110] projection.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, Image B is the only one that represents a centered rectangular lattice with an aspect ratio consistent with the theoretical projection of an FCC structure along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
