**Product A:** The structure is methyl 1-acetyl-4-((2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate. It is formed via a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by ring-opening of the amidine moiety and subsequent acetylation.

**Product B:** The structure is (5aS,9aS)-8-oxo-5,5a,6,7,8,9-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrolo[1',2'-d]pyrazine-7-carbaldehyde. This product arises from the initial cycloadduct which undergoes further intramolecular cyclization, oxidation, and rearrangement.

**Product C:** The structure is 2-acetyl-2,3,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-5H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-d]pyrazin-5-one. It is a side product formed through the acetylation of the starting material followed by a multi-step intramolecular cyclization.
