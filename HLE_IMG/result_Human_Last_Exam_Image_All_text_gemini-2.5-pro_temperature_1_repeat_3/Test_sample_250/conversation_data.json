    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard's title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Musical Elements**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key is either A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The 'C' symbol after the key signature indicates common time, which is 4/4.\n*   **Tonality:** The first chord is labeled \"F-\" (F minor), and the piece resolves to an F chord at the end. This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe and Analyze the Chord Progression**\nLet's list the chord changes for each section of the tune.\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   | F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |\n    *   | C7 | F- | 1. C7 :|| 2. C7 |\n    *   **Careful Point:** The progression in the first four bars is highly distinctive, featuring a chromatically descending bass line/root motion: F → E → E♭ → D♭. The G7 in measure 4 acts as a secondary dominant (V of V) leading to the C7.\n*   **B Section (Bridge - middle 8 bars):**\n    *   | D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |\n    *   | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |\n    *   **Careful Point:** This progression uses a series of ii-V and V-I patterns that move through different key centers (Dø7-G7 is a ii-V in C minor; C7-F7 is V-I in B♭; B♭-7-E♭7 is a ii-V into A♭). This is a classic bridge structure in jazz standards.\n*   **Final A Section:**\n    *   | F | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭ |\n    *   | G7 | C7 | F | % |\n    *   **Careful Point:** This section repeats the theme from the first A section, leading to the final resolution on F. The chord in the first measure is written as 'F', which could be F major or F minor, but in the context of the piece, F minor is implied until the final chord.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\nLet's look at the melodic contour of the first few bars.\n*   **Measure 1:** The melody moves from F up to C.\n*   **Measure 2:** The melody moves from B up to C.\n*   **Measure 3:** The melody moves from E♭ down to A♭.\n*   **Measure 4:** The melody holds a D♭ and then steps down to B.\n*   **Careful Point:** This melodic sequence, paired with the unique chromatic chord progression, creates a very specific musical signature.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Song**\nBased on the combination of the key (F minor), the distinctive chromatic chord progression in the A section, the classic bridge structure, and the specific melody, this piece can be identified.\n*   The progression and melodic shape are characteristic of the composer Tadd Dameron.\n*   Comparing these elements to his body of work, the piece is a perfect match for the jazz standard **\"On a Misty Night\"**.\n*   The composer is **Tadd Dameron**. The minor differences in the chord chart (like G7 in m. 4 or C7 instead of Cm7 in the bridge) are common variations and reharmonizations used by jazz musicians.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the key, chord progression, and melody confirms the identity of the tune.\n\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
