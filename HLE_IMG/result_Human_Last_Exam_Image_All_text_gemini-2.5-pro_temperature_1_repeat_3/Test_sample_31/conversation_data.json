    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify the knot shown in the diagram.\n1.  **Crossing Number:** By counting the intersections where one part of the rope crosses over or under another, we find there are 7 crossings in this specific diagram.\n2.  **Knot Identification:** While this is a 7-crossing diagram, it does not represent one of the prime knots with a minimal crossing number of 7 (i.e., `7_1` through `7_7`). Instead, this diagram is a well-known, non-minimal projection of a more complex knot. By comparing the diagram to standard knot tables and literature, we can identify it as the **Kinoshita-Terasaka knot**.\n3.  **Knot Table Designation:** The Kinoshita-Terasaka knot is listed in the Rolfsen knot table as `11n42`, which means its minimal crossing number is 11. The provided 7-crossing diagram is a common but simplified representation.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer invariant derived from a branch of mathematics called Khovanov homology. It has several important properties, but the most relevant one for this problem is its relationship with the slice genus.\n1.  **Slice Genus:** The smooth slice genus of a knot `K`, denoted `g_s(K)`, is the minimum possible genus of a smooth, oriented surface embedded in the 4-dimensional ball whose boundary is the knot `K`.\n2.  **Rasmussen's Inequality:** Jacob Rasmussen proved a fundamental inequality connecting his invariant to the slice genus: `|s(K)| ≤ 2 * g_s(K)`. This inequality provides a powerful lower bound on the slice genus.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Properties of the Kinoshita-Terasaka Knot**\n\nThe Kinoshita-Terasaka knot is famous in knot theory for its specific properties.\n1.  **Trivial Alexander Polynomial:** It was one of the first non-trivial knots discovered to have an Alexander polynomial of 1, the same as the unknot.\n2.  **Slice Property:** Most importantly for this question, the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot is a **slice knot**. This is a standard result in knot theory. A knot is defined as \"slice\" if its slice genus is zero (`g_s(K) = 0`). This means the knot can be the boundary of a smooth disk embedded in the 4-ball.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nNow we can combine the information from the previous steps to find the value of the Rasmussen invariant.\n1.  Since the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot (`KT`) is a slice knot, its slice genus is 0: `g_s(KT) = 0`.\n2.  We apply Rasmussen's inequality: `|s(KT)| ≤ 2 * g_s(KT)`.\n3.  Substituting the slice genus value: `|s(KT)| ≤ 2 * 0`, which simplifies to `|s(KT)| ≤ 0`.\n4.  The only integer `x` for which `|x| ≤ 0` is `x = 0`.\n5.  Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot must be 0.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Knot Recognition:** The most critical point is recognizing the knot. Mistaking it for a 7-crossing prime knot would lead to an incorrect answer. The visual structure is characteristic of the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot.\n2.  **Invariant vs. Diagram:** The Rasmussen invariant is an invariant of the knot type, not its specific diagram. The fact that the diagram is non-minimal (7 crossings for an 11-crossing knot) is irrelevant to the final value.\n3.  **Knowledge of Knot Properties:** The solution relies on knowing that the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot is slice. This is external knowledge from the field of knot theory and cannot be easily deduced from the diagram alone without advanced computational tools.\n4.  **Understanding the Theory:** A basic understanding of the definition of the slice genus and its relationship to the Rasmussen invariant (`|s(K)| ≤ 2g_s(K)`) is essential to solve the problem.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nTo summarize the path to the final answer:\n1.  **Identify the knot:** The knot in the image is the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot (`11n42`).\n2.  **State its key property:** The Kinoshita-Terasaka knot is a slice knot.\n3.  **Define slice:** A slice knot has a smooth slice genus of 0 (`g_s(K) = 0`).\n4.  **Apply Rasmussen's theorem:** The Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` is bounded by the slice genus: `|s(K)| ≤ 2 * g_s(K)`.\n5.  **Compute the result:** For the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot, `|s(K)| ≤ 2 * 0`, which means `|s(K)| ≤ 0`. This forces `s(K) = 0`.\n\n<<<0>>>"
