    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question's Text:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of a perceptual phenomenon.\n    *   This phenomenon is described as an illusion.\n    *   It is compared to the Necker Cube, which is a classic example of a bistable visual illusion rooted in Gestalt principles of perception. This comparison suggests the phenomenon involves the brain organizing ambiguous sensory input into a stable, coherent perception.\n    *   It is described as a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability,\" implying it's a fundamental process of our sensory system that operates automatically.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Image Content:**\n    *   The image consists of two graphs, which typically represent a sound in different ways.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows frequency over time. There is a strong, thin horizontal line, representing a pure tone at a constant frequency. In the middle, there is a wide, vertical blur, representing a burst of noise that contains many frequencies. Crucially, the horizontal line for the tone appears to continue *uninterrupted* through the noise burst. This visual represents the *perception* of the sound.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, it shows a perfect, regular sine wave, which is the waveform of a pure tone. This wave is then abruptly interrupted and replaced by a more complex, irregular waveform, which represents the noise. This graph shows the *physical stimulus* that is actually presented.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The physical reality (bottom graph) is that a tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then (in the classic experiment) the tone resumes.\n    *   The perceived reality (suggested by the top graph and the nature of the illusion) is that the tone continues seamlessly *behind* or *through* the noise.\n    *   The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, creating an illusion of continuity. This is a classic example of a perceptual completion or restoration effect.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   This auditory illusion is known by a general name and a more specific, famous example.\n    *   The general phenomenon, which applies to any sound (tones, music, etc.), is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It's a principle within the broader theory of Auditory Scene Analysis, explaining how we perceive sounds as continuous streams even when they are momentarily obscured.\n    *   A specific and very famous example of this illusion occurs with speech sounds (phonemes). When a phoneme in a word is replaced by a non-speech sound like a cough or static, listeners perceive the word as complete. This is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Most Accurate Answer:**\n    *   The image explicitly uses a pure tone (represented by the sine wave and the single-frequency line in the spectrogram), not speech.\n    *   The question describes the phenomenon in general terms (\"perceptual ability\") rather than referencing speech or language.\n    *   Therefore, while the Phonemic Restoration Effect is an example of this ability, the most accurate and general name for the phenomenon depicted is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe core phenomenon is the brain's ability to perceptually restore an interrupted sound when the interruption is filled by another sound, like noise. The image uses a non-speech tone as the example. The general scientific term for this phenomenon is the Auditory Continuity Illusion. The Phonemic Restoration Effect is a well-known subtype of this illusion that applies specifically to speech. Given the visual evidence, the more general and accurate term is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
