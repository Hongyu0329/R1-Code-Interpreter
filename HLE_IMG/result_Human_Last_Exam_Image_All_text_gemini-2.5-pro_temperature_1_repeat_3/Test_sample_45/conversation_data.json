    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times an object or pattern looks identical when rotated 360 degrees around a central point. If a pattern looks the same after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees, it is said to have n-fold rotational symmetry. The number 'n' is the order of rotation. For a repeating planar tiling (like the one shown), the possible orders of rotational symmetry are restricted to 2, 3, 4, and 6 by the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate it and have it match its original appearance. The most likely candidates for centers of rotation are the centers of the geometric shapes that make up the tiling. The tiling appears to be made of blue hexagons, yellow squares, and rhombuses (colored yellow and orange).\n\n**Step 3: Test for 6-fold Rotational Symmetry**\nLet's choose the center of one of the blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n*   **The central tile:** The blue tile is a regular hexagon, which by itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Surrounding tiles:** The blue hexagon is surrounded by a ring of six identical rhombuses. If we rotate the pattern by 60 degrees (360°/6) around the center of the hexagon, each rhombus moves into the position previously occupied by its neighbor.\n*   **Next layer of tiles:** The ring of rhombuses is surrounded by a ring of six yellow squares. The same 60-degree rotation also moves each of these squares into the position of its neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the arrangement of tiles around the center of a blue hexagon remains unchanged after a 60-degree rotation, the entire periodic pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry about this point.\n\n**Step 4: Test for Other Possible Symmetries**\nWhile we have already found the highest possible rotational symmetry for a periodic tiling, it is useful to confirm other symmetries exist.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** Let's choose the center of a yellow square. The square is surrounded by four rhombuses. Rotating the pattern by 90 degrees (360°/4) around the square's center maps each rhombus to its neighbor. The next layer of shapes consists of four blue hexagons, which are also interchanged by this rotation. Therefore, the tiling also has points of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **3-fold and 2-fold symmetry:** The pattern also has points of 3-fold symmetry (at the vertices where three tiles meet) and 2-fold symmetry (at the midpoints of edges between tiles).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nThe rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the highest order of rotation that can be found anywhere in the pattern. In this case, we have found points with 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry. The highest of these is 6-fold.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   The rotational symmetry of the entire pattern is not necessarily the same as the symmetry of a single tile. We must consider how the tiles are arranged together.\n*   When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to provide the highest order of symmetry present.\n*   Visually confirm that a rotation maps not just the immediate tiles but the entire surrounding pattern correctly. In this pattern, rotating 60 degrees around a hexagon's center maps every tile in the pattern onto an identical tile.\n*   The different colors (yellow vs. orange rhombuses) must also be respected by the symmetry operation. The arrangement of colors also exhibits the 6-fold symmetry.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
