    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Reading Order:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left. This seal has four characters arranged in a 2x2 grid, so we will read the right column first (top character, then bottom character), followed by the left column (top character, then bottom character).\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in Seal Script):**\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This character is 讀 (dú). It is composed of the radical for \"speech\" (言) and the phonetic component 賣. This character means \"to read\".\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This character is 書 (shū). The top part represents a hand holding a brush, and the bottom part is 曰 (yuē, meaning \"to say\" or representing a book). This character means \"book\".\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This character is 不 (bù). This is a stylized, ancient form of the character meaning \"not\".\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This character is 倦 (juàn). It is composed of the radical for \"person\" (人) on top and the component 卷 (juàn) on the bottom. This character means \"tired\" or \"weary\".\n\n3.  **Assembling the Phrase:** Reading in the correct order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left), the characters form the phrase 讀書不倦 (dú shū bù juàn).\n\n4.  **Meaning and Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   The phrase 讀書不倦 is a well-known idiom that means \"to read/study tirelessly\" or \"to be an avid reader who never gets tired of books.\"\n    *   To convert this to simplified Chinese:\n        *   讀 becomes 读.\n        *   書 becomes 书.\n        *   不 remains 不.\n        *   倦 remains 倦.\n    *   Therefore, the phrase in simplified Chinese is **读书不倦**.\n\n<<<读书不倦>>>"
