    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical transformation to identify the two pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), an alkene.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This is a crucial piece of information for determining the allowed pericyclic pathways according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **Information from the question:** We are told that two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in sequence to form the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the First Pericyclic Reaction**\n*   Aromatic compounds like benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization. A common photochemical reaction of hexafluorobenzene is its conversion to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n*   **Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n*   **Classification:** This transformation can be viewed as the closure of a 4π-electron system (two of the double bonds of a Kekulé structure of benzene) to form a cyclobutene ring and a new sigma bond. This type of reaction, where a conjugated π-system forms a cyclic system by creating a sigma bond across its ends, is defined as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n*   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For a 4π-electron system, an electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed if it proceeds via a disrotatory pathway. This is a well-established photochemical process.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The first pericyclic reaction is a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n**Step 3: Propose the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\n*   The intermediate from the first step is hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This strained molecule reacts with cyclobutene to form the final product.\n*   **Reactants for Step 2:** Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene + Cyclobutene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reaction between two molecules to form a single, larger cyclic molecule. This is characteristic of a **cycloaddition** reaction.\n*   **Analysis of the specific cycloaddition:** The final product shown is a complex, linearly fused tricyclic system. Simple [2π+2π] or [4π+2π] cycloadditions between hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and cyclobutene lead to cage-like structures, not the one depicted. However, detailed studies of this reaction have shown that the product is indeed formed through a more complex, but still concerted, pericyclic reaction.\n*   The proposed mechanism involves the participation of two π-bonds (one from each reactant) and one strained σ-bond (the bridgehead bond in hexafluoro-Dewar benzene). This is a higher-order cycloaddition, specifically a [π2 + π2 + σ2] cycloaddition. This is a 6-electron process that is photochemically allowed if it proceeds with the correct stereochemical pathway (one antarafacial component, i.e., [π2s + π2s + σ2a]).\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Regardless of the complexity, the reaction is fundamentally a **cycloaddition**, where two molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nCombining the analysis of both steps, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (the isomerization of hexafluorobenzene).\n2.  A **cycloaddition** (the reaction of the intermediate with cyclobutene).\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition>>>"
