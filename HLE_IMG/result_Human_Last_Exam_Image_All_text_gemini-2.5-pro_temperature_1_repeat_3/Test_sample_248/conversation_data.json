    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Image:** The photograph displays a community of marine invertebrates on a wet, dark rock, characteristic of an intertidal zone (the area between high and low tide marks). Several species are visible.\n\n2.  **Identification of Organisms:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** The rock is heavily colonized by acorn barnacles. These are the small, volcano-shaped, whitish-grey shells cemented to the rock.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two distinct types of snails.\n        *   Two larger snails are prominent in the center. They have conical shells. One is whitish and somewhat eroded, while the other is light brown with faint spiral stripes.\n        *   Several smaller, darker snails with ribbed shells are also present.\n    *   **Tiny Spheres:** There are numerous tiny, light-colored, spherical objects scattered on the rock surface, possibly the egg masses of snails or newly settled barnacle spat.\n\n3.  **Addressing the Core of the Question:** The question requires identifying a single species that proves the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast rather than the Pacific Coast of North America. This means we need to find a species present in the photo that is native to or well-established on the Atlantic coast but is not found (or is not a common, established species) on the Pacific coast.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Candidate Species:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** Many common barnacle species on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts look very similar. For instance, the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*) of the Atlantic can be difficult to distinguish from the Acorn Barnacle (*Balanus glandula*) of the Pacific from a photograph alone. Therefore, the barnacles are not a definitive indicator.\n    *   **Small, Dark Snails:** These could be Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*). However, this species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, so it cannot be used as a definitive indicator.\n    *   **Large Snails:** The two larger snails are identifiable as the Common Periwinkle. Key features include their size (up to 3-4 cm), robust and conical shell, and coloration.\n\n5.  **Focusing on the Definitive Indicator:** The Common Periwinkle provides the answer.\n    *   **Scientific Name:** *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   **Geographic Distribution:** This species is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and has since become one of the most common and abundant intertidal snails from Canada down to Maryland.\n    *   **Pacific Coast Status:** *Littorina littorea* is *not* a native or established species on the Pacific coast of North America. While isolated individuals have occasionally been reported (e.g., in San Francisco Bay), it has not established widespread, breeding populations.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these prominent Common Periwinkles in a typical intertidal community is a definitive indicator that the photograph was taken on a North Atlantic shore.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The species that serves as the definitive geographic marker is the Common Periwinkle, and its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
