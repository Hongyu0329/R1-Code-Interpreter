    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\nThe first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard (on the right) receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man (on the left) at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major award ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man on the right strongly resembles Nikita Kucherov, a Russian hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov won multiple trophies, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (Most Outstanding Player), and the Art Ross Trophy (Top Point Scorer). The man on the left presenting the award is identifiable as NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n*   The connection to a hockey player is crucial, as it brings to mind the term \"hat trick,\" the act of scoring three goals in one game.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical industrial process. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to process fur into felt for making hats.\n*   This process, known as \"carroting,\" was highly toxic and caused mercury poisoning among the workers, who were known as \"hatters.\" The neurological symptoms gave rise to the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Therefore, the object that has \"almost ceased to be used\" in this toxic form is the **Felt Hat**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\nWe need to find a single two-word term, \"X Y,\" that satisfies both clues. Based on Step 2, the most likely candidate for \"X Y\" is \"Felt Hat.\"\n\n*   **Checking \"Felt Hat\" against Clue 2:** \"Another Felt Hat has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This fits perfectly. The practice of making felt hats using mercury has been discontinued due to its health risks.\n\n*   **Checking \"Felt Hat\" against Clue 1:** \"Felt Hat is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" This requires a metaphorical interpretation. A literal felt hat is not visible. However, the person pictured is a hockey player (Nikita Kucherov). The term \"hat trick\" in hockey refers to scoring three goals. The tradition of the \"hat trick\" originated in cricket, where a player who accomplished the feat was rewarded with a new hat from his club. Historically, this would have been a felt hat. Thus, the hockey player, celebrated for his scoring prowess which includes hat tricks, serves as a modern embodiment of this tradition. In this sense, the concept of the \"Felt Hat\" (as the original prize) is represented by the player being honored.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of the hockey player's connection to the \"hat trick\" tradition and the historical use of mercury in making felt hats, the term \"Felt Hat\" logically connects both clues.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
