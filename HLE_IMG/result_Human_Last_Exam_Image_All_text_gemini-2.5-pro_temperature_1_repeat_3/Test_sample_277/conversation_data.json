    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided image:** The image is completely black. There are no chemical structures, formulas, or names of any molecules displayed.\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to determine the type of isomeric relationship between \"the molecules mentioned above\". The phrase \"mentioned above\" refers to the content within the image.\n3.  **Identify the problem:** Since the image is empty and contains no molecules, there is no information to analyze. We cannot compare any molecules because none are provided.\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers (conformational isomers):** To determine if molecules are conformers, we need to see their structures and check if they can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. We cannot do this as no molecules are shown.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** To determine if molecules are constitutional isomers, we need to know their molecular formulas and their atomic connectivity. We cannot do this as no molecules are shown.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if molecules are identical, we need to see their structures and check if they are superimposable. We cannot do this as no molecules are shown.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** To determine if molecules are stereoisomers, we need to compare their structures to see if they have the same connectivity but a different spatial arrangement of atoms. We cannot do this as no molecules are shown.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** This option is the only logical choice. Since no molecules are provided, it is impossible to classify their relationship as any of the specific types of isomers listed in options (a), (b), (c), or (d). The question is unanswerable with the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe question is based on a false premise that there are molecules shown in the image. Because no molecules are presented for comparison, none of the specific classifications apply. Therefore, the correct answer is \"None of these\".\n\n<<<E>>>"
