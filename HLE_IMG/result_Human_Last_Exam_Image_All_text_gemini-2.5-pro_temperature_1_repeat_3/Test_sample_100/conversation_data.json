    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Let's break it down to find its molecular formula.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. Let's count the atoms in the unsubstituted, de-aminated core: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This has 7 carbons. In our molecule, one carbon (at position 2) is replaced by a nitrogen atom. So the core skeleton (excluding the substituents and the hydrogen on the nitrogen) is C6H5O. Let's verify the hydrogens: C1(H), C4(H), C6(H), C7(H2). Total is 5H. This is correct.\n*   There are two substituents:\n    1.  A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to C5. The formula for this group is CF3.\n    2.  A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) attached to the nitrogen atom. The structure is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. The formula for the PMB group is C8H9O.\n*   Now, let's assemble the molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 (from core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (from core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3 (from CF3)\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1 (from the ring)\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from the carbonyl C=O) + 1 (from PMB) = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this case, it will deprotect the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed from the nitrogen, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** We subtract the atoms of the PMB group and add one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Change = - (C8H9O) + H = -C8H8O\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C).\n*   **Transformation:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** + H2\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. The starting molecule for this step, Intermediate 2, is a lactam (a cyclic amide). Hydrolysis will cleave the amide bond (the N-C=O bond).\n*   **Transformation:** The lactam ring opens up by adding one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2). The overall product is an amino acid.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** + H2O\n*   **Formula of the Product:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    (Note: In the acidic solution, the amine group will be protonated to -NH3+, but the molecular formula is typically reported for the neutral molecule unless specified otherwise.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy tracking the changes in atoms through each step of the reaction sequence, the molecular formula of the final product is determined to be C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
