    "*   **Step 1: Identify the core question.** The question asks which of the four depicted iridium complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Shorter lifetime implies lower stability and faster degradation of the device.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.** All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general structure `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   The central metal ion is Iridium(III).\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this part is constant, it will not be the primary factor in differentiating the lifetimes of the four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups are generally added to improve solubility and film-forming properties and to prevent aggregation, which are factors that can improve performance and stability.\n    *   The `C^N` ligands are cyclometalating ligands derived from 2-phenylpyridine. This is the part that varies among the four complexes. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the strength of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand, which is often the weakest point susceptible to degradation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the differences in the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands.**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring is substituted with two fluorine atoms, one at the ortho-position (position 2') and one at the para-position (position 4') relative to the C-C bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. The phenyl ring is unsubstituted. This serves as the baseline reference.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has one fluorine atom at the ortho-position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has one fluorine atom at the para-position.\n\n*   **Step 4: Relate ligand structure to complex stability and lifetime.** The operational stability of such iridium complexes is strongly influenced by the strength of the Ir-C bond. A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a more robust complex that is less prone to degradation, resulting in a longer device lifetime.\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom and acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    *   Placing EWGs on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligand strengthens the Ir-C Ïƒ-bond. This increased bond strength enhances the overall stability of the complex against chemical and electrochemical degradation.\n    *   The position of the fluorine substituent is crucial. Ortho-fluorination (at the 2' position) is known to be particularly effective in enhancing stability. This is attributed not only to the strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect but also to steric shielding of the reactive Ir-C bond.\n    *   Para-fluorination (at the 4' position) also strengthens the Ir-C bond through its electron-withdrawing effect, but this effect is generally less pronounced than that of an ortho-fluoro substituent in terms of improving operational stability.\n    *   The unsubstituted ligand (no fluorine) will form the weakest Ir-C bond among the options.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the four complexes and rank their expected lifetimes.**\n    *   **Complex 2 (unsubstituted):** Lacks any stabilizing fluorine substituents. It is expected to have the weakest Ir-C bond and therefore the lowest stability and the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4 (para-F):** Has one fluorine atom in the para position. This provides some stabilization compared to Complex 2, so its lifetime should be longer than that of Complex 2.\n    *   **Complex 3 (ortho-F):** Has one fluorine atom in the ortho position. This provides significant stabilization due to the powerful ortho effect. Its lifetime is expected to be substantially longer than that of Complexes 2 and 4.\n    *   **Complex 1 (ortho-F and para-F):** Has two fluorine atoms, including the highly effective ortho-substituent. This combination provides the strongest electron-withdrawing effect and the most significant stabilization. It is expected to have the longest lifetime.\n\n    Therefore, the expected order of operational lifetime is: **Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 4 > Complex 2**.\n\n*   **Step 6: Answer the question.** The question asks for the complexes with **shorter** lifetimes. Based on the ranking, Complexes 2 and 4 are the least stable and will exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3, which are stabilized by the crucial ortho-fluoro substituent. Thus, the correct answer should include both Complex 2 and Complex 4.\n\n*   **Step 7: Match with the given options.** The option that includes both Complex 2 and Complex 4 is [2, 4].\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n- Stability is primarily determined by the strength of the Ir-C bond.\n- Fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring strengthen this bond.\n- The order of stabilizing effect is: 2,4-diF > 2-F > 4-F > no-F.\n- This leads to a lifetime ranking of: Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 4 > Complex 2.\n- The complexes with shorter lifetimes are therefore Complex 2 and Complex 4.\n\n<<<I>>>"
