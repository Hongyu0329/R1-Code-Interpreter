    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork detail.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a round relief sculpture, known as a tondo, set within a larger, ornate frame. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The material, judging by the smooth, modeled surfaces and high relief, is likely glazed terracotta, a medium popularized during this period.\n2.  **Identify the subject matter:** The central scene depicts a Christian sacrament. A priest is shown administering communion to several kneeling figures, including a young boy at the forefront. This scene represents the Eucharist, or Holy Communion.\n3.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a cartouche with a visible inscription. The text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\". This is a mix of Latin and Old Italian/French, which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject as the Eucharist.\n4.  **Connect style and medium to a specific workshop:** The technique of glazed terracotta relief sculpture is strongly and famously associated with the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence during the 15th and early 16th centuries. The founder was Luca della Robbia, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, continued and expanded the workshop's production. The style of the figures and the overall composition are highly consistent with their work.\n5.  **Research the specific artwork:** By searching for \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL,\" we can identify the specific work this detail belongs to. This tondo is one of seven that form the predella (the base panel) of a large altarpiece. The altarpiece is known as the *Altarpiece of the Sacraments* or the *Altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin*.\n6.  **Identify the author and location:** Art historical sources attribute this entire altarpiece, including the predella with the seven sacraments, to **Andrea della Robbia**. It was created around 1490 and is located in the church of Santi Apostoli e Biagio in Pistoia, Italy.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   It's important to distinguish between the work of Luca della Robbia and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia. While their styles are related, this specific altarpiece is consistently attributed to Andrea.\n*   The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\" is a key clue that directly names the subject, making identification easier.\n*   The format of a tondo within a larger altarpiece predella is a common feature in Renaissance art, and recognizing this helps pinpoint the specific work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the style, medium, inscription, and historical records, the author of this detail from the Altarpiece of the Sacraments is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
