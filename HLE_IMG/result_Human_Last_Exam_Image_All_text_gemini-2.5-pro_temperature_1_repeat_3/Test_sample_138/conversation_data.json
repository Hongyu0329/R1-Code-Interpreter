    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Order Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** This is often the most reliable feature. Males typically have longer antennae with more segments (usually 13) than females (usually 12). In some groups, like paper wasps, the tips of male antennae are curled. In long-horned bees, the male antennae are exceptionally long.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have a stinger (a modified ovipositor) and typically 6 visible upper abdominal segments (tergites). Males lack a stinger and usually have 7 visible tergites. The shape of the abdominal tip can also be a key indicator.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), which are absent or reduced in females.\n*   **Scopae:** These are specialized pollen-carrying hairs, usually on the hind legs or underside of the abdomen. They are present only on non-parasitic females. The question states the images are from taxa without scopae on their legs, which points towards wasps, cuckoo bees (which are parasitic and lack scopae), or bees that carry pollen internally or on their abdomen.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees**\nThese bees are likely cuckoo bees (e.g., *Coelioxys* or *Triepeolus*). Female cuckoo bees don't collect pollen and thus lack scopae. They are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is strongly tapered to a sharp point. This is a characteristic feature of a female cuckoo bee of the genus *Coelioxys*. This modified abdomen is used to pierce the nests of her host bee to lay an egg.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen is blunter and does not taper to a sharp point. This abdominal shape is typical of a male cuckoo bee. The antennae also appear longer relative to the head than the insect on the left.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps**\nThese are paper wasps (genus *Polistes*). Wasps do not have scopae. The most telling feature for sexing them is the antennae.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The tips of the antennae are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight from base to tip. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees**\nThese appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*). In this group, the difference in antenna length between sexes is extreme and the most reliable trait for identification. (Note: Female long-horned bees *do* have scopae, so the prompt's statement might be slightly misleading or refer to the fact that males and cuckoo bees lack them. We rely on the most obvious morphological traits).\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):** The antennae are exceptionally long, extending far behind the head. The face (clypeus) is also pale yellow. Both are classic features of a male long-horned bee.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** The antennae are short, of typical length for a bee, barely reaching the back of the head. This is definitive for a female of this group.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   Pair A is (F, M), which is index **4**.\n*   Pair B is (M, F), which is index **3**.\n*   Pair C is (M, F), which is index **3**.\n\nCombining these gives the final sequence.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
