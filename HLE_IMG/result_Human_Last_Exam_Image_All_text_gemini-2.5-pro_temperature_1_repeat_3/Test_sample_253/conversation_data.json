    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange organism with a leafy (foliose) structure growing on a rock. It features small, disc-like structures, which are apothecia (reproductive structures). This morphology, combined with the color and habitat (growing on rocks), is characteristic of the lichen species *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. The information that the picture was taken in Acadia National Park supports this identification, as this species is common in coastal environments.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the protein in question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\". A lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga and/or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). Proteins are encoded by the genes of these constituent organisms. XPH1 stands for *Xanthoria parietina* Hydrophobin 1. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins produced by filamentous fungi, in this case, the mycobiont of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the protein sequence information in a biological database.**\nTo find the number of amino acids, we need to consult a public protein database like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt (Universal Protein Resource). We will search for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Retrieve and analyze the data.**\n*   A search in the UniProt database for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" yields the entry with accession number **P82946**.\n*   This entry is for the protein \"Hydrophobin-1\" from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   The database entry provides detailed information about the protein, including its amino acid sequence.\n*   Under the \"Sequence\" section of the UniProt entry, the length of the protein is explicitly stated.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\nAccording to the UniProt database entry P82946 (and the corresponding NCBI entry CAA65111.1), the full sequence of the *Xanthoria parietina* Hydrophobin-1 (XPH1) protein consists of **99 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the lichen. The distinctive yellow color, foliose growth form, and presence of apothecia are key visual clues. The location information helps to confirm the identification.\n*   **Protein Identification:** The abbreviation \"XPH1\" must be correctly interpreted as Hydrophobin 1 from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Data Source:** Relying on established and reputable biological databases like UniProt or NCBI is essential for obtaining accurate molecular information.\n*   **Reading the Data:** Ensure you are looking at the length of the full, mature protein sequence and not a precursor or partial sequence. Both UniProt and NCBI confirm the length of 99 amino acids for the complete protein.\n\n<<<99>>>"
