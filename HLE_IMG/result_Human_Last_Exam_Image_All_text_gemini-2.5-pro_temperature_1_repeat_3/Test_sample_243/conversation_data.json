    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key features of the plant in the image.**\nThe most prominent feature of the plant in the photograph is its leaves. The leaves are:\n*   Dark green in color.\n*   Elliptical or ovate in shape.\n*   Characterized by a very distinct and intricate network of silvery-white or cream-colored veins. This pattern is known as reticulated venation and gives the leaf a \"marbled\" or \"mosaic\" appearance.\n*   The plant appears to have a shrub-like or vine-like growth habit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant based on its features.**\nThe unique leaf venation is the primary clue for identification. This pattern is characteristic of the juvenile form of a plant known as Marbleleaf. The botanical name for this plant is *Parsonsia capsularis*, and sometimes it is also associated with the closely related *Parsonsia heterophylla*. The specific form with this striking venation is often referred to as *Parsonsia capsularis* 'Alboflavescens'. Its common names include Marbleleaf, Kaihua, and New Zealand Jasmine.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\nThe term \"endemic\" means that a species is exclusively found in a specific geographic area. To answer the question, we need to find out where *Parsonsia capsularis* is endemic. Botanical sources and databases confirm that *Parsonsia capsularis* is a species native to and found only in New Zealand.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the specific question about the island.**\nThe question asks for the name of the island where this plant is endemic. New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island and the South Island—and more than 700 smaller islands. *Parsonsia capsularis* is found throughout the main islands of New Zealand (North, South, and Stewart Island). Therefore, the plant is endemic to the islands of New Zealand.\n\n<<<New Zealand>>>"
