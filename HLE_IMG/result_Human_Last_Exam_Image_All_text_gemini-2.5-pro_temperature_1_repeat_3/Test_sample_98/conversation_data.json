    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the medallion.**\n    The image provided is a black and white photograph of a metal medallion. It has a circular main body and a rectangular suspension loop or tab at the top. The medallion features two figures in relief, positioned side-by-side. The figure on the left is more prominent and detailed. This figure has a distinctive hairstyle, arranged in structured, parallel curls that form a cap-like shape, often referred to as a \"helmet hairstyle\" (Topfhelmfrisur). The facial features, particularly the large, wide-open, staring eyes and the formalized expression, are notable. The figure on the right is less clear but appears to be a female companion, possibly with a simpler hairstyle or a veil. The overall artistic style is not naturalistic in the classical Greek or early Roman sense; instead, it is more abstract, stylized, and blocky.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artistic period based on style.**\n    The stylistic features observed—the rigid poses, the large staring eyes, the non-classical proportions, and especially the \"helmet hairstyle\"—are hallmarks of Late Roman art. This style began to emerge during the Tetrarchy (late 3rd century AD) and became dominant in the 4th century AD under Constantine the Great and his successors. It represents a deliberate move away from classical realism towards a more symbolic and hierarchical representation of power, particularly in imperial portraiture. The focus is on conveying authority and a remote, divine-like status rather than individual personality.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the specific artifact and its context.**\n    This medallion is known to archaeologists as the \"Mursa Medallion,\" discovered in Mursa (modern Osijek, Croatia). It is a gold medallion, and such objects were often distributed by the emperor as gifts (donativa) to high-ranking officials or military officers. It is sometimes interpreted as a marriage medallion. The style is highly comparable to other known 4th-century imperial artworks, such as the portraits of the Tetrarchs in Venice and medallions found in the Szilágysomlyó Treasure, which feature emperors like Valentinian I (r. 364-375) and Valens (r. 364-378).\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the dating.**\n    Based on the distinct artistic style, which is characteristic of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, and comparisons with other securely dated artifacts from the period, archaeologists and art historians firmly place this medallion in the 4th century AD. More specifically, it is often dated to the second half of the 4th century AD. Therefore, the century to which the medallion is ascribed is the 4th century AD.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Distinguish the Late Roman style from earlier, more naturalistic Roman portraiture.\n    *   Recognize the specific hairstyle (\"helmet hairstyle\") as a key chronological marker for the 4th century.\n    *   Note that the large, staring eyes are a defining feature of this period's art, transitioning towards Byzantine iconography.\n    *   The object is a high-status item, likely related to the imperial court, which is why it reflects the official artistic style of the era.\n    *   Avoid confusing this with \"barbarian\" or Migration Period art; this is a product of Late Roman workshops.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
