The image displays a fungus characterized by a polymorphic morphology. Specifically, it shows both oval, budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated yeast cells with characteristic constrictions at the septa. This combination of budding yeasts and pseudohyphae is the classic presentation of an infection by a *Candida* species, most likely *Candida albicans*. The stain used is likely Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains the fungal cell walls magenta against a blue-stained tissue background.
