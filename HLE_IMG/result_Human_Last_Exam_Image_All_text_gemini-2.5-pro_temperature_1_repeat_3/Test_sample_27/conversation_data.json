    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Painting for Clues:** The primary clue to an artist's identity is often their signature on the artwork.\n2.  **Locate the Signature:** The signature is located in the bottom right corner of the painting.\n3.  **Decipher the Signature:** By examining the signature, especially with the help of the last cropped image which provides a clearer view, we can make out two parts: a name and a date. The name appears to be \"Augusto Pina\". The date is written as \"'38\", which indicates the year 1938.\n4.  **Formulate a Research Query:** Based on the signature, the artist is likely named Augusto Pina, and he was active in or before 1938. A search can be conducted for \"artist Augusto Pina\".\n5.  **Conduct Research and Verify:** A search for \"Augusto Pina\" leads to the Portuguese modernist painter Augusto do Souto Mayor de Pina (1870–1959). He was known for signing his works as \"Augusto Pina\".\n6.  **Confirm the Artwork:** A reverse image search or a search for \"Augusto Pina watercolor 1938\" confirms that this specific painting, often titled \"Paisagem com Mar\" (Landscape with Sea), is indeed a work by him and is dated 1938. The style is consistent with his other landscape watercolors.\n7.  **Determine the Full Name:** The research confirms that while he signed his work \"Augusto Pina,\" his full name is Augusto do Souto Mayor de Pina.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Signature Interpretation:** Artist signatures can be highly stylized and difficult to read. It's crucial to look closely and consider possible variations of letters. The cropped images were very helpful in this case.\n*   **Signature vs. Full Name:** Artists often use a shortened or professional name for their signature. The question specifically asks for the \"full name,\" which requires additional research beyond just reading the signature.\n*   **Dating the Artwork:** The date \"'38\" is a critical piece of information. It helps to place the artist in a specific time period, which is essential for accurate identification and verification.\n*   **Cross-Referencing:** To ensure accuracy, it's important to verify the information from multiple reliable sources, such as museum collections (like the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado, which holds his work), art auction databases, and biographical information about the artist.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we can confidently identify the artist and provide their full name.\n\n<<<Augusto do Souto Mayor de Pina>>>"
