    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and number the main carbon chain.**\nFirst, we need to identify the chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, there are three such centers.\nTo name the molecule and assign configurations, we follow IUPAC nomenclature rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which receives priority over the amine (-NH2) group. We number the longest carbon chain containing the -OH group to give it the lowest possible number.\n\nThe longest chain is a pentane chain. Numbering from the left (as oriented in a standard drawing) gives the -OH group the number 2.\nThe structure is:\nCH3(1)-CH(OH)(2)-CH(CH2CH3)(3)-CH(CH3)(4)-CH2NH2(5)\nThe IUPAC name is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\nThe chiral centers are at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration at C2.**\n*   **Identify the four groups attached to C2:** -OH, -CH3 (which is C1), -H (implied), and the rest of the carbon chain (-CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2, the C3 group).\n*   **Assign priorities based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (The C3 group, as it's a larger carbon chain)\n    3.  -CH3 (The C1 group)\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, lowest priority)\n*   **Analyze the stereochemistry from the drawing:** The drawing shows the C2-OH bond and the C2-CH3 bond with dashes, meaning they are pointing away from the viewer. The C2-C3 bond is a solid line, indicating it is in the plane of the paper. For a tetrahedral carbon, if two bonds are pointing away (dashes) and one is in the plane, the fourth bond (to the implied -H) must be pointing towards the viewer (a wedge).\n*   **Determine the configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). When this is the case, we determine the direction from priority 1 to 2 to 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   Tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3: -OH (back) -> C3 group (plane) -> -CH3 (back). This describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) motion.\n    *   A counter-clockwise direction corresponds to an 'S' configuration.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group points towards us, we reverse the assignment: S becomes R.\n    *   **The configuration at C2 is R.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the absolute configuration at C3.**\n*   **Identify the four groups attached to C3:** -CH(OH)CH3 (the C2 group), -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the C4 group), -CH2CH3 (ethyl group), and -H (implied).\n*   **Assign priorities (CIP rules):**\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (C2 group, due to the oxygen atom)\n    2.  -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (C4 group)\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    4.  -H (lowest priority)\n*   **Analyze the stereochemistry from the drawing:** The ethyl group is shown with a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. Therefore, the implied -H atom must be on a dash (pointing away from the viewer).\n*   **Determine the configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is pointing away. We can directly determine the configuration by tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3: C2 group (plane, left) -> C4 group (plane, right) -> ethyl group (front). This describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) motion.\n    *   A counter-clockwise direction corresponds to an 'S' configuration.\n    *   **The configuration at C3 is S.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the absolute configuration at C4.**\n*   **Identify the four groups attached to C4:** -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the C3 group), -CH2NH2, -CH3, and -H (implied).\n*   **Assign priorities (CIP rules):**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (The C is attached to Nitrogen, N > C, so this group has the highest priority).\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the C3 group)\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H (lowest priority)\n*   **Analyze the stereochemistry from the drawing:** The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (forward), and the -CH3 group is on a dash (away). The bond to C3 is in the plane. This means the implied -H atom must also be in the plane.\n*   **Determine the configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is in the plane. To simplify, we can use the \"swap\" method. We mentally swap the lowest priority group (-H, #4) with the group that is pointing away (-CH3, #3).\n    *   In the swapped molecule, -H (#4) is on a dash (away) and -CH3 (#3) is in the plane.\n    *   Now, we determine the configuration for this swapped molecule. Since -H is away, we trace 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Path 1 -> 2 -> 3: -CH2NH2 (wedge, front) -> C3 group (plane, left) -> -CH3 (plane, right). This describes a clockwise (CW) motion.\n    *   A clockwise direction corresponds to an 'R' configuration.\n    *   Since we determined the configuration of a swapped molecule, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite. So, R becomes S.\n    *   **The configuration at C4 is S.**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results.**\nThe absolute configuration for each chiral center is:\n*   C2: R\n*   C3: S\n*   C4: S\n\nThe complete absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2R,3S,4S)>>>"
