The structures of the three products are:

*   **Product A:** N-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)acetamide. It consists of a five-membered saturated pyrrolidine ring with an N-acetylamino group (-NHCOCH₃) attached at the C2 position.
*   **Product B:** Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one (also known as pyrrolizidin-3-one). This is a bicyclic molecule made of two fused five-membered rings that share a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C3 position of the pyrrolizine ring system.
*   **Product C:** N-acetylpyrrolidine. It consists of a five-membered saturated pyrrolidine ring with an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to the nitrogen atom.

A visual representation of the products:
**A:** A pyrrolidine ring with -NH(C=O)CH₃ at C2.
**B:** Two 5-membered rings fused at a C-N-C bridge, with a C=O in one of the rings at a position beta to the bridgehead nitrogen.
**C:** A pyrrolidine ring with -C(=O)CH₃ on the nitrogen atom.
