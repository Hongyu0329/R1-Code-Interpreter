    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**General Approach to Rock Identification**\nTo identify these rocks, we will examine their key physical properties, primarily texture and composition.\n1.  **Texture:** This refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the grains or crystals in the rock.\n    *   Are the grains large and visible (coarse-grained/phaneritic) or too small to see (fine-grained/aphanitic)?\n    *   Are there holes or bubbles (vesicular)?\n    *   Is the rock made of cemented fragments (clastic)?\n    *   Are the crystals interlocking or are they separate grains?\n2.  **Composition:** This refers to the minerals that make up the rock, which can often be inferred from the rock's overall color.\n    *   Light-colored rocks are typically rich in silica (felsic).\n    *   Dark-colored rocks are typically rich in iron and magnesium (mafic).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Specimen H**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** The rock is filled with numerous visible holes or cavities. This texture is called **vesicular**. The holes are gas bubbles that were trapped in the lava as it cooled. The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Color/Composition.** The rock has a reddish-brown to dark color. This suggests a composition that is rich in iron, typical of mafic or intermediate lava. The red color is likely due to the oxidation (rusting) of iron.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude Rock Type.** A vesicular, fine-grained, dark-colored rock formed from lava is an extrusive igneous rock. Specifically, a highly vesicular mafic rock like this is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Specimen I**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** The rock is clearly composed of many smaller, sharp, and irregularly shaped pieces of other rocks (clasts) that have been cemented together. This is a **clastic** texture.\n*   **Step 2: Observe the Clasts.** The clasts are **angular**, not rounded. They vary in size and color, indicating they are fragments of different types of rock.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude Rock Type.** A clastic rock made of large, angular fragments cemented together is known as **Breccia**. Breccias can form in various ways, including from landslides (sedimentary) or explosive volcanic eruptions (volcanic).\n\n**Specimen J**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** Similar to specimen H, this rock is also highly **vesicular** and appears very lightweight and porous. The texture is frothy and the underlying rock is fine-grained.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Color/Composition.** The rock is very light in color, ranging from white to light gray. This light color indicates a **felsic** composition, meaning it is rich in silica.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude Rock Type.** A highly vesicular, felsic, lightweight extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Pumice**. Pumice is so porous that it often has a density less than water, allowing it to float.\n\n**Specimen K**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is a **coarse-grained (phaneritic)** texture. The interlocking nature of the crystals indicates they grew together as the rock slowly cooled from a molten state.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Color/Composition.** The rock contains a mixture of light and dark colored minerals. We can see:\n    *   Glassy, greyish crystals (likely **Quartz**)\n    *   Opaque white to pinkish crystals (likely **Feldspar**)\n    *   Black, blocky or flaky crystals (likely **Biotite Mica** or **Hornblende**)\n*   **Step 3: Conclude Rock Type.** A coarse-grained igneous rock with an interlocking texture that formed from slow cooling deep underground is an intrusive igneous rock. The specific mineral composition of quartz, feldspar, and dark minerals is characteristic of **Granite**.\n\n---\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria (Vesicular, mafic, extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **I:** Breccia (Clastic rock with angular fragments)\n*   **J:** Pumice (Vesicular, felsic, extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **K:** Granite (Coarse-grained, felsic, intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
