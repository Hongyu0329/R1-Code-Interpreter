    "My plan is to analyze the harmony in measure 30 of the provided score to determine its Roman numeral in the context of the piece's key.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which indicates either E♭ major or C minor. The sonata is in C minor.\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The measure is the third one on the second system, immediately following the measure with the `sf` marking in the left hand.\n3.  **Identify the Notes:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays a G octave. The bass note, which determines the harmony's root for analysis, is G.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays a repeating sixteenth-note arpeggio: E♭, G, B♮, D.\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:**\n    *   The key is C minor. The dominant note (the fifth scale degree) is G.\n    *   The bass note is G, so the chord is in root position.\n    *   The notes B♮ and D, combined with the G in the bass, form a G major triad (G-B♮-D). In minor keys, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree (B♭ to B♮) to create a leading tone, which makes the dominant chord major.\n    *   The E♭ in the right-hand arpeggio is a non-chord tone. It is an accented appoggiatura that resolves down to the chord tone D.\n    *   Therefore, the underlying harmony of the entire measure is a G major triad.\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   In the key of C minor, a G major chord functions as the dominant.\n    *   The Roman numeral for the dominant chord is V.\n    *   Since the chord is major, the numeral is uppercase.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this analysis and the final Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef find_roman_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 from Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata\n    and prints the corresponding Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Notes identified in the measure\n    bass_note = \"G\"\n    chord_notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\"]\n    non_chord_tone = \"E-flat\"\n    \n    # Harmonic Analysis\n    # The G major chord (G-B-natural-D) is the dominant of C minor.\n    # The dominant chord is represented by the Roman numeral V.\n    # It is an uppercase V because the chord is major.\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n    \n    print(f\"Step-by-step analysis for measure {measure}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
