    "This is a famous jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing its melody and chord progression.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Melody:** The first few notes of the melody are C, F, G, A♭, G, F, E♭. This melodic line is very distinctive.\n2.  **Identify the Standard:** This opening melodic phrase is the beginning of the bebop standard \"Donna Lee\".\n3.  **Confirm the Key:** \"Donna Lee\" is typically played in the key of A♭ major. In A♭ major, the opening notes would be E♭, A♭, B♭, C, B♭, A♭, G, F. The music sheet provided is in the key of F minor. If we transpose the A♭ melody down by a minor third to F minor, the notes become C, F, G, A♭, G, F, E♭, D♭. This perfectly matches the melody written on the sheet music.\n4.  **Identify the Composer:** \"Donna Lee\" was composed by the legendary saxophonist Charlie Parker. (Note: It was originally credited to Miles Davis on the first recording, but the composition is widely recognized as Parker's).\n5.  **Analyze the Chords:** The chord progression on this sheet (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7...`) is a common reharmonization of the tune, but the melody is what defines it as \"Donna Lee\".\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** I will now write a simple Python script to print the title and the composer of the jazz standard.\n\n```python\ndef get_jazz_standard_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the title and composer of the jazz standard\n  identified from the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Donna Lee\"\n  composer = \"Charlie Parker\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Donna Lee, Composer: Charlie Parker>>>"
