    "To determine the viewpoint's country, we can use the information available in the image: the date, time, and the positions of celestial objects. By calculating the positions of these objects for a specific location on Earth at that exact time, we can find a match.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Extract Time Information**: The image displays the date and time as 2024-10-22 at 20:07:37 CEST. Central European Summer Time (CEST) is 2 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Therefore, the UTC time is 2024-10-22 at 18:07:37.\n2.  **Identify Celestial Objects**: The image clearly labels several objects: the planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, and the bright stars Vega and Capella.\n3.  **Hypothesize a Location**: Since the time is in CEST, the location must be in a country that observes this timezone. This includes many central European countries like Germany, France, Italy, Poland, etc. Based on the high altitude of northern stars like Capella, a location in the mid-latitudes of Europe, such as Germany, is a reasonable starting point.\n4.  **Verify with Code**: We will write a Python script using the `astropy` library to calculate the precise altitude (angle above the horizon) and azimuth (compass direction) of the identified celestial objects as they would appear from a specific city (e.g., Berlin, Germany) at the specified UTC time.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: We will compare the calculated positions with their appearance in the image. If they match, our hypothesized location is correct.\n    *   **Saturn**: Seen very low on the left (southwest).\n    *   **Jupiter and Uranus**: Seen high in the sky, left of center (east-northeast).\n    *   **Capella**: Seen very high, near the top of the frame (northeast).\n    *   **Vega**: Seen at a medium altitude on the right (northwest).\n\nThe following Python code performs the calculation for Berlin, Germany.\n\n```python\nimport astropy.units as u\nfrom astropy.time import Time\nfrom astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation, get_body, AltAz, SkyCoord\n\ndef solve_celestial_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the position of celestial objects to determine the viewpoint's location.\n    The image shows the sky on 2024-10-22 at 20:07:37 CEST.\n    CEST is UTC+2, so the UTC time is 18:07:37.\n    We test a location in a country that uses CEST, for example, Berlin, Germany.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
