    "To find the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Knot**: First, we identify the specific knot from the provided diagram. By counting the crossings and observing its structure, we can determine its standard name.\n2.  **Determine Knot Properties**: We will check if the knot has properties that simplify the calculation of the Rasmussen invariant, such as being an alternating knot.\n3.  **Apply the Relevant Formula**: For knots with certain properties, there are simpler formulas to calculate the Rasmussen invariant. We will use the appropriate formula.\n4.  **Find Necessary Values**: The formula may require other known knot invariants, like the knot signature. We will use the standard, tabulated value for this invariant.\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: Finally, we will substitute the values into the formula to find the Rasmussen invariant.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image\n    by identifying the knot, using its properties, and applying the correct formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot.\n    # The knot diagram in the image is a standard representation of the knot 8_18\n    # in the Alexander-Briggs notation. It has 8 crossings.\n    knot_name = \"8_18\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine knot properties.\n    # The knot 8_18 is an alternating knot. For an alternating knot diagram,\n    # as you trace the strand, the crossings alternate between \"over\" and \"under\".\n    \n    # Step 3: Apply the relevant formula for the Rasmussen invariant.\n    # For any alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant, s(K), is equal\n    # to its knot signature, σ(K).\n    # The formula is: s(K) = σ(K)\n    \n    # Step 4: Find the signature of the knot 8_18.\n    # The signature of a knot is a well-known integer invariant. For the knot 8_18,\n    # the signature is known from knot theory tables to be -2.\n    signature_of_knot = -2\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    rasmussen_invariant = signature_of_knot\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as knot {knot_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The knot {knot_name} is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is equal to its signature σ(K).\")\n    print(f\"The signature of {knot_name}, σ({knot_name}), is {signature_of_knot}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = σ({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result.\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
