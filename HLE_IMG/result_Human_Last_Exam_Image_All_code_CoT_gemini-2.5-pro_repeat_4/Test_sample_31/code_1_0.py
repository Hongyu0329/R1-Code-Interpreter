    # Step 1: Identify the knot.
    # The knot diagram in the image is a standard representation of the knot 8_18

    # Step 2: Determine knot properties.
    # The knot 8_18 is an alternating knot. For an alternating knot diagram,
    # as you trace the strand, the crossings alternate between "over" and "under".
    
    # Step 3: Apply the relevant formula for the Rasmussen invariant.
    # For any alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant, s(K), is equal
    # to its knot signature, σ(K).
    # The formula is: s(K) = σ(K)
    
    # Step 4: Find the signature of the knot 8_18.
    # The signature of a knot is a well-known integer invariant. For the knot 8_18,
    # the signature is known from knot theory tables to be -2.
