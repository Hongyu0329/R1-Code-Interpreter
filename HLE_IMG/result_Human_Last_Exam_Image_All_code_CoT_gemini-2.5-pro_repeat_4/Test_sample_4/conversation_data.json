    "Of course, I can help with that. The knot shown in the image is known in knot theory as the knot `10_139`.\n\nTo find its Jones polynomial, we can use a computational approach. The following Python code utilizes the `spherogram` library, a tool for knot theory computations, to calculate the Jones polynomial for the `10_139` knot. The code identifies the knot using its Planar Diagram (PD) code, calculates the polynomial, and then formats the result as you requested, printing each part of the final equation.\n\nPlease make sure you have the `spherogram` library installed. If not, you can install it by running `pip install spherogram`.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\n\ndef get_jones_polynomial_for_10_139():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the Jones polynomial for the knot 10_139.\n\n    The knot in the image is identified as 10_139.
