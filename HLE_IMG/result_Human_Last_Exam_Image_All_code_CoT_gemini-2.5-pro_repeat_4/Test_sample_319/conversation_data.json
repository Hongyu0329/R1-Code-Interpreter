    "The image displays a spectrogram (top) and a corresponding waveform (bottom) of a sound. The sound consists of a pure tone that is momentarily interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the visual information. The spectrogram shows a constant frequency tone (the horizontal line) which is physically absent during a short interval. In that interval, there is a broadband noise burst (the vertical smear). The waveform below mirrors this, showing a regular sine wave replaced by a random, high-amplitude signal.\n2.  I will identify the perceptual phenomenon this stimulus is designed to elicit. When a listener hears this sound, the brain tends to \"fill in\" the missing part of the tone, creating the illusion that the tone continues uninterrupted *behind* the noise.\n3.  This auditory illusion is known as the **continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n4.  I will write a Python script to print the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion\n    depicted in the image. The illusion is that a tone, which is\n    physically interrupted by a burst of noise, is perceived by the listener\n    as being continuous.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Continuity illusion\"\n    print(f\"The phenomenon shown in the image is known as the: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Continuity illusion>>>"
