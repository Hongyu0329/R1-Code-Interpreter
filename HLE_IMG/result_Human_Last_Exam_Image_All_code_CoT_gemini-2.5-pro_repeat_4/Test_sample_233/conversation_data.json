    "Based on the unique grid-like carving style and the visible runic text, the image fragment can be identified. This style is characteristic of the Sö 281 runestone, which is one of the Ingvar runestones. The visible runes can be transliterated to parts of the known inscription of Sö 281, such as `...risti runaR...` (...raised the runes...) and `...aft haralt...` (...in memory of Haraldr...). Haraldr was Ingvar's brother. This confirms the identification.\n\nThe following Python code states this conclusion and provides the runestone's official ID.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n\n    The identification process involves:\n    1. Analyzing the distinct visual style: The runes are carved within a grid pattern, which is a rare and identifiable feature.\n    2. Contextual Clue: The stone is specified as an \"Ingvar runestone\", narrowing the search to a specific group of runestones.\n    3. Runic Text Analysis: Transliterating the visible runes reveals fragments like \"...risti runaR...\" (raised the runes) and \"...aft haralt...\" (in memory of Haraldr).\n    4. Matching: Comparing these features against the database of Ingvar runestones leads to a definitive match with the stone at Strängnäs Cathedral, which commemorates Haraldr, Ingvar's brother.\n\n    The standard identification for Swedish runestones is the Rundata catalog number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Rundata ID is composed of a location code and a number.\n    location_code = \"Sö\"\n    stone_number = 281\n\n    print(\"Identifying the Ingvar runestone based on its unique features...\")\n    print(f\"The unique grid pattern and runic text match the Ingvar runestone known as {location_code} {stone_number}.\")\n    print(\"The final ID is composed of the location code and its number.\")\n    print(f\"Location Code: {location_code}\")\n    print(f\"Number: {stone_number}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the ID of the runestone is: {location_code} {stone_number}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
