def solve_runestone_id():
    """
    This function identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.

    The identification process involves:
    1. Analyzing the distinct visual style: The runes are carved within a grid pattern, which is a rare and identifiable feature.
    2. Contextual Clue: The stone is specified as an "Ingvar runestone", narrowing the search to a specific group of runestones.
    3. Runic Text Analysis: Transliterating the visible runes reveals fragments like "...risti runaR..." (raised the runes) and "...aft haralt..." (in memory of Haraldr).
    4. Matching: Comparing these features against the database of Ingvar runestones leads to a definitive match with the stone at Strängnäs Cathedral, which commemorates Haraldr, Ingvar's brother.

    The standard identification for Swedish runestones is the Rundata catalog number.
