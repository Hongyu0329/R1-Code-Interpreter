    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the explanation of the difference between the two moss species.\n\nThe primary and most easily observable difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the seta, which is the stalk that supports the spore capsule. This difference is so fundamental that it is reflected in the name of *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n1.  **Grimmia montana**: This species has a **straight seta**. This causes the capsule to be held erect and appear symmetrical. The capsules are typically emergent, meaning they rise just above the leaves on their short, straight stalks.\n\n2.  **Grimmia curviseta**: This species is defined by its **strongly curved seta**. The name itself means \"curved stalk\" (*curvi* + *seta*). This distinct curve causes the capsule to be bent sharply to the side or to be nodding (cernuous), making it look asymmetrical in its presentation.\n\nTherefore, you can distinguish them at a glance by looking at the orientation of the capsule: if it's upright on a straight stalk, it's consistent with *Grimmia montana*; if it's bent over on a curved stalk, it's characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\nHere is a Python script that prints out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_sporophyte_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the main distinguishing feature between the sporophytes\n    of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule):\\n\\n\"\n        \"1. Grimmia montana has a straight seta, which holds the capsule in an erect and upright position.\\n\\n\"\n        \"2. Grimmia curviseta has a strongly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be bent to the side or to nod downwards.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_sporophyte_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the curvature of the seta: it is straight in *Grimmia montana*, resulting in an erect capsule, and strongly curved in *Grimmia curviseta*, resulting in a nodding or bent capsule.>>>"
