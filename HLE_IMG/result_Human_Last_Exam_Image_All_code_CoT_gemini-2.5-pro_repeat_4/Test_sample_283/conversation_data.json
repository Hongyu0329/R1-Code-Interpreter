    "This is a fascinating historical puzzle based on modern data! Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the country:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure**: The chart displays Google Trends data for three different search terms (represented by red, blue, and yellow lines) from December 2019 to mid-2023. The y-axis shows relative search interest, and the x-axis shows time. The key feature is the presence of sharp, recurring annual spikes for each color, which strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual holidays or anniversaries of significant historical events.\n\n2.  **Identify and Correlate the Peaks**:\n    *   **Blue Line**: There is a very consistent and sharp peak every year in early July. This is a classic signature for \"Independence Day\" or \"July 4th\" in the **United States**.\n    *   **Yellow Line**: This line has two major peaks each year. One is in late May (e.g., near the \"May 28, 2023\" label), and the other is in late August/early September (e.g., near the \"Aug 29, 2021\" label). These dates perfectly align with two major US federal holidays: **Memorial Day** (the last Monday in May) and **Labor Day** (the first Monday in September). Both are rooted in US history.\n    *   **Red Line**: This line has a prominent peak every year in late January. This timing corresponds perfectly with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a US federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings**: The combination of these three specific patterns points overwhelmingly to one country.\n    *   Peak in late January: Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n    *   Peak in late May: Memorial Day.\n    *   Peak in early July: Independence Day.\n    *   Peak in early September: Labor Day.\n\n    All of these are significant historical commemorations or holidays in the **United States**. No other country has this specific calendar of nationally significant events.\n\nBased on this evidence, I will now provide a Python script to state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the provided Google Trends graph\n    to determine the country where the three historic events took place.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis of the annual peaks in the graph\n    event_1_timing = \"Early July\"\n    event_2_timing = \"Late January\"\n    event_3_timing = \"Late May and Early September\"\n    \n    # Corresponding historical events/holidays in a specific country\n    us_event_1 = \"Independence Day (July 4th)\"\n    us_event_2 = \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day\"\n    us_event_3 = \"Memorial Day and Labor Day\"\n    \n    # Conclusion based on the unique combination of these events\n    country = \"United States\"\n    \n    print(f\"The analysis of the trend lines points to a single country.\")\n    print(f\"A peak in {event_1_timing} corresponds to {us_event_1}.\")\n    print(f\"A peak in {event_2_timing} corresponds to {us_event_2}.\")\n    print(f\"Peaks in {event_3_timing} correspond to {us_event_3}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis specific combination of nationally significant historical events is unique to the {country}.\")\n\nsolve_country_puzzle()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
