    This function calculates the value of n0 / |t^2| based on the problem description.

    1.  The transmission probability |t^2| is evaluated under the condition V = 2E.
        Based on the physics of 1D Dirac fermion tunneling, this specific condition
        leads to perfect transmission, meaning |t^2| = 1.

    2.  The problem then simplifies to finding the value of n0, which is the number
        of the plot corresponding to the base parameter set.

    3.  By visual inspection of the 12 plots, plot #8 is the most likely candidate
        for the base case (n0). It is the only plot that combines a large mass 'm'
        (long green arc) with a large barrier width 'Î”z' (tightly wound spiral),
        making it a logical "corner" of the parameter space from which other
        variations are generated.

    4.  The final result is n0 / |t^2| = 8 / 1 = 8.
