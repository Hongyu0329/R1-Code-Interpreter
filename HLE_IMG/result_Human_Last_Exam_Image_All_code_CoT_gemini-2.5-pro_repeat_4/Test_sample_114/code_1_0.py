    print("\nStep 1: Identifying the Reaction Type and True Starting Material")
    print("The general reaction is a [3+2] cycloaddition between a münchnone intermediate and methyl propiolate.")
    print("First, we must determine the correct structure of the starting material for Reaction 1. The product, Product A, has a molecular formula of C9H13NO2.")
    print("If the starting material were N-acetyl-N-methyl-valine as drawn, the expected product formula would be C11H17NO2. This does not match.")
    print("However, if the starting material is N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, the reaction yields a product with the formula C9H13NO2, which perfectly matches Product A's HRMS data.")
    print("The NMR data for Product A (1H: 6.23 (s, 1H), 3.77 (s, 3H), 3.39 (s, 3H), 2.50 (s, 3H), 2.18 (s, 3H); 13C: 172.0, 136.5, 135.0, 114.5, 111.2, 52.4, 44.8, 12.3, 11.4) supports a 1,2,5-trimethyl-pyrrole-carboxylate structure derived from alanine.")
    print("Therefore, the starting material for Reactions 1 and 2 is N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine.\n")

    print("Step 2: Interpreting the Labeling Experiment in Reaction 2")
    print("Reaction 2 uses 13C labeling and shows that the two methyl groups (one from the acetyl group, one from the alanine backbone) become scrambled, producing a 1:1 mixture of labeled products.")
    print("This indicates that for the flexible, acyclic system, the münchnone intermediate undergoes a process that makes the C2 and C4 substituents equivalent before the cycloaddition is complete. This is the 'lack of regioselectivity' with respect to substituent placement mentioned in the problem.\n")

    print("Step 3: The Role of the Constrained Intermediate in Reaction 3")
    print("Reaction 3 starts with N-acetyl-proline, which is cyclic. The resulting münchnone intermediate is therefore bicyclic, with the proline ring fused to the oxazolium ring.")
    print("In this rigid, bicyclic structure, the C4 position of the münchnone is a bridgehead carbon. It is conformationally locked and cannot participate in the scrambling mechanism observed in Reaction 2.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: The Final Conclusion")
    print("The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to its rigid, bicyclic münchnone intermediate. This conformational locking prevents the substituent scrambling that occurs in the flexible acyclic intermediate of Reactions 1 and 2.")
    print("Without scrambling, the cycloaddition is governed by the fixed electronics and sterics of the bicyclic münchnone, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B, C10H13NO2).")
    print("Thus, Reactions 1 and 2 demonstrate that substituent scrambling occurs in a flexible system, and Reaction 3 shows that eliminating this flexibility by using a cyclic amino acid restores high regioselectivity to the cycloaddition.")

<<<The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformationally locked bicyclic münchnone intermediate, which prevents the substituent scrambling process that is observed in the flexible, acyclic intermediate of Reaction 2. This lack of scrambling allows the inherent electronic and steric factors of the cycloaddition to control the outcome, leading to a single product.>>>
