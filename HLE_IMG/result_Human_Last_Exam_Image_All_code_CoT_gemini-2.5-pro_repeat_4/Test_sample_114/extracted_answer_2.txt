The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformationally locked bicyclic m√ºnchnone intermediate, which prevents the substituent scrambling process that is observed in the flexible, acyclic intermediate of Reaction 2. This lack of scrambling allows the inherent electronic and steric factors of the cycloaddition to control the outcome, leading to a single product.
