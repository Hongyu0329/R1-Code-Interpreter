Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy growth on the twig, which is a Woolly Oak Gall. This gall is created by a gall wasp. The female wasp lays her eggs on the twig of the oak tree, and the gall grows around the developing larvae, serving as a protective nursery. Therefore, the eggs are laid inside what becomes the gall structure on the twig. Additional, minor evidence includes a small clutch of what appears to be insect eggs on the surface of a leaf, visible in one of the cropped images.
