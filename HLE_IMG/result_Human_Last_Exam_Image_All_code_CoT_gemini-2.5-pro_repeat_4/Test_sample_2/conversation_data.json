    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`. Let's denote its time complexity by `T(n)`.\n    - **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing. The time taken is constant, so `T(1) = O(1)`.\n    - **Recursive Step (n > 1):** The function performs the following steps:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`. This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`: A comparison, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n        3.  `swap(...)`: A swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`. This is conditional.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Another recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`. This is also conditional.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation for the Worst Case:**\n    We are interested in the worst-case time complexity. The worst case occurs when the `if` condition is true, as this triggers the most work (a swap and a second recursive call).\n    In this scenario, the total time `T(n)` is the sum of the time for the first recursive call, the constant time for the comparison and swap, and the time for the second recursive call.\n    So, the recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let's expand the relation to find a pattern:\n    - `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    - `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 3c`\n    - `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n    - Following the pattern, we can generalize to: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\n    To solve this, we set `k = n - 1`, which brings us to the base case `T(1)`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`. This is an exponential time complexity. The algorithm terminates because the problem size `n` decreases with each recursive call, but it is extremely inefficient.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this exponential growth by implementing the algorithm and counting the number of comparisons for worst-case inputs (reverse-sorted arrays).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's a deeply recursive function, so we might need to increase the recursion limit for larger N.\n# sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Global counter for operations\nop_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to swap elements in an array.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort_and_count(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The sorting algorithm from the problem, modified to count comparisons.\n    \"\"\"\n    global op_count\n    if n > 1:\n        sort_and_count(a, n - 1)\n        \n        op_count += 1 # Count the comparison as a basic operation\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            sort_and_count(a, n - 1)\n\ndef demonstrate_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the algorithm's complexity by running it on worst-case inputs\n    and showing that the operation count grows exponentially.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case recurrence relation: T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + 1\")\n    print(\"Assuming T(1) = 0 (no comparisons for n=1).\")\n    print(\"T(2) = 2 * T(1) + 1 = 2 * 0 + 1 = 1\")\n    print(\"T(3) = 2 * T(2) + 1 = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\")\n    print(\"T(4) = 2 * T(3) + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\")\n    print(\"T(5) = 2 * T(4) + 1 = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\")\n    print(\"The number of comparisons follows the formula T(n) = 2^(n-1) - 1, which is O(2^n).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Verification with Code ---\")\n    # Test for n from 1 up to a reasonable limit to avoid long run times.\n    for n in range(1, 13):\n        global op_count\n        op_count = 0\n        \n        # A reverse-sorted array is the worst-case input for this algorithm.\n        worst_case_array = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        \n        sort_and_count(worst_case_array, n)\n        \n        # The theoretical count of comparisons is 2^(n-1) - 1 for n > 1.\n        theoretical_count = (2**(n - 1) - 1) if n > 1 else 0\n        \n        print(f\"For n = {n}: counted {op_count} comparisons (Theoretical: {theoretical_count})\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    demonstrate_complexity()\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
