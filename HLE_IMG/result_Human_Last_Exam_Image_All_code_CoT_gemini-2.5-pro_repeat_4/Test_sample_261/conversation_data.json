    "This image is a cropped section of the cover art from a very famous book. My plan is to identify the book based on the distinct art style and the subject matter (an ethereal unicorn).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image**: The image displays a ghostly, white unicorn with a golden horn, set against a dark background. The art style is painterly and characteristic of a specific, well-known book series illustrator.\n2.  **Identify the Source**: This specific depiction of a unicorn is a detail from the background of the original American cover art for \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" illustrated by Mary GrandPr√©. In the book, unicorns are found in the Forbidden Forest, and their blood can be used to sustain a person's life.\n3.  **Formulate the Code**: I will write a simple Python script to print the title of the book.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book title from the provided cover art fragment.\n    The image is a detail from the cover of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\".\n    \"\"\"\n    book_title = \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"\n    print(book_title)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
