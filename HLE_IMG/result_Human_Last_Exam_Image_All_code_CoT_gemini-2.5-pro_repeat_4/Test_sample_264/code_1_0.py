    Analyzes fictional flow cytometry data to determine which antibody stained all cells.
    
    In flow cytometry histograms:
    - The black curve represents the unstained control population (baseline fluorescence).
    - The red curve represents the antibody-stained population.
    
    If an antibody stains ALL cells, the entire red curve will be shifted to a higher
    fluorescence value compared to the black curve, with no cells remaining in the
    unstained region.
    
    If an antibody stains only a SUBPOPULATION, the red curve will show two groups:
    one group with higher fluorescence (stained) and another that overlaps with the
    black curve (unstained).
