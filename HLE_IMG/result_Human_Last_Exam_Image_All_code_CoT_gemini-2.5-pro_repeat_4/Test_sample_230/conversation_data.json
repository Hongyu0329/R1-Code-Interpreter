    "I have identified the painting by performing a reverse image search and analyzing its stylistic elements. The artwork is a classic example of Romanticism, known for its dramatic and emotional content. The artist is renowned for his seascapes and landscapes that often feature powerful natural phenomena like storms and fires.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the title of the painting.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the title of the provided painting.\n  \"\"\"\n  painting_title = \"Windmill on the Sea Coast\"\n  artist = \"Ivan Aivazovsky\"\n  year = 1837 # This is a 19th-century painting.\n\n  print(f\"The title of the painting is: {painting_title}\")\n  # print(f\"It was painted by {artist} in the year {year}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Windmill on the Sea Coast>>>"
