    """
    Calculates the reactive power supplied by a shunt capacitor bank.

    The problem asks for the reactive power needed to maintain the voltage at Bus 4
    at 400 kV, using a shunt capacitor bank with a given reactance. Despite the
    complex diagram, the problem simplifies to calculating the output of this
    specific capacitor at the target voltage.

    The formula for three-phase reactive power from a shunt capacitor is:
    Q = V_LL^2 / X_C
    where V_LL is the line-to-line voltage and X_C is the per-phase reactance.

    A convenient unit identity is used: Q (MVAR) = (V (kV))^2 / X (立).
