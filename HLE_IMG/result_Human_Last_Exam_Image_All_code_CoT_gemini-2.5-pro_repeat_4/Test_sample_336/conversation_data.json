    "To find the sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices for the specified molecules, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecules**: First, I will determine the chemical structure of the three molecules depicted in the image (two reactants and one product) and represent them using their SMILES strings.\n    *   Molecule 1 (Reactant 1): `5-fluoro-4-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)pyridin-2-amine`\n    *   Molecule 2 (Reactant 2): `7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine`\n    *   Molecule 3 (Product): `N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`\n\n2.  **Calculate Crippen logP**: Using the RDKit library in Python, I will calculate the Crippen logP for each of the three molecules.\n\n3.  **Filter Molecules**: I will identify which of these molecules have a logP value greater than 1, as specified in the problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each molecule that meets the logP > 1 criterion, I will:\n    *   First, add explicit hydrogen atoms to its molecular graph, as the calculation must include them.\n    *   Then, compute its Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI). The ECI is defined as the sum of the product of the vertex degree and the vertex eccentricity for each atom in the molecule (`Î£(deg(i) * ecc(i))`).\n\n5.  **Sum the Indices**: Finally, I will sum the ECI values of all the molecules that satisfied the logP > 1 condition to get the final answer. The code will also print the individual ECI values that contribute to the sum.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries from RDKit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Crippen\nfrom rdkit.Chem import GraphDescriptors\n\ndef solve_molecular_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies molecules with logP > 1 from a given list,\n    calculates their Eccentric Connectivity Index (including hydrogens),\n    and prints the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecules using their SMILES strings\n    # The SMILES strings correspond to the three molecules in the image.\n    smiles_and_names = {\n        \"Reactant 1\": \"Nc1nccc(F)c1OCc1cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c1\",\n        \"Reactant 2\": \"ClN1CC2=C(C1)N=CN=C2\",\n        \"Product\": \"Fc1cncc(Nc2ncc3c(n2)CC[NH]3)c1\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing molecules based on Crippen logP > 1...\")\n    \n    eci_values_to_sum = []\n    \n    for name, smiles in smiles_and_names.items():\n        # Create a molecule object from SMILES\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol is None:\n            print(f\"Could not parse SMILES for {name}: {smiles}\")\n            continue\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate Crippen logP\n        logp = Crippen.MolLogP(mol)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n- Molecule: {name}\")\n        print(f\"  SMILES: {smiles}\")\n        print(f\"  Crippen logP = {logp:.4f}\")\n\n        # Step 3: Filter molecules with logP > 1\n        if logp > 1:\n            print(\"  Condition logP > 1 is met.
