    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as color, texture, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, bubble-filled texture. This vesicular texture is characteristic of volcanic rocks that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. Given its color and appearance, it is likely **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various smaller, angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock, formed from broken pieces of other rocks, is called a **Breccia**. Given the context of the other volcanic rocks, it might be a volcanic breccia.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, whitish-gray rock that is also very porous and appears lightweight. Its frothy, vesicular texture and light color are classic indicators of **Pumice**, a volcanic rock so low in density it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. The crystals are light-colored (likely feldspar and quartz) and well-formed. An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals is known as a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {rock_type}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Breccia, J is Pumice, K is Pegmatite.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
