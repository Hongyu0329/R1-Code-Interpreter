def solve_epidemiological_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle.

    The solution was found by computationally modeling the system of differential
    equations and systematically testing the impact of varying each specified parameter.
    By comparing the qualitative features of the resulting plots with the nine
    provided images, a unique match between each image and a varied parameter was
    established.

    The identified parameter for each plot number is as follows:
    - Plot 1: Susceptible population (S) vs. mortality rate of normally symptomatic (μn). ID: 3
    - Plot 2: Susceptible population (S) vs. quarantine length (ql). ID: 14
    - Plot 3: Susceptible population (S) vs. baseline mortality rate (μ). ID: 1
    - Plot 4: Susceptible population (S) vs. quarantine effectiveness factor (qf). ID: 15
    - Plot 5: Cumulative cost of lost productivity (Cl) vs. cost parameter (cl). ID: 7
    - Plot 6: Susceptible population (S) vs. incubation period (ai). ID: 5
    - Plot 7: Recovered population (R) vs. fraction of severe cases (fs). ID: 6
    - Plot 8: Susceptible population (S) vs. contact rate for hospitalized (βh). ID: 9
    - Plot 9: Deceased population (D) vs. mortality rate of severe, non-hospitalized (μs). ID: 2
