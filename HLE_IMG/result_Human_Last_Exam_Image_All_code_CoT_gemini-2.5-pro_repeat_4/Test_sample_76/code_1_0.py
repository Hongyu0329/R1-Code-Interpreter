# The synthesis of cubane dicarboxylic acid from the given starting material

# group attaches to one of the alpha-prime (α') carbons of the original ketone.

# Identify the α' carbons for each ketone moiety in the starting material.
# The numbering is taken from the provided image of the reactant.

# For the top ketone (C=O between C6 and C7, Br at C2), the α' carbons are C6 and C7.

# reaction with one position from the bottom reaction.
