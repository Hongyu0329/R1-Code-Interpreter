    "Based on the visual information from the image, I will determine the correct caries classification. My plan is to use a Python script to map the features of the lesion to the appropriate category within the most common dental classification system, G.V. Black's classification.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows a lesion on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth (molar or premolar). The decay is occurring in the natural pits and fissures of the tooth, surrounding an existing amalgam restoration. This is also known as recurrent or secondary caries.\n2.  **Apply G.V. Black's Classification:** This system classifies caries based on their location on the tooth.\n    *   **Class I:** Caries in pits and fissures on occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces of posterior teeth, and lingual of anterior teeth.\n    *   **Class II:** Caries on the proximal (in-between) surfaces of posterior teeth.\n    *   **Class III:** Caries on the proximal surfaces of anterior teeth, not involving the incisal angle.\n    *   **Class IV:** Caries on the proximal surfaces of anterior teeth, involving the incisal angle.\n    *   **Class V:** Caries on the gingival third (near the gumline) of any tooth.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define these classifications and identify the correct one based on the lesion's location as determined from the image analysis. It will then print the rationale and the final classification.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification(location_description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the G.V.
