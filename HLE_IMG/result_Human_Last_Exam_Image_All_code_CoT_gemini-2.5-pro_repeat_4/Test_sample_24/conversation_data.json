    "This image displays a Heegaard diagram. To identify the three-manifold it represents, we need to analyze its structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Heegaard Diagram:** The diagram is drawn on a genus-3 surface. It features three `α`-curves (red circles labeled `α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`) and three `β`-curves (represented by the blue lines). This is a highly symmetric diagram based on the 1-skeleton of a tetrahedron.\n2.  **Identify the Manifold:** This specific diagram is a known representation for the Brieskorn integer homology sphere `Σ(2, 3, 4)`. Brieskorn spheres are important examples in low-dimensional topology.\n3.  **Describe the Manifold's Properties:** The manifold `Σ(p, q, r)` is defined as the link of the singularity `z₁ᵖ + z₂² + z₃ʳ = 0` in `ℂ³`. Since `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 13/12 > 1`, `Σ(2, 3, 4)` is a spherical 3-manifold. This means its universal cover is the 3-sphere `S³`.\n4.  **State the Fundamental Group:** The fundamental group `π₁(Σ(p,q,r))` has a canonical presentation. For `Σ(2, 3, 4)`, its fundamental group is the binary tetrahedral group, which has 24 elements.\n5.  **Present the Answer with Code:** I will write a Python script to print this information, including the defining relations for the fundamental group as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_manifold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three-manifold from the given Heegaard diagram and prints its properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q, r = 2, 3, 4\n\n    print(\"The Heegaard diagram represents the Brieskorn sphere Sigma(p, q, r).\")\n    print(f\"For this diagram, the parameters are (p, q, r) = ({p}, {q}, {r}).\")\n    print(\"So the manifold is Sigma(2, 3, 4).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"This is a spherical 3-manifold, also known as a prism manifold.\")\n    print(\"Its fundamental group, pi_1(Sigma(2, 3, 4)), is the binary tetrahedral group of order 24.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"A standard presentation for the fundamental group of Sigma(p, q, r) is:\")\n    print(\"<a, b, c | a^p = b^q, b^q = c^r, abc = 1>\\n\")\n\n    print(\"For this specific manifold, the defining relations are:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    a_exponent = p\n    b_exponent = q\n    c_exponent = r\n    \n    print(f\"a^{a_exponent} = b^{b_exponent}\")\n    print(f\"b^{b_exponent} = c^{c_exponent}\")\n    print(\"a * b * c = 1\")\n\nidentify_manifold()\n```\n<<<The Brieskorn sphere `Σ(2, 3, 4)`.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
