# Step 1 & 2: Define radii and calculate total area from Monte Carlo data
r_y = 0.5  # Radius of yellow circle in cm
num_yellow_circles = 5
total_yellow_area = num_yellow_circles * math.pi * r_y**2
points_in_yellow = 306
total_points = 10000
area_ratio = points_in_yellow / total_points
# A_total = W * H, so we look for W,H that are multiples of 0.5
# A_total is approximately total_yellow_area / area_ratio
# We find by inspection that W=16, H=8 gives A_total=128, which yields a ratio
# very close to the measured one.
W = 16.0
H = 8.0
A_total = W * H

# Step 3: Define the radius of the white circle.
# From geometric constraints (dx^2 = 2*r_w) and the grid rule,
# r_w must be k^2 * 0.5. m=2 gives r_w = 2.0, which is the most plausible value.
r_w = 2.0

# Step 4: Calculate the coordinates of the center of the right-most white circle.
# The right-most white circle is in the middle row and tangent to the right edge.
# Its center's x-coordinate is:
center_x = W - r_w

# The y-coordinate is for the middle row.
# y_top_row_center = H - r_w
# y_bottom_row_center = r_w
# The middle row is halfway between them.
center_y = ( (H - r_w) + r_w ) / 2.0

# Print the final answer and the steps
print("Let r_w be the radius of a white circle and r_y be the radius of a yellow circle.")
