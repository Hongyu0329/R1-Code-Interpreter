    "This painting is a classic example of fantastical realism, blending multiple impossible scenes into one coherent, yet surreal, image. To identify the artist, I will perform a search based on the distinctive elements within the artwork: a room where the floor turns into the sea, a window looking out onto a glacier, and books burning in a fireplace. This combination of themes is unique and points to a specific artist known for such dream-like worlds.\n\nMy plan is to write a simple python script that will store the artist's name in a variable and then print it out.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist who created the painting.\n    The painting, often titled 'Private Lesson' or 'Bibliodame', is a well-known work\n    by a Polish surrealist painter famous for his fantastical and dream-like imagery.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Jacek Yerka\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the following painting is: {artist}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
