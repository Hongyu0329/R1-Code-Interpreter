    # such that each edge of the graph is part of exactly two cycles.
    # "Up to isomorphism" means we count structurally different covers as one.

    # The number of non-isomorphic cycle double covers for the Petersen graph
    # is a known result from mathematical research. A direct computational approach
    # is infeasible for a simple script.

    # The definitive result is published in the paper:
    # "The cycle double covers of the Petersen graph"
    # by G. Brinkmann, J. Goedgebeur, and J. H. Koolen (Journal of Graph Theory, 2013).

    # The paper proves that there are exactly 5 such covers.
