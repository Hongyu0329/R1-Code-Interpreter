    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers**: The molecule has three chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). We will number them C2, C3, and C4 based on IUPAC nomenclature.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so it dictates the numbering of the main carbon chain.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is a 5-carbon chain (a pentane).\n    *   Numbering from right to left gives the -OH group the lowest possible number (2).\n    *   The IUPAC name is **4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Chiral Center**: We will assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center and determine its R/S configuration. Note that the provided drawing has a chemically impossible representation at C2 (two dashed bonds). We will proceed by making the most reasonable correction.\n\n### Analysis of Chiral Centers:\n\n*   **Center C4 (Rightmost):**\n    *   **Substituents**: -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl), -C3, -CH3 (methyl), and -H (hydrogen, implied wedge).\n    *   **Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n        1.  -CH2NH2 (The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen, which has a higher atomic number than the carbons in the other groups).\n        2.  -C3 (This carbon is part of the main chain and is heavily substituted).\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Configuration**: The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 → -C3 → -CH3) is counter-clockwise. Since the H is on a wedge, we reverse the result. Counter-clockwise (S) becomes **R**.\n    *   **C4 is (R)**.\n\n*   **Center C3 (Middle):**\n    *   **Substituents**: -C2, -C4, -CH2CH3 (ethyl, wedged), and -H (implied dash).\n    *   **Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n        1.  -C2 (This carbon is bonded to an Oxygen atom).\n        2.  -C4 (This carbon is bonded to a Nitrogen via an intermediate carbon).\n        3.  -CH2CH3\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Configuration**: The lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer). The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C2 → -C4 → -CH2CH3) is counter-clockwise. Since the H is on a dash, we keep the result.\n    *   **C3 is (S)**.\n\n*   **Center C2 (Leftmost):**\n    *   **Substituents**: -OH (hydroxyl), -C3, -CH3 (methyl), and -H.\n    *   **Correction**: The drawing shows both -OH and -CH3 with dashed bonds, which is impossible. A common convention is that major functional groups are drawn with intended stereochemistry. We will assume the -OH group is correctly shown as dashed, which means the -CH3 group must be wedged.\n    *   **Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n        1.  -OH\n        2.  -C3\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Configuration**: With our correction, we have -OH (dashed) and -CH3 (wedged). The -H is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can swap the -H group with the dashed -OH group. The new arrangement has -H (dashed) and -OH (in the plane). The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3) is now clockwise (R). Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   **C2 is (S)**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n```python\ndef solve_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the determined absolute configuration for each chiral center.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the step-by-step analysis of the molecule's stereochemistry.\n    # The chiral centers are numbered according to IUPAC rules for\n    # 4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol.\n    center_2_config = \"S\"\n    center_3_config = \"S\"\n    center_4_config = \"R\"\n\n    print(\"The absolute configuration of the molecule is:\")\n    print(f\"Center 2: {center_2_config}\")\n    print(f\"Center 3: {center_3_config}\")\n    print(f\"Center 4: {center_4_config}\")\n\nsolve_configuration()\n```\n<<<(2S, 3S, 4R)>>>"
