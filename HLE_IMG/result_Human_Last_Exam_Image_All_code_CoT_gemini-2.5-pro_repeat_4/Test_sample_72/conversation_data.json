    "This problem asks us to identify the two pericyclic reactions that occur in the given transformation. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reactants, Product, and Conditions:**\n    *   **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), a 6π-electron aromatic system, and cyclobutene (C₄H₄), a 2π-electron alkene.\n    *   **Product:** A tricyclic molecule with a C₁₀F₆H₄ formula, which confirms it's an adduct of the two reactants. The structure consists of three fused four-membered rings in a linear arrangement, with one remaining double bond.\n    *   **Conditions:** The reaction is driven by light (`hv`), indicating it's a photochemical process. Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical reactions will apply.\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Mechanism:** The transformation from two separate molecules into a complex single molecule suggests a sequence of reactions. Since the prompt specifies two pericyclic reactions, we can deduce the pathway. There are two plausible sequences:\n\n    *   **Path A: Cycloaddition first, then electrocyclization.**\n        1.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The first step is a photochemical cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene (a 2π system) and the double bond of cyclobutene (another 2π system). This is a [π²s + π²s] cycloaddition, which is photochemically allowed. This intermolecular reaction forms a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative as an intermediate. This intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring fused to a cyclobutane ring.\n        2.  **[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction:** The intermediate possesses a 1,3-diene system (a 4π-electron system) within the six-membered ring. Under photochemical conditions, this 4π system undergoes a conrotatory electrocyclic ring closure to form a new four-membered ring. This intramolecular reaction converts the bicyclic intermediate into the final tricyclic product, which has the observed linear fusion of three four-membered rings.\n\n    *   **Path B: Electrocyclization first, then cycloaddition.**\n        1.  **[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to its valence isomer, Dewar hexafluorobenzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a known photochemical [4π] electrocyclic reaction.\n        2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** Dewar hexafluorobenzene then reacts with cyclobutene in a [2+2] cycloaddition. This would lead to a cage-like tetracyclic compound, which does not match the structure of the given product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Path A correctly predicts the structure of the final product. Therefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a **[2+2] cycloaddition** followed by a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this conclusion and the numbers associated with the reaction classifications as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions in the\n    photochemical reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the two types of pericyclic reactions identified.\n    reaction_1 = \"[2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction_2 = \"[4π] electrocyclic reaction\"\n    \n    # Define the numbers from the reaction classifications.\n    numbers = [2, 2, 4]\n    \n    # Print the explanation.\n    print(\"The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(f\"1. An intermolecular {reaction_1} between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\")\n    print(f\"2. An intramolecular {reaction_2} of the resulting intermediate.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the final equation names of these reactions, the numbers are:\")\n    # Using print to output each number as requested.\n    print(numbers[0])\n    print(numbers[1])\n    print(numbers[2])\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions involved are a [2+2] cycloaddition and a [4π] electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
