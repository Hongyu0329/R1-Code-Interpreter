    "This molecule is a type of carbon nanoring, a macrocycle made of repeating units. By analyzing the structure, we can identify these units and count them to determine the specific name.\n\n1.  **Identify Building Blocks**: The molecule is constructed from two alternating types of units:\n    *   **Phenylene groups**: These are the hexagonal benzene rings (C₆H₄).\n    *   **Acetylene groups**: These are the linear two-carbon linkers with triple bonds (-C≡C-).\n\n2.  **Count the Units**: By inspecting the full ring, we can count that there are **6** phenylene units and **6** acetylene units.\n\n3.  **Determine Connectivity**: The acetylene groups connect to the phenylene rings at opposite ends (the \"para\" or 1,4 positions).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name**: The general name for this class of molecules is **cyclo\\[n]paraphenyleneacetylene**, where 'n' is the number of repeating phenylene-acetylene pairs. Since there are 6 pairs, the name is **cyclo\\[6]paraphenyleneacetylene**. It is also commonly abbreviated as **[6]CPPA**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the molecule based on its structural components.\n    The molecule is a macrocycle composed of alternating phenylene and acetylene units.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_repeating_units = 6\n    phenylene_unit = \"paraphenylene\"\n    acetylene_unit = \"acetylene\"\n\n    molecule_name = f\"cyclo[{num_repeating_units}]{phenylene_unit}{acetylene_unit}\"\n\n    print(f\"The molecule is identified as a macrocycle.\")\n    print(f\"It contains {num_repeating_units} repeating units of '{phenylene_unit}' and '{acetylene_unit}'.\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the molecule is: {molecule_name}\")\n\nidentify_molecule()\n```\n<<<cyclo[6]paraphenyleneacetylene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name the molecule.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
