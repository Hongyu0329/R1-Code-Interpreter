    "This is a checkmate problem (tsume-shogi). Your king is also under threat, so you must find a sequence of checks that leads to a forced mate. Other moves are too slow and will allow the opponent to attack.\n\nThe best move is **G*31**. This initiates a forced checkmate in 7 moves (a 4-move sequence for you). Any other move either fails to mate or allows the opponent to escape.\n\nHere is the winning sequence:\n\n1.  **Sente (You): G*31 (金打 ３一)**\n    You drop a Gold from your hand onto square 31. This is a check. The opponent's king has only one legal move.\n2.  **Gote (Opponent): K-42 (玉-４二)**\n    The king is forced to move to square 42.\n3.  **Sente (You): R-61+ (龍-６一)**\n    Your Dragon at 71 captures the Gold at 61. This is a check. It is written as R-61+ although the Dragon is already promoted. The opponent's only legal move is to capture your Dragon.\n4.  **Gote (Opponent): Kx61 (玉x６一)**\n    The king is forced to capture the Dragon at 61.\n5.  **Sente (You): G*52 (金打 ５二)**\n    You drop another Gold from your hand onto square 52. This is a check. The king's escape to 42 is now blocked. The only escape is to 71.\n6.  **Gote (Opponent): K-71 (玉-７一)**\n    The king is forced to move to square 71.\n7.  **Sente (You): G-62 (金-６二)**\n    You move the Gold you originally dropped at 31 to square 62. This delivers the final checkmate. The opponent's king at 71 has no escape squares.\n\nLet's print this sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_shogi_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the shogi puzzle and prints the mating sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The best move is D: G*31.\")\n    print(\"This move starts a forced checkmate sequence.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step sequence:\\n\")\n\n    moves = [\n        (\"1.
