    "Based on the architectural style of the buildings in the image, I can identify the location.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Buildings:** The image displays several modern skyscrapers. The most prominent one on the right is a massive glass-facade building. To its left, there is another tall building with a noticeable curved structure.\n2.  **Identify Landmarks:** These buildings are located in New York City. The large building on the right is **One Manhattan West**, and the curved residential tower next to it is **The Eugene**. These are part of the Manhattan West development on the west side of Manhattan.\n3.  **Confirm Details:** The steam or smoke seen in the bottom left is a common sight on the streets of New York City, often coming from the city's extensive steam system. The photo was taken in 2024, and these buildings were completed between 2017 and 2021, so their presence is consistent with the timeline.\n\nTherefore, the city in the photograph is New York City. I will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_city():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city based on the visual information provided.\n  The key landmarks identified are One Manhattan West and The Eugene tower,\n  which are located in New York City.\n  \"\"\"\n  city = \"New York City\"\n  print(city)\n\nidentify_city()\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
