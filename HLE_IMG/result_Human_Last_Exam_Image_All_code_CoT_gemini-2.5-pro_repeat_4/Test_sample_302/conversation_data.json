    "The image displays a Chinese seal with four characters in seal script. The traditional reading order for such seals is from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character**: This is `馬` (mǎ), meaning \"horse\".\n2.  **Bottom-Right Character**: This is `到` (dào), meaning \"to arrive\".\n3.  **Top-Left Character**: This is `功` (gōng), meaning \"success\" or \"merit\".\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character**: This is `成` (chéng), meaning \"to accomplish\" or \"become\".\n\nCombining these characters in the correct order gives the idiom `馬到功成` (mǎ dào gōng chéng). In simplified Chinese, `馬` is written as `马`, while the other characters remain the same. The phrase becomes `马到功成`. This idiom means \"to achieve instant success\" or \"to win speedy success\".\n\nThe following Python code will print the identified characters and the resulting idiom.\n\n```python\ndef solve_seal_characters():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the simplified Chinese characters\n    from the provided seal image.\n    The reading order is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Characters identified from the seal, converted to simplified Chinese\n    char_top_right = \"马\"\n    char_bottom_right = \"到\"\n    char_top_left = \"功\"\n    char_bottom_left = \"成\"\n\n    # The complete idiom\n    idiom = char_top_right + char_bottom_right + char_top_left + char_bottom_left\n\n    print(\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are:\")\n    print(f\"Top-Right: {char_top_right}\")\n    print(f\"Bottom-Right: {char_bottom_right}\")\n    print(f\"Top-Left: {char_top_left}\")\n    print(f\"Bottom-Left: {char_bottom_left}\")\n    print(f\"\\nRead in the traditional order, they form the idiom: {idiom}\")\n\nsolve_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<马到功成>>>"
