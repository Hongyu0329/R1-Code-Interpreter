    This function identifies the matching bird.
    By visual inspection, we analyze the distinctive features of the target bird,
    focusing on the unique scalloped pattern of the feathers on its back and wings.

    1. Target bird has a specific, dense scalloping pattern on its back.
    2. The light edges of the wing feathers create a distinct striped pattern.
    3. There's a subtle irregularity or darker spot in the pattern on the upper back, just below the head.

    Comparing these features to the options:
    - A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I all show variations in pattern density, coloration, lighting, or the specific arrangement of feathers that differentiate them from the target.
    - C shows an identical scalloping pattern on the back.
    - C shows the same wing feather striping.
    - C shows the same subtle irregularity on the upper back.
    - The posture and lighting in C are also very similar to the target.

    Therefore, C is the correct match.
