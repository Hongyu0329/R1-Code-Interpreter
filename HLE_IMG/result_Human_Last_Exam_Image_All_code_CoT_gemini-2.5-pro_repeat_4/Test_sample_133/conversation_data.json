    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the compound from the mass spectrum.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Cluster:** I will first look at the peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to determine the molecular weight and identify the presence of any elements with characteristic isotopic patterns, like chlorine or bromine.\n2.  **Determine Molecular Formula:** Based on the molecular ion mass and isotopic pattern, I will deduce the number of halogen atoms and calculate the mass of the remaining part of the molecule. This will allow me to propose a molecular formula.\n3.  **Analyze Key Fragments:** I will examine the most intense peaks (like the base peak) and other significant fragments. The mass differences between these fragments and the molecular ion will reveal how the molecule breaks apart, providing clues about its structure.\n4.  **Confirm Structure and Name:** By piecing together the information from the formula and fragmentation patterns, I will identify the structure of the compound and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nThis entire process of deduction will be encapsulated in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the unknown compound and prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mass spectrum data from the table\n    # Storing a subset of the data relevant for the analysis\n    ms_data = {\n        35: 3.09, 36: 3.38, 37: 1.04, 47: 18.4, 48: 4.62, 49: 6.24, 71: 10.6, 83: 19.4,\n        85: 7.09, 96: 10.1, 117: 2.98, 118: 43.5, 119: 4.41, 120: 29.6, 121: 2.06,\n        141: 28.1, 155: 16.1, 190: 48.4, 192: 24.5, 225: 100, 227: 66.7, 229: 22.2,\n        260: 34.8, 262: 29.0, 264: 12.9, 266: 3.22\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak Cluster\")\n    print(\"The analysis starts by examining the peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to identify the molecular ion.\")\n    mz_260, i_260 = 260, ms_data[260]\n    mz_262, i_262 = 262, ms_data[262]\n    mz_264, i_264 = 264, ms_data[264]\n    mz_266, i_266 = 266, ms_data[266]\n    print(f\"Observed peaks in the high-mass region: m/z {mz_260} (I={i_260}%), m/z {mz_262} (I={i_262}%), m/z {mz_264} (I={i_264}%), m/z {mz_266} (I={i_266}%).\")\n    print(\"This isotopic cluster pattern is characteristic of a compound containing three chlorine atoms (Cl).\")\n    print(\"The theoretical intensity ratio for 3 Cl atoms (due to isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) is approximately M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) = 100:98:32:3.\")\n    normalized_i_262 = (i_262 / i_260) * 100\n    normalized_i_264 = (i_264 / i_260) * 100\n    normalized_i_266 = (i_266 / i_260) * 100\n    print(f\"The observed normalized ratio is {i_260}/{i_260}*100 : {i_262}/{i_260}*100 : {i_264}/{i_260}*100 : {i_266}/{i_260}*100, which calculates to approximately 100 : {normalized_i_262:.0f} : {normalized_i_264:.0f} : {normalized_i_266:.0f}.\")\n    print(\"This observed ratio is a good match with the theoretical pattern for three chlorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the molecule contains 3 Cl atoms, and the peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the molecular ion with only the lighter ³⁵Cl isotope.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Non-Halogen Part of the Molecule\")\n    mass_M_35Cl = 260\n    mass_C = 12\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_35Cl = 35\n    num_Cl = 3\n    mass_of_3_Cl = num_Cl * mass_35Cl\n    mass_of_backbone = mass_M_35Cl -
