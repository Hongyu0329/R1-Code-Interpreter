    "To determine the total number of splice species, we need to analyze the RT-PCR results and count the number of unique RNA transcript variants they represent. Each distinct band on the gel, especially when generated with different or splice-specific primers, provides evidence for a unique splice species.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Examine each experimental panel (B through I) described in the text.\n2.  For each panel, determine the number of distinct splice species it reveals. We must be careful not to double-count species that are detected in multiple experiments (e.g., in panels B and C).\n3.  Sum the number of unique species from all informative panels to get the total count.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** Two bands (190 bp and 159 bp) are detected, indicating **2** distinct species.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** Two bands are seen again. Since the primers and product sizes are consistent with the findings in Panel B, this confirms the same 2 species and does not reveal new ones.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** One band (551 bp) is detected using a primer (E1F2) that specifically spans the 929^3465 splice junction. This represents **1** new species, different from those in Panel B.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** One band (1,005 bp) indicates **1** new late transcript species.\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** One band (972 bp) from the splice-specific E1F2 primer reveals **1** new late species containing the 929^3465 splice.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** Two bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp) detected with the E1F3 primer (specific for the 929^3506 splice) indicate **2** new late species.\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This sensitive PCR shows four distinct bands (450, 419, 378, and 187 bp). This reveals **4** different late transcript species that are spliced in various ways. (Panel H is a less sensitive version of this experiment and is thus redundant).\n\nBy summing the unique species identified from each of these experiments, we can find the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    Each unique product identified by a distinct primer pair or having a unique size is counted as a separate species.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of unique species identified from Panel B (E1F1/E4R)\n    species_from_B = 2\n    print(f\"Panel B (E1F1/E4R) shows {species_from_B} distinct splice species (products of 190 bp and 159 bp).\")\n\n    # Number of unique species from Panel D (E1F2/E5R)\n    # This primer is specific for the 929^3465 splice, identifying a new species.\n    species_from_D = 1\n    print(f\"Panel D (E1F2/E5R) identifies {species_from_D} new species with a specific splice junction (product of 551 bp).\")\n\n    # Number of unique species from Panel E (E1F1/L2R)\n    species_from_E = 1\n    print(f\"Panel E (E1F1/L2R) identifies {species_from_E} new late transcript species (product of 1,005 bp).\")\n\n    # Number of unique species from Panel F (E1F2/L2R)\n    species_from_F = 1\n    print(f\"Panel F (E1F2/L2R) identifies {species_from_F} new late transcript species containing the 929^3465 splice (product of 972 bp).\")\n\n    # Number of unique species from Panel G (E1F3/L2R)\n    # The E1F3 primer is specific for the 929^3506 splice, and two products were seen.\n    species_from_G = 2\n    print(f\"Panel G (E1F3/L2R) identifies {species_from_G} new late species with the 929^3506 splice (products of 1,003 bp and 931 bp).\")\n\n    # Number of unique species from Panel I (E1F1/L1R)\n    # This sensitive PCR revealed four distinct products.\n    species_from_I = 4\n    print(f\"Panel I (E1F1/L1R) reveals {species_from_I} distinct late species with different splicing patterns (products of 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp).\")\n\n    # Total number of species is the sum from all informative panels.\n    total_species = species_from_B + species_from_D + species_from_E + species_from_F + species_from_G + species_from_I\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species found in each informative experiment:\")\n    # The final equation with each number explicitly shown\n    final_equation = f\"Total species = {species_from_B} (from B) + {species_from_D} (from D) + {species_from_E} (from E) + {species_from_F} (from F) + {species_from_G} (from G) + {species_from_I} (from I)\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(f\"Total species = {total_species}\")\n\n    # Returning the final number as requested in the problem format.\n    return total_species\n\n# Run the function to get the answer.\nfinal_count = count_splice_species()\nprint(f\"\\n<<<Total number of splice species found is {final_count}.>>>\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
