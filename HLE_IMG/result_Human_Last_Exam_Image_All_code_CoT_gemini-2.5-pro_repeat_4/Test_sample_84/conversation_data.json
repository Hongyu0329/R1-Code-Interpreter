    "This is a fascinating heraldic puzzle. The coat of arms in the image shares its primary elements with the coat of arms of a specific city. By analyzing the key symbols—the shield divided into blue and gold, the crescent moon, and the crab—we can identify the city.\n\nThe shield is divided horizontally (a heraldic term known as \"per fess\"). The top half is blue (azure) with a gold crescent moon (or), and the bottom half is gold (or) with a black crab (sable). This exact combination is the coat of arms of the city of **Ananyiv** in the Odesa Oblast of Ukraine. The blue and gold fields also echo the colors of the Ukrainian flag.\n\nWhile the crown and the surrounding wreath of olive and oak branches in the image are artistic interpretations, the core design on the shield is a direct match to that of Ananyiv.\n\nHere is a Python script to print this finding.\n\n```python\ndef solve_heraldry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the city with a coat of arms similar to the one provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Ananyiv, Ukraine\"\n    \n    # Key elements from the image's coat of arms\n    shield_division = \"Horizontally divided (per fess)\"\n    top_field_color = \"Blue (azure)\"\n    top_field_charge = \"Gold crescent moon\"\n    bottom_field_color = \"Gold (or)\"\n    bottom_field_charge = \"Black crab\"\n    \n    print(f\"The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the image is: {city_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a breakdown of the comparison:\")\n    print(f\"1.
