    "This is a multi-component reaction involving an amine (2-aminopyridine), a dialdehyde (o-phthalaldehyde), and a source of cyanide (TMSCN). This type of reaction is a well-known method for synthesizing highly fluorescent substituted isoindole derivatives.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism:\n1.  **Iminium Ion Formation:** The primary amine of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the electrophilic aldehyde carbons of o-phthalaldehyde. After the loss of a water molecule, an iminium ion is formed.\n2.  **Cyanide Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), generated from TMSCN in the presence of KF and water, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon of the iminium ion. This step forms an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The nitrogen atom of the newly formed secondary amine attacks the second aldehyde group within the same molecule. This closes the ring, forming a five-membered cyclic hemiaminal, which is a substituted hydroxy-isoindoline.\n4.  **Dehydration & Aromatization:** The hemiaminal intermediate is unstable and readily eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated system. This step, likely followed by an oxidation (e.g., by atmospheric oxygen), results in the formation of a fully aromatic isoindole ring system.\n\nThe final product, **Compound A**, is **1-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole**.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molecular formula and molar mass of this compound.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies compound A from the reaction and calculates its molar mass.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Product Information\n    compound_name = \"1-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole\"\n    # The molecular formula is derived from the structure of the product:\n    # It consists of an isoindole core (C8H6N), a cyano group (CN) replacing an H,\n    # and a pyridin-2-yl group (C5H4N) replacing the H on the nitrogen.\n    # Total: C(8+1+5) H(6-1-1+4) N(1+1+1) = C14H8N3 -> Wait, let's recount H.\n    # Isoindole (C8H7N).
