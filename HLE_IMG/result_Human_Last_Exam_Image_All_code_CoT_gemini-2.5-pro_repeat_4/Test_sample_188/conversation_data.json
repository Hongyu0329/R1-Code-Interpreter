    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use the deletion-contraction method. This is a powerful recursive algorithm for finding the chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), for a graph G, where k is the number of available colors.\n\nThe method is based on the following recurrence relation for any graph G and any edge `e` in G:\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n2.  `G . e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted. This means the two vertices of `e` are merged into a single new vertex, which is connected to all the former neighbors of the original two vertices.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the graph `G` from the figure. It has 5 vertices and 8 edges.\n2.  Choose a suitable edge `e` to apply the deletion-contraction formula. I will choose the edge `e = (3, 4)`.\n3.  Calculate the chromatic polynomial for the simpler graph `G - e` (graph with edge (3,4) removed). This new graph might require another application of the deletion-contraction formula to simplify it further.\n4.  Calculate the chromatic polynomial for the simpler graph `G . e` (graph with vertices 3 and 4 merged). This resulting graph is a 4-cycle (C4).\n5.  The chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph `Cn` is known: `P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n * (k-1)`. I will use this for `P(C4, k)`.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute these results back into the main formula to find `P(G, k)`.\n7.  I will write a Python script to format and print the final polynomial equation, ensuring all coefficients (numbers) are explicitly shown.\n\nThe step-by-step derivation leads to the polynomial: `P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`.\n\nThe following Python code will print this result in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef print_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the final chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The polynomial P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k was derived\n    using the deletion-contraction method.
