    "To determine which pattern corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we can derive the expected two-dimensional projection pattern from the properties of the FCC lattice.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the FCC lattice structure using mathematical conditions on atomic coordinates.\n2.  Define the projection along the [110] direction by choosing a suitable 2D coordinate system.\n3.  Derive the mathematical condition that the projected coordinates must satisfy.\n4.  Describe the resulting 2D lattice pattern based on this condition.\n5.  Compare this theoretical pattern with the four given images (A, B, C, D) to find the match.\n\nI will provide a Python script that performs this derivation and prints a step-by-step explanation, leading to the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fcc_projection_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the 2D projection pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110]\n    direction and identifies the corresponding image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation we will derive is u + v = 2 * (k - y).\n    # The numbers in this equation are 2 and 1 (from 1*y).\n    num1 = 2\n    num2 = 1\n\n    analysis_steps = [\n        \"Analysis of the FCC lattice projection along the [110] direction:\",\n        \n        \"Step 1: Define the FCC lattice.\",\n        \"An FCC lattice can be represented by points (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are all integers, and their sum is an even number.\",\n        \"The condition is: x + y + z = 2k, where k is any integer.\",\n        \n        \"\\nStep 2: Define the projection.\",\n        \"We are viewing along the [110] direction.
