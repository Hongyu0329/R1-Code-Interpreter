    explanation = """Explanation: A prognostic marker helps predict the likely course or outcome of a disease. The diagram illustrates that the binding of S100B to its RAGE receptor initiates downstream signaling cascades that directly cause the core events of neurodegenerative pathology. Specifically, it activates:
1.  The JNK/JUN pathway, leading to apoptosis (neuronal cell death) and the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
2.  The NFkÎ² pathway, a central driver of neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.

Because the concentration of S100B directly correlates with the activation of these damaging cellular processes, measuring its levels can provide a forecast of the disease's progression and severity. Higher levels of S100B would suggest a more aggressive disease course and therefore a worse prognosis."""
