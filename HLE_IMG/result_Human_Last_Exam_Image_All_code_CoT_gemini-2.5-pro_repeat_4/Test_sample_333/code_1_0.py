def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    Solves the airfoil matching problem by applying aerodynamic principles.

    The solution is based on two key relationships:
    1. Airfoil Thickness vs. Suction Peak: Thinner airfoils produce sharper
       leading-edge suction peaks in the pressure coefficient (Cp) plot.
    2. Airfoil Camber vs. Lift: For a fixed angle of attack, higher camber
       produces more lift, which corresponds to a larger area enclosed by the
       Cp plot.
