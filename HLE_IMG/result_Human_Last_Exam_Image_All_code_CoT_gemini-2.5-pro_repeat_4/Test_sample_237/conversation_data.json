    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle. Based on its distinct black body, long antennae, and the prominent red-orange markings at the top of its wing covers (elytra), it can be identified.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  common_name = \"Two-banded Longhorn Beetle\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura cordigera\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    print(f\"It appears to be a {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The scientific name of this animal is: {scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
