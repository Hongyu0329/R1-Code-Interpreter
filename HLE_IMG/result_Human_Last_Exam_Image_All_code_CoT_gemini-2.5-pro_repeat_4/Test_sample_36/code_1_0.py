1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The main goal is to use Knowledge Management (KM) to improve the sales process. This involves creating and using knowledge assets like sales scripts and work manuals as shown in the sales funnel diagram.

2.  **Evaluate DIKW Model:** This model is highly relevant. The sales process starts with raw **Data** (VA Sales List), which is processed into **Information** (qualified leads with defined needs). This leads to **Knowledge** in the form of effective "VA Sales Scripts" and "VA Deals" templates. This model perfectly describes the structure of the sales pipeline.

3.  **Evaluate SECI Model:** This model is also critical. Since the company is new to KM, a lot of sales expertise is tacit (in employees' heads). To create assets like a "VA Sales Script" or a "Work Manual", the company must convert this tacit knowledge into explicit, documented knowledge. This process, called **Externalization**, is a core part of the SECI model.

4.  **Evaluate Bloom's Taxonomy:** This is a model for individual learning and education, not for managing an organization's knowledge base. It's less suitable for the company's primary goal of building a company-wide KM system.

5.  **Conclusion:** VVA needs a way to capture employee expertise to create its knowledge assets (addressed by the SECI model) and a way to structure this knowledge within its sales process (addressed by the DIKW model). Therefore, using both models together provides the most complete solution.
