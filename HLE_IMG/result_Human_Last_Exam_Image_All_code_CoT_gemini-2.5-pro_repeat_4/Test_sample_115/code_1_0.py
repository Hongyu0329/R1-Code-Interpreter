    This function calculates the number of models for the 3-CNF formulas
    that could have generated the given graph.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  The graph structure (clause partition and negation edges) is unique.
        This implies that the min and max number of models are the same.
    2.  The formula has 4 clauses and 6 variables.
    3.  We can calculate the total number of models by summing contributions
        for each independent set of size 4.
        Contribution of an independent set I is 2^(n_vars - |V(I)|),
        where n_vars=6 and V(I) is the set of variables in I.
    4.  The calculation is done by casework, based on the choice of vertex
        from one of the triangles.
