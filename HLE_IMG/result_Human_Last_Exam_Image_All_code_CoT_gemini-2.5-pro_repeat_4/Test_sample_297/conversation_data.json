    "My plan is to find the secret word by first identifying numerical clues hidden within the visual elements of the image. I'll count distinct objects or patterns to get these numbers. Based on the prompt's hint about an \"equation,\" I will then try to form a simple mathematical relationship between these numbers. The result of this equation will be the key to the final answer. I hypothesize that the result, a number, will correspond to a letter in the alphabet (e.g., 1=A, 2=B, 3=C), which will be the \"secret word\" or character.\n\n1.  **Count top border elements:** I will count the number of repeating square blocks along the top edge of the image.\n2.  **Count right border colors:** I will count the number of distinct colors in the repeating vertical pattern on the right edge of the image.\n3.  **Form the equation:** I will use the numbers from the previous steps to form a simple division equation.\n4.  **Find the secret character:** The result of the equation will be used as an index to find the corresponding letter in the English alphabet. This letter is the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the puzzle by counting elements in the image,\n    forming an equation, and deriving the secret character.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Count the repeating blocks on the top border.\n    # By manual inspection, there are 24 blocks.\n    num_top_blocks = 24\n\n    # Step 2: Count the distinct colors on the right border.\n    # The repeating pattern consists of Black, White, Magenta, Yellow,\n    # Cyan, Green, Red, and Blue.\n    num_side_colors = 8\n\n    # Step 3: Form an equation. The most plausible simple relationship\n    # is division.\n    result = num_top_blocks // num_side_colors\n\n    # Step 4: Find the secret character. The result '3' corresponds to the\n    # 3rd letter of the alphabet, which is 'C'. The word \"Cake\" in the image\n    # also hints at the letter 'C'.\n    # We can get the alphabet from the string module.\n    alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase\n    secret_character = alphabet[result - 1]\n\n    # As requested, print the equation with each number.\n    print(f\"The equation derived from the image is: {num_top_blocks} / {num_side_colors} = {result}\")\n    print(f\"The result is {result}, which corresponds to the letter '{secret_character}'.\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n<<<C>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the secret word that is encrypted in the image\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
