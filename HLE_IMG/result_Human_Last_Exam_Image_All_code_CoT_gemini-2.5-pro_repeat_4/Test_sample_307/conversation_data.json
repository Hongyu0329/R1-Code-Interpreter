    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Visuals**: The task requires finding the infinity-norm for each of the nine matrices (Wigner 3-j symbols) shown in the image. The infinity-norm is the maximum absolute row sum. Since I cannot access the raw numerical data, I will estimate these norms by visually inspecting the images.\n2.  **Establish a Scale**: I will create a consistent numerical scale corresponding to the color intensities in the plots. A simple linear scale should be effective, as the final ratio is independent of the absolute scale chosen. I'll use:\n    *   Brightest color (red or green): Magnitude of 2.0\n    *   Medium shade: Magnitude of 1.0\n    *   Faint shade: Magnitude of 0.5\n    *   White: Magnitude of 0.0\n3.  **Estimate Norms**: For each of the nine sub-images, I will identify the horizontal row that appears to have the largest sum of magnitudes. I will then calculate this sum using my established scale. This sum will be my estimate for the infinity-norm of that matrix.\n4.  **Identify Max and Min**: After estimating the nine norms, I will find the maximum and minimum values among them. My visual analysis suggests Image 5 will have the maximum norm and Image 6 will have the minimum.\n5.  **Calculate Ratio**: Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation based on my estimations and print the ratio of the maximum norm to the minimum norm, including the values used in the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the estimated infinity-norms for each of the 9 images.\n# The norms are estimated by visually inspecting the images and finding the\n# maximum absolute row sum. We assign relative magnitudes to the colors:\n# Bright = 2.0, Medium = 1.0, Faint = 0.5.\n# The sign of the value (red/green) is irrelevant for the infinity-norm.\n\n# Estimated composition of the strongest row for each image:\n# - Image 1: 4 bright, 4 medium => 4*2.0 + 4*1.0 = 12.0\n# - Image 2: 4 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 4*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 11.0\n# - Image 3: 4 bright, 4 medium => 4*2.0 + 4*1.0 = 12.0\n# - Image 4: 4 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 4*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 11.0\n# - Image 5: 5 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 5*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 13.0\n# - Image 6: 2 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 2*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 7.0\n# - Image 7: 3 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 3*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 9.0\n# - Image 8: 3 bright, 2 medium, 2 faint => 3*2.0 + 2*1.0 + 2*0.5 = 9.0\n# - Image 9: Appears as a lower-intensity version of Image 3. Assuming an\n#            intensity scaling factor of 0.8, its norm is 12.0 * 0.8 = 9.6.\n\nestimated_norms = [12.0, 11.0, 12.0, 11.0, 13.0, 7.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.6]\n\n# Step 2: Find the maximum and minimum norms from the list.\nmax_norm = max(estimated_norms)\nmin_norm = min(estimated_norms)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio.\nratio = max_norm / min_norm\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number and the result.\nprint(\"Based on visual estimation, the infinity-norms are:\")\nprint(estimated_norms)\nprint(f\"\\nMaximum norm found: {max_norm}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum norm found: {min_norm}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe equation for the ratio is:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = Maximum Norm / Minimum Norm\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {max_norm} / {min_norm} = {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<1.8571428571428572>>>"
