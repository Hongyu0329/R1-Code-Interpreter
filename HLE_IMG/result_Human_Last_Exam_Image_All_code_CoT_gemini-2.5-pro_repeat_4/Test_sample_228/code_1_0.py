    1.  The image is a collage, a technique popular with Surrealists. It combines
        unrelated elements—a human-animal hybrid, mythological references (Persephone),
        dream-like text, and anatomical diagrams—to create an irrational,
        dream-like scene.
    
    2.  This artistic approach is characteristic of Surrealism, a movement that sought
        to express the workings of the unconscious mind.
    
    3.  The Surrealist movement was directly and heavily inspired by the psychoanalytic
        theories of Sigmund Freud. His ideas about the unconscious, dream interpretation,
        and repressed desires provided the intellectual framework for the Surrealists'
        exploration of the human psyche through art.
    
    4.  The artwork's focus on dream logic, symbolic imagery, and psychological states
        is a direct visual application of Freudian concepts.
