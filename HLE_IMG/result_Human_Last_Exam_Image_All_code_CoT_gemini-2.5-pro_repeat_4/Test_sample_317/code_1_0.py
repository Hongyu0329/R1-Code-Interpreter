    # Step 1: Determine k.
    # The fixed point analysis shows x3 = Re/5.
    # The plots show x3 is centered around 16-18.
    # Re = 50 * k. So, 16 < (50*k)/5 < 18 => 16 < 10*k < 18.
    # The most plausible integer k is 2, giving Re = 100 and x3_fixed = 20.
    k = 2

    # Step 2: Identify the axes for x1, x2, x3, x4.
    # x3 has a large non-zero average value, so its horizontal axis must be f.
    # Damping terms are -2x1, -9x2, -5x4. Expected amplitudes: |x1| > |x4| > |x2|.
    # Ranges in Set 2: H_h > H_g > H_i.
    # This maps x1->h, x4->g, x2->i.
    # So the order for x1, x2, x3, x4 is h, i, f, g.
