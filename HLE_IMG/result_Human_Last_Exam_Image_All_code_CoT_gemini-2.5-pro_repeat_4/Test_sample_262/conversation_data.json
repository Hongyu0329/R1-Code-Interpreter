    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures**: I will first examine the chemical structures of the four Iridium(III) complexes provided in the image. All complexes share a common [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ architecture, where N^N is the 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand and is the same for all four. The key difference lies in the two cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are phenylpyridine derivatives with different fluorine substitution patterns on the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability**: The operational lifetime of these complexes in a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is strongly correlated with their chemical stability. A primary degradation mechanism for such complexes involves the cleavage of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of the cyclometalating ligand.\n\n3.  **Apply Chemical Principles**: I will apply a known principle from organometallic chemistry regarding the stability of fluorinated phenylpyridine ligands. While electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine can generally strengthen the Ir-C bond and improve stability, their position on the phenyl ring is critical. Specifically, a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position (position 2 relative to the Ir-C bond) is known to introduce a specific degradation pathway. This proximity to the metal center makes the C-F bond susceptible to cleavage under operating conditions, which significantly destabilizes the complex and shortens its lifetime.\n\n4.  **Identify Unstable Complexes**: I will inspect each complex to see if its C^N ligand contains a fluorine atom at the ortho-position.\n    *   **Complex 1**: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. It has an ortho-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 2**: 2-phenylpyridine ligand. It has no fluorine substituents.\n    *   **Complex 3**: 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. It has an ortho-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 4**: 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. It has only meta-fluorines.\n\n5.  **Formulate Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, the complexes containing an ortho-fluorine substituent ([1] and [3]) are expected to be the least stable and therefore exhibit shorter lifetimes. I will write a Python script to automate this identification process and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium(III) complexes based on their ligand structure.\n\n    The stability, and thus the operational lifetime in a Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC),\n    of these cyclometalated Iridium complexes is highly dependent on the substituents on the\n    phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n\n    A key principle is that a fluorine atom at the ortho-position (position 2) of the phenyl ring\n    (relative to the Ir-C bond) introduces a significant degradation pathway, leading to a shorter\n    lifetime.
