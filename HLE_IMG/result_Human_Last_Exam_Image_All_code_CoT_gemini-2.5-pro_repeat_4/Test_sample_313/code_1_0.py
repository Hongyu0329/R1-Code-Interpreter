# The problem asks to identify the term "X Y" based on two clues.

# Clue 1: "X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019."
# The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov, a top goal-scorer, at the 2019 NHL awards.
# A significant feat in hockey is the "Hat Trick" (three goals in a game).

# Clue 2: "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts."
# The origin of the term "hat trick" involves being awarded a hat.
# Historically, hat-making (by "hatters") involved using mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt, a practice that has now ceased.

# The common link is the word "Hat". Therefore, X Y is "Hat Trick".

X = "Hat"
Y = "Trick"

# Printing the final answer
print(f"The term X Y is: {X} {Y}")
