    "My thinking process to solve this riddle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image and the First Clue:** The image displays two men at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" A reverse image search or knowledge of sports events identifies the man on the right as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player. The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, where he won several trophies, including the Art Ross Trophy as the league's top scorer. A very notable achievement for a top scorer in hockey is a \"hat trick\" - scoring three goals in a single game. This suggests that \"X Y\" might be \"Hat Trick\", with the image representing the concept through a celebrated goal-scorer.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Second Clue:** The second clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical or industrial context involving mercury.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** I need to find a link between \"Hat Trick\" and \"mercury salts\".\n    *   The term \"hat trick\" is widely believed to have originated in the 1850s in the sport of cricket. A bowler who took three wickets with three consecutive balls would be rewarded with a new hat, paid for by a collection from the fans.\n    *   This brings us to the history of hat-making. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a process called \"carroting\" was used to separate fur from the skin of animals like beavers and rabbits to make felt for hats. This process used a solution of mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt.\n    *   Hat makers, or \"hatters,\" were exposed to mercury vapors daily, which often led to severe neurological damage from mercury poisoning. This is the origin of the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   Due to its extreme toxicity, the use of mercury in the hat-making industry has been banned and has ceased.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The term \"Hat Trick\" (X Y) fits both clues. The first clue is represented by a famous hockey player known for scoring, and the second clue relates to the origin of the term \"hat\" in \"hat trick,\" which connects to the historical use of mercury salts by \"hatters.\"\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify the term \"X Y\" based on two clues.\n\n# Clue 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n# The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov, a top goal-scorer, at the 2019 NHL awards.\n# A significant feat in hockey is the \"Hat Trick\" (three goals in a game).\n\n# Clue 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n# The origin of the term \"hat trick\" involves being awarded a hat.\n# Historically, hat-making (by \"hatters\") involved using mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt, a practice that has now ceased.\n\n# The common link is the word \"Hat\". Therefore, X Y is \"Hat Trick\".\n\nX = \"Hat\"\nY = \"Trick\"\n\n# Printing the final answer\nprint(f\"The term X Y is: {X} {Y}\")\n\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
