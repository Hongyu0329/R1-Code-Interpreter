    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the distinct, dense vertical bands of neural activity. These bands represent synchronized bursts where many electrodes fire at nearly the same time.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: For each identified burst, I will estimate its center time from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between the timestamps of each consecutive pair of bursts.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI**: I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output**: I will present the final average rounded to two significant figures and provide Python code that performs and documents these calculations.\n\nBased on my visual analysis, I have identified five distinct bursts at the following approximate timestamps: 3 s, 17 s, 26 s, 36 s, and 49 s. Now I will use code to calculate the average interval.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals, and computes their average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the approximate center timestamp for each synchronized burst.\n    # These are estimated visually from the dense vertical columns of activity in the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 17, 26, 36, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the intervals between consecutive bursts.\n    intervals = []\n    print(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n        intervals.append(interval)\n        # The prompt requires showing the numbers in the final equation,\n        # but showing the individual subtractions is also helpful for clarity.\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval} s\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the intervals.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    interval_strings = [str(i) for i in intervals]\n    equation = f\"({ ' + '.join(interval_strings) }) / {len(intervals)}\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nAverage interval calculation: {equation} = {average_interval:.3f} s\")\n\n    # Step 4: Round the final answer to two significant figures.\n    # For a number like 11.5, two significant figures is 12.\n    average_rounded = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval, rounded to two significant figures, is: {average_rounded} s\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
