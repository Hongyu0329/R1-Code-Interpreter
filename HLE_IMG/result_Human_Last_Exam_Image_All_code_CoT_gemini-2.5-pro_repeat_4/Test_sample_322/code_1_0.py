def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the vortex trajectory puzzle.

    The solution is a 16-character string derived from analyzing each of the 16 plots.
    Each character represents the unique vortex in the corresponding plot:
    - B/b: Blue vortex is unique (Twice/Half strength)
    - G/g: Green vortex is unique (Twice/Half strength)
    - R/r: Red vortex is unique (Twice/Half strength)

    The analysis for each plot is as follows:
    1: G (Green is strong, central spiral)
    2: B (Blue is strong, central spiral)
    3: G (Green is strong, central in chaos)
    4: r (Red is weak, flung out)
    5: b (Blue is weak, flung out)
    6: G (Green is strong, central spiral)
    7: R (Red is strong, central in chaos)
    8: b (Blue is weak, flung out)
    9: g (Green is weak, trapped)
    10: B (Blue is strong, central spiral)
    11: B (Blue is strong, central in chaos)
    12: R (Red is strong, central spiral)
    13: b (Blue is weak, trapped)
    14: b (Blue is weak, trapped)
    15: R (Red is strong, central in chaos)
    16: G (Green is strong, central spiral)
