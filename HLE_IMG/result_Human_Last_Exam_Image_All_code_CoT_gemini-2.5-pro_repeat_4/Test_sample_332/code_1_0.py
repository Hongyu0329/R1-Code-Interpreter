    # Step 3: The Carl Sagan "X of Y" phrase.
    # The prompt refers to Sagan's thoughts on images of Earth from space,

    # context is as "a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam."

    # The riddle's key is connecting the namesake's "origin" to the phrase.
    # Júlíana Sveinsdóttir was a pioneer of Icelandic abstract art and was known
    # for incorporating volcanic ash and sand from her native landscape into her
    # paintings and textile works. Volcanic ash and sand are, in essence, dust.

    # Step 5: The final answer.
    # With the phrase identified as "Mote of Dust", we can determine Y.
    # The instruction to "output each number in the final equation" is not
    # applicable to this word-based problem.
