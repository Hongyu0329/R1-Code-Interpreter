    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, we need to first identify the complete text and then count the syllables to see if it fits a known metrical form.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Poem's Text:** The poem is a collage that includes not only the cut-out words but also other prominent text on the page, which is a common technique in this art form. The complete text includes the chapter title (\"THE FIRST STEP\"), the cut-out words (\"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\"), and the page number (\"35\").\n2.  **Consider the \"American Sentence\" Form:** One of the answer choices is \"American Sentence,\" a specific poetic form created by Allen Ginsberg, which consists of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. The artist of this piece, Mary-Kim Arnold, is known for using this form. This provides a strong clue that we should check if the total syllable count is 17.\n3.  **Count the Syllables:** We will count the syllables for each part of the combined text.\n    *   \"The first step\": 3 syllables (1+1+1)\n    *   \"rules and lines,\": 3 syllables (1+1+1)\n    *   \"an intricate spider's web\": 7 syllables (1+3+2+1)\n    *   \"work\": 1 syllable\n    *   \"35\" (read as \"thirty-five\"): 3 syllables (2+1)\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** We will sum the syllable counts to see if they match the 17 syllables required for an American Sentence.\n5.  **Conclusion:** If the total is 17, the poem follows the American Sentence pattern.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poem_metrics():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of syllables in the erasure poem\n    to identify its metric pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem's text is formed by combining the title, the cut-out words,\n    # and the page number from the image.\n    # We define the phrases and their corresponding syllable counts in a dictionary.\n    poem_components = {\n        \"The first step\": 3,\n        \"rules and lines,\": 3,\n        \"an intricate spider's web\": 7,\n        \"work\": 1,\n        \"thirty-five (from page number 35)\": 3\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the poem's syllable count to determine its metric pattern.\")\n    print(\"The poem is constructed from text elements on the page:\")\n    \n    syllable_counts = []\n    for component, count in poem_components.items():\n        print(f\"- '{component}' has {count} syllables.\")\n        syllable_counts.append(count)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of syllables\n    total_syllables = sum(syllable_counts)\n\n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, syllable_counts))\n\n    print(\"\\nSumming the syllables to find the total:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_syllables}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe poem has a total of 17 syllables.\")\n    print(\"A single sentence containing exactly 17 syllables is called an 'American Sentence'.\")\n    print(\"This matches option F.\")\n\nanalyze_poem_metrics()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
