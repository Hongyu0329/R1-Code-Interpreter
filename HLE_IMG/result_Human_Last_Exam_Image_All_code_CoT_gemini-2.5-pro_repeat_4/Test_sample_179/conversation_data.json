    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Pattern:** I will examine the provided image, which is a \"piano roll\" style visualization of a piece of music. I'll focus on the rhythm and melodic contour rather than trying to transcribe the exact notes, as these visualizations can sometimes be simplified or transposed.\n2.  **Identify the Rhythmic Motif:** The most prominent feature is a repeating rhythmic pattern. It consists of a long, sustained note followed by two quicker, shorter notes. This `LONG, short-short` pattern repeats three times in the visible segment.\n3.  **Match the Motif to a Famous Piece:** This specific rhythmic and melodic structure (`DAA, da-da`) is the iconic and unmistakable main theme of a very famous piano prelude. I will identify this piece as Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G minor.\n4.  **Find the Opus Number:** Once the piece is identified, I will look up its catalog information to find the associated opus number. The Prelude in G minor is the fifth piece in Rachmaninoff's set of Ten Preludes.\n5.  **State the Conclusion:** The set of Ten Preludes is designated as Opus 23. Therefore, the correct opus number is 23. I will write a Python script to print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the musical pattern and identifies the correct opus number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    piece_name = \"Prelude in G minor\"\n    composer = \"Sergei Rachmaninoff\"\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the visual pattern and its rhythm.\n    # The image displays a clear rhythmic pattern: a long sustained note,\n    # followed by two quicker, descending notes.
