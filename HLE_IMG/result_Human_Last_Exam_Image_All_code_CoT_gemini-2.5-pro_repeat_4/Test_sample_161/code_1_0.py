    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.
    The reaction is a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis.
    The alpha-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.
    The missing reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with their substituents.
    By analyzing the final product (tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate),
    we deduce that the missing reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine.
