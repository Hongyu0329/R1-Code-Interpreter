    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Grid:** The ECG strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid is composed of small squares (1 mm) and large squares (5 mm).\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square:**\n    *   The time for 1 mm of paper to pass is 1 sec / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Therefore, one small square (1 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n    *   One large square (5 mm) represents 5 * 0.04 = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes).\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** I've identified several long pauses. The longest one appears in multiple places, for example, in the fourth strip between the 3rd and 4th beats. By counting the small squares between the peaks of these two R-waves, I find the distance is approximately 24 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Duration:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to get the total duration in seconds.\n    *   Calculation: 24 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation and output the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function is based on visual analysis of the provided ECG image.\n    1. The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n    2. A small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n    3. The time represented by one small square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    4. By visually inspecting the ECG, the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves\n       is identified and measured in small squares. This longest interval spans 24 small squares.\n    5. The duration in seconds is calculated by multiplying the number of squares by the time per square.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Paper speed in mm per second\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n    \n    # Time per small square (1 mm) in seconds\n    time_per_small_square = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n    \n    # Longest R-R interval measured in number of small squares from the ECG\n    num_small_squares = 24\n    \n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = num_small_squares * time_per_small_square\n    \n    # Print the equation and the final answer\n    print(f\"To find the longest R-R interval in seconds, we use the formula:\")\n    print(f\"Duration = (Number of Small Squares) * (Time per Small Square)\")\n    print(f\"Based on the ECG at 25 mm/sec, Time per Small Square = 1 / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} = {time_per_small_square} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"The longest interval spans {num_small_squares} small squares.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_small_squares} * {time_per_small_square} = {longest_rr_interval_sec}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds.\")\n\ncalculate_longest_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<0.96>>>"
