    # The SEM image shows the 3D structure. The new flagellum consistently grows to the left of the old flagellum,

    position_of_new_flagellum_relative_to_old = "left"

    # Step 2: Understand the orientation of Images 2 and 3 (TEM).
    # The problem states the view is a transverse section from posterior to anterior.
    # This means the left side of the image corresponds to the cell's actual left side.
    viewing_orientation = "Posterior to Anterior"

    # Step 3: Combine the information to identify the new flagellum in the TEM images.
    # Since the new flagellum is on the cell's left side (from Step 1), and the TEM image's
    # left side is the cell's left side (from Step 2), the new flagellum will appear on the left in the TEM images.

    # Step 4: Apply the logic to Image 2.
    # Image 2 shows two flagella. The one on the left of the image is the new one.

    # Image 3 also shows two flagella. The one on the left of the image is the new one.
