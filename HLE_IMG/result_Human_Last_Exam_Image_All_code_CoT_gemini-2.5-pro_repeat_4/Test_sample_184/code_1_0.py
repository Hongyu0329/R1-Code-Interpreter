# This script will print the letters corresponding to the two products of the reaction.

# Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence.
# The first reaction is a thermal 4-pi electrocyclic ring opening of a chiral cyclobutene.
# This conrotatory process creates two diastereomeric diene intermediates.
# Diene I has the Me group "in" and OMe group "out" in the s-cis conformation.
# Diene II has the OMe group "in" and the Me group "out".

# Step 2: Analyze the Diels-Alder reaction.
# The reaction is specified to proceed in an "endo" fashion.
# The endo rule dictates that the CO2Et group of the dienophile will be cis to the "inner" substituent of the diene.

# Step 3: Determine the products.
# For Diene I (inner Me), the product has CO2Et cis to Me. This corresponds to structure B.
# For Diene II (inner OMe), the product has CO2Et cis to OMe. This corresponds to structure A.
