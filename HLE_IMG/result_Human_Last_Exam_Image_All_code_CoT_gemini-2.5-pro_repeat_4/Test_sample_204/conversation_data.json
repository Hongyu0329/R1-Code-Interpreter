    "To solve this, I will first identify each mineral specimen based on its visual characteristics. Then, I will determine the silicate structure for each identified mineral. Silicate structures are classified by how the silica tetrahedra (the basic [SiO₄]⁴⁻ building block) are linked together. The complexity increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify Specimen A:** A dark, prismatic crystal. This appears to be tourmaline, a cyclosilicate (ring silicate).\n2.  **Identify Specimen B:** A green, flaky mineral with excellent cleavage in one direction. This is characteristic of a mica-group mineral, which is a phyllosilicate (sheet silicate).\n3.  **Identify Specimen C:** A granular mass of green crystals. This is a classic habit for olivine, a nesosilicate (isolated tetrahedra).\n4.  **Identify Specimen D:** A translucent, well-formed hexagonal crystal. This is quartz, a tectosilicate (framework silicate).\n5.  **Order by Complexity:** I will order these structures from least to most complex based on the degree of polymerization (sharing of oxygen atoms):\n    *   **Nesosilicates (Isolated tetrahedra):** Least complex (e.g., Olivine).\n    *   **Cyclosilicates (Ring silicates):** More complex (e.g., Tourmaline).\n    *   **Phyllosilicates (Sheet silicates):** Even more complex (e.g., Mica).\n    *   **Tectosilicates (Framework silicates):** Most complex (e.g., Quartz).\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to store this information, sort the specimens by their structural complexity, and print the resulting order.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens, classifies their silicate structures,\n    and orders them by increasing structural complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1-4: Identify specimens and classify their silicate structure.\n    # The complexity rank is based on the degree of polymerization of silica tetrahedra:\n    # 1: Nesosilicate (isolated)\n    # 2: Cyclosilicate (rings)\n    # 3: Phyllosilicate (sheets)\n    # 4: Tectosilicate (framework)\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Tourmaline', 'structure': 'Cyclosilicate', 'complexity_rank': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet Silicate)', 'complexity_rank': 3},\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity_rank': 1},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework Silicate)', 'complexity_rank': 4},\n    ]\n\n    # Step 5: Sort the specimens by their complexity rank.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity_rank'])\n\n    # Print the identification of each specimen\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Silicate Structure:\")\n    for specimen in specimens:\n        print(f\"  - Specimen {specimen['label']}: {specimen['mineral']} ({specimen['structure']})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    \n    # Extract the labels in the new sorted order.\n    ordered_labels = [s['label'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    # Print the final ordered sequence.\n    print(\" -> \".join(ordered_labels))\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C -> A -> B -> D>>>"
