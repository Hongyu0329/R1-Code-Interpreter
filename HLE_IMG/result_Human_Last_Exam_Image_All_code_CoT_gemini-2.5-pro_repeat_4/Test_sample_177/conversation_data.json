    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Baseline Car VMT**: For each trip distance category, we'll calculate a relative VMT. This is done by multiplying the `share of total trips` for that category by the total car mode share (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and the `average trip distance`. Summing these values across all distance categories gives us the total relative VMT for the baseline scenario.\n\n2.  **Calculate Proposed Car VMT**: We will repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table to find the total relative VMT for the proposed scenario.\n\n3.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**: Using the VMT values from the baseline and proposed scenarios, we will calculate the percentage reduction using the formula:\n    `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nThe absolute total number of trips is not needed as it will cancel out when calculating the percentage difference. The average carpool occupancy is also not required because the question asks for *Vehicle* Miles Traveled, not *Person* Miles Traveled.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_vmt(car_1_occupant_share, car_multi_occupant_share, share_of_total_trips, average_trip_distance):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total relative Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).\n    VMT is calculated as the sum of VMT for each trip distance category.\n    VMT per category = (share of total trips) * (total car mode share) * (average trip distance)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sum the shares of the two car modes to get the total car mode share for each distance category\n    total_car_share = np.add(car_1_occupant_share, car_multi_occupant_share)\n    \n    # Calculate the VMT for each distance category\n    vmt_by_category = np.multiply(np.multiply(share_of_total_trips, total_car_share), average_trip_distance)\n    \n    # Sum the VMT across all categories to get the total VMT\n    total_vmt = np.sum(vmt_by_category)\n    \n    return total_vmt\n\n# --- Data from the tables ---\n\n# Data that is common for both scenarios\nshare_of_total_trips = np.array([0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16])\naverage_trip_distance = np.array([1, 4, 7.5, 20]) # in miles\n\n# Baseline scenario data (Table 1)\nbaseline_car_1_occupant_share = np.array([0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42])\nbaseline_car_multi_occupant_share = np.array([0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47])\n\n# Proposed scenario data (Table 2)\nproposed_car_1_occupant_share = np.array([0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16])\nproposed_car_multi_occupant_share = np.array([0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33])\n\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.
