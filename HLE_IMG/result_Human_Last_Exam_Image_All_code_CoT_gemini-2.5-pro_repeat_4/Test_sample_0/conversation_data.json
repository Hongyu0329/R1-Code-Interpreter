    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board and Constraints:** I'll carefully examine the position of all pieces for both White and Black. The key constraints are that it's Black's turn to move, the goal is a checkmate in two of Black's moves, and Black's queens on a2 and b1 cannot be moved.\n\n2.  **Identify White's Limitations:** A crucial observation is that White's bishop on c1 is blocked by Black's pawn on c2. This severely restricts White's legal moves to only its pawns on h2 and e5.\n\n3.  **Find Black's Key First Move:** I will search for a forcing first move for Black. A check is the most forcing type of move. I'll test the candidate move `Ng3+`.\n\n4.  **Analyze White's Forced Replies:** Since `Ng3+` is a check, White has a limited number of legal responses. I will analyze both of them:\n    *   Case A: White moves the king (`Kh1`).\n    *   Case B: White captures the knight with the pawn (`hxg3`).\n\n5.  **Find Black's Mating Second Move:** For each of White's possible replies, I must find a move for Black that results in an immediate checkmate.\n    *   In Case A (`Kh1`), I will find Black's second move that checkmates the king on h1.\n    *   In Case B (`hxg3`), I will find Black's second move that checkmates the king on g1, taking into account the newly opened g-file and the trapped White bishop.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** Once I've confirmed that a mate is guaranteed regardless of White's reply, I will format the sequence of Black's moves using standard chess notation as requested, presenting it within a Python code block. The notation will show Black's first move and the possible mating moves for the second turn.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The puzzle is a mate in 2 for Black, without moving the queens.\n\n    The key move is Ng3+. This forces White into one of two replies,\n    both of which lead to an immediate checkmate on Black's next move.\n\n    Variation 1:\n    1. ... Ng3+\n    2. Kh1 ... (White's king moves to h1)\n    3. ... Rg8# (Black's rook delivers mate)\n\n    Variation 2:\n    1. ... Ng3+\n    2. hxg3 ... (White's pawn captures the knight)\n    3. ... Rf1# (Black's rook delivers mate, which is possible because White's bishop on c1 is trapped and cannot capture the rook)\n\n    The puzzle asks for the sequence of black's moves.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_move = \"Ng3+\"\n    second_move_variation_1 = \"Rg8#\"\n    second_move_variation_2 = \"Rf1#\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the sequence. We present the first move,\n    # and then the two possible mating second moves.\n    # The notation \"move1 / move2\" is used to show alternatives.\n    print(f\"1... {first_move}  2... {second_move_variation_1} / {second_move_variation_2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<1... Ng3+  2... Rg8# / Rf1#>>>"
