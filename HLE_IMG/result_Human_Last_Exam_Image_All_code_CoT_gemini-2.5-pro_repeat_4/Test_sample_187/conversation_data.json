    "This reaction proceeds through a two-step pericyclic mechanism.\n\n1.  **Step 1: 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition.** The starting mesoionic compound, a MÃ¼nchnone, acts as a 1,3-dipole. It reacts with the electron-deficient alkyne, dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which serves as the dipolarophile. This is a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a bicyclic intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Cheletropic Elimination.** The bicyclic intermediate is unstable and readily undergoes a retro-cycloaddition to achieve aromaticity. In this step, a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) is eliminated. This type of reaction, where a small stable molecule is extruded in a concerted fashion, is known as a cheletropic elimination.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and a cheletropic elimination, and the stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide.\n\nHere is the Python code to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the two types of pericyclic reactions and the stoichiometric\n  byproduct in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n  \"\"\"\n  reaction_type_1 = \"1,3-dipolar cycloaddition\"\n  reaction_type_2 = \"cheletropic elimination\"\n  byproduct = \"carbon dioxide (CO2)\"\n\n  print(f\"The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are a {reaction_type_1} and a {reaction_type_2}.\")\n  print(f\"The stoichiometric byproduct is {byproduct}.\")\n\nsolve_reaction_mechanism()\n```\n<<<1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and cheletropic elimination; carbon dioxide (CO2)>>>"
