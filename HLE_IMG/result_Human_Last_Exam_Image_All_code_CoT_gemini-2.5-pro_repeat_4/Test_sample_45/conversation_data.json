    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the largest integer 'n' such that rotating the entire pattern by 360/n degrees around a certain point leaves the pattern unchanged. We will test the possible crystallographic symmetries (n=6, 4, 3, 2) from highest to lowest.\n\n1.  **Test for 6-fold symmetry (60° rotation):**\n    A natural candidate for a 6-fold rotation center is the center of one of the large blue hexagons. Let's examine the shapes immediately surrounding such a hexagon. We can see an alternating pattern of yellow squares and smaller orange rhombi. If we rotate the pattern by 60°, a yellow square would have to land on the position of an orange rhombus. Since these shapes are different, the pattern is not unchanged. Therefore, the tiling does not have 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n2.  **Test for 4-fold symmetry (90° rotation):**\n    A candidate for a 4-fold rotation center is the center of a yellow square. Let's observe the orientation of the shapes around it. Directly \"above\" a yellow square is a blue hexagon, which is oriented with two of its sides perfectly horizontal. If we rotate the pattern by 90° around the center of the square, this hexagon should map onto the hexagon located directly to the \"right\" of the square. However, the hexagon to the right is oriented differently; it has two sides that are perfectly vertical. Since an object with horizontal sides is mapped to an object with vertical sides, the pattern is not identical after rotation. Thus, the tiling does not have 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Test for 3-fold symmetry (120° rotation):**\n    Let's return to the center of a blue hexagon. Let's test for 3-fold symmetry. Surrounding the hexagon is a ring of three yellow squares (at roughly 12, 4, and 8 o'clock) and three orange rhombi (at 2, 6, and 10 o'clock). A 120° rotation would map the square at 12 o'clock to the position at 4 o'clock, where there is another square. This seems to work. However, let's check the orientation. The square at 12 o'clock has vertical and horizontal sides. The square at 4 o'clock is tilted. Since the orientations do not match, the tiling does not have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n4.  **Test for 2-fold symmetry (180° rotation):**\n    Let's test the center of a yellow square again. A 180° rotation would map the blue hexagon \"above\" the square to the blue hexagon \"below\" it. The hexagon above has horizontal sides, and so does the one below. This matches. The hexagon to the \"right\" (with vertical sides) would be mapped to the hexagon to the \"left\" (which also has vertical sides). This also matches. A full check of the other surrounding shapes confirms that a 180° rotation around the center of a yellow square leaves the entire tiling unchanged.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe tiling does not have 6-fold, 4-fold, or 3-fold symmetry. It does have 2-fold symmetry. Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to find the rotational symmetry of the given tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the tiling to determine its rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(\"Rotational symmetry of order 'n' means the tiling is unchanged by a 360/n degree rotation.\")\n    print(\"We test for the highest possible orders of symmetry first.\\n\")\n\n    # Test for n=6\n    n = 6\n    rotation_angle = 360 / n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Test for {n}-fold symmetry ({rotation_angle}° rotation).\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of a blue hexagon as the rotation center.\")\n    print(\"The hexagon is surrounded by alternating yellow squares and orange rhombi.\")\n    print(f\"A {rotation_angle}° rotation would map a yellow square onto an orange rhombus.\")\n    print(\"Since the shapes are different, the tiling does NOT have 6-fold symmetry.\\n\")\n\n    # Test for n=4\n    n = 4\n    rotation_angle = 360 / n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Test for {n}-fold symmetry ({rotation_angle}° rotation).\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of a yellow square as the rotation center.\")\n    print(\"The blue hexagon directly 'above' this square has horizontal sides.\")\n    print(f\"A {rotation_angle}° rotation maps this hexagon to the 'right' of the square.\")\n    print(\"The hexagon to the 'right' has vertical sides, not horizontal.\")\n    print(\"Since the orientation changes, the tiling does NOT have 4-fold symmetry.\\n\")\n    \n    # Test for n=3\n    n = 3\n    rotation_angle = 360 / n\n    print(f\"Step 4: Test for {n}-fold symmetry ({rotation_angle}° rotation).\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of a blue hexagon again.\")\n    print(\"The yellow square 'above' it has horizontal/vertical sides.\")\n    print(f\"A {rotation_angle}° rotation maps this square to a position where the square is tilted.\")\n    print(\"Since the orientation changes, the tiling does NOT have 3-fold symmetry.\\n\")\n\n    # Test for n=2\n    n = 2\n    rotation_angle = 360 / n\n    print(f\"Step 5: Test for {n}-fold symmetry ({rotation_angle}° rotation).\")\n    print(\"Let's use the center of a yellow square again.\")\n    print(f\"A {rotation_angle}° rotation maps the hexagon 'above' (horizontal sides) to the one 'below' (also horizontal sides).\")\n    print(f\"It also maps the hexagon to the 'right' (vertical sides) to the one on the 'left' (also vertical sides).\")\n    print(\"All shapes map to identical shapes with the same orientation.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the tiling HAS 2-fold symmetry.\\n\")\n\n    # Conclusion\n    final_answer = 2\n    print(\"Step 6: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The highest order of rotational symmetry is {final_answer}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_symmetry()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
