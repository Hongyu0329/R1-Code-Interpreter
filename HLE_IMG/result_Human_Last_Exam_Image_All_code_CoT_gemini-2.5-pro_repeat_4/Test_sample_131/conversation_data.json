    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will first identify the chemical structure provided in the image. The structure is a known polycyclic alkaloid. To satisfy the request for a code-based solution, I will write a Python script that not only states the name of the compound but also calculates its molecular weight based on its chemical formula, showing the full calculation as requested.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the compound from the provided chemical structure. The compound is Matrine.\n2.  Determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms: C₁₅H₂₄N₂O.\n3.  Write a Python script to:\n    a. Store the atomic weights of Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen.\n    b. Store the count of each atom from the molecular formula.\n    c. Print the name of the compound.\n    d. Calculate the molecular weight by summing the weights of all atoms.\n    e. Print the full calculation equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the alkaloid compound, provides its molecular formula,\n    and calculates its molecular weight.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Name of the compound\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n\n    # Molecular formula: C15H24N2O\n    atom_counts = {'C': 15, 'H': 24, 'N': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Standard atomic weights (g/mol)\n    atomic_weights = {'C': 12.011, 'H': 1.008, 'N': 14.007, 'O': 15.999}\n\n    # Print the name and formula\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n    print(f\"Its molecular formula is C{atom_counts['C']}H{atom_counts['H']}N{atom_counts['N']}O{atom_counts['O']}.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the molecular weight:\")\n\n    # Calculate and build the equation string\n    total_mw = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    for atom, count in atom_counts.items():\n        weight = atomic_weights[atom]\n        total_mw += count * weight\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({count} * {weight})\")\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    # Print the full equation and the result\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_mw:.3f} g/mol\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
