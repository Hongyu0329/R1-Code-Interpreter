# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct statements are identified.
# 1. Higher Lewis number leads to more stable dynamics. The more stable plots, showing damped or monotonic convergence, are 1, 2, and 3. The less stable plots, showing sustained oscillations or chaos, are 4, 5, and 6.
# 2. The set of plots with the higher Lewis number (twice as large) is therefore {1, 2, 3}. This corresponds to statement 12.
# 3. This narrows the possible answers to F and L, as they are the only ones including statement 12.
# 4. Evaluating the pairings proposed in F and L, the set of pairings implied by F ({A: {2,4}, C: {1,6}, B: {3,5}}) is dynamically plausible and fully consistent with the Lewis number analysis.
# 5. Therefore, option F is the most likely correct answer.

# The statements selected in option F are 4, 6, and 12.
# The final task is to print the numbers in the final chosen answer.
