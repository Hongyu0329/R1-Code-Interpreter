The first step is to convert the coordinates from the DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format to Decimal Degrees (DD) to easily locate it on a map.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the conversion and provide the identification:\n\n```python\ndef identify_structure_from_coords():\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts coordinates from DMS to DD and identifies the structure at that location.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Latitude: 29° 06' 18.75''N\n    lat_deg = 29\n    lat_min = 6\n    lat_sec = 18.75\n\n    # Longitude: 103° 47' 50.28''W\n    lon_deg = 103\n    lon_min = 47\n    lon_sec = 50.28\n\n    print(\"--- Coordinate Conversion ---\")\n\n    # --- Latitude Calculation ---\n    print(\"\\nCalculating Latitude (N):\")\n    # Equation: DD = Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)\n    lat_dd = lat_deg + (lat_min / 60) + (lat_sec / 3600)\n    print(f\"Equation: {lat_deg} + ({lat_min} / 60) + ({lat_sec} / 3600)\")\n    print(f\"Result: {lat_deg} + {lat_min / 60:.6f} + {lat_sec / 3600:.6f} = {lat_dd:.6f}\")\n    \n    # --- Longitude Calculation ---\n    print(\"\\nCalculating Longitude (W):\")\n    # Equation: DD = -(Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600))\n    lon_dd = -1 * (lon_deg + (lon_min / 60) + (lon_sec / 3600))\n    print(f\"Equation: -({lon_deg} + ({lon_min} / 60) + ({lon_sec} / 3600))\")\n    print(f\"Result: -({lon_deg} + {lon_min / 60:.6f} + {lon_sec / 3600:.6f}) = {lon_dd:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Identification ---\")\n    print(\"The structure at these coordinates is the ruins of the Presidio de San Vicente.\")\n    print(\"\\nIs it a historic landmark?\")\n    print(\"Yes, it is a significant historic landmark.
