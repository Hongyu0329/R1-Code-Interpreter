    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   The Nitrogen Rule states that a compound with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume one nitrogen atom.\n\n**2. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135**\n*   There are 7 distinct carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   The signals at δ > 100 ppm (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are in the aromatic region, suggesting a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The signals at δ < 100 ppm (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) are in the aliphatic region.\n*   DEPT-135 shows one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and/or CH₃ groups).\n*   Since there are 7 total carbon signals and 6 signals in the DEPT-135 spectrum, one signal must be from a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached protons). The signal at δ 145.1 is the most likely candidate for the quaternary carbon, typical for an ipso-carbon in a substituted benzene ring.\n*   This leaves us with:\n    *   1 Quaternary C (145.1)\n    *   1 CH₂ (negative DEPT-135 signal)\n    *   5 CH/CH₃ (positive DEPT-135 signals)\n\n**3. ¹H NMR**\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This pattern is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.7-2.9 ppm (complex multiplets, total 3H):** The integrations show two overlapping signals, one integrating to ~1H and the other to ~2H. This corresponds to a -CH- group and a -CH₂- group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n*   The total proton count from the spectrum is 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11H.\n*   Given the presence of a nitrogen atom (from MS) and the need to account for the molecular weight of 135, we can deduce the molecular formula. The fragments identified are C₆H₅, CH, CH₂, and CH₃, totaling C₉H₁₁. The remaining mass is 135 - (9*12 + 11*1) = 135 - 119 = 16. This could be an oxygen, but an NH₂ group (mass 16) would fit better with the Nitrogen Rule and give a formula of C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 135). The two protons of the NH₂ group are often broad and may not be clearly visible or may have exchanged with the solvent. The Degree of Unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which perfectly matches a benzene ring.\n\n**4. HSQC**\n*   This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n*   The proton signal at ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the carbon at **19.2 ppm**.\n*   The proton signal at ~2.85 ppm (the 2H signal, CH₂) correlates with the carbon at **43.5 ppm**. This confirms the assignment of the negative DEPT-135 signal.\n*   The proton signal at ~2.75 ppm (the 1H signal, CH) correlates with the carbon at **49.6 ppm**.\n*   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the carbons in the 126-129 ppm range.\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation**\n*   We have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and an -NH₂ group.\n*   From the ¹H NMR, the CH₃ group (δ 1.2) is a doublet, meaning it's next to the CH group. This gives us a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n*   The CH group is coupled to the CH₃ group, and its chemical shift (δ ~2.75 ppm) suggests it's also connected to other groups.\n*   The -CH₂- group's chemical shift (~2.85 ppm) suggests it is benzylic (next to the phenyl ring).\n*   Connecting the fragments: The C₆H₅- group is attached to the -CH₂- group. The -CH₂- group is attached to the -CH- group, which also holds the -CH₃ and the -NH₂ groups.\n*   This leads to the structure: **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**\n\n**Conclusion: IUPAC Name**\nThe structure is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, commonly known as amphetamine.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
