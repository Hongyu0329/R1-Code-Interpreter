    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, which results in a series of [1,2] shifts known as a backbone rearrangement. The goal is to determine the identity (H or CH3) of the substituents at five specific positions in the final product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Product:** The starting material is a saturated pentacyclic alcohol. The product is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a rearranged carbon skeleton. Specifically, the reaction transforms a friedelane-type skeleton into an olean-12-ene skeleton. Although the drawing of the starting material has some inconsistencies with a standard friedelane structure (notably at C4), the transformation to olean-12-ene via a cascade of [1,2] shifts points towards the classic friedelane-oleanane rearrangement. We will proceed by analyzing this standard mechanism.\n\n2.  **Mechanism: The Rearrangement Cascade**\n    The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C3 by the acid catalyst (HCl), followed by the loss of a water molecule to form a secondary carbocation at C3. This unstable carbocation triggers a cascade of sequential [1,2] shifts of methyl groups (CH3) and hydride ions (H) along the fused ring system. This continues until a more stable carbocation is formed, which can then be quenched by eliminating a proton to form a stable alkene.\n\n3.  **Tracing the Shifts:** The established sequence of shifts to convert the friedelane skeleton to the oleanane skeleton is as follows:\n    *   A methyl group from C4 migrates to C3. The carbocation moves to C4.\n    *   A hydride from C5 migrates to C4. The carbocation moves to C5.\n    *   A methyl group from C10 migrates to C5. The carbocation moves to C10.\n    *   A hydride from C9 migrates to C10. The carbocation moves to C9.\n    *   A methyl group from C8 migrates to C9. The carbocation moves to C8.\n    *   A methyl group from C14 migrates to C8. The carbocation moves to C14.\n    *   A hydride from C13 migrates to C14. The carbocation moves to C13.\n    *   Finally, a proton is eliminated from C12 to form the stable C12=C13 double bond seen in the product.\n\n### Determining the Substituents\n\nNow we can determine what substituent ends up at each labeled position in the product:\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** This position starts with methyl groups. One methyl group migrates away to C3, and a hydrogen atom migrates *to* C4 from C5. So, C4 ends up with one methyl group and one hydrogen. The label '1' points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (at C10):** The original methyl group at C10 migrates to C5. A hydrogen atom from C9 migrates *to* C10.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (at C8):** The original methyl group at C8 migrates to C9. A methyl group from C14 migrates *to* C8.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (at C14):** The original methyl group at C14 migrates to C8. A hydrogen atom from C13 migrates *to* C14.\n    *   **4 = H**\n\n*   **Position 5:** The label for position 5 is ambiguous. The drawing shows it pointing to a substituent on C13, which is chemically impossible as C13 becomes part of a double bond. The most reasonable interpretation is that it points to the substituent at C18, which is at the adjacent ring junction. The hydrogen at C18 is not involved in the rearrangement cascade. It starts as a hydrogen and remains a hydrogen.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions after the rearrangement.\n    This function encapsulates the reasoning explained above.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",  # The remaining methyl group at C4.\n        2: \"H\",    # A hydride from C9 migrates to C10.\n        3: \"CH3\",  # A methyl group from C14 migrates to C8.\n        4: \"H\",    # A hydride from C13 migrates to C14.\n        5: \"H\"     # The hydrogen at C18, which is unaffected by the rearrangement.\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    output = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        output.append(f\"{position} = {substituents[position]}\")\n    \n    print(\", \".join(output))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
