  1.  The acyl chloride reactant is determined to be (S).
  2.  The alcohol reactant is determined to be (S).
  3.  In the product, the stereocenter from the alcohol retains its configuration, remaining (S).
  4.  In the product, the stereocenter from the acyl chloride retains its geometry, but a change
      in substituent priorities causes the stereochemical descriptor to flip from (S) to (R).
