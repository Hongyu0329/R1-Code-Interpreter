The image displays a fungus exhibiting both budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and pseudohyphae. The yeast cells are the round/oval forms, and the pseudohyphae are the elongated, chain-like structures. This combination of morphological features is characteristic of the genus *Candida*. The staining method is likely Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains the fungal elements magenta.
