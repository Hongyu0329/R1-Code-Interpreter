    "The image displays a kidney glomerulus with several key histopathological features. The most prominent finding is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped structure composed of numerous cells that fills Bowman's space, compressing the glomerular tuft. This structure is a \"cellular crescent.\" The glomerular tuft itself appears hypercellular and shows signs of injury. The presence of a large cellular crescent is the hallmark of crescentic glomerulonephritis, which is the histological manifestation of a clinical syndrome known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
