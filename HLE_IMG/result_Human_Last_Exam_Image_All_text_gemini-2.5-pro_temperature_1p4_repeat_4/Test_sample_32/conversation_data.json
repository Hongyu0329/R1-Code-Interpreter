    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and key terms.**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily visible (at a glance) difference in the sporophyte between two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte is the spore-producing generation in mosses, typically consisting of a capsule (which contains the spores) and a seta (the stalk that holds the capsule).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the names of the species for clues.**\nThe name *Grimmia curviseta* itself provides a major clue. In Latin, \"curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name directly translates to \"Grimmia with a curved seta.\" This suggests the shape of the seta is a defining characteristic.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically short and **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect (upright) and is typically emergent, meaning it pokes out just above the surrounding perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the base of the sporophyte).\n\n**Step 4: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   **Seta:** As its name implies, the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is short but **strongly curved**, often in an S-shape (cygneous) or a simple arc (arcuate).\n*   **Capsule Position:** This pronounced curve in the seta causes the capsule to be bent over, appearing nodding, pendent, or even inverted. The capsule is often immersed or only slightly emergent, sometimes hidden among the leaves due to its orientation.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the main difference.**\nThe most striking and immediate difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **curvature of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n\n*   *Grimmia montana*: **Straight seta** holding an **erect capsule**.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta*: **Curved seta** holding a **nodding or inverted capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   This distinction is only possible when mature sporophytes with intact setae are present. The provided image shows old, empty capsules (urns) where the seta is not clearly visible, but the question is a general one about the species' characteristics.\n*   While other subtle differences in capsule shape or leaf characteristics exist, the seta curvature is the most prominent and easily observable feature for distinguishing these two species when they are in fruit.\n*   \"At a glance\" often implies observation with a hand lens in bryology. The difference in capsule orientation is readily apparent with this level of magnification.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a short but strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or inverted."
