The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a short but strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or inverted.
