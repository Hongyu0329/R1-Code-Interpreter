    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### **Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n2.  **What is Car VMT?** VMT is the total mileage traveled by vehicles. In this context, \"Car VMT\" refers to the miles traveled by all cars, regardless of the number of occupants.\n3.  **Identify Relevant Data:**\n    *   **Share of total trips:** This row tells us the distribution of all trips across different distance brackets (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles). These percentages are the same in both tables.\n    *   **Average trip distance:** This is the average mileage for a single trip within each distance bracket. These are also the same in both tables.\n    *   **Car Mode Shares:** We need to consider both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The VMT calculation requires summing the mode shares of these two categories for each distance bracket.\n4.  **Identify Irrelevant Data:**\n    *   The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" (2.8 and 3) is not needed for calculating VMT, which measures vehicle mileage, not person mileage (PMT). This is a potential distractor.\n    *   Mode shares for transit, walk, bike, and micromobility are not directly used in the car VMT calculation, but the changes in these shares are what cause the car mode shares to change.\n5.  **Methodology:**\n    *   To compare the two scenarios, we'll calculate a \"VMT Index\" for each. This index represents the average VMT per trip across all trips. Since the total number of trips is assumed to be the same in both scenarios, comparing these indices is equivalent to comparing the total VMT.\n    *   The VMT for each distance bracket is calculated as:\n        `(Share of total trips in bracket) × (Total car mode share in bracket) × (Average trip distance for bracket)`\n    *   The total VMT Index is the sum of the VMT calculated for all four distance brackets.\n    *   Finally, the percentage reduction is calculated using the formula:\n        `% Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] × 100`\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\n\nFirst, we calculate the VMT for each distance bracket in the Baseline scenario (Table 1).\n\n*   **Bracket 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (carpool) = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% (trips) × 53% (car trips) × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = **0.2544**\n*   **Bracket 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% (1 occupant) + 43% (carpool) = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% (trips) × 81% (car trips) × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = **0.7128**\n*   **Bracket 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% (1 occupant) + 45% (carpool) = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% (trips) × 85% (car trips) × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = **0.8925**\n*   **Bracket 10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% (1 occupant) + 47% (carpool) = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% (trips) × 89% (car trips) × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = **2.8480**\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077**\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\n\nNext, we repeat the calculation for the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n*   **Bracket 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% (1 occupant) + 2% (carpool) = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% (trips) × 3% (car trips) × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = **0.0144**\n*   **Bracket 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% (1 occupant) + 19% (carpool) = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% (trips) × 27% (car trips) × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = **0.2376**\n*   **Bracket 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% (1 occupant) + 27% (carpool) = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% (trips) × 41% (car trips) × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = **0.4305**\n*   **Bracket 10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% (1 occupant) + 33% (carpool) = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% (trips) × 49% (car trips) × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = **1.5680**\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505**\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nNow, we use the two VMT indices to find the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    *   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = **2.4572**\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) × 100\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100\n    *   Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.52195 × 100 ≈ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
