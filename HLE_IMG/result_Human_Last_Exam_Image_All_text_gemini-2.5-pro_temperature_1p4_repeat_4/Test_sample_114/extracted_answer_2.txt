The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the inherent and rigid asymmetry of the münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. This münchnone has electronically and sterically distinct substituents at its reactive centers: a methyl group at C2 and a hydrogen atom at C4. When this asymmetric dipole reacts with the asymmetric methyl propiolate, the combination of electronic effects (matching the nucleophilic C4 of the dipole with the electrophilic β-carbon of the alkyne) and steric effects (minimizing repulsion between the bulky groups) strongly favors one of the two possible transition states, leading to a single product.

Reactions 1 and 2 provide the crucial rationale for this conclusion by serving as a comparative control. The isotope-labeling experiment in Reaction 2 shows that the two methyl groups (at C2 and C4) of the N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine-derived münchnone become equivalent or scramble prior to reaction. This means the dipole in Reactions 1 and 2 is "effectively symmetric". Therefore, the regioselectivity in Reaction 1 arises solely from the asymmetric alkyne interacting with a symmetric dipole. By demonstrating that the dipole in the alanine case is effectively symmetric, these results highlight that the pronounced regioselectivity in Reaction 3 must stem from the key difference: the fixed and unambiguous asymmetry of the proline-derived münchnone.
