    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Features of the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is written for a large orchestra. We can identify parts for flutes (`2 gr. Fl.` - 2 große Flöten), oboe (`I. Hob.`), English horn (`engl. Horn`), bassoon (`I. Fag.`), and a large string section including first violins (`I. Viol.`), second violins (`II. Viol.`), violas (`Br.`), and cellos (`Celli`). This orchestration is typical of late Romantic and 20th-century operas.\n*   **Language:** The instrument names and musical directions are in German. Examples include `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten), `Hob.` (Oboe), `Br.` (Bratschen), `(die übrigen)` (the rest), and `mit Dämpfer` (with mute). This strongly suggests the opera is of German or Austrian origin.\n*   **Key Clue - Stage Direction:** A critical piece of information is the text `1 (Vorhang)` located above the first violin staff. \"Vorhang\" is the German word for \"curtain\". This indicates that the music starting at rehearsal mark 1 accompanies the rising of the stage curtain. The question confirms this is the opening of the second act.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** There is no key signature. The music is highly chromatic, filled with accidentals (sharps and flats) that do not conform to a traditional major or minor key. This points towards late Romanticism, Expressionism, or atonality. The chords and melodic lines create a sense of unease and tension.\n*   **Melody and Texture:** The melodic lines are fragmented rather than long and lyrical. There are multiple independent lines occurring simultaneously, creating a complex, layered texture. The use of a solo viola (`Solo Br.`) is also a specific coloristic choice.\n*   **Dynamics and Articulation:** The score features detailed dynamic markings, from `pp` (pianissimo) to `mf` (mezzo-forte), with frequent `dim.` (diminuendo) markings. Towards the end of the excerpt, there are `gliss.` (glissando) markings in the string parts. These stylistic elements are characteristic of early 20th-century composers.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   The combination of a German-language score, a large orchestra, a highly chromatic/atonal musical style, and the specific context of the curtain rising on Act II points towards a modernist opera from the early 20th century.\n*   Composers like Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, and Alban Berg are the primary candidates.\n*   This particular musical excerpt, with its distinctive unsettling atmosphere created by the English horn, solo viola, and muted strings, is the famous opening of Act II of Alban Berg's opera **Wozzeck**. A quick check against a published score of *Wozzeck* confirms that this is an exact match for the beginning of Act II, Scene 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of Alban Berg's groundbreaking Expressionist opera, *Wozzeck*.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
