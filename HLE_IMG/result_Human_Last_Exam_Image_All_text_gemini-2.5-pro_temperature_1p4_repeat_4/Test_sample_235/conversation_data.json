    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the complete text of the poem.**\nAn erasure poem is created by selecting specific words from a source text to form a new piece. In this visual poem, we must identify all the words intended to be part of the final work. The composition includes:\n*   The title from the original page: `THE FIRST STEP`\n*   The page number from the original page: `35`\n*   Cut-out words and phrases: `rules`, `and`, `lines,`, `an intricate spider's web`, `work`.\n\nReading these elements in a logical, top-to-bottom sequence, we can assemble the poem's full text. It appears the artist intended for all these highlighted elements to be read together.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the poem and count the syllables.**\nLet's assemble the text and carefully count the syllables for each part:\n*   `The first step`: The (1) + first (1) + step (1) = 3 syllables.\n*   `thirty-five` (for the number 35): thir (1) + ty (1) + five (1) = 3 syllables.\n*   `rules`: 1 syllable.\n*   `and`: 1 syllable.\n*   `lines,`: 1 syllable.\n*   `an intricate spider's web`: an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) = 7 syllables.\n*   `work`: 1 syllable.\n\nAdding them all together: 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the given answer choices based on the syllable count.**\nThe poem is a single phrase or sentence with a total of 17 syllables. Let's evaluate the options:\n*   **A. free verse:** This means no regular meter. While possible, we should first check for a specific form, as the syllable count is precise.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form has 10 syllables per line. Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This form has 12 syllables per line. Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic line (hendecasyllabic) has 11 syllables. This would only be correct if we ignored the title and page number, but their prominence suggests they are part of the poem. Therefore, this is likely incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form has roughly 6 syllables per line. Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This form, created by poet Allen Ginsberg, is specifically defined as a complete sentence of exactly 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the best fit.**\nThe total syllable count of the poem is exactly 17. This precisely matches the defining rule of the \"American Sentence\" form. While the assembled text, \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines an intricate spider's web work,\" is not a grammatically conventional sentence, erasure poetry often uses fragmented syntax to create a complete thought or image. Thematic coherence can function as a sentence in a poetic context. The fact that the syllable count is exactly 17 is a very strong indicator that this specific form was the artist's intention. The poem's content about \"rules\" and \"lines\" forming an \"intricate... web\" could even be a self-referential nod to the poem's own structure.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern the words follow is an American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
