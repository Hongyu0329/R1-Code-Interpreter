    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the corresponding chemical compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak and Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion Cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear in a cluster starting around m/z 258 and extending to m/z 266. The most intense peaks in this group are at m/z 258 (I=17.4%), 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), and 264 (I=12.9%). This distinctive pattern indicates the presence of chlorine atoms.\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms:** The relative intensities of the isotopic peaks (M+, M+2, M+4, etc.) are characteristic of the number of chlorine (or bromine) atoms.\n    *   The natural abundance of Cl isotopes is approximately ³⁵Cl : ³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1 (or 75.8% : 24.2%).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis of three chlorine atoms (Cl₃). The theoretical intensity ratio for M:M+2:M+4:M+6 is approximately 1:0.98:0.32:0.03.\n    *   Let's assume the peak at **m/z 260** is the molecular ion peak (M+), corresponding to the molecule with the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The observed intensity ratios relative to m/z 260 are:\n        *   I(262)/I(260) = 29.0 / 34.8 ≈ 0.83\n        *   I(264)/I(260) = 12.9 / 34.8 ≈ 0.37\n    *   These observed ratios (1 : 0.83 : 0.37) are a reasonable match for the theoretical pattern of three chlorine atoms (1 : 0.98 : 0.32), considering potential experimental variability. Other possibilities (like 2 or 4 chlorines, or presence of bromine) do not fit the pattern as well.\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Assuming M+ is at m/z 260 and the molecule contains three chlorine atoms, the mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is 260 - (3 × 35) = 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n    *   This remaining mass must be composed of carbon and hydrogen (CₓHᵧ).\n    *   Dividing by the mass of carbon (12): 155 / 12 = 12 with a remainder of 11.\n    *   This suggests a formula of **C₁₂H₁₁** for the remainder.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n4.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H + X)/2, where X is the number of halogens.\n    *   DoU = 12 + 1 - (11 + 3)/2 = 13 - 14/2 = 13 - 7 = 6.\n    *   A DoU of 6 suggests an aromatic structure, likely containing a benzene ring (DoU=4) and additional rings or double bonds (DoU=2).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Base Peak and Key Fragment Ions**\n\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum (I=100%). It is at m/z 225.\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•).\n    *   The formation of [M-Cl]⁺ as the most stable fragment is very common for compounds where the chlorine atom is in an activated position (allylic or benzylic), leading to a resonance-stabilized carbocation.\n    *   The isotopic pattern of the base peak confirms this. We see a peak at m/z 227 with an intensity of 66.7%. The ratio I(227)/I(225) = 66.7/100 = 0.667. This is a perfect match for a fragment containing two chlorine atoms (theoretical ratio is 2 × ³⁷Cl/³⁵Cl ≈ 2 × 0.325 = 0.65). This confirms the base peak is [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺.\n2.  **Fragment Ion at m/z 190:**\n    *   This peak corresponds to a mass loss of 70 u from the molecular ion (260 - 190 = 70), or 35 u from the base peak (225 - 190 = 35). This indicates the loss of a second chlorine atom, forming the fragment [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺.\n3.  **Fragment Ion at m/z 155:**\n    *   This peak corresponds to a mass loss of 105 u from the molecular ion (260 - 155 = 105), which is the mass of three chlorine atoms. This fragment is the hydrocarbon backbone, [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺.\n4.  **Fragment Ion at m/z 47:**\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z 47 (I=18.4%) with its own isotope peak at m/z 49 (I=6.24%). The intensity ratio is I(49)/I(47) = 6.24 / 18.4 ≈ 0.34.\n    *   This pattern is the classic signature of a fragment containing one chlorine atom, specifically the chloromethyl cation, **[CH₂Cl]⁺**. (Mass of CH₂³⁵Cl = 47, Mass of CH₂³⁷Cl = 49).\n    *   The presence of this fragment strongly suggests the molecule contains a -CH₂Cl group. However, given the other evidence, this may also be a product of a rearrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\nBased on the analysis, we are looking for a compound with the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ that has:\n*   A DoU of 6.\n*   A structure that readily loses a chlorine atom to form a very stable carbocation. This points to a chlorine atom in an allylic position.\n*   A hydrocarbon backbone of C₁₂H₁₄ (e.g., phenylcyclohexene) or a related bicyclic structure.\n\nLet's test the structure **1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4-dichlorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n*   **Formula:** C₆H₄Cl (chlorophenyl group) + C₆H₇Cl₂ (dichlorocyclohexenyl part). The phenyl group C₆H₄ has 4 H. The cyclohexene ring has H at C2, C3, C4, and two H each at C5, C6. Total H = 4 + 1(C2) + 1(C3) + 1(C4) + 2(C5) + 2(C6) = 11 H. The formula is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**. This matches perfectly.\n*   **DoU:** A benzene ring (DoU=4) and a double bond in the cyclohexene ring (DoU=1) and a second ring (DoU=1) gives a total DoU of 6. This matches.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   The chlorine atoms at C3 and C4 are allylic to the double bond at C1. Loss of one of these chlorines would generate a stable, resonance-delocalized allylic carbocation. This explains why the base peak is **[M-Cl]⁺ at m/z 225**.\n    *   Subsequent losses of the other chlorine atoms would explain the fragments at m/z 190 and m/z 155.\n    *   The [CH₂Cl]⁺ fragment would have to form via a more complex rearrangement of the cyclohexene ring, which is less direct but still possible.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with the most important features of the mass spectrum.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is **1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4-dichlorocyclohex-1-ene**. (Other isomers are possible, but this represents the correct structural class).\n\n<<<1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4-dichlorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
