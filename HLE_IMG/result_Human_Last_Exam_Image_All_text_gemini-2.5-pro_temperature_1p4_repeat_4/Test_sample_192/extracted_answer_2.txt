The prominent diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern are indexed according to the standard data for the monoclinic phase of CuO (Tenorite, JCPDS No. 00-045-0937). The following table lists the approximate 2θ positions of these peaks as read from the graph and their corresponding Miller indices (h k l).

| Approximate Peak Position 2θ (degree) | Miller Indices (h k l) |
