    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Knot\n1.  **Analyze the Knot Diagram:** The provided image shows a knot diagram. We first count the number of crossings in the diagram. A careful count reveals that there are 8 crossings.\n2.  **Check for Alternating Property:** We can trace a path along the knot. Starting from any point, as we move along the strand, we pass alternately over and under at each crossing. This means the diagram is an **alternating knot diagram**.\n3.  **Identify from Knot Tables:** The knot is an alternating knot with 8 crossings. By comparing this diagram with standard knot tables (using, for example, the Alexander-Briggs notation), this knot is identified as the **8₁₈ knot**. The given diagram is a standard, minimal crossing projection of 8₁₈.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant and its Properties\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot K. It is derived from a version of Khovanov homology (specifically, Lee's modification).\n2.  **Relation to Slice Genus:** One of the most important properties of the Rasmussen invariant is that it provides a lower bound on the slice genus (or 4-ball genus), `g₄(K)`, of a knot. The slice genus is the minimum genus of a smooth, oriented surface in the 4-dimensional ball that has the knot K as its boundary. The inequality is:\n    `|s(K)| ≤ 2g₄(K)`\n3.  **Property for Alternating Knots:** For the special case of alternating knots, a key theorem states that this inequality becomes an equality. Since 8₁₈ is an alternating knot, we have:\n    `s(8₁₈) = 2g₄(8₁₈)`\n    This provides a direct way to compute the Rasmussen invariant if we know the slice genus of the knot.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Slice Genus of the 8₁₈ Knot\nThe problem of finding the Rasmussen invariant is now reduced to finding the slice genus of 8₁₈.\n1.  **Lower Bound on Slice Genus:** We can establish a lower bound on `g₄(8₁₈)`. The Alexander polynomial of 8₁₈ is known to be `Δ(t) = -t² + 3t - 1`. According to the Fox-Milnor condition, if a knot is slice (i.e., `g₄(K) = 0`), its Alexander polynomial must have the form `f(t)f(t⁻¹)` for some integer Laurent polynomial `f(t)`. The polynomial `-t² + 3t - 1` cannot be factored in this way. Therefore, the knot 8₁₈ is not slice, which implies `g₄(8₁₈) ≥ 1`.\n2.  **Known Value of Slice Genus:** The slice genus is a well-known invariant for many knots. According to authoritative knot theory resources and databases (such as KnotInfo), the slice genus of the 8₁₈ knot is 1.\n    `g₄(8₁₈) = 1`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\nUsing the equality for alternating knots and the known value of the slice genus, we can now calculate the Rasmussen invariant of 8₁₈.\n`s(8₁₈) = 2 * g₄(8₁₈) = 2 * 1 = 2`\n\n### Careful Points and Summary\n*   **Knot Identification:** Correctly identifying the knot as 8₁₈ is the crucial first step.\n*   **Choosing the Right Method:** Direct computation of the Rasmussen invariant from its definition or from diagrammatic formulas (involving the Jones polynomial or checkerboard colorings) is possible but highly complex and prone to errors related to normalization conventions or intricate diagram analysis.\n*   **Leveraging Key Theorems:** The most efficient and reliable approach is to use the powerful theorem `s(K) = 2g₄(K)` which holds for alternating knots.\n*   **Using Known Results:** This method relies on the known value of the slice genus for the 8₁₈ knot from established literature, which is a standard practice in tackling such problems without computational tools.\n\nThe final answer is therefore 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
