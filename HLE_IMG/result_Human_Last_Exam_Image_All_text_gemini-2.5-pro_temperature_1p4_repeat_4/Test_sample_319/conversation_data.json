    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the question's text.**\nThe question describes an illusion with three key characteristics:\n1.  It is similar to the Necker Cube's \"bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. This suggests the phenomenon involves the brain creating a perception that is not explicitly present in the sensory data, and potentially has more than one interpretation (though one is often dominant).\n2.  It reveals a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This points to a fundamental way our brain processes sensory information automatically, without conscious effort.\n3.  The phenomenon is related to the \"elements\" shown in the image.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the image.**\nThe image consists of two plots, representing a sound over time.\n1.  **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This shows the frequency content of a sound over time. There is a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this band is completely broken. Exactly at the point of the break, there is a short, vertical blur that covers a wide range of frequencies. This vertical blur represents a burst of noise. After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes. So, the *physical* sound is: Tone -> Noise -> Tone. The tone does not exist during the noise burst.\n2.  **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, smooth sine wave (representing the pure tone). In the middle section, the waveform becomes complex and irregular (representing the noise). Then, it returns to a regular sine wave. This plot confirms the physical sequence of sounds shown in the spectrogram.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis of the text and image.**\nThe image shows the physical components of an auditory stimulus: a tone that is interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise. The question asks for the name of an *illusion* associated with these elements. This implies that the perception of this sound is different from its physical reality.\n\nThe specific illusion being referred to occurs when a listener is presented with this sequence. Instead of hearing the tone stop and then start again, the listener typically perceives the tone as *continuing uninterrupted* behind the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, assuming that the louder noise simply masked it.\n\nThis \"filling-in\" is a prime example of a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability,\" as our brains constantly use context to create a coherent and continuous experience from fragmented sensory input. This is crucial for understanding speech in noisy environments, for example.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nThis auditory \"filling-in\" illusion is known as the **phonemic restoration effect**. The name was coined by Richard M. Warren, who discovered it in 1970. In his original experiments, he replaced a speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence with a non-speech sound like a cough or a burst of static. Participants not only reported hearing the missing phoneme (and thus the complete word), but they often could not even identify which part of the sentence had been replaced by the noise.\n\nWhile the image uses a simple tone instead of a speech phoneme, the underlying mechanism and the resulting illusion are the same. The more general term for this is the \"auditory continuity illusion,\" but the \"phonemic restoration effect\" is the specific and most famous name associated with this phenomenon, and it perfectly encapsulates the idea of a common, unconscious perceptual ability revealed by an illusion.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect"
