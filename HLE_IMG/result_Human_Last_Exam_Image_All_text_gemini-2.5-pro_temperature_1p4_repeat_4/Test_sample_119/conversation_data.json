    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is given at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom is present.\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:** Using the Rule of 13 for a preliminary formula (CₓHᵧ): 135 / 13 = 10 with a remainder of 5, suggesting a base formula of C₁₀H₁₅. To incorporate one nitrogen atom (mass 14), we subtract CH₂ (mass 14): C₁₀H₁₅ - CH₂ → C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** There is a base peak (most intense) at m/z = 106 (loss of 29, possibly -CH₂CH₃) and other significant peaks at m/z = 120 (loss of 15, possibly -CH₃) and m/z = 91 (tropylium/benzyl ion). The peak at m/z 77 (phenyl ion) is also present. This fragmentation data will be considered later.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** Sharp peaks are visible just above 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions below 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are consistent with C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   **Absence of key peaks:** There is no strong, broad absorption around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (ruling out O-H) and no strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ (ruling out C=O). The absence of a clear N-H stretch is noted, but amine N-H peaks can be weak or broad.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, this implies some carbons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Chemical Shifts:**\n    *   Aromatic region: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm (4 signals).\n    *   Aliphatic region: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm (3 signals).\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   A positive signal indicates a CH or CH₃ group.\n    *   A signal present in the broadband ¹³C but absent in DEPT is a quaternary carbon (C).\n*   **Assignments:**\n    *   There is 1 quaternary C (absent in DEPT). This is likely the aromatic ipso-carbon (attached to the side chain), δ = 145.1 ppm.\n    *   There is 1 CH₂ group (negative). Its signal is one of the aliphatic carbons (49.6, 43.5, or 19.2 ppm).\n    *   There are 5 CH or CH₃ groups (positive). Since there are 4 aromatic signals and one is the quaternary ipso-C, the other 3 must be CH groups. This leaves 2 positive signals for the aliphatic part.\n*   **Conclusion on structure:** The molecule contains a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 ipso-C, 3 types of CH for ortho, meta, para, leading to 4 signals). The side chain contains 3 carbons: one CH₂ and two carbons that are either CH or CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm:** A complex multiplet integrating to 5H. This is a classic pattern for a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** We need to account for the remaining 8 protons of the C₃H₈N side chain. Looking closely at the integrations:\n        *   **δ ~2.8 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~2H.\n        *   **δ ~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~1H.\n        *   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet integrating to ~3H.\n    *   The total integration of these distinct aliphatic signals is 2H + 1H + 3H = 6H. We are missing 2H from the C₃H₈N side chain (total 8H). These missing 2H are likely from an -NH₂ group, as N-H protons often give broad signals that may not integrate well or are exchanged.\n*   **Fragment Assembly:**\n    *   A 3H doublet at ~1.2 ppm indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group. Fragment: **-CH-CH₃**.\n    *   This confirms the presence of a CH group and a CH₃ group in the side chain.\n    *   The 1H multiplet at ~2.7 ppm must correspond to this -CH proton.\n    *   The 2H multiplet at ~2.8 ppm must correspond to the CH₂ group.\n    *   The side chain fragments are therefore: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n*   **Proposed Structure:** The only way to assemble these fragments is C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the ¹H NMR data:\n        *   C₆H₅-: 5H multiplet. **✓**\n        *   -CH₃: Next to one H, so it's a doublet (3H). **✓** (at 1.2 ppm)\n        *   -CH(NH₂)-: Next to a CH₂ (2H) and a CH₃ (3H), so it's a complex multiplet (1H). **✓** (at 2.7 ppm)\n        *   C₆H₅-CH₂-: This benzylic CH₂ is adjacent to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic. They will have slightly different shifts and couple to each other and the adjacent CH, resulting in a complex multiplet (2H). **✓** (at 2.8 ppm)\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the HSQC Spectrum**\n*   This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n*   **Cross-peaks:**\n    *   The H signal at ~1.2 ppm (d, 3H) correlates with the C signal at ~19.2 ppm. This assigns the -CH₃ group.\n    *   The H signal at ~2.7 ppm (m, 1H) correlates with the C signal at ~49.6 ppm. This assigns the -CH(NH₂)- group.\n    *   The H signal at ~2.8 ppm (m, 2H) correlates with the C signal at ~43.5 ppm. This assigns the C₆H₅-CH₂- group.\n*   The HSQC data perfectly confirms the proposed structure and the assignments of all aliphatic H and C signals.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\n*   The combined spectroscopic data overwhelmingly supports the structure being **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n*   **Note on conflicting MS data:** While the base peak at m/z=106 strongly suggests the isomer N-ethyl-N-methylaniline (via loss of an ethyl group), the ¹H NMR spectrum for that compound (expecting a 3H singlet, a 2H quartet, and a 3H triplet) is completely inconsistent with the observed spectrum. In cases of conflicting data, the detailed and consistent 2D NMR evidence is considered more definitive than MS fragmentation, which can involve complex rearrangements.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a propane chain. Numbering should give the amine group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Chain: C₆H₅-C¹H₂-C²H(NH₂)-C³H₃\n    *   Substituents: Phenyl group at position 1, amino group at position 2.\n    *   Parent name: Propan-2-amine.\n    *   Full name: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
