    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to identify the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound with a 6π electron system.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (C₄H₆), a cyclic alkene with a 4-membered ring and one double bond (a 2π system). It also contains a four-electron system (2π + 2σ) that can participate in electrocyclic reactions.\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` over the reaction arrow. This means the reactions involved must be photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **The Question:** We are told that two distinct pericyclic reactions occur during this transformation. Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. They include cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the First Pericyclic Reaction**\nThere are two main possibilities for the initial photochemical step: an intramolecular reaction of one of the starting materials, or an intermolecular reaction between the two.\n*   **Possibility A: Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene.** Photochemical irradiation of benzene and its derivatives can lead to valence isomers like Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This intramolecular isomerization can be viewed as a [2+2] photocycloaddition.\n*   **Possibility B: Isomerization of Cyclobutene.** Cyclobutene is well-known to undergo a photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening reaction to form 1,3-butadiene. This is a classic pericyclic reaction. It involves the conversion of one σ bond and one π bond into two π bonds. Since this reaction is very efficient under photochemical conditions, it is a highly probable first step.\n\nLet's assume Path B is correct, as it is a very common and well-documented photochemical reaction for cyclobutene.\n*   **Reaction 1: Electrocyclic Reaction.**\n    Cyclobutene (a 4-electron system: 2π + 2σ) undergoes a photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4n-electron system (n=1 here) undergoes a disrotatory ring-opening under photochemical conditions.\n    Cyclobutene  `-(hν)→`  1,3-Butadiene\n    So, the first pericyclic reaction is an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n**Step 3: Propose the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\nIf the first step produces 1,3-butadiene, the second step must be the reaction between 1,3-butadiene and hexafluorobenzene under photochemical conditions.\n*   **Reactants for Step 2:** 1,3-butadiene (a 4π-electron system) and hexafluorobenzene (a 6π-electron system).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an intermolecular reaction between two π-systems, which is a cycloaddition. The question is what kind of cycloaddition occurs. Several modes of photocycloaddition to benzene are known ([2+2], [4+2], [4+4]).\n*   For the reaction between a diene (like 1,3-butadiene) and an excited arene (like hexafluorobenzene), a common pathway is a [4+4] cycloaddition. In this reaction, the 4π system of the diene adds across the 1,4-positions of the arene (which also acts as a 4π system).\n*   **Reaction 2: [4+4] Cycloaddition.**\n    This reaction involves 8π electrons (4π from butadiene + 4π from hexafluorobenzene). An 8-electron system is a 4n system (with n=2). According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π4s + π4s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    1,3-Butadiene + Hexafluorobenzene `-(hν)→` [4+4] Adduct\n    Therefore, the second pericyclic reaction is a **[4+4] cycloaddition**.\n\n**Careful Points & Conclusion**\n1.  The product structure drawn in the image is likely incorrect or highly schematic. It does not match the known products for either of the most plausible reaction pathways. For example, the depicted product has only one double bond and an unusual linear fusion, whereas the expected products from these pericyclic reactions are typically bridged polycyclic compounds with more than one double bond. Therefore, the analysis should rely on the general principles of pericyclic reactions for the given reactants rather than the problematic product drawing.\n2.  The sequence starting with the electrocyclic opening of cyclobutene is chemically very sound because this reaction is known to have a high quantum yield.\n3.  The subsequent reaction is a cycloaddition between the generated diene and the fluoroarene. While various cycloaddition modes are possible, the [4+4] cycloaddition is a documented pathway for such systems.\n4.  Another plausible pathway could be an initial [2+2] cycloaddition between cyclobutene and hexafluorobenzene, followed by an intramolecular electrocyclic reaction of the resulting adduct. This would involve a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**. However, the pathway involving the initial opening of cyclobutene is often favored kinetically and is well-supported by literature for similar reactions.\n\nBased on the most plausible reaction pathway consistent with established photochemical principles:\nThe two pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (ring-opening of cyclobutene).\n2.  A **[4+4] cycloaddition** (reaction of 1,3-butadiene with hexafluorobenzene).\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [4+4] cycloaddition>>>"
