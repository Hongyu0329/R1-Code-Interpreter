    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine the song's identity.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music Basics:**\n    *   **Clef and Key Signature:** The music is written in the treble clef. There is no key signature (no sharps or flats), which indicates the key of C major or its relative, A minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, indicating four beats per measure, with the quarter note getting the beat.\n    *   **Tempo:** A metronome marking at the top left, though blurry, appears to be around ♩= 128, which is a moderately fast, upbeat tempo.\n    *   **Instrumentation and Format:** This is a \"lead sheet.\" It provides the main melody line along with chord symbols written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7). This format is common in jazz, pop, and commercial music for improvisation and accompaniment by instruments like piano or guitar.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Harmonic Content (Chords):**\n    *   The piece begins in the key of C major. The chord progression in the first four bars is `C | E7 | F | F#dim G7`.\n    *   This is a very distinctive progression.\n        *   The **C** chord establishes the tonic.\n        *   The **E7** chord is a secondary dominant (V7 of A minor), but here it's used unconventionally to lead to the F chord, adding a bluesy, Vaudevillian color.\n        *   The **F# diminished 7th chord** acts as a chromatic passing chord leading smoothly to the G7. This is a very common device in older jazz styles, particularly swing and gypsy jazz.\n    *   Throughout the piece, we see other standard jazz progressions like Dm - G7 - C (a ii-V-I turnaround). The presence of these specific chords and their arrangement strongly points towards a jazz genre.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melodic and Rhythmic Content:**\n    *   **Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many off-beat eighth notes, triplets, and tied notes. This rhythmic complexity and swing feel are hallmarks of jazz.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody is jaunty and uses arpeggios that outline the underlying chords, as well as chromatic passing tones (like the G# in the second measure over the E7 chord). This style of melodic construction is typical of instrumental jazz solos and themes.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Song:**\n    *   The combination of the unique chord progression (`C | E7 | F | F#dim...`), the upbeat tempo, the swing rhythm, and the jaunty melody is highly characteristic of one particular song.\n    *   This is the main theme from the 2003 animated film *Les Triplettes de Belleville* (The Triplets of Belleville). The song is titled **\"Belleville Rendez-vous\"**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Musical Style and Origin:**\n    *   **Musical Style:** The music, composed by Benoît Charest, is a deliberate homage to the 1930s-40s French hot club style, specifically **Gypsy Jazz** (or *Jazz Manouche*), pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt. All the elements—the chord choices, the \"la pompe\" swing rhythm feel, and the melodic style—are characteristic of Gypsy Jazz.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The film *Les Triplettes de Belleville* is a French production (with co-producers from other countries, but its cultural identity is French). The song's lyrics are in French, and its musical style is rooted in a French jazz tradition. Therefore, the country of origin is **France**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   **Title:** \"Belleville Rendez-vous\" (from *Les Triplettes de Belleville*)\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (Jazz Manouche) / French Swing\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<**Title:** \"Belleville Rendez-vous\"\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or French Jazz/Swing)\n**Country of Origin:** France>>>"
