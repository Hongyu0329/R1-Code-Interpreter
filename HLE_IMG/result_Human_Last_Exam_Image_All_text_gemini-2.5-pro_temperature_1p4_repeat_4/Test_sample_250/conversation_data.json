    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db).\n*   **First Chord:** The piece begins with an F minor chord (F-). This, combined with the key signature, strongly indicates the key is F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, common for jazz standards.\n*   **Form:** The presence of a 1st and 2nd ending after the first 8 bars suggests a repeating 'A' section. The following musical material is harmonically and melodically different, indicating a 'B' section or bridge. The final section reprises the initial melodic and harmonic ideas. This structure is a classic 32-bar AABA form.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic Analysis**\nThe melody is the most identifiable feature of a tune. Let's transcribe the first few bars:\n*   **Bar 1:** Three C's (the fifth of the F minor tonic). The rhythm is a half note followed by two quarter notes.\n*   **Bar 2:** A G followed by an F.\n*   **Bar 3:** A whole note Eb.\n*   **Bar 4:** A sequence of Db, C, and B natural.\n\nWhen played or \"sung\", this melodic phrase is highly distinctive. The opening phrase (C-C-C | G-F | Eb...) is iconic within the jazz repertoire. This melody is immediately recognizable as the bebop standard \"Hot House\".\n\n**Step 3: Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression)**\nLet's analyze the chords provided to confirm the identification.\n*   **A Section (Bars 1-8):** | F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | C7 | F- ||\n    This progression features a descending chromatic root movement in the first four bars (F, E, Eb, Db), which is a common reharmonization technique used in the bebop era.\n*   **B Section (Bridge, Bars 9-16):** | D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |\n    This bridge consists of a series of ii-V progressions and cycling dominants. D-7b5 to G7 is a ii-V in C minor. C7 is the V of F. F7 is the V of Bb. Bb-7 to Eb7 is a ii-V in Ab major, which resolves to Ab. This type of harmonically dense bridge is characteristic of bebop compositions.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis and Identification**\n*   The melody is definitively that of **\"Hot House\"**.\n*   \"Hot House\" was composed by the great bebop pianist and composer **Tadd Dameron**.\n*   It is a well-known contrafact, meaning it is a new melody written over the chord changes of an existing song. The original song is Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\". The chord progression in the provided lead sheet is a reharmonization of the original changes, a common practice among jazz musicians, but the melody solidifies the tune's identity as \"Hot House\".\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the unmistakable melody and characteristic bebop harmony, the jazz standard is \"Hot House\" by Tadd Dameron.\n\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
