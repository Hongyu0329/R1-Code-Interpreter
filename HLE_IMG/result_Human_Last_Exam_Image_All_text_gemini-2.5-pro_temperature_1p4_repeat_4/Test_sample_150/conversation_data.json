    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃ → Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid, AlCl₃, activates the propanoyl chloride to generate an acylium ion electrophile (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A phenyl group attached to a propanoyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Directing Effects:** The reactant is propiophenone. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring towards further electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming electrophile to the *meta* position.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is substituted at the meta-position (position 3) relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A benzene ring substituted with a propanoyl group and a bromine atom at the meta position relative to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd → Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Careful Points:** The reagent H₂/Pd is a powerful reducing agent. It can perform multiple reductions on the substrate, 3-bromopropiophenone.\n    1.  **Reduction of the ketone:** A benzylic ketone can be completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-) via hydrogenolysis under these conditions. So, the -CO- group becomes a -CH₂- group.\n    2.  **Reduction of the aryl halide:** The carbon-bromine bond can also be cleaved by hydrogenolysis with H₂/Pd, replacing the bromine atom with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Both the ketone and the aryl bromide are reduced. The starting 3-bromopropiophenone is converted into propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A phenyl group attached to a propyl chain (Ph-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄ → Product**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Radical Bromination (specifically, a Wohl-Ziegler reaction).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a source of bromine radicals for selective bromination. Benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) is a radical initiator. CCl₄ is an inert solvent for radical reactions.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** This reaction is highly selective for the benzylic position. This is because the abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom leads to a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, which is the most stable radical intermediate that can be formed.\n*   **Product:** In propylbenzene (Ph-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the benzylic position is the carbon atom of the propyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. One of the hydrogens on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The final product is (1-bromopropyl)benzene (also known as 1-phenyl-1-bromopropane).\n*   **Structure of Final Product:** Ph-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃.\n\nFinal Summary:\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** (1-Bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<(1-Bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
