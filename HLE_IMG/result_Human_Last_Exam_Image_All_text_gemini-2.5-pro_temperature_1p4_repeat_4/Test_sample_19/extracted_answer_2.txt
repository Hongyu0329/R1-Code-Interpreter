2. The original key is C# minor. E major is the **relative major** of C# minor. This is a very common and standard modulation in tonal music, providing harmonic contrast while maintaining a close relationship since both keys share the same four-sharp key signature.
3. The Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is **III**. The chord is an E major triad, which is the major chord built on the third scale degree (mediant) of the home key, C# minor.
