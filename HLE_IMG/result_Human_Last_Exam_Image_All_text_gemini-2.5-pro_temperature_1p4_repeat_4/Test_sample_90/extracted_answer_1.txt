**Product A:**
A is a bicyclic dihydropyridinone. The proline nitrogen has added to methyl propiolate, and the resulting intermediate has cyclized with the original pyrroline moiety which has also been acetylated. Structure: Methyl 2-(1-acetyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-yl)-octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carboxylate derivative. (The precise structure matching the spectra is complex, a simplified representation is a Michael adduct which has undergone further reaction.)
The structure is methyl 1-(2-(N-(4-oxobutyl)acetamido)pyrrolidin-1-yl)acrylate.

**Product B:**
B is a complex tricyclic product from a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement. Structure: (3S,11aS)-3-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3,5,6,7,11a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11-dione. *(Correction: The IUPAC name is likely incorrect, the structure is a fused pyrrolo-diazepine-dione.)*

**Product C:**
C is formed from the starting material and acetic anhydride. The structure is (S)-2-acetyl-octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, formed by intramolecular cyclization of the amino acid with its own side chain, likely involving fragmentation/rearrangement, and subsequent acetylation.

Final representation of structures:

*   **A**: A Michael adduct of the starting material's proline nitrogen onto methyl propiolate, with the pyrroline ring opened to an N-acetyl-aminobutyl chain.
*   **B**: A complex tricyclic lactam formed via a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by rearrangement and loss of atoms.
*   **C**: A bicyclic dione formed by intramolecular cyclization of the starting material, where the C=N has become C=O and an acetyl group has been added.
