    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Overall Reaction**\nThe starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It reacts with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 Â°C. This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is eliminated along with a proton from an adjacent carbon to form a double bond and a molecule of water (H2O). The product's formula, C30H50, confirms the loss of H2O from the starting material (which has the formula C30H52O).\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism - Formation of the Initial Carbocation**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E1 mechanism.\n1.  The acid (H+) protonates the hydroxyl group, turning it into a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n2.  The -OH2+ group leaves as a water molecule, generating a secondary carbocation on the carbon atom where the alcohol was attached (this is C-3 in standard nomenclature).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade**\nSecondary carbocations are relatively unstable and will rearrange to form more stable tertiary carbocations if possible. The problem statement specifies that a number of [1,2] shifts occur. This is a well-known phenomenon in triterpenoid chemistry called a \"backbone rearrangement\". We need to follow the cascade of shifts step-by-step. The migrations will involve methyl groups (CH3) and hydride ions (H-). For each step, we identify which group migrates and track what is left behind and what arrives at the new location.\n\n*   **Initial Carbocation:** A positive charge (+) is at C-3.\n\n*   **Shift 1: [1,2]-Methyl Shift**\n    *   The secondary carbocation at C-3 is adjacent to a quaternary carbon (C-4, which becomes position 1) that has two methyl groups. One of these methyl groups shifts to C-3.\n    *   This moves the positive charge to C-4, creating a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n    *   **Result at Position 1 (originally C-4):** It started with two CH3 groups and lost one. It now has one **CH3** group.\n\n*   **Shift 2: [1,2]-Hydride Shift**\n    *   The carbocation at C-4 is adjacent to C-5 (which becomes position 3), which bears a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen atom (as a hydride, H-) shifts to C-4.\n    *   This moves the positive charge to C-5, which is also a tertiary position.\n    *   **Result at Position 3 (originally C-5):** It started with an H atom, which migrated away. It is now vacant and awaits an incoming group.\n\n*   **Shift 3: [1,2]-Methyl Shift**\n    *   The carbocation at C-5 is adjacent to the quaternary carbon C-10 (which becomes position 2). The methyl group on C-10 shifts to C-5.\n    *   This moves the positive charge to C-10.\n    *   **Result at Position 3 (originally C-5):** It receives the migrating methyl group. The substituent is now **CH3**.\n    *   **Result at Position 2 (originally C-10):** It started with a CH3 group, which migrated away. It is now vacant.\n\n*   **Shift 4: [1,2]-Hydride Shift**\n    *   The carbocation at C-10 is adjacent to C-9 (which becomes position 5). The hydrogen atom on C-9 shifts to C-10.\n    *   This moves the positive charge to C-9.\n    *   **Result at Position 2 (originally C-10):** It receives the migrating hydrogen atom. The substituent is now **H**.\n    *   **Result at Position 5 (originally C-9):** It started with an H atom, which migrated away. It is now vacant.\n\n*   **Shift 5: [1,2]-Methyl Shift**\n    *   The carbocation at C-9 is adjacent to C-8 (which becomes position 4). The methyl group on C-8 shifts to C-9.\n    *   This moves the positive charge to C-8.\n    *   **Result at Position 5 (originally C-9):** It receives the migrating methyl group. The substituent is now **CH3**.\n    *   **Result at Position 4 (originally C-8):** It started with a CH3 group, which migrated away. It is now vacant.\n\n*   **Subsequent Shifts and Elimination**\n    The cascade continues with a hydride shift from C-14 to C-8 (making the substituent at **Position 4 = H**), followed by a methyl shift from C-13 to C-14. This places the final positive charge at C-13. From this final carbocation, a proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-12, forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond shown in the product.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the Results**\nBy tracking the fate of each position through the rearrangement cascade, we can determine the final substituent.\n\n*   **Position 1:** Started with two CH3 groups, one migrated away. **Final substituent = CH3**.\n*   **Position 2:** Started with one CH3 group (migrated away), and one H atom migrated in. **Final substituent = H**.\n*   **Position 3:** Started with one H atom (migrated away), and one CH3 group migrated in. **Final substituent = CH3**.\n*   **Position 4:** Started with one CH3 group (migrated away), and one H atom migrated in. **Final substituent = H**.\n*   **Position 5:** Started with one H atom (migrated away), and one CH3 group migrated in. **Final substituent = CH3**.\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = H\n5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
