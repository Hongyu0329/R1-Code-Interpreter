    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall chart structure.**\nThe image displays a Google Trends graph showing search interest over time for three different topics, represented by yellow, red, and blue lines. The time scale runs from late 2019 to mid-2023. The key feature of the graph is the presence of recurring, sharp spikes in search interest for each topic, which indicates that these are annually recurring events, such as holidays or anniversaries. The prompt specifies these are three historic events from a single country.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the yellow line.**\nThe yellow line exhibits the highest peaks on the chart. These peaks occur at the same time each year: early July.\n*   There is a peak in early July 2020.\n*   There is a peak in early July 2021.\n*   There is a peak in early July 2022.\n*   There is a very high peak in early July 2023.\nThis distinct and strong annual pattern in early July points directly to the United States' **Independence Day**, which is celebrated on July 4th. This is a very strong indicator for the country.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the red line.**\nThe red line shows significant, though generally lower than yellow, annual peaks. These peaks occur consistently in late May or very early June.\n*   There is a peak in late May 2020.\n*   There is a peak in late May 2021.\n*   There is a peak in late May 2022.\n*   There is a peak in late May 2023.\nThis pattern aligns perfectly with **Memorial Day** in the United States, a federal holiday that occurs on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who died in service. This finding reinforces the hypothesis that the country is the United States.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the blue line.**\nThe blue line shows the lowest search interest of the three but still has clear annual spikes. The most consistent and noticeable of these spikes occurs in mid-November each year.\n*   There is a peak in November 2020.\n*   There is a peak in November 2021.\n*   There is a peak in November 2022.\nThis timing corresponds with **Veterans Day** in the United States, a federal holiday observed annually on November 11th to honor all military veterans. (Note: The blue line also has smaller recurring spikes, such as in January, which likely corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but the November spike for Veterans Day is a clear historical commemoration that fits the pattern).\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the evidence and conclude.**\nAll three data series correspond to major historical commemorations that are federal holidays in the United States:\n*   **Yellow Line:** Independence Day (July 4th)\n*   **Red Line:** Memorial Day (Late May)\n*   **Blue Line:** Veterans Day (November 11th)\n\nThe unique combination of these three specific, annually celebrated historical events, with their characteristic timings, points conclusively to one country.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
