    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Image Analysis:** The image displays a circular metal medallion with a flat tab at the top. The medallion is decorated in a relief style, likely repoussé, which involves hammering the metal from the reverse side to create a design in low relief. The design features two busts facing each other. The figure on the left is shown in profile with prominent curly hair or a headdress featuring what looks like a large ram's horn. The figure on the right is also in profile, facing left. The style of the figures, particularly the hair and facial features, suggests ancient craftsmanship.\n\n2.  **Artifact Identification:** This is a famous archaeological artifact. It is a gold plaque or medallion found in the Great Bliznitsa (Bolshaya Bliznitsa) kurgan, a Scythian royal burial mound located on the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia. The region was a hub of interaction between the nomadic Scythians and the Greek colonies of the Bosporan Kingdom.\n\n3.  **Stylistic and Contextual Dating:** The artwork displays a mixture of Scythian subject matter and Hellenistic Greek artistic style. This blend is characteristic of the art produced for the wealthy Scythian elite in the 4th century B.C. Greek craftsmen were often commissioned to create luxurious items that incorporated Scythian cultural and religious motifs. The high quality of the workmanship is consistent with the best Greek metalwork of the period.\n\n4.  **Archaeological Dating:** The archaeological context of the Great Bliznitsa kurgan provides a firm date for the objects found within it. Excavations and subsequent studies have confidently dated the main burial, where this plaque was discovered, to the second half of the 4th century B.C. (approximately 350–300 B.C.).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the find-spot, the artistic style, and the archaeological context, the medallion is unanimously ascribed by archaeologists to the 4th century B.C.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{4th century B.C.}}$."
