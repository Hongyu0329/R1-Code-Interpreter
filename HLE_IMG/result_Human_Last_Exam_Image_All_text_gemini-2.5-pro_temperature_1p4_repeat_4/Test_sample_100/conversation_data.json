    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. Its core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This indicates a norbornane-like skeleton where a CH2 group at position 2 has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, there's a carbonyl group at position 3 (making it a lactam), and a double bond between positions 5 and 6.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is attached to C5.\n    *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom (N2). The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** Let's count the atoms.\n    *   The basic 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton with a CF3 at C5 and NH at N2 would be C7H5F3NO. Let's verify:\n        *   C1(CH), C4(CH), C6(CH), C7(CH2), C5(C-CF3), C3(C=O), N2(NH).\n        *   Carbons: 7 (including the one in CF3).\n        *   Hydrogens: 1(C1)+1(C4)+1(C6)+2(C7)+1(N2) = 6 hydrogens. Hmm, let me recount. Ah, C7H6F3NO is the formula for Intermediate 1. My initial count was correct. Let's restart from the full starting material.\n        *   Core without substituents on C5 and N2: C6H7NO.\n        *   Adding C=C at C5-C6 removes 2H -> C6H5NO.\n        *   Adding CF3 at C5 removes 1H -> C6H4F3NO (for the core ring system atoms plus N and O). Total C is 6 (ring)+1(CF3)=7. Total formula C7H4F3NO.\n        *   Let's count directly: C1(CH), C4(CH), C6(CH), C5(C-CF3), C7(CH2), C3(C=O), N2. Carbons = 7. Hydrogens = 1+1+1+2=5. Formula part: C7H5F3NO.\n        *   PMB group: -CH2-(p-C6H4)-OCH3. C: 1+6+1=8. H: 2+4+3=9. O: 1. Formula: C8H9O.\n        *   Attaching PMB to N replaces H with PMB. Starting with C7H5F3NO (hypothetical NH form) -> remove H, add C8H9O -> C(7+8)H(5-1+9)F3N(1)O(1+1) = C15H13F3NO2.\n        *   Let's try summing all parts: bicyclic ring C7H5. N with PMB N-C8H9O. Carbonyl O. CF3 group. Total: C(7+8)H(5+9)F3NO(1+1) = C15H14F3NO2. This looks correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction (Formation of Intermediate 1)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. The N-PMB bond is broken, and the nitrogen becomes an NH group. The PMB group is converted to p-anisaldehyde (C8H8O2), but what's important is the change in the main molecule.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. So the net change is -C8H8O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction (Formation of Intermediate 2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 (catalytic hydrogenation) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) to a single bond (C5-C6). Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** + H2.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C7H6F3NO + H2 = C7H8F3NO.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction (Formation of the final Product)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are harsh acidic hydrolysis conditions. The lactam (a cyclic amide) in Intermediate 2 will be hydrolyzed. The amide bond (N2-C3) breaks, consuming one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the ring to form an amino acid. The nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH2), and the carbonyl carbon (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Structure of the Product:** The bicyclic ring opens to form a substituted cyclopentane ring. The final product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water (+ H2O).\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C7H8F3NO + H2O = C7H10F3NO2.\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet's count the atoms in the final product, 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 5 in the cyclopentane ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CF3 group = 7.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 7 on the cyclopentane ring (1 at C1, 1 at C2, 2 at C3, 1 at C4, 2 at C5) + 1 in the -COOH group + 2 in the -NH2 group = 10.\n*   **Fluorines (F):** 3 in the -CF3 group.\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 in the -NH2 group.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the -COOH group.\nThe resulting molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2. This confirms the calculation from the reaction steps.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
