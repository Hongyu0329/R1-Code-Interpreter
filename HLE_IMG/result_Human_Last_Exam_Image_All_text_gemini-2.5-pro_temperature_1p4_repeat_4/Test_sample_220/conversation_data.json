    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction**\nWhen we view a crystal lattice along a specific crystallographic direction, we are essentially projecting the 3D positions of all atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to that direction. The [110] direction in a cubic system is the direction of a face diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Theoretical Pattern for FCC [110]**\nWhen an FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern has specific, well-known characteristics:\n*   **Pattern Type:** The atoms form a **centered rectangular** lattice. This means the pattern can be described as a grid of rectangles with an atom at each corner and an additional atom in the center of each rectangle.\n*   **Atomic Layers:** The atoms in the FCC structure are arranged in stacked planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These planes stack in an A-B-A-B sequence. When projected, these two distinct layers (A and B) superimpose. The atoms from one layer (e.g., A) form the corners of the rectangles, while the atoms from the other layer (B) are projected onto the centers of these rectangles. In a 2D diagram, this is often represented by using two different symbols or sizes for the atoms, indicating their different depths.\n*   **Rectangle Dimensions:** The primitive rectangle of this projected pattern has side lengths in the ratio of `a : a/√2`, which simplifies to `√2 : 1` (approximately 1.414 : 1).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Image**\nLet's examine the four options based on the characteristics identified in Step 3. We are looking for a centered rectangular pattern, ideally with two types of atoms representing the A/B layers.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but no atoms at their centers. This does not match the centered rectangular pattern of an FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image displays a pattern of atoms of two different sizes. Let's check the arrangement. We can identify rectangles formed by atoms. For instance, consider the atoms at the approximate coordinates (1,3), (7,3), (1,6), and (7,6). These four atoms form a rectangle. Crucially, there is another atom located at the center of this rectangle, at approximately (4, 4.5). This centered rectangular pattern repeats throughout the image. The two different atom sizes effectively represent the two different atomic planes (A and B) stacked along the [110] direction. This pattern matches the theoretical description of an FCC [110] projection. (Note: The aspect ratio of the rectangles in this schematic drawing may not be perfectly √2:1, but the topology of the pattern is the key feature).\n\n*   **Image C:** This image shows a clear hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This is the characteristic pattern of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the body diagonal), which is perpendicular to the close-packed planes. This is not the [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image shows two intertwined rectangular grids that are offset from each other. It is not a centered rectangular pattern because the atoms of the second grid are not at the centers of the rectangles formed by the first grid. This pattern does not correspond to an FCC [110] projection.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, only Image B shows the characteristic centered rectangular pattern that results from viewing an FCC crystal structure along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
