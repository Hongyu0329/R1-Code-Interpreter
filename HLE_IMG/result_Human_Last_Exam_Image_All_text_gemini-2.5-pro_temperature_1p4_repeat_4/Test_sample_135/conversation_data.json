    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork detail.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image content and style:**\n    *   The image shows a bas-relief sculpture within a circular frame (a tondo).\n    *   The scene is religious. A figure in priestly vestments is administering a sacrament, which appears to be Holy Communion (the Eucharist), to a group of kneeling figures, including a child.\n    *   The artistic style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, noted for its classical harmony, graceful figures, and naturalistic depiction. The technique of low relief, known as *rilievo schiacciato* or *stiacciato*, is evident in the subtle rendering of depth.\n\n2.  **Examine the inscription:**\n    *   At the bottom of the circular scene, there is a scroll with an inscription.\n    *   Looking closely at the detail crops, the inscription reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\".\n    *   This is an archaic form of French or Italian, translating to \"Sacrament of the Altar\", which confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Identify potential artists and schools:**\n    *   The combination of marble or glazed terracotta, the tondo format, and the specific High Renaissance style points strongly to the Florentine school of the 15th century.\n    *   In particular, this style is the hallmark of the Della Robbia family workshop, which was famous for its glazed terracotta and marble sculptures. The serene, idealized beauty of the figures is very typical of the workshop's founder.\n\n4.  **Connect the details to a specific artwork and artist:**\n    *   Searching for artworks with the theme \"Sacrament of the Altar\" by artists from this period, especially those associated with the Della Robbia workshop, leads to a specific, well-known piece.\n    *   This relief is a detail from the predella (the base) of the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (in Italian, *Tabernacolo del Sacramento*).\n    *   This masterpiece, made of marble, bronze, and glazed terracotta, was created between 1441 and 1443.\n    *   Art historical sources universally attribute this Tabernacle to the renowned Florentine sculptor **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400 – 1482). It was originally commissioned for a chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and is now located in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, Florence.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Inscription:** Deciphering the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a key clue to identifying the subject matter accurately.\n*   **Artistic Style:** Recognizing the specific stylistic traits—graceful figures, balanced composition, low relief—is crucial for placing the work in the context of the Italian Renaissance and associating it with the Della Robbia school.\n*   **Medium:** While not definitive from the black and white photo, the high-gloss finish suggests glazed terracotta, a medium perfected and famously used by Luca della Robbia, though this specific piece is primarily marble.\n*   **Context:** Understanding that this is a *detail* of a larger work (an altarpiece or tabernacle) helps in searching for the complete object and its attribution. The circular format (tondo) within a larger structure is a common feature in Renaissance art.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the iconographic, stylistic, and historical evidence, the author of this relief is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
