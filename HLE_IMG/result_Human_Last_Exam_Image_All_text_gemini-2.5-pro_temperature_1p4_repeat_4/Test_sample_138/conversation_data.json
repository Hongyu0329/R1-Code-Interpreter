    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) compared to females (typically 12). In some species, like certain wasps, male antennae are curled at the tips.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** Males typically have more visible abdominal segments (7) than females (6). The shape of the abdominal tip is often a key differentiator. Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is absent in males.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), which are absent or reduced in females.\n*   **Pollen-Carrying Structures (Scopae):** The question states the collected taxa are *without scopae on their legs*. This is a crucial clue. It points towards groups like wasps (which don't collect pollen for larvae), cleptoparasitic bees (like cuckoo bees, which steal provisions), or bees that carry pollen on their abdomen (e.g., family Megachilidae, like leafcutter and mason bees) or internally.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair A**\n\n*   **Identification:** These bees have a distinctively pointed abdomen, characteristic of *Coelioxys*, or Sharp-tailed Cuckoo Bees. As cuckoo bees, females are cleptoparasites and do not collect pollen, thus lacking scopae.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen tapers to a single, sharp, conical point. This is the modified ovipositor of a **female** *Coelioxys*, used to pierce the nest cell of a host bee to lay her egg.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen is blunter and ends in multiple spines or projections, which is characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair B**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. They are social predators that also feed on nectar. They do not have scopae for collecting pollen.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of **male** paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This wasp also exhibits the same distinctly curled antennae tips.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Both insects are Males (M, M). This corresponds to option **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair C**\n\n*   **Identification:** These bees are robust and hairy. The clue \"without scopae on their legs\" suggests they might belong to the family Megachilidae, which have a pollen-collecting scopa on the underside of their abdomen, not their legs. The insect on the left has characteristics of a male Wool Carder Bee (*Anthidium*), which is in this family.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee displays several male characteristics. It has relatively long antennae and a prominent pale/yellow marking on its face. Most critically, its front legs (tarsi) are pale and distinctly modified or expanded, resembling \"mittens.\" This is a feature of male *Anthidium* bees, used in territorial disputes. This is a **male**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has shorter antennae than the male. Its body is robust, which is typical for a female. Given the identification as *Anthidium* (a Megachilid bee), this **female** would carry pollen on a scopa on her abdomen (not visible in the photo), fitting the prompt's description.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Synthesis**\n\n*   **Pair A:** (F, M) -> Index **4**\n*   **Pair B:** (M, M) -> Index **1**\n*   **Pair C:** (M, F) -> Index **3**\n\nThe final answer, formatted as indices for A, B, and C separated by commas, is \"4, 1, 3\".\n\n<<<4, 1, 3>>>"
