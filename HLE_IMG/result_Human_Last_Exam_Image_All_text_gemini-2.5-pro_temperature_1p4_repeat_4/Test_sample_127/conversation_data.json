    "*   **Step 1: Identify the components of the molecule.**\n    The image shows a large coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. This central metal is coordinated by several organic ligands. The ligands themselves are complex, composed of multiple aromatic rings. The question asks about the free rotation of specific phenyl rings, which are labeled with letters G, H, J, K, and L. Phenyl rings are C6H5 groups. Rings B, D, E, and F are pyridyl rings because they contain a nitrogen atom within the six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the concept of \"free rotation\".**\n    Free rotation refers to the ability of a group (in this case, a phenyl ring) to rotate around the single bond that connects it to the rest of the molecule. This rotation is \"free\" if the energy barrier to rotation is low. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance, where bulky groups near the rotating bond collide with each other, preventing or slowing down the rotation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the local environment of each phenyl ring to assess steric hindrance.**\n    We need to examine the position of each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) relative to the bulky parts of the molecule, especially the Iridium center and its directly attached atoms.\n\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to carbon-6 of ring A. The diagram shows that this C6 position of ring A has a direct interaction (indicated by the dotted line) with the central Iridium atom.\n        *   Ring L is attached to carbon-6 of ring C. The diagram shows that this C6 position of ring C is directly bonded (indicated by the solid wedge bond) to the central Iridium atom.\n        *   In both cases, the phenyl rings K and L are attached to a carbon atom that is part of the coordination sphere of the very bulky Iridium atom. Any rotation of rings K or L around their connecting bonds would cause their ortho-hydrogen atoms (at positions 2 and 6 of rings K and L) to clash severely with the other ligands also bound to the Iridium. This creates a very high steric barrier, so rings **K and L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring H and Ring J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to carbon-4 of ring A. Ring A is part of a ligand that binds to Iridium via N(B) and C6(A). The attachment point of ring H (C4) is relatively far from the coordination sites (N and C6). It is on the \"back\" of the ligand, pointing away from the metal center. The groups adjacent to the C4-phenyl bond are hydrogens on C3 and C5 of ring A. There is no significant steric hindrance to prevent rotation. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n        *   Ring J is attached to carbon-4 of ring C. This situation is analogous to ring H. Ring C is part of a ligand that binds to Iridium via N(D) and C6(C). The attachment point of ring J (C4) is far from the bulky metal center. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to carbon-4 of the pyridyl ring D. Ring D is coordinated to the Iridium atom through its nitrogen atom (N). The C4 position is on the opposite side of the ring from the coordinating nitrogen. This means ring G is positioned away from the crowded metal center. The adjacent groups on ring D are hydrogens at C3 and C5. There is no significant steric hindrance to prevent rotation. Therefore, **ring G can rotate freely**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consolidate the findings and select the correct answer.**\n    Based on the analysis, the rings that can rotate freely are G, H, and J. The rings whose rotation is restricted by steric hindrance are K and L.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A. G, J, L, K, H (Incorrect)\n    B. G, J, L, H (Incorrect)\n    C. G, J, K, H (Incorrect)\n    D. L, K, J, H (Incorrect)\n    E. G, J, H (Correct)\n    F. L, J, H (Incorrect)\n    G. K, J, H (Incorrect)\n    H. J, H (Incorrect)\n    I. J, G (Incorrect)\n    J. G, H (Incorrect)\n    K. G (Incorrect)\n    L. J (Incorrect)\n    M. H (Incorrect)\n    N. none (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct combination is G, J, and H.\n\n<<<E>>>"
