The result should be interpreted as indeterminate or inconclusive. While the curve technically crosses the threshold with a Ct value of 30.8 (which is below the cut-off of 40), the amplification curve is not sigmoidal. The slow, linear rise in fluorescence suggests non-specific amplification or background noise rather than a true positive result. This result is unreliable and would require re-testing for confirmation.
