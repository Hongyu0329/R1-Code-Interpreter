    "This is a piece of sheet music for solo piano. Let's analyze it to identify the song.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Genre:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music. The style, characterized by its dramatic dynamic shifts (from *piano* to *forte*), complex chordal textures, and rapid running notes (sixteenth notes), suggests it could be from a film, TV show, anime, or video game soundtrack, or possibly a piece from the late Romantic or contemporary classical period.\n\n2.  **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature has two sharps (F# and C#), indicating the key of D major or B minor. The first chord in the left hand is a D major chord, strongly suggesting the piece is in D major. The time signature is 4/4 (common time). The tempo is marked at ♩ = 80, which is a moderate \"Andante\" tempo.\n\n3.  **Melody and Harmony (Opening):**\n    *   The piece begins quietly (*p*) with a simple melody in the right hand. The first few notes are A-G-F#-E | D-C#-B. This is a descending scale pattern in D major.\n    *   The left hand provides a simple chordal accompaniment.\n\n4.  **Development and Texture:**\n    *   At measure 3, there is a sudden change in dynamics to *forte* (*f*), and the texture becomes much denser and more rhythmic.\n    *   From measure 4 onwards, a distinctive pattern emerges: the left hand plays continuous broken chords (arpeggios) in sixteenth notes, while the right hand plays powerful block chords. This creates a very driving and epic feel.\n    *   This combination of a simple, memorable opening melody that erupts into a rhythmically intense, chord-heavy section is very characteristic of the composer Hiroyuki Sawano, particularly his work for the anime series *Attack on Titan* (Shingeki no Kyojin).\n\n5.  **Identification:**\n    *   The opening melodic line (A-G-F#-E...) is the main theme of the song \"Bauklötze\" from the *Attack on Titan* original soundtrack. \"Bauklötze\" is German for \"Building Blocks.\"\n    *   Comparing the sheet music to arrangements of \"Bauklötze\" confirms the match. The structure, chord progressions, and the iconic piano pattern are all present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music is from the song \"Bauklötze\", composed by Hiroyuki Sawano for the soundtrack of the anime *Attack on Titan*.\n\n<<<Bauklötze - Attack on Titan>>>"
