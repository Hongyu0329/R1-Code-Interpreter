    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the provided image.**\nThe first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows a man with a beard, smiling, as he shakes hands with an older man and receives a trophy. This appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   **Identify the Person and Event:** A search for major award ceremonies on June 20, 2019, points to the NHL Awards. The man receiving the award is identifiable as Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   **Identify the Accomplishment:** On that specific night, Nikita Kucherov won three of the NHL's most prestigious individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   **Connect to \"X Y\":** In sports, particularly hockey, achieving three significant feats in one game or event is famously known as a \"hat trick\". Media widely referred to Kucherov's triple win as a \"hat trick\" of awards. Therefore, the image depicts the celebration of a \"hat trick\". This suggests that \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Connect to the Hypothesis:** If \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\", we need to connect this phrase to mercury toxicity. The key component is the word \"Hat\".\n*   **Historical Context:** Historically, the process of making felt for hats involved using a mercury compound, specifically mercuric nitrate. This process, called \"carroting,\" was hazardous to the health of the hat makers (hatters).\n*   **Toxicity and Disuse:** Prolonged exposure to mercury vapors caused severe neurological damage, a condition that gave rise to the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\" Due to its high toxicity, the use of mercury in hat-making was eventually banned and has now ceased.\n*   **Synthesize the Clue:** The second clue is a clever play on words. It refers to the making of a physical \"hat,\" the activity from which the first word of \"hat trick\" derives its name. This historical practice has indeed been discontinued because of the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the identity of \"X Y\".**\nBoth clues logically point to the same two-word phrase.\n*   The first clue describes an event where a \"hat trick\" of awards was achieved and celebrated.\n*   The second clue alludes to the historical process of \"hat\" making, which has been abandoned due to mercury poisoning.\n\nTherefore, \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
