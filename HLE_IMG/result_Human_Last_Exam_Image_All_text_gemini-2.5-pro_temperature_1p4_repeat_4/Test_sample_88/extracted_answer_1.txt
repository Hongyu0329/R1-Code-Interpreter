Product A: A dihydropyrrolizine derivative where the bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with a (3-acetyl-1-pyrrolin-2-yl) group, and the newly formed five-membered ring contains a methyl ester group and a double bond.
Product B: An aromatic pyrrolizine derivative formed through cycloaddition, followed by oxidation (addition of one oxygen) and dehydrogenation (loss of four hydrogens).
Product C: 1-(3-acetyl-1-pyrrolin-2-yl)proline, the C-acylation product of the starting material.
