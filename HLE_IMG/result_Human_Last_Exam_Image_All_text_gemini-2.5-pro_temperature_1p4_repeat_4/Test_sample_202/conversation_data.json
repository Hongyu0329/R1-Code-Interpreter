    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Careful Points:** Observe the color, texture, and overall structure. The rock is reddish-brown and is full of small holes, which are known as vesicles. This vesicular texture gives it a porous or spongy appearance.\n    *   **Analysis:** The presence of vesicles indicates that this is an extrusive igneous rock, formed from lava that cooled quickly at the Earth's surface, trapping gas bubbles. The reddish color is common in iron-rich volcanic rocks. This combination of features is characteristic of scoria.\n    *   **Identification:** **Scoria**\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Careful Points:** Observe that this rock is composed of many smaller, sharp-edged pieces of other rocks. These fragments (clasts) are of various types and sizes and are cemented together in a finer-grained material (matrix). The clasts are distinctly angular, not rounded.\n    *   **Analysis:** A rock made up of angular fragments cemented together is called a breccia. This can form from landslides, fault zones, or explosive volcanic eruptions (volcanic breccia). The key identifying feature is the angularity of the clasts.\n    *   **Identification:** **Breccia**\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Careful Points:** Observe the color and texture. This rock is very light in color (off-white/light gray) and, like specimen H, is full of vesicles. Its texture appears even more porous and frothy than H, suggesting it is very low in density.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another extrusive igneous rock. Its light color indicates a silica-rich (felsic) composition. The extremely vesicular and frothy texture is the defining characteristic of pumice, which is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions from gas-rich magma.\n    *   **Identification:** **Pumice**\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Careful Points:** Observe the texture and mineral crystals. This rock is made of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible. This is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture. There are large, blocky, light-colored crystals (likely feldspar) and some darker minerals.\n    *   **Analysis:** The large crystal size indicates that this is an intrusive igneous rock, which cooled very slowly deep underground, allowing time for large crystals to grow. Rocks with very large crystals (often larger than a centimeter) are called pegmatites. The mineral composition appears felsic, similar to granite, but the crystal size is exceptionally large.\n    *   **Identification:** **Pegmatite**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the visual characteristics of each specimen:\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
