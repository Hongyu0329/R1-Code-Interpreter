The compounds A and B are the two constitutional isomers formed by the addition of a tert-butoxy group and a benzoyloxy group across the double bond of styrene. Their structures are:

**1. 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate:**
```
      OCOPh
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - OtBu
```

**2. 2-benzoyloxy-1-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane:**
```
      OtBu
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - OCOPh
```
(Where Ph is a phenyl group, C₆H₅, and tBu is a tert-butyl group, C(CH₃)₃)
These two structures can be represented as:
