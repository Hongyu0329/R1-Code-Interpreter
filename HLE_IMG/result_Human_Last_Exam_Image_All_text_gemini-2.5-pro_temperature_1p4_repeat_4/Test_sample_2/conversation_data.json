    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The provided code defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** The recursion stops if `n` is not greater than 1 (i.e., `n <= 1`). An array of size 0 or 1 is inherently sorted.\n    -   **Recursive Step (for `n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first recursive call, it compares the last element of the current scope, `a[n-1]`, with the element just before it, `a[n-2]`. Assuming the first call sorted `a[0...n-2]`, `a[n-2]` would be the largest element in that subarray.\n        3.  `swap(...)`: If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`. This places a larger value at `a[n-1]`, but it may disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray because the smaller value (originally `a[n-1]`) is now at `a[n-2]`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the potential disruption caused by the swap, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to re-sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. This second call is conditional and only happens if the swap occurs.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)`. The operations inside the function, other than the recursive calls (i.e., the `if` check and the `swap`), take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    -   In the **best case**, the array is already sorted. The condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` will always be false. Thus, the second recursive call is never made. The recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`, which resolves to `O(n)`.\n    -   In the **worst case**, we want the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` to be true at every step of the recursion to maximize the number of calls. If this happens, the recurrence relation becomes `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`, which simplifies to:\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant for the `O(1)` work).\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    Consider an array sorted in descending order, e.g., `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    -   When `sort(a, n)` is called on this array, the first call is `sort(a, n-1)`. Let's assume inductively that this call correctly sorts the first `n-1` elements (`a[0...n-2]`). The subarray `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` will become `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The last element `a[n-1]` is untouched, so it's still `1`. The state of array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    -   The `if` condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `1 < n`. This is true for `n > 1`.\n    -   Therefore, the swap occurs, and the second `sort(a, n-1)` is executed. This confirms that a reverse-sorted array triggers the worst-case behavior at each level of the main recursion.\n\n4.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, with a base case `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n    Let's expand the relation:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + (2^2-1)c`\n    -   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + (2^3-1)c`\n    -   Following the pattern, after `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k-1)c`\n    -   To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1)c`\n    -   Substituting `T(1) = d`, we get `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:**\n    The dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d+c) * 2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored, so the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe algorithm makes two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1` in the worst case. This leads to an exponential number of calls, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of `O(2^n)`. The algorithm does terminate because the size of the problem `n` decreases with each recursive call until it reaches the base case.\n\n<<<E>>>"
