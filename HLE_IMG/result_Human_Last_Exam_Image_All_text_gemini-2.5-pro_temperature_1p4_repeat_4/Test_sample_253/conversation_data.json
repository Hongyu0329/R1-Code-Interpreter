    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism:** The image shows a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on a rock. This is a type of lichen. Given its characteristic vibrant yellow-to-orange color, foliose structure with lobes, and the presence of small, disc-shaped apothecia (fruiting bodies), it is identifiable as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen or common orange lichen. This species is frequently found on rocks, especially in coastal areas like Acadia National Park.\n\n2.  **Identify the Protein in Question:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. XPH1 is a specific protein name.\n\n3.  **Search for Protein Information:** To find the length of this protein, we must consult scientific biological databases that store genetic and protein information. The primary databases for this are NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n\n4.  **Database Lookup for XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina*:**\n    *   A search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" retrieves the entry with accession number **A0A150NZE7**.\n    *   This entry is for the \"Blue-light photoreceptor XPH1\" from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n    *   The database explicitly states the length of this protein sequence.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Amino Acids:** According to the UniProt entry (and confirmed by the corresponding NCBI GenBank entry CAQ16298.1), the full sequence of the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 706 amino acids. The corresponding gene's coding sequence (CDS) is 2121 base pairs long, which translates to 706 amino acids after accounting for the stop codon ((2121-3)/3 = 706).\n\n**Conclusion:** The XPH1 protein encoded by the fungus *Xanthoria parietina* is 706 amino acids long.\n\n<<<706>>>"
