    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\nFirst, we need to identify the chiral centers in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given structure, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right for easier reference:\n*   **C_left**: The carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the molecule to the right.\n*   **C_middle**: The carbon atom bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (implied), the C_left part, and the C_right part.\n*   **C_right**: The carbon atom bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the molecule to the left.\n\nTo provide a systematic answer, we should determine the IUPAC name to number the carbons correctly.\n*   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which has priority over the amine (-NH2).\n*   The main chain must contain the carbon bearing the -OH group (C_left).\n*   We need to find the longest carbon chain containing this carbon. Tracing all possibilities, the longest chain has 5 carbons. This is a pentane chain: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(Et)-CH(Me)(...)`.\n*   Let's check the two 5-carbon chains containing the OH group:\n    1.  The chain going through the ethyl group: `(from Et)CH3-CH2-CH(C_middle)-CH(C_left)-CH3(on C_left)`. This makes it a pentan-2-ol with a `-CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)` substituent at position 3. The name is **3-(1-aminopropan-2-yl)pentan-2-ol**.\n    2.  The chain going through the methyl group on the right: `(from right)CH3-CH(C_right)-CH(C_middle)-CH(C_left)-CH3(on C_left)`. This also results in a pentan-2-ol.\n*   Rule for tie-breaking in chain length: Choose the chain with the greater number of substituents. Chain 1 gives one complex substituent. Chain 2 gives two simpler substituents (`-ethyl` at C3 and `-aminomethyl` at C4). However, the rightmost carbon is C4 which is bonded to a C5(methyl) in this naming scheme, but the drawing shows it bonded to H, CH3 and CH2NH2. Thus, the structure corresponding to this second name is different.\n*   Therefore, the most appropriate IUPAC name is **3-(1-aminopropan-2-yl)pentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at positions **C2** and **C3** of the pentane chain, and at position **C2'** of the propyl substituent.\n    *   **C2** corresponds to **C_left**.\n    *   **C3** corresponds to **C_middle**.\n    *   **C2'** corresponds to **C_right**.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**\nWe will now assign priorities (1=highest, 4=lowest) to the groups attached to each chiral center based on atomic number.\n\n**Analysis of C2 (C_left):**\n*   **Groups:** -OH, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the molecule at C3 (-C3).\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -C3 (Carbon bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen)\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon bonded to three hydrogens)\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n\n**Analysis of C3 (C_middle):**\n*   **Groups:** -C2, -C2', -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -C2 (The C is bonded to O, C, H)\n    2.  -C2' (The C is bonded to C, C, N (via C-C-N link), H) -> More precisely, C2' is bonded to two carbons and a hydrogen.\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (The C is bonded to one carbon and two hydrogens)\n    4.  -H\n*   Let's refine the priorities between C2', and Ethyl group. C2' is part of `-CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)` which is a C bonded to {C, C, H}. The ethyl group `-CH2CH3` is a C bonded to {C, H, H}. Therefore, C2' has higher priority than the ethyl group. The C2 group has highest priority because its carbon is bonded to an oxygen.\n\n**Analysis of C2' (C_right):**\n*   **Groups:** -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the molecule at C3 (-C3).\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (The C is bonded to N, H, H. Nitrogen (Z=7) gives this group priority over carbon-based groups)\n    2.  -C3 (The C is bonded to C, C, O at the next level)\n    3.  -CH3 (The C is bonded to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine R/S Configuration**\nNow we determine the configuration by observing the 3D orientation of the groups from the drawing.\n\n**Configuration of C2 (C_left):**\n*   **Orientation:** The C1(CH3)-C2-C3 backbone is in the plane of the drawing. The -OH group is on a dash (pointing away/into the page). The implied -H atom must be on a wedge (pointing towards/out of the page).\n*   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer. We trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-OH -> -C3 -> -CH3). This path is counter-clockwise (S). Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we must reverse the configuration.\n*   **Result:** S is reversed to **R**. So, the configuration is **2R**.\n\n**Configuration of C3 (C_middle):**\n*   **Orientation:** The C2-C3-C2' backbone is in the plane. The ethyl group is on a wedge (towards the viewer). The implied -H atom is on a dash (away from the viewer).\n*   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away from the viewer. We can directly read the configuration by tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-C2 -> -C2' -> -Ethyl). This path from left -> right -> up is clockwise (R).\n*   **Result:** The configuration is **3R**.\n\n**Configuration of C2' (C_right):**\n*   **Orientation:** The C3-C2' bond is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (towards the viewer) and the -CH3 group is on a dash (away from the viewer). The implied -H atom is in the plane.\n*   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. We can use the swap method. Swap the lowest priority group (-H, #4) with the group pointing away (-CH3, #3). Now, H is dashed, and CH3 is in the plane. We determine the configuration for this new arrangement and then reverse it.\n*   The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is now -CH2NH2 -> -C3 -> -CH3(new position). This traces a counter-clockwise (S) circle. Since we performed one swap, we must reverse the result.\n*   **Result:** S is reversed to **R**. So, the configuration is **2'R**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll three chiral centers have the R configuration. Based on the IUPAC naming convention, the full absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 2'R).\n\nThe final answer should specify the configuration for all chiral centers.\nFinal answer from left to right chiral center: R, R, R.\nUsing the IUPAC numbering C2, C3, C2': (2R, 3R, 2'R).\n\n<<(2R, 3R, 2'R)>>"
