    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the provided image:** The image is completely black. There are no drawings, chemical structures, or molecules visible in the image.\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". This question presupposes that there are molecules shown or described \"above\" (i.e., in the image).\n3.  **Evaluate the premise:** Since the image is blank, the premise of the question is false. There are no \"molecules mentioned above\" to analyze or compare.\n4.  **Assess the options based on the missing information:**\n    *   (a) Conformational isomers, (b) Constitutional isomers, (c) Identical molecules, and (d) Stereoisomers are all descriptions of specific relationships between two or more chemical structures.\n    *   To determine any of these relationships, we must be able to see the molecular formulas and the connectivity/spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecules.\n    *   Without any molecules to inspect, it is impossible to determine if they are identical, constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, or conformers.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because the necessary information (the molecules) is not provided, none of the specific classifications (a, b, c, d) can be logically chosen. The question is unanswerable as presented. Therefore, the most appropriate option is (e) \"None of these\", as we cannot confirm any of the other relationships.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The primary issue is the missing information (the molecules). The image is blank.\n*   The question is directly tied to the content of the image (\"molecules mentioned above\").\n*   We cannot assume what molecules were intended to be shown. We must work only with the information given.\n*   Since we cannot establish any relationship between non-existent molecules, we cannot select options (a), (b), (c), or (d). This leaves (e) as the only logical choice.\n\n<<<E>>>"
