    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n=5.\n*   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the connections in the figure, we can list the edges:\n    E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n    The number of edges is |E|=7.\n\nThe structure of the graph can be understood as follows:\nThe subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K4) with the edge (2, 5) removed. This subgraph is often denoted as K4-e.\nThe vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5, which are the two non-adjacent vertices in the K4-e subgraph.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method** to compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k). This method is based on the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted, and `G.e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted.\n\nA good choice for `e` is an edge that simplifies the graph's structure. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)**.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e\n\nThe graph `G - e` is formed by removing the edge (3, 4) from G.\n*   Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   Edges: {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n*   Structure: In this new graph, vertices {2, 3, 5, 4} form a 4-cycle (C4). Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\nWe can compute P(G - e, k) by direct counting. Let's color the vertices in the order 1, 2, 5, 3, 4.\n1.  **Color vertex 1:** `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 2:** Must be different from vertex 1. `k-1` choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 5:** Must be different from vertex 1. `k-1` choices.\nNow, we must consider two cases for the colors of vertices 2 and 5.\n\n*   **Case A: Color(2) = Color(5)**\n    *   The number of ways to color vertices 1, 2, and 5 is `k * (k-1) * 1`.\n    *   **Color vertex 3:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, there are `k-1` choices for 3.\n    *   **Color vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, there are `k-1` choices for 4.\n    *   Total ways for Case A: `k * (k-1) * 1 * (k-1) * (k-1) = k(k-1)³`.\n\n*   **Case B: Color(2) ≠ Color(5)**\n    *   The number of ways to color 1, 2, and 5 is `k * (k-1) * (k-2)`.\n    *   **Color vertex 3:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have different colors, there are `k-2` choices for 3.\n    *   **Color vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have different colors, there are `k-2` choices for 4.\n    *   Total ways for Case B: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)³`.\n\nCombining both cases, P(G - e, k) is the sum:\nP(G - e, k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\nP(G - e, k) = k(k³ - 3k² + 3k - 1) + k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\nP(G - e, k) = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k² - k)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\nP(G - e, k) = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 18k³ - 20k² + 8k)\n**P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G.e\n\nThe graph `G.e` is formed by contracting the edge `e = (3, 4)`. We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new vertex, let's call it `v_34`.\n*   Vertices: {1, 2, 5, `v_34`}\n*   Edges: The new vertex `v_34` is connected to every vertex that was connected to either 3 or 4.\n    *   Neighbors of 3: {2, 5, 4}.\n    *   Neighbors of 4: {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   So, `v_34` is connected to {2, 5}.\n*   The edges from the original graph that remain are (1,2) and (1,5).\n*   Structure: The resulting graph has vertices {1, 2, 5, `v_34`} and edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2, `v_34`), (5, `v_34`)}. This is a 4-cycle, C4.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for a cycle of length n, P(Cn, k), is `(k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1)`.\nFor `G.e = C4`, we have n=4:\nP(G.e, k) = P(C4, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1)\nP(G.e, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1)\nP(G.e, k) = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k-1)\n**P(G.e, k) = k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Chromatic Polynomial\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6 - 1)k⁴ + (15 - (-4))k³ + (-17 - 6)k² + (7 - (-3))k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThis polynomial can also be written in factored form as k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
