The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. Based on the information provided, S100B could be used as a prognostic marker. This is because its over-expression is shown to directly activate signaling cascades (such as NFκβ and JNK/JUN) that lead to key pathological outcomes like neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis. The level of S100B would therefore correlate with the extent of these damaging processes, allowing clinicians to predict the progression and severity of the neurological disorder, which is the function of a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct one.
