    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nFirst, we look at the key signature at the beginning of the staff. We see three flats: B-flat (B♭), E-flat (E♭), and A-flat (A♭). This signature corresponds to the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. Given the overall context and tonality of the first movement of the \"Pathetique\" sonata, the primary key is C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\nThe question points to measure 30, which is clearly labeled in the score. We need to identify all the notes played in this measure in both the right and left hands.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a pattern of sixteenth notes. The notes, in ascending order, are G, B-natural (B♮), D, and F-sharp (F♯). The accidental (♯) is explicitly written before the F, and the natural sign (♮) is written before the B.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays broken octaves. The notes are G and F-sharp (F♯).\n\nCombining the notes from both hands, the complete set of pitches present in measure 30 is G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Structure and Function**\nLet's analyze the chord formed by these notes: G - B♮ - D - F♯.\n*   The root of the chord is G. In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree, which is the **dominant**.\n*   The notes G - B♮ - D form a **G major triad**. In a minor key, it is standard practice to raise the third of the dominant chord to create a leading tone (B♮ is the leading tone to C). This makes the dominant chord major.\n*   The additional note is F♯. The F♯ is the major seventh of the G chord, making it a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n*   The chord in measure 30 functions as a **dominant chord**, as it leads directly to the **tonic chord** (C minor) in the following measure (measure 31). This dominant-tonic resolution is a fundamental part of harmonic progression.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Correct Roman Numeral**\nIn Roman numeral analysis, we represent the function and quality of the chord within the established key.\n*   The root of the chord is on the **fifth** scale degree, so the Roman numeral will be **V**.\n*   The chord is **major** (G-B♮-D), so we use a capital Roman numeral: **V**.\n*   The F♯ is a chromatic alteration. It is the raised fourth scale degree (^#4) of C minor. This note creates extra tension by acting as a leading tone to the dominant note G itself (F♯ resolves to G). In a standard functional analysis, this chromatic embellishment does not change the chord's fundamental identity as the dominant. The core harmony is the G major triad.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and standard Roman numeral representation for the harmony in measure 30 is V, representing the major dominant chord.\n\n<<<V>>>"
