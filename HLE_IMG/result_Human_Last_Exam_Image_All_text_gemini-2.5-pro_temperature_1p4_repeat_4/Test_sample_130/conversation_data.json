    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is produced when atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them). The energized electrons jump to higher energy levels and then fall back to their original levels, emitting light of specific colors (wavelengths) in the process. The result is a series of bright lines on a dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Significance of Spectral Lines**\nEach chemical element has a unique and characteristic emission spectrum. The number, color (wavelength), position, and intensity of the lines are like a fingerprint for that element. To identify the element, we need to compare the pattern of lines in the given spectrum with the known spectra of different elements.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Features of the Given Spectrum**\nLet's carefully observe the prominent lines in the spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer wavelength to shorter wavelength):\n*   **Red Region:** There are several distinct lines, with one being particularly bright.\n*   **Yellow/Orange Region:** A very bright and prominent yellow line is visible.\n*   **Green Region:** There are multiple lines, including a very bright green line and several others nearby.\n*   **Blue/Cyan Region:** There are several distinct lines in this area.\n*   **Violet/Deep Blue Region:** The spectrum shows several lines, becoming more crowded as they go deeper into the violet.\n\nThe overall pattern is complex, with numerous lines spread across the entire visible spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, let's consider the spectra of some common elements:\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a cyan line (H-beta), a blue-violet line (H-gamma), and a violet line (H-delta). The spectrum in the image is far more complex than that of hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** The most distinctive feature of the sodium spectrum is a very strong, closely-spaced pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow part of the spectrum. While the provided spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other prominent lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The spectrum is not dominated solely by the yellow line, so it's unlikely to be pure sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its spectrum being overwhelmingly dominated by numerous bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum, which is what gives neon signs their characteristic reddish-orange glow. The spectrum in the image has a much more balanced distribution of colors.\n*   **Helium:** The spectrum of helium is known for having several strong, well-separated lines across the visible range. Key features include a strong red line, a very bright yellow line, a bright green line, and several other prominent lines in the blue and violet.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Identification**\nThe pattern of lines shown in the image—a prominent red line, a bright yellow line, a bright green line, and several other lines in the blue and violet regions—is a classic and perfect match for the emission spectrum of the element **Helium (He)**. This specific \"fingerprint\" of lines is unique to helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
