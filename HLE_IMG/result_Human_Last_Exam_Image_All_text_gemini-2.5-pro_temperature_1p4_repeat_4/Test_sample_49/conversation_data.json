    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This node is part of a low-pass filter, formed by the capacitor $C$ and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the network as seen from node $a_0$. The cutoff frequency, typically denoted as $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second) or $f_c$ (in Hertz), is the frequency at which the filter's output power is half its passband power. For a first-order low-pass filter, this corresponds to the frequency where the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Problem in Terms of Circuit Analysis**\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ for a simple RC filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $C$ is the capacitance and $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\nOur task, therefore, boils down to finding the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground (node $b_0$).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must deactivate all independent sources in the circuit. The input `IN` at node $c_0$ is the source. Deactivating a voltage source means shorting it to ground. Thus, we connect node $c_0$ to ground.\n\nThe problem is now to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also grounded. The circuit is an infinite ladder of resistors.\n\n**Step 4: Use Nodal Analysis and Difference Equations**\nLet's label the nodes `a_0` as `d_0` for consistency with the rest of the ladder (`d_1, d_2, ...`). The node voltages are denoted by $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ for nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively.\nTo find the resistance $R_{th}$, we can apply a test voltage $V_{d0}$ at node $d_0$ (with $V_{c0}=0$) and calculate the resulting current $I_{in}$ flowing into the node. Then $R_{th} = V_{d0} / I_{in}$.\n\nThe Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ are:\nAt node $c_n$: $\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{dn}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n+1}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{cn} - V_{dn} - V_{c,n-1} - V_{c,n+1} = 0$\nAt node $d_n$: $\\frac{V_{dn} - V_{cn}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n+1}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{dn} - V_{cn} - V_{d,n-1} - V_{d,n+1} = 0$\n\nThese are coupled second-order difference equations. We can decouple them by defining new variables:\nSum: $S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$\nDifference: $D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$\n\nAdding the two KCL equations gives a difference equation for $S_n$:\n$2S_n - S_{n-1} - S_{n+1} = 0 \\implies S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$\nSubtracting the second KCL equation from the first gives one for $D_n$:\n$4D_n - D_{n-1} - D_{n+1} = 0 \\implies D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the Difference Equations**\nThe general solutions are:\nFor the S-equation (`\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1 = 0` has a repeated root `\\lambda=1`): $S_n = A(1)^n + B \\cdot n(1)^n = A + Bn$.\nFor the D-equation (`\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0` has roots `\\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}`): $D_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n + E(2+\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\nWe apply boundary conditions for the infinite ladder: the node voltages must remain finite as $n \\to \\infty$.\n*   For $S_n = A+Bn$ to be bounded, we must have $B=0$. So, $S_n = A$ (a constant).\n*   For $D_n$ to be bounded, the coefficient of the term that grows with $n$ (`2+\\sqrt{3} > 1`) must be zero. So, $E=0$. Thus, $D_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\nNow we use the conditions at $n=0$ and $n=1$:\n*   From the KCL at $n=1$, we found $S_{n} = S_{0}$ for $n \\ge 1$. Here $S_0 = V_{c0} + V_{d0}$. Since $V_{c0}=0$, we have $S_0 = V_{d0}$. So, $S_n = V_{d0}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n*   For the D-equation, at $n=0$, $D_0 = V_{c0} - V_{d0} = 0 - V_{d0} = -V_{d0}$. Also, from the general solution, $D_0 = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^0 = C$. Thus, $C = -V_{d0}$, which gives $D_n = -V_{d0}(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Thevenin Resistance**\nThe input current is given by the connection at $d_0$: $I_{in} = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{d1}}{r}$.\nWe can find $V_{d1}$ from our solutions for $S_1$ and $D_1$:\n$V_{d1} = \\frac{S_1 - D_1}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0} - [-V_{d0}(2-\\sqrt{3})^1]}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0}(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3})}{2} = V_{d0} \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nNow, substitute $V_{d1}$ into the current expression:\n$I_{in} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_{d0} - V_{d0} \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{r} \\left( \\frac{2 - (3-\\sqrt{3})}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$.\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{I_{in}}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)/2} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\nRationalizing the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(\\sqrt{3}+1)$.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ back into the formula for the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$.\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which can be interpreted as either angular frequency $\\omega_c$ (in rad/s) or frequency $f_c$ (in Hz), where $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$. The expression in terms of `r` and `C` is most compactly written for $\\omega_c$.\n\nFinal expression for the cutoff frequency (angular):\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
