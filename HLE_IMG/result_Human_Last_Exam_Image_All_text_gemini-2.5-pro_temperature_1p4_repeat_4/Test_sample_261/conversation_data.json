    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the book title:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Content:** The image shows a close-up of a book cover illustration. The central figure is a ghostly, white, or light blue unicorn in a galloping pose. It has a golden horn. The background is dark, suggesting a forest at night. On the right side of the image, there is a portion of a decorative, column-like border with warm, golden, and red tones.\n\n2.  **Identify the Art Style:** The illustration is painterly and has a distinct fantasy feel. This style is strongly associated with the original American editions of the Harry Potter series, illustrated by Mary GrandPré. The ornate border is also a signature element of these covers.\n\n3.  **Connect the Image to a Specific Story:** The image of a unicorn in a dark forest is a very specific and memorable scene from the Harry Potter series. This event occurs in the first book when Harry ventures into the Forbidden Forest and encounters a mysterious figure drinking the blood of a slain unicorn.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Exact Book and Edition:** Given the art style and the scene depicted, the book is almost certainly the first installment of the Harry Potter series. The specific illustration in the fragment is not from the front cover of the book. Instead, it is the artwork featured on the *spine* of the original American hardcover edition of the book.\n\n5.  **Determine the Title:** The first book in the Harry Potter series has two titles depending on the region. In the United Kingdom and most of the world, it is called *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. However, the artwork by Mary GrandPré is for the American edition, where the title was changed. Therefore, the title of the book featuring this specific artwork is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
