    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The provided image is a raster plot. The y-axis shows 128 different electrodes, and the x-axis shows time in seconds (s). Each black dot represents an electrical spike (firing) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** Synchronized bursts are events where many electrodes fire intensely and at roughly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots that span a significant portion of the y-axis.\n\n3.  **Estimate Timestamps of Bursts:** We will locate the center of each of these vertical bands on the time axis.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first distinct, network-wide burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 5 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 18 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The final burst in the observed window is centered at approximately **t₄ = 48 s**.\n\n4.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have three such intervals in this data.\n    *   **Interval 1 (between Burst 1 and 2):** IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 18 s - 5 s = **13 s**.\n    *   **Interval 2 (between Burst 2 and 3):** IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 18 s = **18 s**.\n    *   **Interval 3 (between Burst 3 and 4):** IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** We find the average of the calculated intervals.\n    *   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n    *   Average IBI = (13 s + 18 s + 12 s) / 3\n    *   Average IBI = 43 s / 3\n    *   Average IBI ≈ 14.333... s\n\n6.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be given with two significant figures.\n    *   The number 14.333... starts with the digits 1 and 4. These are the first two significant figures.\n    *   The third significant figure is 3. Since it is less than 5, we round down (i.e., we do not change the second significant figure).\n    *   Therefore, the average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is **14 s**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Definition:** It's important to consistently identify only the major, network-wide synchronized events as \"bursts\" for this calculation. Smaller, less coordinated events are considered background activity.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The accuracy of the final result depends on the estimation of the burst centers. The identified bursts are wide, but estimating their central point is a reasonable approach. The values 5, 18, 36, and 48 s are robust visual estimations.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the specified precision (two significant figures) is a crucial final step. The raw calculation gives 14.333..., but the final answer must be rounded to 14.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Burst Timestamps: ~5 s, ~18 s, ~36 s, ~48 s.\n*   Inter-Burst Intervals: 13 s, 18 s, 12 s.\n*   Average: (13 + 18 + 12) / 3 = 43 / 3 ≈ 14.33 s.\n*   Answer to two significant figures: 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
