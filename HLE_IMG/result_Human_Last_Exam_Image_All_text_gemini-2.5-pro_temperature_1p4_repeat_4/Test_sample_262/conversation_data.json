    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify which of the four provided iridium complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. The lifetime of an emitter in a device refers to its stability against degradation during operation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:**\n    *   All four compounds are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   They share a common central iridium(III) ion.\n    *   They all have the same bidentate `N^N` ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily influence properties like solubility and packing, but are not the main variable affecting intrinsic bond stability here.\n    *   The key difference lies in the two identical cyclometalating `C^N` ligands in each complex. These ligands are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), where the phenyl ring is substituted with a varying number of fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two** fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. It has **zero** fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom.\n        *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **three** fluorine atoms.\n\n3.  **Relate Molecular Structure to Lifetime (Stability):**\n    *   The operational lifetime of these phosphorescent emitters is largely determined by their chemical stability. A primary degradation pathway involves the breaking of bonds within the complex, particularly the metal-ligand bonds.\n    *   The strongest bond in these types of complexes is generally the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond formed by cyclometalation. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the strength of this bond.\n    *   Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups via the inductive effect.\n    *   When fluorine atoms are attached to the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand, they pull electron density away from the ring and, consequently, from the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This withdrawal of electron density strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond.\n    *   A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more resistant to chemical degradation (e.g., from reductive or oxidative quenching, or bond dissociation from the high-energy excited state). Therefore, a higher degree of fluorination on the cyclometalating ligand generally leads to a more stable complex and a longer operational lifetime.\n\n4.  **Compare the Complexes and Predict Lifetimes:**\n    *   We can rank the complexes based on the number of fluorine atoms on their `C^N` ligands, which correlates with the expected Ir-C bond strength and, thus, lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2 (0 Fluorines):** Has the non-fluorinated ppy ligand. This will result in the weakest Ir-C bond among the four complexes. Consequently, it is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 3 (1 Fluorine):** The single fluorine atom will strengthen the Ir-C bond relative to Complex 2. However, it will be less stable than the complexes with more fluorine atoms.\n    *   **Complex 1 (2 Fluorines):** The two fluorine atoms provide significant stabilization, making the Ir-C bond much stronger than in Complexes 2 and 3. This complex is expected to have a long lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4 (3 Fluorines):** With the highest number of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms, this complex should have the strongest Ir-C bond and the greatest stability, leading to the longest lifetime.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The expected order of lifetime is: **Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2**.\n    *   The question asks for the complexes with **shorter** lifetimes. This refers to the least stable complexes in the series.\n    *   Based on our ranking, Complex 2 and Complex 3 are the two least stable complexes and are therefore expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to Complex 1 and Complex 4.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   The pair of complexes identified as having shorter lifetimes is [2, 3].\n    *   This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that \"lifetime\" in this context means operational stability, not the phosphorescent lifetime (Ï„, the decay time of the excited state).\n*   The key chemical principle is the strengthening of the Ir-C bond by electron-withdrawing substituents (fluorine).\n*   The question asks for \"shorter\" (plural) lifetimes, suggesting a comparison and grouping of the less stable options.\n*   Systematically count the number of fluorine atoms on the critical ligand (`C^N` ligand) to rank the complexes.\n\n<<<H>>>"
