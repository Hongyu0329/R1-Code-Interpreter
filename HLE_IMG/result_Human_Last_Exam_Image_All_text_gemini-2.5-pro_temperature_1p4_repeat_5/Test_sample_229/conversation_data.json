    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Musical Style Identification:**\n    *   **Instrumentation and Format:** The sheet music is a \"lead sheet,\" showing a melody line in treble clef with chord symbols written above it (e.g., C, E7, F, G7). This format is very common in jazz and related popular music genres.\n    *   **Rhythm and Syncopation:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes and rests, creating a driving, swinging rhythm. This is a key characteristic of jazz.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression uses frequent seventh chords (E7, G7), which are fundamental to jazz harmony. The progression | C | C | E7 | E7 | F | F | ... and the later use of a ii-V-I cadence (Dm - G7 - C) are standard jazz devices.\n    *   **Melody and Articulation:** The melody consists of fast-moving lines that often arpeggiate the underlying chords (e.g., the melody over the E7 chord clearly outlines an E7 arpeggio: G#-B-G#-B-C#-E-G#-B). This, combined with the specific rhythmic feel, points strongly towards the **Gypsy Jazz** (or **Jazz Manouche**) style.\n\n2.  **Song Title Identification:**\n    *   Based on the Gypsy Jazz style, the composer is likely Django Reinhardt, the style's most famous proponent. We can try to match the melody and chord progression to one of his famous compositions.\n    *   Let's analyze the chord progression of the first section (often called the 'A' section):\n        *   `| C | C | E7 | E7 | F | F | C G7 | C |` (This progression is visible in the third and fourth staves, representing the \"B\" or bridge section). A very similar progression appears in the first section.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the second section:\n        *   `| C | C | Cm | Cm | Dm | Dm | G7 | G7 |` (The chord indicated as `C-` is C minor).\n    *   This specific 32-bar AABA-form chord progression is the signature harmonic structure of the jazz standard **\"Djangology\"** composed by Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli.\n    *   The melody written on the sheet music also matches the main theme of \"Djangology\" precisely.\n\n3.  **Country of Origin Identification:**\n    *   The Gypsy Jazz style was developed in the 1930s.\n    *   Its principal creators were guitarist Django Reinhardt (Belgian-born Romani) and violinist Stéphane Grappelli (French).\n    *   Their group, the Quintette du Hot Club de France, was based in Paris.\n    *   Therefore, the style and the song are considered to have originated in **France**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The sheet music is handwritten, likely a personal transcription, so some notation might be informal (e.g., `C-` instead of `Cm`).\n*   The key signature (C major / A minor) and the first chord (C major) establish the key of the piece as C major. \"Djangology\" is often performed in G major, but C major is also a common key for this tune.\n*   The structural markings (`To Segno`, `To Coda`, `Coda`) indicate a standard jazz performance practice of repeating sections (D.S. al Coda) and having a specific ending.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the musical elements—the syncopated melody, the specific chord progression characteristic of the composer, and the overall feel—we can confidently identify the piece.\n\n<<<Title: Djangology\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: France>>>"
