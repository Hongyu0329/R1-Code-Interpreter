    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the image.**\nThe image displays a fragment of a runestone carving. The runes belong to the Younger Futhark script, typical of the Viking Age. They are carved within horizontal bands defined by incised lines. An 'x' symbol is used as a punctuation mark to separate words. The style of the runes is relatively clear and belongs to a known runestone style (likely RAK or a related style).\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate the runes in the image.**\nTo identify the specific stone, we need to read the runes and convert them into Latin letters. We will proceed row by row.\n\n*   **Top Row:** Reading from left to right, we can identify the following runes: `...ᛁᛋ : ᚦᚢᚱᚦᛁᛦ : ᚦᛅᛁᛦ : ᚴᛁ...`\n    This transliterates to: `...is : þurþiʀ : þaiʀ : ki...`\n    The sequence `þurþiʀ` corresponds to the Old Norse name *Þórðr*. The word `þaiʀ` means \"they\".\n\n*   **Second Row:** The runes are `...ᛘᛅᚱ : ᚠᛅᚦᚢᚱ : ᛋᛁᚾ : ᚢᛁ...`\n    This transliterates to: `...mar : faþur : sin : ui...`\n    The sequence `faþur : sin` means \"his father\". The preceding `mar` is likely the end of a name.\n\n*   **Third Row:** The runes are `...ᛚᛅ : ᛅᚢᚴ : ᛅᛏ : ... ᛘᚬᚦᚢᚱ...`\n    This transliterates to: `...la : auk : at : ... moþur...`\n    `auk` means \"and\", `at` can mean \"in memory of\", and `moþur` means \"mother\". The `la` is likely the end of the previous word from the second row.\n\n*   **Bottom Row (partially visible):** The runes appear to be `...ᛋᛁᚾᛅ : ᚼᛅᚾ : ᚢᛅᛋ...`\n    This transliterates to: `...sina : han : uas...`\n    `sina` means \"his/her\", `han` means \"he\", and `uas` means \"was\".\n\n**Step 3: Reconstruct the inscription and search for a match.**\nBy combining the transliterated fragments, we can piece together parts of the original inscription. The text flows from one line to the next.\n- The word ending in `...mar` followed by `faþur : sin` suggests the name *Þjóðmarr*.\n- The word ending in `...la` is likely `uitula` or `snialla` (meaning \"eloquent\" or \"capable\").\n- The complete readable section seems to be: `... (Þiuð)mar, faður sinn ... (vitu)la ok at ... móður sína. Hann vas ...` (in normalized Old Norse). In transliteration: `...mar : faþur : sin : ...la : auk : at : ... moþur : sina : han : uas ...`\n\nThis specific combination of names and phrases (`Þórðr`, `faður sinn`, `móður sína`, `hann vas`) is a unique fingerprint.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the runestone using catalogue information.**\nThe question specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". These are a group of runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition. Searching through the catalogue of Ingvar runestones for the inscription fragments we identified leads to one specific stone: **Sö 166**, also known as the Grinda Runestone in Södermanland, Sweden.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the match.**\nThe full transliteration of Sö 166 is:\n`kriutkarþr : suis : þurþiʀ : þaiʀ : kirþu : at : þiuþmar : faþur : sin : uitula : auk : at : ...a... moþur : sina : han : uas ...`\n\nLet's align this with what we see in the image:\n- **Image Row 1 (`...is : þurþiʀ : þaiʀ : ki...`)** matches the end of `suis` and the following words `þurþiʀ : þaiʀ : kirþu`.\n- **Image Row 2 (`...mar : faþur : sin : ui...`)** matches the end of `þiuþmar` and the following words `faþur : sin : uitula`.\n- **Image Row 3 (`...la : auk : at : ... moþur...`)** matches the end of `uitula` and the following `auk : at : ... moþur`.\n- **Image Row 4 (`...sina : han : uas...`)** matches the sequence `sina : han : uas`.\n\nThe match is perfect. The stone is indeed Sö 166. It is considered part of the Ingvar runestone group due to its location, style, and dating, placing it in the same context as other stones that explicitly mention Ingvar.\n\n<<<Sö 166>>>"
