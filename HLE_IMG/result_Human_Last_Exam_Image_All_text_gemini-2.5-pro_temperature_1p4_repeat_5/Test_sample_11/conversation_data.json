    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information.**\n    The image displays a small section of a flag, located in the top-left corner of a grid. This section consists of three horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the colors are black, white, and dark red.\n\n*   **Step 2: Search for flags with this pattern.**\n    A direct search for a national flag with horizontal stripes of black, white, and red in that order reveals that no current sovereign nation officially uses this flag. This specific design was historically the flag of the German Empire (1871–1918) and the Republic of Upper Volta (1959–1984), which is now Burkina Faso.\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider common puzzle tricks.**\n    Since the puzzle asks to identify a current country, and a direct match doesn't exist, we should consider common tricks used in such puzzles. One frequent trick is displaying a flag upside down.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify a flag that matches when inverted.**\n    Let's think about flags with the same three colors but in a different order. The flag of Yemen consists of three horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom.\n\n*   **Step 5: Test the inversion hypothesis.**\n    If we take the flag of Yemen (Red-White-Black) and turn it upside down, the order of the stripes becomes Black-White-Red. This inverted order perfectly matches the arrangement of colors seen in the puzzle image.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the identity of the country.**\n    Based on the evidence, the image shows the flag of Yemen displayed upside down. This is a common and plausible trick for a flag identification puzzle. The country to be guessed is therefore Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
