    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (Bb), which typically indicates the key of F Major or D minor.\n    *   The piece starts and ends on an F chord (F minor at the beginning, F major at the very end). This suggests the piece is in the key of F minor, a common key for this standard.\n    *   The structure appears to be a 32-bar AABA form, which is very common for jazz standards. There are four 8-bar sections (though the barring is a bit condensed in this chart).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody (A Section):**\n    *   The very first melodic phrase in the first measure consists of the notes C, C, A, F.\n    *   When played over the F minor (F-) chord written above, these notes correspond to the 5th, 5th, minor 3rd (Ab is written, but this is a common typo in handwritten charts; the note on the staff is an A-natural, but the implied harmony and standard melody use Ab), and root of the chord. However, let's assume the written A-natural is correct for this specific arrangement. Even with A-natural, the contour is very recognizable. *Correction*: Looking closely, the note is on the A space. In the key of F, this is A. The F- chord symbol indicates an F minor chord (F-Ab-C). There's a slight discrepancy, but the rhythm and general melodic shape are key. Let's focus on the C's and the F.\n    *   The melodic rhythm (quarter note, quarter note, half note) is also very distinctive. This opening phrase is one of the most famous in the jazz repertoire.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony (A Section):**\n    *   The chord progression in the first four measures is: `F- | Eø7 (E-7b5) | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7`.\n    *   This specific progression, with its chromatically descending root motion (F, E, Eb, Db), is the undeniable harmonic fingerprint of the tune in question. It is highly unique and immediately identifiable to a jazz musician.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Tune:**\n    *   The combination of the melodic fragment and the unique chord progression in the A section definitively identifies the piece.\n    *   The tune is **\"Lullaby of Birdland\"**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Composer:**\n    *   \"Lullaby of Birdland\" was composed by the British jazz pianist **George Shearing** in 1952.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Handwritten Chart Inaccuracies:** The chart is handwritten and contains some non-standard notations and potential slight inaccuracies (like the A-natural in the first bar over an F- chord, or the condensed chord changes). However, the core musical information is clear enough for identification.\n*   **Bridge Reharmonization:** The B-section (bridge), starting around measure 9, has the progression `Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | ...`. This is a common reharmonization (alternate chord progression) for the bridge of \"Lullaby of Birdland\" found in many popular fake books. The original composition by Shearing features a bridge that transposes the A-section's harmony. This difference does not change the tune's identity; it's just a common variation.\n*   **Melody and Harmony Match:** The crucial step is matching the distinctive melody of the A-section with its equally distinctive harmony. The `F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7` progression is the \"smoking gun\" that confirms the identification.\n\nBased on this analysis, the title of the jazz standard is \"Lullaby of Birdland\" and the composer is George Shearing.\n\n<<<Title: Lullaby of Birdland, Composer: George Shearing>>>"
