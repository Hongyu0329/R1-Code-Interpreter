    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   Remaining mass = 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   The ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra suggest the presence of a benzene ring (C₆H₅, mass = 77).\n*   Remaining mass = 121 - 77 = 44. This mass corresponds to a C₃H₈ fragment (3*12 + 8*1 = 44).\n*   Combining these parts, the molecular formula is likely C₆H₅ + C₃H₈ + N = C₉H₁₃N.\n*   Let's verify the molecular weight of C₉H₁₃N: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A benzene ring has 4 DBE (3 double bonds + 1 ring), which fits perfectly.\n*   The fragmentation pattern shows significant peaks at m/z 91 (tropylium or benzyl cation, [C₇H₇]⁺) and a base peak at m/z 30 ([CH₂NH₂]⁺). A base peak at m/z 30 strongly suggests a primary amine fragment, -CH₂-NH₂. A peak at m/z 91 suggests a Ph-CH₂- group. This points towards an isomer containing a benzyl group. However, we will see that the NMR data is conclusive and contradicts the MS base peak, suggesting the MS data may be for a different isomer or contain artifacts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ (~3020-3080 cm⁻¹) are characteristic of aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (~2850-2960 cm⁻¹) are characteristic of aliphatic sp³ C-H stretching.\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ indicate C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   The sharp bands around 700-750 cm⁻¹ often suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   There are some broad absorptions in the 3200-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which could be N-H stretching from a primary or secondary amine, though not very distinct. The formula C₉H₁₃N requires an N-H bond unless it's a quaternary salt (which is not the case).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   There are 7 distinct carbon signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, there must be some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 Cipso, 3 distinct CH signals for the ortho, meta, and para carbons, where ortho and meta carbons are pairwise equivalent).\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 70 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows 1 negative signal (CH₂) and 5 positive signals (CH and CH₃).\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm does not appear in DEPT, confirming it's a quaternary carbon (Cq), the Cipso of the phenyl ring.\n    *   The 3 aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be CH groups (3 positive signals).\n    *   This leaves 1 negative signal (CH₂) and 2 positive signals (CH/CH₃) for the 3 aliphatic carbons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The molecule contains: 1 Cq, 5 CH (3 aromatic, 2 aliphatic), 1 CH₂, and 1 CH₃ (from the combination of DEPT signals). Wait, 5 positive signals means 3 aromatic CH + 2 aliphatic. These two aliphatic signals could be two CHs, two CH3s, or one CH and one CH3. Given we have a 3-carbon chain, and one CH₂, the remaining two carbons must be one CH and one CH₃ to make C3. So: 1 Cq, 3 types of Ar-CH, 1 CH₂, 1 CH, 1 CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.4 ppm (m, 5.02H):** Multiplet integrating to 5 protons, characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (d, 3.24H):** A doublet integrating to ~3 protons. This corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm (m, 1.96H + 0.97H):** A complex region integrating to a total of ~3 protons. This can be resolved into a 2H multiplet and a 1H multiplet.\n*   **-NH₂ group:** The formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 protons. So far we have 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 protons. The remaining 2 protons likely belong to a primary amine (-NH₂), whose signal is often broad and may be underlying other signals or not integrated.\n\n**Step 5: Integrate all Data using HSQC to Determine the Structure**\nHSQC correlates protons to the carbons they are directly bonded to.\n*   **Correlation 1:** The proton doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm (3H) correlates to the carbon at δ 19.2 ppm. This confirms the **CH₃** group.\n*   **Correlation 2:** From the ¹H integrals, there is a 2H multiplet (~2.7 ppm) and a 1H multiplet (~2.9 ppm). The HSQC shows a cross-peak between the proton signal at ~2.7 ppm and the carbon at δ 43.5 ppm. Since the proton signal represents 2H, the carbon at 43.5 ppm must be a **CH₂** group. This matches the single negative peak in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n*   **Correlation 3:** The HSQC shows a cross-peak between the proton signal at ~2.9 ppm and the carbon at δ 49.6 ppm. Since the proton signal represents 1H, the carbon at 49.6 ppm must be a **CH** group. This matches one of the positive peaks in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Structure**\nWe have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\nLet's assemble them. The only way to connect these to form a stable C₉H₁₃N molecule is:\n**Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**\n\nLet's check if this structure (1-phenylpropan-2-amine) is consistent with the chemical shifts:\n*   CH₃ (next to CH): δ(¹³C) = 19.2 ppm. Typical.\n*   CH₂ (benzylic, next to Ph): δ(¹³C) = 43.5 ppm. A typical value for a benzylic CH₂ is ~45 ppm. This is a good match.\n*   CH (next to N and C): δ(¹³C) = 49.6 ppm. A typical value for a CH-N is ~50 ppm. This is a good match.\n*   The relative shifts are also correct: the CH carbon attached to the electronegative nitrogen is downfield from the benzylic CH₂ carbon.\n\nLet's consider the alternative isomer consistent with the fragments: Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂ (2-phenylpropan-1-amine).\n*   This would have a benzylic CH and a CH₂-N group.\n*   From our data, we would have to assign C(CH₂-N) = 43.5 ppm and C(benzylic CH) = 49.6 ppm.\n*   This assignment is chemically unreasonable. A benzylic CH (~42-45 ppm) should be upfield of a CH₂-N group (~48-50 ppm). The data forces the opposite assignment, ruling this isomer out.\n*   Note on MS: The base peak at m/z 30 in the MS would strongly suggest the 2-phenylpropan-1-amine isomer. However, the comprehensive and self-consistent NMR evidence (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC) overwhelmingly and unambiguously points to the 1-phenylpropan-2-amine structure. In such a case of conflicting data, the detailed and consistent NMR package is considered more reliable.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The determined structure is **Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**.\n*   The parent chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Numbering starts from the end closer to the principal group, but here we need to give the substituent the lowest number. The chain is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The phenyl group is at position 1, and the amino group is at position 2.\n*   Parent name: propan-2-amine.\n*   Substituent: a phenyl group at position 1.\n*   The IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
