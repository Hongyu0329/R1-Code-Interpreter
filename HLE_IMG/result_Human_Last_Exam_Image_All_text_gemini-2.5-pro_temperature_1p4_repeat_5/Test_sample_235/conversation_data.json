    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is created through a collage of words on an illustrated page. To analyze its meter, we must first determine the full text of the poem.\nThe most prominent words are the ones cut out and pasted onto the image:\n*   `rules`\n*   `and`\n*   `lines,`\n*   `an intricate spider's web`\n*   `work`\n\nHowever, erasure and collage poetry often incorporate elements from the source page. At the top of the page, there is a title, \"THE FIRST STEP\", and a page number, \"35\". A plausible reading of the poem would include these elements, typically in the order they appear on the page (top to bottom).\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the full text of the poem.**\nArranging the textual elements from top to bottom, we get a single sentence or thought:\n\"The first step, thirty-five: rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\nThis reading treats the title and page number as part of the poetic line, which is a common technique in this style of poetry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the metric pattern by counting syllables.**\nNow, let's count the syllables in the assembled sentence to check against the given metric patterns.\n*   `The` (1) `first` (1) `step` (1) = 3 syllables\n*   `thir-ty-five` (3) = 3 syllables\n*   `rules` (1) `and` (1) `lines,` (1) = 3 syllables\n*   `an` (1) `in-tri-cate` (3) `spi-der's` (2) `web` (1) = 7 syllables\n*   `work` (1) = 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllable count = 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 1 = **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.**\nLet's examine the definitions of the metric patterns offered:\n*   **A. free verse:** This means the poem has no regular meter or rhyme. While possible, the exact syllable count of 17 points to a more specific form.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** A line with 10 syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. This poem has 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line with 12 syllables, usually iambic. This poem has 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A specific stanza form (three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable line) with a complex trochaic and dactylic meter. This poem is a single sentence. Incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line with approximately 3 iambic feet (around 6 syllables). Incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A poetic form invented by Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem, when read to include the title and page number from the source page, forms a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This perfectly matches the definition of an American Sentence.\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n*   Recognizing that erasure/collage poetry can incorporate text from the source background (title, page numbers).\n*   Correctly assembling the words into a single, coherent sentence based on their placement.\n*   Accurately counting the syllables of the entire sentence, including reading \"35\" as \"thirty-five\".\n*   Knowing the specific definitions of the poetic forms listed in the answer choices, particularly the 17-syllable rule for the American Sentence.\n\nThe analysis robustly supports the conclusion that the poem follows the metric pattern of an American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
