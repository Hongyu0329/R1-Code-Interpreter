    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the general class of the compound:** The molecule is a complex, polycyclic organic compound containing nitrogen atoms. This is characteristic of an alkaloid, a class of naturally occurring organic compounds that mostly contain basic nitrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the core structure (the scaffold):**\n    *   The molecule has a tetracyclic (four-ring) system.\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms integrated into the ring system.\n    *   The core framework is known as a quinolizidine alkaloid skeleton. Specifically, it is related to the parent alkaloid sparteine, which has the same tetracyclic framework but lacks the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Identify key functional groups:**\n    *   The most prominent functional group, apart from the tertiary amine and the overall ring system, is the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   This carbonyl group is part of a cyclic amide, which is called a lactam. It is located in a six-membered ring (a piperidone ring).\n\n4.  **Relate the structure to known alkaloids:**\n    *   The structure is an oxidized derivative of sparteine. The presence of the lactam at this specific position (C2) on the sparteine skeleton is the defining feature.\n    *   This particular alkaloid is a well-known member of the lupin alkaloid family, found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n\n5.  **Determine the specific name:**\n    *   Based on the sparteine skeleton with a lactam group at the C2 position, the common name for this alkaloid is **Lupanine**.\n\n6.  **Consider Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The drawing shows specific stereochemistry with wedges and dashes at the chiral centers. This particular stereoisomer is the naturally occurring (-)-lupanine, which is the most common form.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n\n*   **Alkaloid nature:** Recognize the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic system as typical for an alkaloid.\n*   **Parent skeleton:** Identifying the underlying sparteine skeleton is a key step in classifying the compound.\n*   **Key functional group:** The lactam group is the critical feature that distinguishes this molecule from sparteine and gives it its specific name.\n*   **Common vs. IUPAC name:** For complex natural products like this, the common name (Lupanine) is almost always used instead of the very long and complicated systematic IUPAC name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is the quinolizidine alkaloid known as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
