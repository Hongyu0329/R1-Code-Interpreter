    "This is a piece of sheet music for piano. Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify it:\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and General Style**: The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined), which is standard for piano music. The piece displays a high level of technical difficulty, featuring rapid sixteenth-note passages, dense chords, large leaps, and dynamic extremes (from `p` to `f`). This virtuosic style is characteristic of late Romantic composers or modern, epic-style music often found in film or video game scores.\n\n2.  **Key and Time Signature**: The key signature has two flats (B♭ and E♭), which indicates the key of G minor or B♭ major. The first chord played by the left hand is a G minor chord (G-B♭-D), and the initial right-hand melody is an arpeggiation of the same chord, confirming the key is G minor. The time signature is 4/4, indicated by the 'C' symbol for common time.\n\n3.  **Tempo and Dynamics**: The tempo is marked at \"♩ = 80\", a moderately slow tempo for a quarter note. However, the piece is filled with sixteenth notes, meaning the actual pace of the notes being played is very fast. The dynamics shift dramatically, starting `piano` (soft), jumping to `forte` (loud) in measure 3, then changing to `mezzo-piano` (moderately soft) and `mezzo-forte` (moderately loud), which contributes to its dramatic and intense character.\n\n4.  **Melodic and Harmonic Content**:\n    *   The piece begins with a quiet, ominous arpeggiated figure in G minor.\n    *   In measure 3, it explodes into a loud, driving section with fast, repeating arpeggios in both hands, firmly establishing the G minor tonality with force.\n    *   From measure 4 onwards, the harmony becomes highly chromatic and dissonant, with frequent accidentals (C♯, F♯, A♯, D♯ etc.). This aggressive, chromatic harmony combined with the relentless sixteenth-note rhythm is a strong identifier. This section features a very recognizable descending chromatic pattern in the harmony.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Piece**:\n    *   The combination of a G minor key, an epic and virtuosic character, and highly chromatic harmony strongly suggests music from a video game boss battle.\n    *   The specific melodic/harmonic progression and rhythmic patterns are hallmarks of the iconic theme \"One-Winged Angel\" from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*.\n    *   This particular transcription, with its specific introductory measures and extreme technical demands, is recognizable as a popular and highly difficult fan arrangement for piano, likely the one by the arranger Animenz. The original piece was composed by Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nTherefore, the music is an arrangement of \"One-Winged Angel\" from Final Fantasy VII.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel>>>"
