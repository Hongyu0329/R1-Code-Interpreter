The structure shown in the image is the remains of a World War II-era Air-to-Ground Gunnery Range Target. It was part of the larger Marfa Army Airfield in Texas, used by pilots for bombing and strafing practice. While it is a genuine historic ruin from a significant period, it is not officially registered as a standalone historic landmark.
