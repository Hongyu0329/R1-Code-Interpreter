1. The music modulates to the key of E minor. 2. The original key is C# minor, and its relative major is E major. The modulation to E minor is a form of mode mixture, where the composer uses the parallel minor of the relative major (E minor instead of E major). This allows for a change in the tonal center to the expected relative tonic (E) while preserving the piece's somber, melancholic mood. 3. The complete Roman numeral marking for the chord on the first beat of measure 11 is i⁶₄ in the new key of E minor. This represents the new tonic chord (i) in second inversion (⁶₄), as the fifth of the chord (B) is in the bass.
