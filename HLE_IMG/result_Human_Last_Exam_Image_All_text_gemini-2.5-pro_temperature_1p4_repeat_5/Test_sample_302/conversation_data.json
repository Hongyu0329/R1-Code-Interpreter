    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Reading Order:** Chinese seals with four characters are traditionally read from right to left, and from top to bottom. So, the order of reading is:\n    *   1. Top-right character\n    *   2. Bottom-right character\n    *   3. Top-left character\n    *   4. Bottom-left character\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in seal script, then converted to modern Chinese):**\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This character is 景 (jǐng). In seal script, the top part represents '京' (capital) and the bottom part is '日' (sun). Together, they form 景, which means \"scenery\" or \"view\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character is 園 (yuán). It has an outer enclosure radical '囗' and an inner component '袁'. This character means \"garden\" or \"park\". In simplified Chinese, it is written as 园.\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character has a very distinct and classic shape in seal script. It is the character 不 (bù), meaning \"not\" or \"no\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This is the most complex character. It corresponds to the traditional character 盡 (jìn). The upper part (resembling a brush in a holder) and the lower part (a vessel or dish '皿') are characteristic of 盡 in seal script. It means \"to exhaust\" or \"end\". In simplified Chinese, it is written as 尽.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Phrase:**\n    *   Putting the characters together in the correct order, we get the phrase: 景園不盡 (Jǐng Yuán Bù Jìn).\n\n4.  **Final Phrase in Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   Converting the traditional characters to simplified ones, the phrase is: **景园不尽**. This is a poetic expression meaning \"The scenery of the garden is endless\" or \"Endless garden scenery\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The script used is an ancient form called Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū), where the characters' shapes can be very different from their modern forms.\n*   Correctly identifying the reading order is crucial for interpreting the meaning of the seal correctly.\n*   The simplified Chinese character for 園 is 园, and for 盡 is 尽. The other two characters, 景 and 不, are the same in both traditional and simplified scripts.\n\n<<<景园不尽>>>"
