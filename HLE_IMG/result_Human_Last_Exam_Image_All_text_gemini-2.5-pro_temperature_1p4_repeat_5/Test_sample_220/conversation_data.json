    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Crystal Structure and Viewing Direction:** The question asks to identify the pattern of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   An FCC lattice has atoms at the 8 corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n    *   The [110] direction is a vector pointing along the diagonal of a face of the cube (e.g., from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a,a,0), where 'a' is the lattice constant).\n    *   Viewing along this direction means we are projecting the 3D positions of the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n2.  **Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    *   When the FCC lattice is projected onto the plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern of atoms forms a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   This can be visualized by considering the stacking of atomic planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. The planes stack in an ABAB... sequence.\n    *   Layer A consists of atoms that form a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle correspond to the [001] and [1-10] directions of the original cube, and have lengths of `a` and `aâˆš2`, respectively.\n    *   Layer B consists of atoms that are located at the center of the rectangle formed by the atoms in Layer A.\n    *   When viewed from above (projected), these two layers superimpose, creating a pattern of a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and an additional atom at its exact center.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Provided Images:** We need to examine each image to see which one displays this \"centered rectangle\" pattern. The images show arrangements of atoms within a rectangular box, which likely represents the projected unit cell.\n\n    *   **Image A:** The atoms appear to be arranged in two offset vertical columns. This does not form a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms form a rhombus-like or hexagonal pattern. This is not a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms is irregular and does not show the symmetry of a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image D:** This image shows two layers of atoms (represented by the different depths in the 3D box).\n        *   Let's focus on the front layer of atoms. We can clearly identify four atoms forming the corners of a rectangle. Let's note their approximate coordinates from the axes: (x=1, z=6), (x=5, z=6), (x=1, z=12), and (x=5, z=12).\n        *   There is another atom in this front layer located at (x=3, z=9). This point is exactly at the center of the rectangle: `x_center = (1+5)/2 = 3` and `z_center = (6+12)/2 = 9`.\n        *   Therefore, the front plane of atoms in image D perfectly represents a **centered rectangle**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** While the back layer of atoms in image D forms a different pattern (and the superposition of both layers would result in a simple 3x3 grid), image D is the only option that clearly and prominently features the correct theoretical pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction. It is common in such schematic questions that one part of the diagram clearly illustrates the key principle. The front layer in D accurately depicts the centered rectangular projection.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
