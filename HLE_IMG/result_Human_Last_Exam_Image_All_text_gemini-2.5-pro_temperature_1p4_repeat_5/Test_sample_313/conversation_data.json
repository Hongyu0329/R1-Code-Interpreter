    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Visual Clue**\n*   The image provided is a black and white photo of two men in formal suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   One man, who is older and has white hair, is handing a trophy to a younger man with a beard and is shaking his hand.\n*   The question states the event took place on \"June 20, 2019\".\n*   By searching for major awards events on or around that date, we find the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019. It's common for photos from an event to be published or circulated the following day.\n*   The younger man in the photo strongly resembles Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had a major night, winning three prestigious awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   The older man presenting the award resembles Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL.\n*   So, the visual clue points to Nikita Kucherov being honored as a top hockey player at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clue**\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical manufacturing process. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in a process called \"carroting\" to turn animal fur (often from beavers) into felt for making hats.\n*   This process was highly toxic and caused neurological damage (erethism) in the hat makers, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\".\n*   Therefore, the \"X Y\" in this clue refers to a type of hat made with this process, such as a \"Felt Hat\" or, more specifically, a \"Top Hat\", which was commonly made from mercury-treated beaver felt.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Two Clues**\n*   We need to find a two-word phrase \"X Y\" that fits both clues. The word \"another\" in the second clue is key, as it implies that \"X Y\" has two different meanings: one related to the photo and one related to the mercury-treated hats.\n*   Let's test the most likely candidate from Step 2: **\"Top Hat\"**.\n*   **Clue 1 (Visual):** \"Top Hat is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   No one is literally wearing a top hat in the picture. However, the term \"top hat\" can be used figuratively to refer to a person of high status or importance. Nikita Kucherov, at that moment, was being recognized as the **top** player in the league by winning the MVP and top scorer awards. The word \"**hat**\" also has a strong connection to hockey through the \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals in a game). Therefore, \"Top Hat\" can be seen as a fitting figurative description for the person pictured: the **top** player in a sport known for the **hat** trick.\n*   **Clue 2 (Textual):** \"Another Top Hat has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This refers to the literal object, the **Top Hat**, which was historically made using the toxic mercury process. This meaning fits the clue perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe phrase \"Top Hat\" works for both clues. It refers figuratively to the high-achieving hockey player in the photograph and literally to the historical item made with mercury salts. The word \"another\" correctly distinguishes between these two meanings.\n\n<<<Top Hat>>>"
