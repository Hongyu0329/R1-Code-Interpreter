    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the plant in the image.**\nThe plant shown in the image has several distinct features:\n*   **Leaves:** The leaves are the most prominent feature. They are dark green, glossy, and have an elliptical or ovate shape.\n*   **Venation:** The most striking characteristic is the complex, web-like network of pale green or creamy-white veins that stand out against the dark green leaf blade. This is known as reticulate venation.\n*   **Leaf Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged in whorls (circling the stem at the same point) at the tips of the branches.\n*   **Stems:** The central part of the leaf whorl and the petiole (leaf stalk) show a purplish or dark tint.\n*   **Other features:** In one of the cropped images, small, dark, round structures are visible, which could be flower buds or developing fruit capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant species.**\nBased on the unique combination of these features, particularly the prominent reticulate venation on glossy, whorled leaves, the plant can be identified as *Pittosporum cornifolium*. This plant is a species within the *Pittosporum* genus, often known by its common Māori name, perching kōhūhū. The visual evidence strongly matches the known appearance of this species.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\nThe question asks for the island to which this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the plant is native and restricted to a specific geographic area.\n*   A search of botanical databases and resources for *Pittosporum cornifolium* reveals its native habitat.\n*   Sources such as the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network and various botanical gardens confirm that *Pittosporum cornifolium* is endemic to New Zealand.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific island.**\nNew Zealand consists of two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, along with many smaller islands. It's necessary to find the specific distribution of *Pittosporum cornifolium* within New Zealand.\n*   The documented range for *Pittosporum cornifolium* is exclusively on the North Island of New Zealand, from the northernmost tip (Te Paki) down to the Waikato and Coromandel Peninsula regions. It is not found naturally on the South Island.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the answer.**\nSince the plant is *Pittosporum cornifolium*, and its natural, endemic range is restricted to the North Island of New Zealand, the answer to the question is the North Island.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Accurate Identification:** Correctly identifying the plant is crucial. The unique venation is the key clue that distinguishes it from other plants.\n*   **Understanding \"Endemic\":** The term is specific and means the species is found only in that location and nowhere else in the world naturally.\n*   **Geographic Specificity:** The question asks for an \"island,\" not a country. Providing \"New Zealand\" would be too broad, as the plant is not endemic to the entire country but to a specific island within it.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the plant is *Pittosporum cornifolium*, which is endemic to the North Island of New Zealand.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
