The image shows a **fungus**, specifically a **polymorphic yeast**. The observed morphology includes both **oval, budding yeast cells** and filamentous structures known as **pseudohyphae** (chains of elongated, budding cells with constrictions at the septa). This combination is highly characteristic of the genus ***Candida***, such as ***Candida albicans***.
