    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the cuneiform sign.**\n    The image displays an archaic cuneiform sign. It is not composed of the later, more abstract wedge-shaped impressions but is clearly pictographic, meaning it's a simplified drawing of an object. The sign has a rectangular base with internal lines, suggesting walls or an interior layout. Above this base is a triangular shape, resembling a roof. This overall structure strongly suggests a building.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the specific cuneiform sign.**\n    This sign is known in Sumerology as É. It is one of the most fundamental and recognizable pictographs in early cuneiform writing. The sign is a schematic representation of a reed house, which was a common dwelling type in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the meaning of the sign É.**\n    The Sumerian word É directly translates to \"house\" or \"temple.\" The sign retained this primary meaning throughout the history of cuneiform writing, even as its form evolved from a pictograph to a more abstract collection of wedges.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Cuneiform signs for tools, like the one for a hoe (MAR) or an adze, were pictographs of those specific tools and look different from the sign shown.\n    *   **B. Guard:** The sign for a guard or overseer (UGULA or PA) does not resemble a house.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA or GAR) is a pictograph of a ration bowl, typically conical or round in shape.\n    *   **D. Home:** This is a direct synonym for \"house,\" which is the meaning of the sign É. The pictograph is clearly a depiction of a dwelling or home.\n    *   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a pictograph of a star (an eight-pointed star in its earliest form), representing the heavens. It looks completely different.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for a beard (SU) is a pictograph of a human jaw with a beard and does not match the image.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The provided cuneiform sign is the pictograph É, which represents a house. Therefore, its meaning is \"home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
