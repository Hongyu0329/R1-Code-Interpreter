    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given transformation to identify the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction involves two molecules:\n    1.  **Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆):** An aromatic six-membered ring with a 6π electron system.\n    2.  **Cyclobutene (C₄H₄ or C₄H₆):** A four-membered ring containing one double bond (a 2π electron system). The drawing of cyclobutene (C₄H₄) is unusual, but for the purpose of identifying reaction types, we treat it as a source of a reactive π-bond.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is promoted by ultraviolet light, indicated by `hv`. This signifies that the reaction proceeds via a photochemical pathway. The rules governing pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for photochemical and thermal processes.\n*   **Product:** The product is a complex, fused polycyclic molecule (C₁₀H₄F₆). Its formation from the simple reactants suggests a multi-step process involving significant reorganization of bonds, which is characteristic of pericyclic reactions. The question explicitly states that two such reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the first pericyclic reaction.**\n*   Aromatic compounds like hexafluorobenzene are typically unreactive in pericyclic reactions because of their high stability (aromaticity). However, under photochemical conditions, they can absorb energy and undergo valence isomerization to less stable, strained isomers.\n*   A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the conversion to \"Dewar benzene\" (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation breaks the aromaticity and creates a highly strained but reactive intermediate.\n*   The isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene is an intramolecular reaction that involves the reorganization of the 6π electron system to form a new sigma bond and a bicyclic structure. This type of reaction is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 6π electron system (a 4n+2 system where n=1) undergoes a photochemically allowed disrotatory electrocyclization. This mode of closure leads to the formation of Dewar benzene. So, the first step is a photochemically allowed electrocyclic reaction.\n    *Reaction 1:* Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (**Electrocyclic Reaction**)\n\n**Step 3: Propose the second pericyclic reaction.**\n*   The intermediate formed in Step 1, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, is highly strained and contains two reactive double bonds. It can readily react with other molecules containing π-systems.\n*   The second reactant is cyclobutene, which has a 2π electron system.\n*   The intermediate and cyclobutene can react together in a cycloaddition. Specifically, one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (a 2π system) reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene (another 2π system) to form a new four-membered ring, thus fusing the two molecules.\n*   This reaction, where two π systems combine to form a cyclic compound with two new sigma bonds, is a **cycloaddition reaction**. Since it involves a 2π system and another 2π system, it is specifically a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   The total number of electrons involved in this step is 2 + 2 = 4π electrons (a 4n system where n=1). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is allowed under photochemical conditions (typically proceeding via a suprafacial-suprafacial pathway, [π2s + π2s]).\n    *Reaction 2:* Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene + Cyclobutene → Final Product (**[2+2] Cycloaddition Reaction**)\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nThe overall transformation is best explained by a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** where hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition reaction** between the hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate and cyclobutene to form the final product.\n\nThe question asks for the kind of pericyclic reactions involved. Based on the analysis, these are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition reaction.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction.>>>"
