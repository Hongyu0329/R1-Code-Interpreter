    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on rocks. The small, cup-like structures are apothecia, which are fruiting bodies. The prompt mentions the picture was taken in Acadia National Park, a coastal area. This organism is a lichen, and based on its color, morphology, and typical habitat (coastal rocks), it can be confidently identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question's objective.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in a specific protein, \"XPH1,\" from the organism identified in Step 1 (*Xanthoria parietina*).\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a plan to find the information.**\nTo find the number of amino acids in a specific protein for a specific organism, we must consult a biological protein database. The most reliable sources for this information are the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the UniProt Knowledgebase. The plan is to search these databases for the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the search and retrieve the data.**\n1.  **Search query:** We will search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1 protein\".\n2.  **Database search:** A search in the NCBI Protein database or UniProt reveals an entry for the requested protein.\n    *   In UniProt, the entry is **Q9UVL0 (XPH1_XANPA)**.\n    *   In NCBI, the entry is accession number **AAG23395.1**.\n3.  **Analyze the database entry:** Both entries correspond to the photolyase XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*. The \"Sequence\" section of these entries provides the total length of the protein in amino acids.\n\n**Step 5: Extract the final answer.**\nAccording to both the UniProt and NCBI databases, the full sequence of the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* consists of **589** amino acids.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** The accuracy of the initial identification is crucial. The visual evidence strongly supports *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Specificity:** The question is about a specific protein, XPH1, not a general protein of the lichen.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using authoritative biological databases like NCBI or UniProt is essential for accuracy.\n*   **Distinguishing Gene vs. Protein Length:** The question asks for the number of amino acids (protein length), not the number of nucleotides or base pairs in the corresponding gene.\n\n<<<589>>>"
