**Product A** is methyl (7aR)-1-acetyl-5-oxo-8,8a-dihydro-1H,5H,7H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]oxazine-9-carboxylate (This is a simplified name, the structure is a complex fused system resulting from Michael addition and cyclization).
**Product B** is a complex tetracyclic lactam formed by intramolecular condensation of C.
**Product C** is N-acetyl-2-(1-pyrrolin-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.

The visual representations of the structures are:
**Product A:** 
A bicyclic system formed from N-acetyl proline and methyl propiolate after Michael addition of the pyrroline enamine and cyclization. It contains a pyrrolidine ring, an N-acetyl group, a newly formed six-membered ring containing oxygen, and a methyl ester group.
**Product B:**
A tetracyclic structure containing a spiro-aminal center, formed via intramolecular condensation of C.
**Product C:** 
The starting material (2-(1-pyrrolin-5-yl)proline) in which the proline nitrogen has been acetylated.
