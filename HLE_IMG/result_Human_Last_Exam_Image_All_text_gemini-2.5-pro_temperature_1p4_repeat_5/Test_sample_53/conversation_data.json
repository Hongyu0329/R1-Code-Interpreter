    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Artwork Style and Subject Matter**\nThe image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase. The style is red-figure pottery, where figures are left in the natural red color of the clay against a black-painted background. This specific example, with its elaborate composition and use of added white and yellow paint, is characteristic of South Italian, specifically Apulian, vase-painting from the late Classical period (c. 4th century BCE). The scene depicted is dramatic and narrative, typical of mythological subjects on such vessels.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Central Scene**\nThe scene is centered around a chariot. We can identify several key figures:\n*   **The Charioteer:** A figure wearing a patterned sleeve and a distinctive, conical, forward-curving cap known as a Phrygian cap. This type of dress was used by Greek artists to signify someone of Eastern or \"barbarian\" origin. This figure is actively driving the chariot, holding the reins.\n*   **The Chariot:** It is a simple two-wheeled chariot. A large white wing is prominently displayed behind the driver, indicating that this is a magical, flying chariot.\n*   **A Second Figure in the Chariot:** Behind the driver, there is another figure, draped in cloth.\n*   **The Fallen Figure:** Below the chariot, a nude male figure lies on the ground, seemingly dead or dying. His posture suggests he has been thrown or has fallen.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Mythological Narrative**\nThe combination of a female driver in \"oriental\" dress, a magical flying chariot, and a dead youth on the ground strongly points to one specific Greek myth: the escape of Medea from Corinth.\n*   **The Story:** Medea, a sorceress from Colchis (on the Black Sea, considered \"the East\"), helped Jason obtain the Golden Fleece. He later abandoned her in Corinth to marry the king's daughter. In revenge, Medea murdered Jason's new bride and the two sons she had with Jason. To escape Jason's wrath, her grandfather, the sun-god Helios, sent her a golden, winged chariot (often drawn by dragons or serpents).\n*   **Matching the Figures:**\n    *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Medea**, the powerful sorceress from the East.\n    *   The flying chariot is the one sent by Helios.\n    *   The dead figure on the ground is one of her murdered **sons**. The second figure in the chariot is likely the body of her other son, which she is taking with her.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the Specific Question**\nThe question is: \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\"\nThis question can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  Who is the person that has physically exited or fallen from the chariot? This would be the dead son on the ground.\n2.  Who is the main character using the chariot to leave/depart from the scene? This would be Medea.\n\nIn the context of analyzing art and mythology, the question most likely refers to the principal actor performing the central action of the narrative. The entire point of the scene is Medea's dramatic and terrifying departure from Corinth after her revenge. She is the agent of the action, the one who is \"leaving\". The son is a passive victim of her actions. Therefore, Medea is the figure who is leaving.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
