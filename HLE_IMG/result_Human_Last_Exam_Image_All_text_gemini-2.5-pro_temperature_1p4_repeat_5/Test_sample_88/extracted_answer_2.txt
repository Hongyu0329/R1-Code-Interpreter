The three products A, B, and C are formed through competing reaction pathways:

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3, likely C14H19N2O3):** Formed via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition pathway. An azomethine ylide is generated from the starting material, which is then acetylated by the solvent (acetic anhydride) to form a stabilized ylide. This acetylated ylide undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate.
