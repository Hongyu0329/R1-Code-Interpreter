The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be upright and immersed or emergent among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long, strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes its capsule to be nodding or hanging down.
