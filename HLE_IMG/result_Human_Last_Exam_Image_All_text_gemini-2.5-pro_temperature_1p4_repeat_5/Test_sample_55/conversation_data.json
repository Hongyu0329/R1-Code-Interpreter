    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates either F major or D minor. The title of the piece is \"Fantasy in D minor,\" which establishes the home key as D minor. In the key of D minor, D is the tonic.\n\n2.  **Locate the Measure and Circled Notes:** The question directs us to measure 8. The circle encompasses the notes played on the third beat of this measure in both the right and left hands.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in the Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes in the upper staff are F and A. Crucially, there is a sharp sign (♯) next to the F, making it an F♯.\n\n4.  **Identify the Notes in the Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The notes in the lower staff are D and A.\n\n5.  **Combine the Notes to Form the Chord:** Combining the notes from both staves gives us the pitches D, F♯, and A.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Chord Quality:**\n    *   The root of the chord is D.\n    *   The note F♯ is a major third above D.\n    *   The note A is a perfect fifth above D.\n    *   A root, a major third, and a perfect fifth form a **major triad**. Therefore, the chord is a D major triad.\n\n7.  **Determine the Roman Numeral in the Context of D Minor:**\n    *   The Roman numeral must represent the chord's function within the key of D minor.\n    *   The root of the chord is D, which is the first scale degree (the tonic) of D minor.\n    *   The quality of the chord is major.\n    *   In Roman numeral analysis, major chords are represented by uppercase Roman numerals. A major chord built on the tonic is labeled **I**.\n    *   Ordinarily, the tonic chord in D minor is a D minor triad (D-F-A), which would be labeled 'i' (lowercase). The F♯ accidental changes the quality of this tonic chord from minor to major. This specific harmonic device, where a minor-key passage concludes on a major tonic chord, is known as a **Picardy third**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The circled notes form a D major chord. Since D is the tonic of the key (D minor), the correct Roman numeral for a major tonic chord is **I**.\n\n<<<I>>>"
