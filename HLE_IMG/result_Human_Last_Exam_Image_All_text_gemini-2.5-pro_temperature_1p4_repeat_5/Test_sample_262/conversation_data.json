    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). A shorter lifetime corresponds to lower stability and faster degradation of the emitter molecule during device operation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the general structure of the complexes:** All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structural motif: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where Ir is the central metal ion, `C^N` represents a cyclometalating ligand, and `N^N` is a neutral bidentate ligand.\n    *   **Metal Center:** All complexes feature an Iridium(III) center, which is typical for efficient phosphorescent emitters due to strong spin-orbit coupling.\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** In all four complexes, the `N^N` ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is identical across all four structures, it is not the differentiating factor for their relative stabilities. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily serve to enhance solubility and prevent intermolecular quenching.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. This variation is expected to be the primary determinant of their relative lifetimes.\n\n3.  **Relate Molecular Structure to Emitter Lifetime:** The operational stability of phosphorescent metal complexes, particularly in OLEDs and LECs, is heavily influenced by the strength of the chemical bonds within the molecule. A well-established degradation pathway for iridium complexes based on 2-phenylpyridine involves the activation and cleavage of C-H bonds, especially those in proximity to the metal center, when the molecule is in its excited state. The C-H bond ortho to the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond on the phenyl ring is known to be particularly vulnerable.\n\n4.  **A Key Strategy for Enhancing Lifetime:** A widely adopted and highly effective strategy to improve the stability and thus the lifetime of these emitters is to replace the vulnerable ortho C-H bond with a much stronger and less reactive C-F bond. The bond dissociation energy of a C-F bond (typically >480 kJ/mol) is significantly higher than that of an aromatic C-H bond (~430 kJ/mol), making the fluorinated ligand much more resistant to degradation.\n\n5.  **Analyze Each Complex based on this Principle:** We must examine the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand for each complex, specifically looking for the presence or absence of a fluorine atom at the position ortho to the Ir-C bond.\n\n    *   **Complex 2:** This complex uses the parent, unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand. On the phenyl ring, the position ortho to the Ir-C bond is occupied by a hydrogen atom (C-H). This makes it a baseline for stability, and it is known to be susceptible to degradation via this pathway. Therefore, it is expected to have a relatively short lifetime.\n\n    *   **Complex 1:** This complex has two fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring. However, carefully observing the structure reveals that these fluorine atoms are located at the *meta* and *para* positions relative to the Ir-C bond. The crucial *ortho* position still has a C-H bond. While fluorination at other positions can increase oxidative stability and tune electronic properties, it does not protect the most vulnerable ortho C-H bond. Thus, Complex 1 is also expected to be relatively unstable and have a short lifetime.\n\n    *   **Complex 3:** In this complex, each phenyl ring is substituted with a single fluorine atom. Critically, this fluorine atom is positioned at the location *ortho* to the Ir-C bond. This ortho-fluorination directly replaces the weak C-H bond with a strong C-F bond, effectively blocking the major degradation pathway. Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to be significantly more stable and have a longer lifetime than complexes 1 and 2.\n\n    *   **Complex 4:** This complex features three fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring. One of these is at the *ortho* position, similar to Complex 3. The additional fluorine atoms at meta and para positions further enhance the stability. Since it possesses the key ortho-fluorine substituent, Complex 4 is also expected to be very stable and exhibit a long lifetime.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The presence of an ortho-fluorine on the cyclometalating ligand is the dominant factor determining high stability and long lifetime.\n    *   **Complexes 3 and 4** have this stabilizing feature. They are expected to have longer lifetimes.\n    *   **Complexes 1 and 2** lack this stabilizing feature, retaining a vulnerable ortho C-H bond. They are therefore expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\nThe question asks for the complexes with **shorter lifetimes**, which are Complexes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<E>>>"
