    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image provided is a raster plot.\n    *   The **x-axis** represents **Time** in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n    *   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, from 0 to 128.\n    *   Each black dot indicates an action potential (a \"firing\") recorded by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** \"Synchronized bursts\" are periods of time where a large number of neurons fire together. On the raster plot, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating high firing activity across many electrodes simultaneously. We can visually identify five major synchronized bursts in the 50-second recording period.\n\n3.  **Estimate Timestamps of Bursts:** To calculate the interval between bursts, we first need to assign a single time point to each burst. A reasonable method is to estimate the center time of each dense band of activity.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first major burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 4 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 16 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final burst in this window is centered at approximately **t₅ = 49 s**.\n\n4.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. With five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n    *   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and 2):** t₂ - t₁ = 16 s - 4 s = **12 s**\n    *   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and 3):** t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 16 s = **8 s**\n    *   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and 4):** t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**\n    *   **IBI₄ (between Burst 4 and 5):** t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** We now find the average of the four calculated intervals.\n    *   Sum of intervals = 12 s + 8 s + 12 s + 13 s = 45 s\n    *   Number of intervals = 4\n    *   Average IBI = (Sum of intervals) / (Number of intervals) = 45 s / 4 = **11.25 s**\n\n6.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the answer to be given to two significant figures.\n    *   The number is 11.25.\n    *   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1.\n    *   The third digit is 2. Since 2 is less than 5, we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant figure).\n    *   Therefore, 11.25 s rounded to two significant figures is **11 s**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The identification of a \"burst\" is qualitative but the five chosen events are clearly the most prominent and synchronized network-wide activities.\n*   The estimation of the \"center\" of a burst has some subjectivity, but using reasonable estimates leads to a robust final answer. For example, slight shifts in the estimated times (e.g., ±0.5s) do not change the final rounded result.\n*   It is important to calculate the number of intervals correctly (for N bursts, there are N-1 intervals).\n*   The final rounding must be done according to the rules of significant figures.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 4 s, 16 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 49 s. The calculated average inter-burst interval is 11.25 s, which when rounded to two significant figures is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
