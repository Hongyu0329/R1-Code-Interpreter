    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight and Presence of Halogens**\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Cluster:** The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) corresponds to the molecular ion and its isotopologues. This cluster appears to be m/z 260, 262, 264, 266.\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern:** The relative intensities of these peaks can reveal the presence of elements with multiple common isotopes, such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n    *   The peaks in the molecular ion cluster are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), and 264 (I=12.9%).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis of chlorine atoms being present.\n        *   1 Cl: M:(M+2) ratio is ~3:1.\n        *   2 Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4) ratio is ~9:6:1 (or ~1:0.67:0.11).\n        *   3 Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ratio is ~27:27:9:1 (or ~1:1:0.33:0.04).\n    *   Let's normalize the observed intensities of the cluster assuming the peak at m/z 260 is the M⁺ peak (containing only the most abundant isotopes, i.e., ³⁵Cl).\n    *   Ratio of intensities: I(260) : I(262) : I(264) = 34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9.\n    *   Normalized to I(260): 1 : 0.83 : 0.37.\n    *   This pattern is a very good match for a molecule containing **three chlorine atoms**. The theoretical ratio is approximately 1:0.96:0.31.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound (using the lightest isotopes) is 260 Da, and it contains three chlorine atoms.\n3.  **Apply the Nitrogen Rule:** The molecular weight (260) is an even number, which indicates that the molecule contains an even number of nitrogen atoms (most likely zero).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n1.  The mass of three ³⁵Cl atoms is 3 × 35 = 105 Da.\n2.  The mass of the rest of the molecule (let's call it R) is 260 - 105 = 155 Da.\n3.  We need to find a plausible chemical formula for the R group, which has a mass of 155 and likely consists of C, H, and possibly O.\n    *   **Option A (C, H only):** The formula C₁₂H₁₁ gives a mass of (12 × 12) + (11 × 1) = 144 + 11 = 155. The overall molecular formula would be **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**. The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 12 - 11/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This high DoU suggests aromatic rings.\n    *   **Option B (C, H, O):** The formula C₁₁H₇O gives a mass of (11 × 12) + (7 × 1) + 16 = 132 + 7 + 16 = 155. The overall molecular formula would be **C₁₁H₇OCl₃**. The DoU = 11 - 7/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 11 - 5 + 1 = 7. This also suggests aromatic rings (e.g., a naphthalene ring has DoU=7).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak is at m/z 225. This corresponds to a loss of 260 - 225 = 35 Da from the molecular ion. This mass loss is characteristic of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). So, the base peak is the **[M-Cl]⁺** ion.\n    *   The isotope pattern for this fragment should show two Cl atoms. Let's check: m/z 225 (I=100) and m/z 227 (I=66.7). The ratio is 100:66.7 or 1:0.67. This perfectly matches the theoretical M:(M+2) ratio for a species with two chlorine atoms (~1:0.64). This confirms our analysis.\n2.  **Fragment at m/z 143 (I=27.8%):** This peak is quite significant. It could arise from the cleavage of the molecule into two parts. Let's consider a structure of the type R'-CCl₃.\n    *   Cleavage of the C-C bond would yield an R'⁺ ion and a ·CCl₃ radical.\n    *   The mass of ·CCl₃ is 12 + (3 × 35) = 117 Da. The corresponding fragment ion CCl₃⁺ cluster starts at m/z 117 and is observed to be very weak.\n    *   The mass of the R' group would be 260 - 117 = 143 Da. The formation of R'⁺ at m/z 143 is a major fragmentation pathway (I=27.8%), suggesting R'⁺ is a stable cation.\n3.  **Fragment at m/z 143 corresponds to the [C₁₀H₇O]⁺ ion:** Comparing our two formula possibilities, the R' fragment of mass 143 could be [C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ or [C₁₀H₇O]⁺. The [C₁₀H₇O]⁺ fragment is recognizable as a stable naphthoxy cation. This suggests the molecule has a naphthoxy group linked to a CCl₃ group.\n4.  **Proposed Structure:** The structure is likely **1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene** (or the 2-isomer).\n    *   Formula: C₁₁H₇OCl₃\n    *   Molecular Weight (nominal): 11*12 + 7*1 + 16*1 + 3*35 = 132 + 7 + 16 + 105 = 260 Da. This matches perfectly.\n    *   Structure: A naphthalene ring (C₁₀H₇) is attached to an oxygen, which is in turn attached to a trichloromethyl group (-CCl₃).\n\n**Step 4: Verify with Fragmentation and Name the Compound**\n1.  **Fragmentation of 1-(Trichloromethoxy)naphthalene:**\n    *   **M⁺:** [C₁₀H₇-O-CCl₃]⁺• at m/z 260. Observed.\n    *   **[M-Cl]⁺:** Loss of a Cl atom to form [C₁₀H₇-O-CCl₂]⁺ at m/z 225. This is the base peak, indicating it's a very stable fragment. Observed and confirmed.\n    *   **[C₁₀H₇O]⁺:** Cleavage of the O-CCl₃ bond gives the naphthoxy cation at m/z 143. Observed.\n2.  **Systematic IUPAC Name:** The parent structure is naphthalene. The substituent at position 1 is -OCCl₃, which is named trichloromethoxy.\n\nTherefore, the compound is 1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene.\n\n<<<1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene>>>"
