The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the electronic and steric asymmetry of the bicyclic m端nchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. In this m端nchnone, the C2 terminus of the 1,3-dipole is substituted with a methyl group, while the C5 terminus is a bridgehead carbon as part of the fused pyrrolidine ring. This asymmetry leads to significantly different frontier molecular orbital (HOMO) coefficients at C2 and C5. The reaction with the asymmetric alkyne (methyl propiolate) then proceeds selectively through the single, lower-energy transition state that provides optimal orbital overlap, resulting in the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B).

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the crucial rationale for this conclusion. They act as a control experiment, demonstrating that when the m端nchnone is symmetrically substituted (with methyl groups at both C2 and C5), there is no electronic preference for either orientation of attack. This leads to a complete lack of regioselectivity, forming a 1:1 mixture of products as confirmed by the isotopic labeling study. Therefore, Reactions 1 and 2 prove that the regioselectivity is dependent on the asymmetry of the m端nchnone dipole, a condition that is met in Reaction 3 but not in Reactions 1 and 2.
