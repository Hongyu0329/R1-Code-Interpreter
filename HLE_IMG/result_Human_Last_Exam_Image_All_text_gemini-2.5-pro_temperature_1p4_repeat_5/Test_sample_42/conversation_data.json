    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual elements of the icon:**\n    *   **Subject:** The icon portrays an elderly man with a long, thin, white beard and a receding hairline, consistent with the depiction of an ascetic or a desert father.\n    *   **Halo:** The golden halo around his head signifies that he is a saint.\n    *   **Attire:** He is wearing dark, monastic robes, which reinforces his identity as a monk or hermit.\n    *   **Scroll:** He holds an unrolled scroll with Cyrillic script. In iconography, scrolls often contain a quote from the saint's writings or a passage from scripture relevant to their life or teachings. The presence of a scroll is common for prophets, apostles, and teacher saints.\n    *   **Artistic Style:** The style is expressive and dramatic, with strong lines and a sense of spiritual intensity. The elongated features and stark lighting are characteristic of the work of a master iconographer. The work is a fresco, not a panel icon.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific artwork and artist:**\n    *   This is a very famous and well-documented fresco. A search for \"fresco old monk long beard scroll\" or similar terms, especially in the context of Russian or Byzantine art, quickly identifies the work.\n    *   This fresco is located in the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on Ilyina Street in Veliky Novgorod, Russia.\n    *   It was painted in 1378 by the renowned master painter Theophanes the Greek (Феофан Грек). This artist is famous for his unique, expressive, and spiritually profound style.\n\n3.  **Identify the saint depicted:**\n    *   Art historical sources and museum catalogues universally identify the subject of this specific fresco by Theophanes the Greek as **Saint Simeon Stylites** (Святой Симеон Столпник).\n    *   While Saint Simeon is most famous for living on a pillar (stylos in Greek), and is often depicted on top of it, bust or half-length portraits like this one also exist. In these portraits, the focus is on his ascetic face and spiritual power, rather than the narrative of his life on the pillar.\n    *   The features—the emaciated face, intense gaze, and sparse but long beard—are characteristic of Theophanes' depiction of ascetic saints and are strongly associated with this particular image of Simeon Stylites.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given answer choices:**\n    *   A. Saint Anthony: Often depicted as an elderly monk, but this specific famous work is not of him.\n    *   B. Saint Macarius: Also a Desert Father depicted as an elder, but again, this fresco is identified as Simeon Stylites.\n    *   C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov: Lived much later (18th-19th century) and has a different, distinct iconography (often with a fuller beard, sometimes in white robes, sometimes with a bear).\n    *   D. Moses the Prophet: An Old Testament figure, typically shown with the tablets of the Law, not a scroll of this type. His iconography is different.\n    *   E. Saint Varlaam: While a monastic saint, this specific artwork is not identified as him.\n    *   F. Saint Simeon Stylites: This matches the established identity of this masterpiece by Theophanes the Greek. Despite the absence of his pillar, this is a well-known iconographic representation of him.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the specific artwork as a famous fresco by Theophanes the Greek in Novgorod, the figure depicted is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
