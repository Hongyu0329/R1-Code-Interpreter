    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, leading to the formation of an alkene and a water molecule. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 Â°C) are harsh, suggesting that the reaction proceeds under thermodynamic control, likely involving carbocation intermediates and rearrangements to form the most stable possible product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material (SM):** A saturated pentacyclic alcohol, with the formula C30H52O. The -OH group is at C-3. The core skeleton is a triterpenoid.\n    *   **Product:** An alkene with the formula C30H50, consistent with the loss of one molecule of water. The product has a tetrasubstituted double bond between rings D and E, which is a very stable arrangement. This product is a derivative of oleanene, specifically olean-13(18)-ene. The formation of this product from a saturated precursor involves a significant rearrangement of the carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Propose the Mechanism - The \"Backbone Rearrangement\":** This transformation is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement cascade, often called a \"backbone rearrangement\" in terpene chemistry. It involves a series of sequential [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts.\n\n    *   **Step A: Initiation.** The alcohol at C-3 is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group (-OH2+). This group departs as water, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n    *   **Step B: The Cascade of [1,2]-Shifts.** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and initiates a cascade of shifts to move the positive charge across the molecule, generally forming more stable tertiary carbocations at each step. The sequence is dictated by the stereochemistry of the molecule, as the migrating group and the forming p-orbital must be anti-periplanar.\n        Let's track the migration of the positive charge (+) and the shifting groups. Standard triterpene numbering is used for clarity.\n\n        1.  **C-3(+) formation:** Initial secondary carbocation.\n        2.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** A methyl group from the adjacent quaternary C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge moves to C-4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n            *   *C-4 is now C-4(+).*\n        3.  **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates to C-4(+). The charge moves to C-5 (tertiary).\n            *   *C-5 is now C-5(+).*\n        4.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-10 migrates to C-5(+). The charge moves to C-10 (tertiary).\n            *   *C-10 is now C-10(+).*\n        5.  **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen atom from C-9 migrates to C-10(+). The charge moves to C-9 (tertiary).\n            *   *C-9 is now C-9(+).*\n        6.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-8 migrates to C-9(+). The charge moves to C-8 (tertiary).\n            *   *C-8 is now C-8(+).*\n        7.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8(+). The charge moves to C-14 (tertiary).\n            *   *C-14 is now C-14(+).*\n        8.  **[1,2]-H shift:** A hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to C-14(+). The charge moves to C-13 (tertiary). *(Note: This step requires a specific stereochemistry at the C/D ring junction, which seems to be implied by the drawing, allowing this shift to occur).*\n            *   *C-13 is now C-13(+).*\n\n    *   **Step C: Termination.** The final carbocation at C-13 is stabilized by eliminating a proton from an adjacent carbon. Elimination of a proton from C-18 forms the highly stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Substituents at the Labeled Positions:** Now we trace what group is at each labeled position in the final product. The labels appear to point to substituents at specific backbone carbons. Based on the structure, the most logical assignment is: 1=C-4, 2=C-10, 3=C-9, 4=C-8, 5=C-14.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (at C-4):** C-4 started with two CH3 groups. It lost one CH3 (to C-3) and gained one H (from C-5). Therefore, the substituent that wasn't there originally is the hydrogen. **1 = H**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C-10):** C-10 started with one CH3 group. It lost its CH3 (to C-5) and gained one H (from C-9). The new substituent is a hydrogen. **2 = H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C-9):** C-9 started with one H atom. It lost its H (to C-10) and gained one CH3 group (from C-8). The new substituent is a methyl group. **3 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C-8):** C-8 started with one CH3 group. It lost its CH3 (to C-9) and gained one CH3 group (from C-14). It still has a methyl group, but it's the one that was originally at C-14. **4 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C-14):** C-14 started with one CH3 group. It lost its CH3 (to C-8) and gained one H (from C-13). The new substituent is a hydrogen. **5 = H**.\n\n**Summary of Final Substituents:**\n*   1 = H\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = H, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
