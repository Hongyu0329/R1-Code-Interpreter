    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Experimental Setup**\n*   **Figure A (Map):** We have a viral genome with several open reading frames (ORFs) like E1, E2, L1, L2, etc. There are early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation signals, meaning transcripts can terminate at different points. Splicing can occur to remove introns and join different exons.\n*   **RT-PCR Panels (B-I):** Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is used to amplify specific RNA transcripts. A pair of primers (forward and reverse) defines the region to be amplified.\n    *   The presence of a band indicates that an RNA transcript exists containing both primer binding sites.\n    *   The size of the band tells us the length of the amplified region in the RNA. If this size is smaller than the distance on the genome, it confirms that splicing has occurred.\n    *   Multiple bands for a single primer pair indicate multiple different splice variants (species).\n*   **Special Primers:**\n    *   **E1F2:** Specifically recognizes the splice junction where nucleotide 929 is joined to 3465 (929^3465).\n    *   **E1F3:** Specifically recognizes the splice junction where nucleotide 929 is joined to 3506 (929^3506).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Group of Transcripts**\n\nWe will group the analysis by the final exon region targeted by the reverse primers (E4/E5, L2, and L1).\n\n**Group 1: Early Transcripts (terminating at AE)**\nThese are detected using reverse primers E4R and E5R.\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** Shows two bands (190 bp and 159 bp). This immediately tells us there are **two distinct splice species** in this region.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** Also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). Since the forward primer (E1F1) is the same as in panel B and the reverse primer (E5R) is just downstream of E4R, these two bands correspond to the same two splice species found in B.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** Uses the primer specific for the 929^3465 splice. It shows only one band (551 bp). This size is consistent with band 2 from panel C (553 bp). This allows us to identify one of the species.\n    *   **Species 1:** Contains the 929^3465 splice junction. Detected as band 2 in panels B and C, and the single band in panel D.\n    *   **Species 2:** By elimination, the other species must be the one responsible for band 1 in panels B and C. The text tells us the other known splice acceptor site is at 3506. Thus, this species contains the 929^3506 splice junction.\n*   **Conclusion for Group 1:** We have identified **2 unique splice species** that use the early polyadenylation site.\n\n**Group 2: L2-Containing Transcripts**\nThese are detected using the reverse primer L2R.\n\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** Uses the primer specific for the 929^3465 splice. It shows one band (972 bp). This is a new species, as it connects the E1/E4 region (with the 929^3465 splice) to the L2 region.\n    *   **Species 3:** Contains the 929^3465 splice and an L2 exon.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** Uses the primer specific for the 929^3506 splice. It shows two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). This means there are two different ways to splice from the E1/E4 region (with the 929^3506 splice) to the L2 region.\n    *   **Species 4:** Contains the 929^3506 splice and an L2 exon (long form, 1,003 bp).\n    *   **Species 5:** Contains the 929^3506 splice and an L2 exon (short form, 931 bp).\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** Uses a general E1 primer. It shows one major band at 1,005 bp. This size corresponds to Species 4 (1,003 bp). This doesn't reveal a new species but confirms the existence of Species 4.\n*   **Conclusion for Group 2:** We have identified **3 new, unique splice species** that contain L2.\n\n**Group 3: L1-Containing Transcripts**\nThese are detected using the reverse primer L1R.\n\n*   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** Shows two distinct bands (450 bp and 419 bp). These represent two unique ways to splice the transcript to include the L1 region.\n    *   **Species 6:** Results in a 450 bp product.\n    *   **Species 7:** Results in a 419 bp product.\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** Uses the same primers but more PCR cycles, which can amplify less abundant transcripts. This panel reveals four bands.\n    *   The bands at 450 bp and 419 bp are the same as Species 6 and 7.\n    *   A new band appears at 378 bp. **Species 8.**\n    *   Another new band appears at 187 bp. **Species 9.**\n*   **Conclusion for Group 3:** We have identified **4 new, unique splice species** that contain L1.\n\n**Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the unique species identified from each group:\n*   Group 1 (Early transcripts): 2 species\n*   Group 2 (L2-containing): 3 species\n*   Group 3 (L1-containing): 4 species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
