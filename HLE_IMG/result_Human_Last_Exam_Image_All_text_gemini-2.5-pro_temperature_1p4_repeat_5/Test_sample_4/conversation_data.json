    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Jones polynomial of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\nFirst, we need to identify the knot shown in the diagram. By counting the number of crossings, we find there are 10 crossings. This diagram is famous in knot theory. It is one of the two diagrams that led to the discovery of the \"Perko pair\". These two diagrams were initially thought to represent two different 10-crossing knots, namely 10_161 and 10_162, but were later proven by Kenneth Perko in 1974 to be diagrams of the same knot. This knot is now conventionally known as 10_161 in the Rolfsen knot table. The knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image, which is denoted as 10_162.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which chiral version the diagram represents**\nSince the knot is chiral, it has a Jones polynomial V(t), and its mirror image has the Jones polynomial V(t⁻¹). To determine which of these two knots the diagram represents, we need to calculate the writhe of the diagram. The writhe is the sum of the signs of all crossings in the diagram.\n\nTo calculate the writhe, we first need to assign an orientation to the knot (i.e., a direction of travel along the string). Let's start from the top-most loop and trace the knot in a counter-clockwise direction. We then assign a sign (+1 or -1) to each crossing. A common convention is the right-hand rule: if you point the thumb of your right hand along the direction of the over-strand, the crossing is positive (+1) if the under-strand points in the direction of your fingers, and negative (-1) otherwise. An equivalent method for an oriented diagram: as you travel along the path, if you go over a crossing, it's negative if the strand below passes from left to right, and positive if it passes right to left. If you go under a crossing, it's positive if the strand above passes from right to left, and negative if it passes left to right.\n\nLet's orient the knot by starting at the top-most arc (between crossings C4 and C5) and proceeding to the left. We label the crossings C1 to C10 as in the thought process. The path and crossing signs are determined as follows:\n\n1.  **C4 (Over-crossing):** The path goes left-to-right. The under-strand passes from top-left to bottom-right, which is from left to right relative to our path. Sign = -1.\n2.  **C3 (Under-crossing):** The path goes down. The over-strand passes from right-to-left. Sign = +1.\n3.  **C2 (Under-crossing):** The path goes left. The over-strand passes from bottom-to-top, which is from right to left relative to our path. Sign = +1.\n4.  **C1 (Over-crossing):** The path goes down. The under-strand passes from right-to-left, which is from left to right relative to our path. Sign = -1.\n5.  **C8 (Under-crossing):** The path goes right. The over-strand passes from top-to-bottom, which is from right to left relative to our path. Sign = +1.\n6.  **C9 (Over-crossing):** The path curves up and left. The under-strand passes from bottom-left to top-right, which is from right to left relative to our path. Sign = +1.\n7.  **C7 (Under-crossing):** The path goes down and right. The over-strand passes from left-to-right. Sign = -1.\n8.  **C6 (Over-crossing):** The path curves up and right. The under-strand passes from top-right to bottom-left, which is from left to right relative to our path. Sign = -1.\n9.  **C10 (Over-crossing):** The path goes left. The under-strand passes from top-to-bottom, which is from right to left relative to our path. Sign = +1.\n10. **C5 (Under-crossing):** The path goes up. The over-strand passes from left-to-right, which is from right to left relative to our path. Sign = +1.\n\nSumming the signs: There are 6 positive crossings (C2, C3, C5, C8, C9, C10) and 4 negative crossings (C1, C4, C6, C7).\nThe writhe of the diagram is w = (+6) + (-4) = +2.\n\nBy convention in knot theory, for a chiral knot listed with a positive index number like 10_161, the standard representation is chosen to be the one whose minimal diagram has a negative writhe. A diagram with a positive writhe thus represents its mirror image, 10_162. Therefore, the provided diagram represents the knot 10_162.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Jones Polynomial for the identified knot**\nWe need the Jones polynomial for the knot 10_162. Reliable sources like KnotInfo database or Wolfram MathWorld provide the Jones polynomial for 10_161. Let's denote it as V_10_161(t). The polynomial for its mirror image, 10_162, is then V_10_161(t⁻¹).\n\nThe Jones polynomial for 10_161 is:\nV_10_161(t) = t² - t³ + t⁴ - t⁵ + t⁶ - t⁷ + t⁸\n\nNow, we compute the polynomial for 10_162 by substituting t with t⁻¹:\nV_10_162(t) = V_10_161(t⁻¹) = (t⁻¹)² - (t⁻¹)³ + (t⁻¹)⁴ - (t⁻¹)⁵ + (t⁻¹)⁶ - (t⁻¹)⁷ + (t⁻¹)⁸\nV_10_162(t) = t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁷ + t⁻⁸\n\n**Step 4: Format the answer**\nThe question asks for the polynomial `p(t)` in decreasing degree order. The term with the highest degree is t⁻².\n\np(t) = t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁷ + t⁻⁸\n\n<<<t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4 - t^-5 + t^-6 - t^-7 + t^-8>>>"
