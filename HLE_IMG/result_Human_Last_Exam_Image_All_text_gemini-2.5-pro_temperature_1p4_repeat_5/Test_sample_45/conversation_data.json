    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how a shape or pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain amount around a central point. An object has n-fold rotational symmetry if it maps onto itself after a rotation of 360/n degrees. We are looking for the highest value of 'n' for which this is true for the entire tiling pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to identify points in the tiling around which we can rotate the pattern and have it look unchanged. Let's examine the different geometric shapes and their arrangements:\n*   The centers of the dark blue hexagons.\n*   The centers of the light yellow squares.\n*   The meeting points (vertices) of the tiles.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetry at the Center of a Hexagon**\nLet's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n*   The hexagon itself is a regular hexagon, which has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, etc.).\n*   Now, let's look at the tiles surrounding the hexagon. Each of the hexagon's six sides is adjacent to an identical light yellow, irregular pentagon. This creates a larger star-shaped or flower-like motif (a rosette).\n*   If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° (which is 360°/6) around the center of the blue hexagon, the hexagon itself will land back in its original footprint. Critically, each of the surrounding pentagons will move exactly into the position of its neighbor.\n*   Extending this observation to the entire tiling, we can see that a 60° rotation around the center of any blue hexagon will map the entire pattern perfectly onto itself.\n*   This confirms that the tiling has at least 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Other Potential Centers (for completeness)**\n*   **Center of a Square:** If we choose the center of one of the light yellow squares, we can see that a rotation of 90° (360°/4) maps the square and its surrounding tiles onto themselves. This means the tiling also has points of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Midpoint of an edge between two hexagons:** At this point, two hexagons and two pentagons meet. A rotation of 180° (360°/2) around this point maps the pattern onto itself. This is a point of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Symmetry of the Tiling**\nWhen describing the rotational symmetry of a tiling, we refer to the highest order of rotational symmetry that exists anywhere in the pattern. In this case, we have found points of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry. The highest order is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe presence of centers of 6-fold rotation (at the center of each blue hexagon) defines the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling. The pattern is unchanged by a rotation of 60 degrees.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
