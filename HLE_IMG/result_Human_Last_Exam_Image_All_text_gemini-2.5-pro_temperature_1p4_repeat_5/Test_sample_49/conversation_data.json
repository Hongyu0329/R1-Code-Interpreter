    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the filter whose output is the voltage at node $a_0$. For a simple RC filter, the cutoff frequency is determined by the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$, and the cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi) = 1/(2\\pi R_{th}C)$. Our main task is to find the Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from the terminals of the capacitor $C$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground ($b_0$), after deactivating all independent sources. The input source at \"IN\" (node $c_0$) is deactivated by shorting it to ground.\n\n**3. Decomposing the Resistance Calculation**\nLet's analyze the circuit diagram to find the resistance between $a_0$ and ground ($c_0$ is now ground).\n- Node $a_0$ is connected to node $d_1$ through a resistor $r$.\n- The rest of the network is connected from node $d_1$ onwards.\nTherefore, the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ can be expressed as the sum of the resistor $r$ and the equivalent resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$).\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1, \\text{gnd}}$\nwhere $R_{d1, \\text{gnd}}$ is the resistance between node $d_1$ and the ground reference at $c_0$.\n\n**4. Simplifying the Infinite Ladder**\nThe network extending from nodes $c_1, d_1$ upwards to $c_\\infty, d_\\infty$ is an infinite, uniform ladder network. This infinite section can be replaced by its characteristic impedance, which is the impedance seen looking into the terminals of an infinitely long ladder. We need the differential characteristic impedance, $Z_{diff}$, which is the resistance measured between the two rails ($c_1$ and $d_1$ in this case) of the infinite ladder. Let's call this resistance $R_{up}$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Characteristic Impedance ($R_{up} = Z_{diff}$)**\nWe can calculate $Z_{diff}$ using an odd-mode analysis.\n- **Odd mode:** We assume the voltages on the two rails are equal and opposite: $V_{cn} = -V_{dn}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n- Due to this symmetry, the voltage at the midpoint of each horizontal \"rung\" resistor `r` is zero (`(V_{cn} + V_{dn})/2 = 0`).\n- This means we can analyze one rail (e.g., the 'd' rail) as an infinite ladder where each node $d_n$ has a series resistor $r$ connecting to $d_{n-1}$ and a shunt resistor of value $r/2$ connecting to a virtual ground.\n- The input impedance of this odd-mode half-circuit, let's call it $Z_{odd}$, looking into node $d_1$, can be found using a recurrence relation. The impedance `Z` looking into any node of this infinite ladder is the same.\n$Z_{odd} = r + (Z_{odd} \\parallel \\frac{r}{2}) = r + \\frac{Z_{odd} \\cdot (r/2)}{Z_{odd} + r/2}$\n$Z_{odd} = r + \\frac{r Z_{odd}}{2Z_{odd} + r}$\n- Multiplying by $(2Z_{odd} + r)$:\n$Z_{odd}(2Z_{odd} + r) = r(2Z_{odd} + r) + r Z_{odd}$\n$2Z_{odd}^2 + r Z_{odd} = 2r Z_{odd} + r^2 + r Z_{odd}$\n$2Z_{odd}^2 - 2r Z_{odd} - r^2 = 0$\n- Solving this quadratic equation for $Z_{odd}$:\n$Z_{odd} = \\frac{-(-2r) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2r)^2 - 4(2)(-r^2)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{4} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{4} = \\frac{2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{4}$\n- Since resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$Z_{odd} = \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{2}$\n- The total differential impedance between the two rails is twice the odd-mode impedance:\n$R_{up} = Z_{diff} = 2 \\cdot Z_{odd} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**6. Calculating $R_{d1, \\text{gnd}}$**\nNow we can calculate the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$). The upper part of the ladder has been replaced by the single resistor $R_{up} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$ connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$. The path from $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$) is through $R_{up}$ to node $c_1$, and then through the resistor $r$ between $c_1$ and $c_0$. These two resistances are in series.\n$R_{d1, \\text{gnd}} = R_{up} + r = r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + r = r(1 + \\sqrt{3} + 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**7. Calculating the Final Thevenin Resistance $R_{th}$**\nNow we can substitute this result back into our expression for $R_{th}$.\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1, \\text{gnd}} = r + r(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = r(1 + 2 + \\sqrt{3}) = r(3 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**8. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can find the cutoff frequency. Let's express it as the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(3 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(3 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$. Usually, this refers to the formula for the frequency. We will provide the expression for $f_c$.\n\n<<<f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi rC(3 + \\sqrt{3})}>>>"
