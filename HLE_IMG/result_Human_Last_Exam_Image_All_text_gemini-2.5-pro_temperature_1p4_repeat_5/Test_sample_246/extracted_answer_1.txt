Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy ball on the twig is a woolly oak gall, which is created by a gall wasp (*Callirhytis seminator*). The gall itself is a nursery that grew around the larvae from eggs that were previously laid in the twig. The adult wasps that mature inside and emerge from this gall will lay their eggs on the major veins of the oak leaves.
