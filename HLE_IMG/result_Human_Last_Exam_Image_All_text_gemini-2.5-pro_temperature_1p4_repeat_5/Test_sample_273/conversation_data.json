    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label the chiral carbons from left to right for easier reference.\n*   **C2:** The leftmost chiral carbon, bonded to -OH, -CH3, -H (implicit), and the rest of the molecule (the C3 group).\n*   **C3:** The middle chiral carbon, bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), -H (implicit), the C2 group, and the C4 group.\n*   **C4:** The rightmost chiral carbon, bonded to a -CH2NH2 group, a -CH3 group, -H (implicit), and the C3 group.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\nPriorities are assigned based on the atomic number of the atoms directly attached to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\n**Analysis of C2 (leftmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Substituents:** -OH, -C3 group, -CH3, -H.\n2.  **Priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3 group (-CH(Et)C4...). The carbon is bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen.\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (Methyl). The carbon is bonded to three hydrogens.\n    *   Priority 4: -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n    (Comparing group 2 and 3: C vs C is a tie. We look at the next atoms. C3 is bonded to C, C, H. The methyl C is bonded to H, H, H. C beats H, so the C3 group is priority 2).\n3.  **Determine Configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The structure at C2 shows the -OH group (1) on a wedge (pointing forward) and the -CH3 group (3) on a dash (pointing backward). The bond to the C3 group (2) and the implicit -H (4) are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   To determine the configuration, the lowest priority group (4, -H) should be pointing away. Since it is in the plane, we can use a swap method. Let's swap the positions of group 4 (-H) and group 3 (-CH3).\n    *   After swapping, group 4 is now pointing away (dashed). Group 1 (-OH) is forward, group 2 (-C3) is in the plane, and group 3 (-CH3) is now in the plane.\n    *   Viewing the molecule with group 4 pointing away, the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH -> -C3 group -> -CH3) traces a counter-clockwise path.\n    *   A counter-clockwise path indicates an (S) configuration. However, since we performed one swap, we must invert the result.\n    *   Therefore, the absolute configuration at C2 is **(R)**.\n\n**Analysis of C3 (middle chiral center):**\n1.  **Substituents:** -C2 group, -C4 group, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H.\n2.  **Priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -C2 group (-CH(OH)CH3). The C is bonded to (O, C, H).\n    *   Priority 2: -C4 group (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2). The C is bonded to (C, C, H). (The carbon in the CH2NH2 group is bonded to N, giving this group higher precedence than the ethyl group's next carbon).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (Ethyl). The first C is bonded to (C, H, H).\n    *   Priority 4: -H.\n    (Comparing group 1 and 2: The C of the C2 group is bonded to an Oxygen, while the C of the C4 group is bonded to other Carbons. O > C, so the C2 group is priority 1).\n3.  **Determine Configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The structure at C3 shows the ethyl group (3) on a wedge (forward). This implies the lowest priority group, -H (4), is on a dash (backward).\n    *   With the lowest priority group pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration by looking at the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from the C2 group (1, left) to the C4 group (2, right) and then to the ethyl group (3, up and forward) is a **clockwise** direction.\n    *   Therefore, the absolute configuration at C3 is **(R)**.\n\n**Analysis of C4 (rightmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Substituents:** -CH2NH2, -C3 group, -CH3, -H.\n2.  **Priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2. The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen (Z=7).\n    *   Priority 2: -C3 group. The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3. The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    *   Priority 4: -H.\n    (Comparing group 1 and 2: C vs C is a tie. For group 1, the next atoms are (N, H, H). For group 2, the next atoms are (C, C, H). Since N has a higher atomic number than C, the -CH2NH2 group is priority 1).\n3.  **Determine Configuration (R/S):**\n    *   The structure at C4 shows the -CH2NH2 group (1) on a wedge (forward) and the -CH3 group (3) on a dash (backward). The bond to the C3 group (2) and the implicit -H (4) are in the plane.\n    *   This is the same situation as C2. We swap group 4 (-H) and group 3 (-CH3).\n    *   After swapping, group 4 is now pointing away. Group 1 (-CH2NH2) is forward, group 2 (-C3 group) is in the plane, and group 3 (-CH3) is in the plane.\n    *   Viewing the molecule with group 4 pointing away, the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 (-CH2NH2 -> -C3 group -> -CH3) traces a **clockwise** path.\n    *   A clockwise path indicates an (R) configuration. Because we performed a swap, we must invert the result.\n    *   Therefore, the absolute configuration at C4 is **(S)**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining the configurations for the three chiral centers from left to right (C2, C3, C4):\n*   C2 is (R)\n*   C3 is (R)\n*   C4 is (S)\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S), assuming numbering from left to right.\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
