    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1).\n\n**2. Define the Calculation Formula**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT) * 100%`\n\n**3. Strategy: Calculate Total VMT for Each Scenario**\nTo find the total VMT for each scenario, we need to calculate the VMT for each trip distance category and then sum them up. We can calculate a relative VMT value (e.g., average VMT per 100 trips) since the total number of trips is not given and will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\nThe VMT for any given distance category is calculated as:\n`(Share of total trips) x (Share of car trips in that category) x (Average trip distance)`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Car VMT:** This refers to *Vehicle* Miles Traveled, not Person Miles Traveled. Therefore, we must sum the shares of both car categories ('car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') to find the total share of vehicle trips made by car. The 'Average Carpool Occupancy' figures are not needed for this calculation.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** The 'share of total trips' acts as a weight for each distance category. We cannot simply average the mode shares.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**Step A: Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\n1.  **Find the total share of car trips for each distance category in Table 1 (Baseline):**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (carpool) = 53%\n    *   **3-5 miles:** 38% (1 occupant) + 43% (carpool) = 81%\n    *   **5-10 miles:** 40% (1 occupant) + 45% (carpool) = 85%\n    *   **10+ miles:** 42% (1 occupant) + 47% (carpool) = 89%\n\n2.  **Calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category:**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** `0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544`\n    *   **3-5 miles:** `0.22 (share of trips) * 0.81 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.7128`\n    *   **5-10 miles:** `0.14 (share of trips) * 0.85 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.8925`\n    *   **10+ miles:** `0.16 (share of trips) * 0.89 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 2.8480`\n\n3.  **Sum the contributions to find the total relative Baseline VMT:**\n    *   `Baseline VMT = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step B: Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\n1.  **Find the total share of car trips for each distance category in Table 2 (Proposed):**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** 1% (1 occupant) + 2% (carpool) = 3%\n    *   **3-5 miles:** 8% (1 occupant) + 19% (carpool) = 27%\n    *   **5-10 miles:** 14% (1 occupant) + 27% (carpool) = 41%\n    *   **10+ miles:** 16% (1 occupant) + 33% (carpool) = 49%\n\n2.  **Calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category:**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** `0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144`\n    *   **3-5 miles:** `0.22 (share of trips) * 0.27 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.2376`\n    *   **5-10 miles:** `0.14 (share of trips) * 0.41 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.4305`\n    *   **10+ miles:** `0.16 (share of trips) * 0.49 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 1.5680`\n\n3.  **Sum the contributions to find the total relative Proposed VMT:**\n    *   `Proposed VMT = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n1.  **Calculate the absolute reduction in VMT:**\n    *   `VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n\n2.  **Calculate the percentage reduction:**\n    *   `Percentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n    *   `Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 = 52.195%`\n\n3.  **Round to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., one decimal place):**\n    *   `52.2%`\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
