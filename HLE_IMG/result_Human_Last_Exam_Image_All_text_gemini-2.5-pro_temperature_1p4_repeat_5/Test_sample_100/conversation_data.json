    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Based on its structure, it is a derivative of an aza-norbornene system. A reasonable assignment for the core structure is **2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one**.\n*   The nitrogen atom (at position 2) is protected with a **p-methoxybenzyl (PMB)** group.\n*   A **trifluoromethyl (CF3)** group is attached to the double bond (at position 5 or 6).\n*   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    *   **PMB group:** -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. The formula for this group is C8H9O.\n    *   **Core structure:** `6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`. Let's count the atoms of the parent bicyclic lactam C6H7NO and then substitute.\n        *   Norbornene has a formula C7H10. Replacing a CH2 with NH gives azanorbornene C6H9N. Making it a lactam (adding C=O, removing 2H) gives C6H7NO. Substituting a hydrogen on the double bond with CF3 removes one H and adds CF3, giving C6H6(CF3)NO.\n        *   Alternatively, let's count directly from the presumed structure:\n            *   Carbons in the core: 6 (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7).\n            *   Hydrogens on the core: H at C1, H at C4, CH2 at C7, H at C5 (assuming CF3 is at C6). Total H on carbon skeleton = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n            *   The core with substituents except PMB is C6H5(CF3)NO. Adding the C from CF3, it's C7H5F3NO.\n    *   **Total molecular formula of Starting Material:** We combine the core `C6H5(CF3)NO` with the PMB group `C8H9O` attached to the nitrogen.\n        *   C: 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n        *   H: 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB ether) = 2\n        *   So, the starting material's formula is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**2. Reaction 1: PMB Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from alcohols and amines. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We remove the PMB group (C8H9O).\n    *   We add one hydrogen atom (H) to the nitrogen.\n    *   Net change: -(C8H9O) + H = -C8H8O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**3. Reaction 2: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The lactam carbonyl and the CF3 group are stable under these mild conditions.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The reaction involves the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2) across the double bond.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   The formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**4. Reaction 3: Lactam Hydrolysis**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are acidic hydrolysis conditions. The lactam (a cyclic amide) will be hydrolyzed. The amide bond (C-N) within the ring will break, opening the ring.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Hydrolysis of an amide consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2). In the acidic medium, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+), but for calculating the molecular formula of the neutral product, we consider it as -NH2.\n    *   Net change: addition of H2O.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of the formulas:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Final Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
