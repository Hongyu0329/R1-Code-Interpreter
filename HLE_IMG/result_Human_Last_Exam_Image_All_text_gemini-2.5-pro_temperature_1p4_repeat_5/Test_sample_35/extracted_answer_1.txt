The protein S100B shows a strong affinity for the **V domain** of its target receptor, **RAGE**. It could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. This is because the S100B protein is not merely associated with the disease but is an active trigger in the pathological cascade. As shown in the diagram, its binding to RAGE initiates downstream signaling that leads directly to key events driving disease progression, such as neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neuronal loss. Therefore, the level of S100B expression can directly predict the severity and future course of the neurodegenerative disease, fulfilling the role of a prognostic marker.
