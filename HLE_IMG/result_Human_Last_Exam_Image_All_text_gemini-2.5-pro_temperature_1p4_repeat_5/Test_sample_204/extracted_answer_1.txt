The order of increasing silicate structure complexity is C, A, B, D. Specimen C is olivine (nesosilicate, isolated tetrahedra), Specimen A is a pyroxene or amphibole (inosilicate, chain silicate), Specimen B is a mica or chlorite (phyllosilicate, sheet silicate), and Specimen D is quartz (tectosilicate, framework silicate).
