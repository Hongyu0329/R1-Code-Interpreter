    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\nTo identify the rocks, we will examine their key characteristics, such as texture (crystal size, shape, and arrangement), color, and composition based on visual cues.\n\n**Specimen H**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Color.** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, bubbly appearance. The holes are called vesicles. This vesicular texture indicates that gas was trapped in the rock as it cooled quickly from a molten state. The underlying rock material appears fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Step 2: Determine Rock Type.** The fine-grained and vesicular texture points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock, which forms from lava cooling on the Earth's surface.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Specific Rock.** A reddish, highly vesicular, mafic to intermediate volcanic rock is known as **scoria**. It is sometimes called volcanic cinder. It is denser than pumice and typically does not float in water.\n*   **Identification: Scoria**\n\n**Specimen I**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Composition and Texture.** This rock is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments of different sizes and types, which are cemented together by a finer-grained material (matrix). This is a clastic texture.\n*   **Step 2: Examine the Shape of the Fragments (Clasts).** The fragments are notably sharp-edged and angular. They have not been significantly rounded by erosion or transport.\n*   **Step 3: Determine Rock Type and Identify.** A clastic rock made of large, angular fragments is classified as a **breccia**. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. Breccias can be either sedimentary (formed from landslides or faulting) or volcanic (formed from explosive eruptions).\n*   **Identification: Breccia**\n\n**Specimen J**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Color.** This rock is very light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is extremely vesicular. The vesicles are very small and numerous, giving the rock a frothy, foam-like appearance.\n*   **Step 2: Determine Rock Type.** The glassy, frothy texture is characteristic of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled so rapidly there was no time for crystals to form. The high volume of trapped gas bubbles makes it very low in density.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Specific Rock.** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is known as **pumice**. It is famous for its ability to float on water.\n*   **Identification: Pumice**\n\n**Specimen K**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** This rock is composed entirely of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Mineral Composition.** We can see several different minerals. There are large, blocky, light-colored crystals (likely feldspar) and possibly some glassy gray crystals (quartz) and darker minerals.\n*   **Step 3: Determine Rock Type and Identify.** A coarse-grained igneous rock that cooled slowly underground is an intrusive (plutonic) rock. When the crystals are exceptionally large, as they appear here, the rock is specifically called a **pegmatite**. Pegmatites are compositionally similar to granite but are defined by their very large crystal size.\n*   **Identification: Pegmatite**\n\n**Summary of Identifications**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
