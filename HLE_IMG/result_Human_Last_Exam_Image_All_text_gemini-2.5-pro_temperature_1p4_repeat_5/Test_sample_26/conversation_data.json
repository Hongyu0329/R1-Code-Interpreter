    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Measure and Determine the Key**\nFirst, we locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The measure numbers are indicated at the beginning of each line. The second system on the page starts at measure 28. Measure 30 is the third measure in this system. The key signature for the movement is C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭). Roman numeral analysis will be done in relation to this tonic key.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\nWe need to identify all the unique pitches present in measure 30 across both the treble and bass clefs.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of sixteenth notes: F♯, A, C, E♭, C, A, F♯, A.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays two staccato eighth-note chords. Both chords consist of the notes D and F♯.\nCombining all the notes from both hands, the pitch collection for this measure is: **D, F♯, A, C, E♭**.\n\n**Step 3: Build the Chord and Identify its Quality**\nTo identify the chord and its root, we arrange the notes into a stack of thirds.\n*   Starting with D as the root: D - F♯ - A - C - E♭.\n*   The notes D-F♯-A form a **D major triad**.\n*   Adding the C (a minor seventh above the root D) makes it a **D dominant seventh chord (D7)**.\n*   Adding the E♭ (a minor ninth above the root D) makes it a **D dominant seventh with a lowered ninth (D7♭9)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Harmonic Function (Roman Numeral)**\nNow we must determine the function of this D7(♭9) chord within the key of C minor.\n*   In C minor, the dominant chord (V) is G major. Its dominant seventh is G7 (G-B-D-F).\n*   The chord in measure 30, D7(♭9), is the dominant of G. A dominant chord that resolves to a chord other than the tonic is known as a **secondary dominant** or **applied dominant**.\n*   Since the D7 chord is the dominant of the G chord, and the G chord is the V of C minor, the D7 chord functions as the \"dominant of the dominant\".\n*   This relationship is notated in Roman numerals as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n*   To be more precise about the chord's quality (a dominant seventh), we notate it as **V7/V**. The ♭9 alteration is a coloristic detail and doesn't change its fundamental function as V7/V. The chord strongly prepares the listener for the G chord that appears soon after (in measure 33), reinforcing its role as the dominant of the dominant.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Chromaticism:** The F♯ is a chromatic alteration. It is not in the key of C minor. Its presence is the strongest clue that this is a secondary dominant, as F♯ is the leading tone to G.\n*   **Chord Inversion:** The chord is in root position, with the root D clearly stated in the bass.\n*   **Context:** The measures leading up to m. 30 (like m. 29) contain a G7 chord, which is the V7 of C minor. The V7/V chord in m. 30 creates a brief, powerful harmonic departure that intensifies the eventual return to the dominant (G7) and, subsequently, the tonic (C minor).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe chord in measure 30 is a D dominant seventh with a flat nine (D7♭9). Its function in the key of C minor is the dominant of the dominant. The correct Roman numeral is V7/V.\n\n<<<V7/V>>>"
