    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus ***Ptychomnion***.\n\nThe plant's distinctive appearance, with robust, creeping stems and tightly overlapping, wavy or pleated leaves, gives it a braided look that is characteristic of the *Ptychomnion* genus. When dry, this moss often resembles a pipe cleaner, a common name given to *Ptychomnion aciculare*. This genus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often forming extensive mats on the ground, fallen logs, or as an epiphyte. While other mosses like those in the *Hypnum* or *Ptilium* genera can have overlapping or feather-like appearances, the specific combination of the robust, braided or pipe-cleaner form with transversely wrinkled leaves is a hallmark of *Ptychomnion*.\n\n<<<Ptychomnion>>>"
