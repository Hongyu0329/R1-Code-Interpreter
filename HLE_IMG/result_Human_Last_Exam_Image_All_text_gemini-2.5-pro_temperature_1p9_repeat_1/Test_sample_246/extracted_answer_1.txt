Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in this image. The large, white, fuzzy ball on the twig is an insect gall, specifically a Wool Sower Gall, created by a cynipid gall wasp. The female wasp lays her eggs by injecting them directly into the tissue of the young oak twig. The gall then forms around the developing larvae, so the eggs were laid at the center of the gall structure seen in the image.
