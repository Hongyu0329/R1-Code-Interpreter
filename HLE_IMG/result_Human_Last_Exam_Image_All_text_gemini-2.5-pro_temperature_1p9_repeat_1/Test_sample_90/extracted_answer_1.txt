*Simplified sketch:* A pyrrolizidine ring system where the nitrogen (position 4) is acetylated. At position 3 (a bridgehead), there is a 1-pyrroline substituent. The other five-membered ring of the pyrrolizidine system contains a double bond between C1 and C2, with a methoxycarbonyl group at C2.

**Product B:**
A complex rearranged tricyclic lactam. The IUPAC name is methyl 4-oxo-1,2,3,4,9,9a-hexahydro-5H-pyrrolo[1',2':1,5]pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-6-carboxylate.

*Simplified sketch:* A tricyclic structure composed of a central pyridine ring fused to two different pyrrolidine rings. One of the pyrrolidine rings is part of a lactam system. There is a double bond within the pyridine ring, and it is substituted with a methoxycarbonyl group.

**Product C:**
The N-acetylated starting material. The structure is 1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
