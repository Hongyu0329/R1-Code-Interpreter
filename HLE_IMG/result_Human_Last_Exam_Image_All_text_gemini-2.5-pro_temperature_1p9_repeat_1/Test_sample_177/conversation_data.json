    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) travel patterns to the Proposed (Table 2) patterns.\n\n**1. Understand the Calculation for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)**\nVMT is the total mileage traveled by vehicles. To calculate the total VMT for cars, we need to consider how many trips are made by car and the distance of those trips. The calculation for total Car VMT can be expressed as a sum over all distance categories:\n`Total Car VMT = Σ [ (Total Trips in Category) × (Car Mode Share in Category) × (Average Distance of Category) ]`\n\nSince we are interested in a percentage change, we can calculate a proportional VMT for each scenario, assuming a base of 100 total trips for simplicity, or just work with the given proportions.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Key Data**\n*   **Car VMT:** Includes both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We must sum their mode shares.\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" (2.8 and 3) is used for calculating Person Miles Traveled (PMT), not Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), and should be ignored.\n*   **Constants:** The \"share of total trips\" by distance and the \"Average trip distance\" are the same for both scenarios.\n    *   Share of Trips: 48% (0-3 mi), 22% (3-5 mi), 14% (5-10 mi), 16% (10+ mi)\n    *   Average Distance: 1 mi, 4 mi, 7.5 mi, 20 mi for the respective categories.\n*   **The calculation must be weighted.** We cannot simply average the percentages. We must calculate the VMT for each distance segment and then sum them.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT (Table 1)**\nWe will calculate the proportional VMT for each distance category and sum them. The formula for each category's contribution is: `(Share of Trips) × (Total Car Share) × (Avg Distance)`.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** `0.48 × (0.25 + 0.28) × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544`\n*   **3-5 miles:** `0.22 × (0.38 + 0.43) × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128`\n*   **5-10 miles:** `0.14 × (0.40 + 0.45) × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925`\n*   **10+ miles:** `0.16 × (0.42 + 0.47) × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480`\n\n**Total Baseline VMT (proportional) =** `0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT (Table 2)**\nWe repeat the calculation with the new car mode shares from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** `0.48 × (0.01 + 0.02) × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144`\n*   **3-5 miles:** `0.22 × (0.08 + 0.19) × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376`\n*   **5-10 miles:** `0.14 × (0.14 + 0.27) × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305`\n*   **10+ miles:** `0.16 × (0.16 + 0.33) × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680`\n\n**Total Proposed VMT (proportional) =** `0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100`.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction in Car VMT is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
