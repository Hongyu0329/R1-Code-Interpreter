    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification and Initial Observation:** The image displays a medallion, likely made of a precious metal like gold, given the fine detail and high-relief work. It is circular with a tab for suspension, indicating it was probably worn as a large pendant. The central motif consists of two busts in profile facing each other (a style sometimes called \"confronted busts\").\n\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:** The most striking feature is on the figure to the left: a large, curved ram's horn emerging from his temple. In the context of ancient Mediterranean art, this is a powerful and specific symbol. It is the attribute of the syncretic Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon (or Jupiter-Ammon in the Roman period).\n\n3.  **Historical Context of the Iconography:** The iconography of the ruler with the horns of Ammon was popularized by Alexander the Great after he visited the Oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis and was hailed as the son of the deity. Following his death, many of the Hellenistic kings who succeeded him adopted this imagery on their coinage and in their royal portraiture to associate themselves with Alexander's divine status and power. This firmly places the object within the Hellenistic period (roughly 323 B.C. to 31 B.C.).\n\n4.  **Artistic Style and Provenance:** The artistic style, with its blend of realistic portraiture and idealized divine attributes, is characteristic of Hellenistic court art. This specific medallion is a famous archaeological artifact known as the **Taman Medallion**. It was discovered in the Anapa kurgan on the Taman Peninsula, a region on the Black Sea that was part of the Hellenistic world (specifically, the Bosporan Kingdom).\n\n5.  **Specific Dating:** Scholars have identified the figures on the medallion as the Hellenistic king **Pharnaces I of Pontus** and his queen Nysa. King Pharnaces I reigned from approximately c. 190 B.C. to c. 159 B.C. This historical identification aligns perfectly with the style and iconography of the piece.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the reign of Pharnaces I falls entirely within the 2nd century B.C. (200 B.C. to 101 B.C.), archaeologists and art historians confidently ascribe this medallion to that period.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish from Roman Period:** While the Romans also revered Jupiter-Ammon, the style of royal portraiture featuring confronted busts and Ammon horns is most strongly associated with the Hellenistic kingdoms that followed Alexander.\n*   **Significance of Horns:** The horns are not just decorative; they are a direct claim to divinity and a specific link to the legacy of Alexander the Great.\n*   **Geographical Location:** The find spot in the Black Sea region highlights the vast extent of Hellenistic cultural influence, reaching far beyond Greece and Egypt.\n*   **Dating Precision:** Identifying the ruler as Pharnaces I allows for a more precise dating than just \"Hellenistic period,\" narrowing it down to the 2nd century B.C.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis of the object's iconography (Zeus-Ammon horns), artistic style (Hellenistic royal portraiture), and specific historical identification (King Pharnaces I, reigned c. 190â€“159 B.C.) all converge to place its creation within the 2nd century B.C.\n\n<<<2nd century B.C.>>>"
