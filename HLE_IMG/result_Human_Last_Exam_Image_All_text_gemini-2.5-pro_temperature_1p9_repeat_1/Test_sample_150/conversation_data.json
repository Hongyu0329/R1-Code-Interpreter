    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂CO⁺), which is a strong electrophile. The benzene ring attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Formula: C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivator. It directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position. The Br₂/FeBr₃ reagent system generates an electrophilic \"Br⁺\" species.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is **3-bromopropiophenone** (or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at the meta-position (C-3) on the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (hydrogen gas over palladium catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction reduces the ketone functional group. For aryl ketones (where the carbonyl is directly attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst typically reduces the ketone completely to an alkane (a CH₂ group). This is known as hydrogenolysis. The C=O is first reduced to a C-OH, and then the C-OH bond (being benzylic) is cleaved and replaced with a C-H bond.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the 1 and 3 positions, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to the Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination (Wohl-Ziegler Reaction).\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (a non-polar solvent).\n*   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents is used for selective bromination at the most reactive C-H bond, which is typically an allylic or **benzylic** position. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the CH₂ group directly attached to the phenyl ring. A hydrogen atom from this carbon is abstracted to form a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, which then reacts with bromine.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogens at the benzylic position.\n    *   Structure: `(m-Br-C₆H₄)-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   Name: The parent alkane chain is propane. At carbon 1, there is a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group. The name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\nSummary of Structures:\n*   **Start:** Benzene\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
