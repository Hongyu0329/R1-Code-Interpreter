    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$ which goes to ground. This configuration forms a simple RC low-pass filter. The cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, for such a filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the resistance of the circuit connected to the capacitor, looking into node $a_0$. Standard procedure for finding Thévenin resistance requires setting all independent sources to zero. The input signal `IN` is at node $g_0$. Assuming it is a voltage source, we set it to zero by connecting node $g_0$ to ground. The node labeling in the diagram indicates that $a_0$ is the same as $d_0$, and $g_0$ is the same as $c_0$.\nSo, we need to find the equivalent resistance between nodes $d_0$ and $c_0$ of the infinite ladder network. Let's call this $R_{d_0, c_0}$.\n$R_{th} = R_{d_0, c_0}$\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe network is an infinite ladder made of identical square cells of resistors, each with resistance $r$. The cell for index $i$ ($i \\ge 1$) consists of four nodes: $c_{i-1}, d_{i-1}, c_i, d_i$. However, a careful look at the repeating pattern shows a cell from $(c_i, d_i)$ to $(c_{i+1}, d_{i+1})$ connected by two vertical resistors, with a horizontal resistor bridging $(c_i, d_i)$. The first cell is slightly different at the base $(c_0, d_0)$.\nTo find the resistance $R_{d_0, c_0}$, we can imagine applying a current source $I$ that injects current into $d_0$ and extracts it from $c_0$. Then $R_{d_0, c_0} = V_{d_0, c_0} / I = (V_{d_0} - V_{c_0}) / I$.\n\n**Step 4: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Circuit**\nThe ladder network is perfectly symmetric with respect to its two main rails (the `c`-rail and the `d`-rail). The excitation we are applying (current `I` into `d_0` and `-I` into `c_0`) is anti-symmetric. Due to the combination of a symmetric network and anti-symmetric excitation, the voltage response will also be anti-symmetric. This means:\n$v_{c_n} = -v_{d_n}$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\nA key consequence of this anti-symmetry is that the midpoint of each horizontal resistor (connecting $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$) must be at zero potential. This allows us to place a virtual ground at the midpoint of each of these resistors without affecting the circuit.\nBy doing so, each horizontal resistor of value $r$ becomes two resistors of value $r/2$, each connected to this virtual ground. This effectively decouples the `c`-rail from the `d`-rail.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the Decoupled Ladder**\nLet's focus on the `d`-rail ladder. It's now a single-rail ladder with:\n1.  A semi-infinite chain of series resistors `r` (from $d_0$ to $d_1$, $d_1$ to $d_2$, and so on).\n2.  At each node $d_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$), there is a shunt resistor of value $r/2$ connected to ground.\n\nWe need to find the input resistance of this `d`-chain, as seen from node $d_0$. Let's call it $R_{d-chain}$.\n$R_{d-chain} = \\frac{v_{d_0}}{I}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Characteristic Impedance**\nThe `d`-chain consists of the first series resistor (between $d_0$ and $d_1$) and the rest of the infinite chain starting from $d_1$. Let $Z_L$ be the characteristic impedance of the infinite chain starting from node $d_1$. Because the chain is infinite, the impedance looking into node $d_2$ is also $Z_L$.\nThe impedance $Z_L$ (looking into $d_1$) is the parallel combination of the shunt resistor $r/2$ and the series combination of the next resistor `r` and the rest of the chain $Z_L$.\nSo, we can write the equation for $Z_L$:\n$Z_L = \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right) \\parallel (r + Z_L)$\n$Z_L = \\frac{\\frac{r}{2}(r+Z_L)}{\\frac{r}{2} + r + Z_L} = \\frac{\\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r}{2}Z_L}{\\frac{3r}{2} + Z_L}$\n$Z_L \\left(\\frac{3r}{2} + Z_L\\right) = \\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r}{2}Z_L$\n$\\frac{3r}{2}Z_L + Z_L^2 = \\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r}{2}Z_L$\n$Z_L^2 + r Z_L - \\frac{r^2}{2} = 0$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for $Z_L$:\n$Z_L = \\frac{-r \\pm \\sqrt{r^2 - 4(1)(-\\frac{r^2}{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-r \\pm \\sqrt{r^2 + 2r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-r \\pm \\sqrt{3r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-r \\pm r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\nSince resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$Z_L = \\frac{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculating the Total Thévenin Resistance**\nThe input resistance of the `d`-chain, $R_{d-chain}$, is the sum of the first resistor `r` (between $d_0$ and $d_1$) and the characteristic impedance $Z_L$ at node $d_1$.\n$R_{d-chain} = r + Z_L = r + \\frac{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2} = \\frac{2r + r\\sqrt{3} - r}{2} = \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{2}$\nThis resistance is $R_{d-chain} = v_{d_0} / I$.\n\nThe total Thévenin resistance we need is $R_{th} = R_{d_0, c_0} = (v_{d_0} - v_{c_0})/I$.\nUsing the anti-symmetry property $v_{c_0} = -v_{d_0}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{v_{d_0} - (-v_{d_0})}{I} = \\frac{2v_{d_0}}{I} = 2 R_{d-chain}$\n$R_{th} = 2 \\times \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 8: Calculating the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we can substitute this result back into the formula for the cutoff angular frequency:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency in radians per second."
