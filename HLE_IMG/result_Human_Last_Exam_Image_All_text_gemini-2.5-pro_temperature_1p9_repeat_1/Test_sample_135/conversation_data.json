    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the altarpiece detail:\n\n1.  **Observe the Artwork:** The image displays a bas-relief sculpture inside a circular frame (a tondo). The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the Eucharist (Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including children and adults. The style is clearly Italian Renaissance, characterized by graceful figures, classical drapery, and a balanced composition.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Details:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a scroll or *cartellino* with a visible inscription. By examining the main image and the cropped details, the text can be transcribed as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL,\" which is Old French for \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This French inscription is a crucial clue, suggesting a connection to France (either a French patron or a location in France).\n\n3.  **Research the Artwork and Inscription:**\n    *   Searching for reliefs of the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" from the Italian Renaissance points to several artists, including Luca della Robbia, Desiderio da Settignano, and their followers.\n    *   The specific French inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" narrows the search significantly. This exact inscription is found on a painted stucco relief held in the Louvre Museum in Paris (inventory number RF 425). The photograph provided is of this specific object.\n\n4.  **Determine the Attribution:**\n    *   The Louvre Museum attributes this stucco relief as being \"d'après Desiderio da Settignano,\" which means \"after Desiderio da Settignano.\" This indicates that it is believed to be a copy of a lost or original work by the Florentine sculptor Desiderio da Settignano (c. 1430–1464). Desiderio was a master sculptor known for his refined and delicate low-relief carvings, a style clearly reflected in this piece.\n    *   There is a well-known, almost identical marble relief without this inscription located in the Cathedral of San Martino in Lucca, Italy. That relief is part of the Tabernacle of the Sacrament and was created by the sculptor Matteo Civitali (1436–1501).\n    *   Art historians note that Civitali was heavily influenced by Desiderio da Settignano. It is widely believed that both Civitali's marble relief and the Louvre's stucco cast derive from a common source, most likely a lost original composition by Desiderio da Settignano.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The image shown is specifically of the stucco cast in the Louvre, identifiable by the unique French inscription. The Louvre, which holds the piece, attributes the original design to Desiderio da Settignano. Therefore, he is considered the author of the composition.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
