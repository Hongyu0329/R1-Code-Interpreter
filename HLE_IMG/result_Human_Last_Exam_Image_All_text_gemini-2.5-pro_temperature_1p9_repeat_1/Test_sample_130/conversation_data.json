    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input image.**\nThe image shows a bright-line emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is produced when atoms of a gas are excited (for example, by an electric current) and then emit light as they return to their lower energy states. Each element emits light only at specific, discrete wavelengths, creating a unique pattern of colored lines that acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The spectrum in the image shows colors from blue/violet on the left to red on the right, indicating it covers the visible range of light.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key features of the spectral lines.**\nBy observing the image, we can note the presence and approximate color of the most prominent (brightest) lines:\n*   Several lines in the blue and violet region.\n*   A couple of distinct lines in the blue-green (cyan) and green region.\n*   A very bright yellow-orange line.\n*   A bright red line.\n*   Several other dimmer lines are also visible across the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed spectrum with the known spectra of common elements.**\nWe need to match this specific pattern of lines with the known emission spectrum of a chemical element. Let's consider some common candidates:\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is much simpler, consisting mainly of four lines: a red, a blue-green, a blue-violet, and a violet line. The spectrum in the image is significantly more complex.\n*   **Sodium:** The sodium spectrum is dominated by a very strong doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow part of the spectrum. The given spectrum has prominent lines in many other colors, not just yellow.\n*   **Neon:** The neon spectrum is characterized by a large number of very bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum, which is why neon signs glow reddish-orange. The spectrum shown has strong lines across the entire visible range, including blue and green.\n*   **Mercury:** Mercury has prominent lines in the violet, blue, green, and yellow regions. While a possible candidate, the exact pattern and relative intensities do not perfectly match. For example, mercury has a single, exceptionally bright green line at 546 nm, which isn't the pattern seen here.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of helium has several strong lines spread across the visible range, including a characteristic bright red line (~668 nm), a bright yellow line (~588 nm), prominent green and cyan lines (~502 nm, ~492 nm), and strong blue and violet lines (~471 nm, ~447 nm).\n\n**Step 4: Final Identification.**\nThe pattern observed in the image—a prominent red line, a bright yellow line, and several distinct lines in the green, blue, and violet regions—is a textbook match for the emission spectrum of the element **Helium**.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
