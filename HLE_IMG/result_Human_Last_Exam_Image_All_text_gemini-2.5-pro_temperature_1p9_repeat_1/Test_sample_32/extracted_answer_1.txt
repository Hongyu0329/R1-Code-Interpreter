The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctly curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or turned to one side.
