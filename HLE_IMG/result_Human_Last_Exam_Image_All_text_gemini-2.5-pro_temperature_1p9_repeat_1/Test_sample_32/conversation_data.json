    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the parts of a moss sporophyte.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* \"at a glance\". A moss sporophyte typically consists of three parts:\n*   **Foot:** Embeds the sporophyte in the gametophyte.\n*   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and curvature are important diagnostic features.\n*   **Capsule (sporangium):** Contains the spores. Its shape, orientation, and surface (e.g., ribbed or smooth) are also key features.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short and, most importantly, **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held erect (upright). It is typically described as immersed (hidden within the perichaetial leaves) or emergent (peeking out just above the leaves), as seen in the provided image.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   **Seta:** The species name *curviseta* is a direct clue. \"Curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk. The seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is distinctly **curved** or even hook-shaped (cygneous).\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** The strong curvature of the seta causes the capsule to be nodding, cernuous (hanging down), or at least turned to one side. It is often tucked beneath the surrounding leaves.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two species to find the main \"at a glance\" difference.**\n*   The most striking and immediate difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **shape of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n*   *Grimmia montana* has an erect, upright capsule on a short, straight seta.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta* has a nodding or sideways-turned capsule on a strongly curved seta.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the findings to the provided image.**\nThe image shows numerous capsules that are erect and emergent from the moss cushions. They appear to be on very short, straight stalks (setae), although the setae themselves are mostly hidden by the leaves. This presentation is characteristic of *Grimmia montana* and not *Grimmia curviseta*. An image of *Grimmia curviseta* would show the capsules bent over on curved stalks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe primary difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctly curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or turned to one side.>>>"
