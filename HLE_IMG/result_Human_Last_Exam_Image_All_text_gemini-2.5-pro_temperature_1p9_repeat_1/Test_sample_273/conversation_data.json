    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right for clarity:\n*   **Cα:** The leftmost carbon, bonded to -OH, -CH3, -H (implied), and the rest of the molecule.\n*   **Cβ:** The middle carbon, bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), -H (implied), and the carbons Cα and Cγ.\n*   **Cγ:** The rightmost carbon, bonded to -CH3, a -CH2NH2 group, -H (implied), and the carbon Cβ.\n\nWe will determine the configuration (R or S) for each of these three centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of the middle chiral center (Cβ)**\n1.  **Identify the groups and assign priorities:**\n    *   The groups attached to Cβ are:\n        1.  -Cα(H)(OH)(CH3): The carbon Cα is attached to an Oxygen (O), a Carbon (C), and a Hydrogen (H). Atomic numbers: (8, 6, 1).\n        2.  -Cγ(H)(CH3)(CH2NH2): The carbon Cγ is attached to two Carbons and a Hydrogen (C, C, H). Going further, one C goes to N.\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group): The first carbon is attached to a Carbon and two Hydrogens (C, H, H).\n        4.  -H (implied): The hydrogen atom has the lowest priority.\n\n    *   **Priority assignment:**\n        *   Comparing group 1 and 2: We look at the atoms attached to Cα vs Cγ. Cα is bonded to (O, C, H). Cγ is bonded to (C, C, H). Since O (atomic number 8) is heavier than C (atomic number 6), group 1 has higher priority than group 2.\n        *   Comparing group 2 and 3: Cγ is bonded to (C, C, H). The ethyl's first carbon is bonded to (C, H, H). The (C, C, H) set on Cγ outranks the (C, H, H) on the ethyl group. So group 2 has higher priority than group 3.\n        *   The priorities are:\n            1.  -Cα(H)(OH)(CH3)\n            2.  -Cγ(H)(CH3)(CH2NH2)\n            3.  -CH2CH3\n            4.  -H\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C-C backbone (Cα-Cβ-Cγ) is in the plane of the paper.\n    *   At Cβ, the ethyl group is on a wedge (coming out of the page).\n    *   Therefore, the implied -H atom (priority 4) must be on a dash (going into the page).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) in the back, we can determine the configuration by tracing the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path from group 1 (Cα, down-left) to group 2 (Cγ, up-right) to group 3 (ethyl, wedged towards us) traces a clockwise direction.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration of Cβ is **(R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of the rightmost chiral center (Cγ)**\n1.  **Identify the groups and assign priorities:**\n    *   The groups attached to Cγ are:\n        1.  -CH2NH2: The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen (N), H, H.\n        2.  -Cβ(H)(Et)(Cα...): The carbon Cβ is attached to C, C, H.\n        3.  -CH3: The carbon is attached to H, H, H.\n        4.  -H (implied).\n\n    *   **Priority assignment:**\n        *   Comparing group 1 and 2: The carbon of -CH2NH2 is attached to (N, H, H). The carbon Cβ is attached to (C, C, H). Since N (atomic number 7) is heavier than C (atomic number 6), group 1 has the highest priority.\n        *   The priorities are:\n            1.  -CH2NH2\n            2.  -Cβ(H)(Et)(Cα...)\n            3.  -CH3\n            4.  -H\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   At Cγ, the bond to Cβ and the implied H atom are in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) is on a wedge, and the -CH3 group (priority 3) is on a dash.\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is in the plane of the page.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we can use the determinant method or a swap. Let's use the swap method. We mentally swap the group in the back (-CH3, priority 3) with the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4).\n    *   After the swap, H is on a dash, and CH3 is in the plane. We determine the configuration of this new arrangement and then reverse it.\n    *   With H in the back, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. Group 1 (-CH2NH2) is on a wedge. Group 2 (-Cβ) is in the plane (down-left). Group 3 (-CH3, which is now in the H's original position) is in the plane (right).\n    *   The path from 1 (wedge) -> 2 (plane-left) -> 3 (plane-right) is clockwise. This gives an (R) configuration for the swapped molecule.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration of Cγ is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of the leftmost chiral center (Cα)**\n1.  **Analyze the drawing:**\n    *   The drawing at Cα is non-standard. A tetrahedral carbon is shown with two bonds in the plane (to Cβ and an implied H) and two bonds on dashes (to -OH and -CH3). This is geometrically impossible.\n    *   The most plausible assumption is that there is a drawing error or a specific convention is used that needs interpretation. Assuming consistency with the rest of the molecule (Cβ and Cγ), where the C-C backbone is in the plane and other groups are on wedges/dashes, the drawing at Cα contains a mistake. A likely interpretation, which also aligns with related bioactive molecules, is that Cα has the bond to Cβ and the -OH group in the plane, the -CH3 group on a dash, and thus the implied -H on a wedge.\n\n2.  **Identify the groups and assign priorities (based on the interpretation):**\n    *   The groups attached to Cα are:\n        1.  -OH (highest priority, O has atomic number 8)\n        2.  -Cβ(H)(Et)... (C attached to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH3 (C attached to H, H, H)\n        4.  -H (implied).\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration (based on the interpretation):**\n    *   Our interpretation: Cα-OH (plane), Cα-Cβ (plane), Cα-CH3 (dash, priority 3), and Cα-H (wedge, priority 4).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing out), we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from group 1 (-OH, in plane, left) to group 2 (-Cβ, in plane, right) to group 3 (-CH3, dashed) is clockwise.\n    *   This gives an apparent configuration of (R).\n    *   Because the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the result.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration of Cα is **(S)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe absolute configurations of the three chiral centers, from left to right, are S, R, and S.\n\n<<<S, R, S>>>"
