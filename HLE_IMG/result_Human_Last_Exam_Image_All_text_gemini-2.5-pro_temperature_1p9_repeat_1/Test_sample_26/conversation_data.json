    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata.\n\n**1. Identify the Musical Context:**\n*   **Piece:** Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 \"Pathétique\", 1st Movement (Allegro di molto e con brio).\n*   **Measure:** 30.\n*   **Key Signature:** Three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), indicating the key of C minor.\n*   **Resolution:** The chord in measure 30 resolves to a C minor chord (the tonic, `i`) in measure 31. This means the chord in measure 30 has a dominant or pre-dominant function, creating tension that leads to the tonic.\n\n**2. Note Identification:**\nTo analyze the chord, we must first identify all the pitches present in measure 30.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** There is a single half note. The note is on the B line and is preceded by a natural sign (♮), cancelling the B-flat in the key signature. The note is **B-natural**.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of arpeggiated sixteenth notes.\n    *   The lowest note is **D**.\n    *   The next note is **F-sharp** (F with a sharp accidental, ♯).\n    *   The next note is **A**. Due to the key signature, this A is **A-flat**. There is no natural sign to cancel the flat.\n    *   The highest note is **C**.\n*   **Complete Pitch Collection:** The notes sounding simultaneously in measure 30 are **B, D, F♯, A♭, and C**.\n\n**3. Harmonic Analysis (Evaluating Possible Chord Labels):**\n\nThe chord is complex and has features of several different harmonic functions. Let's examine the most likely candidates for a Roman numeral label.\n\n*   **Leading-Tone Chord (vii°):** A leading-tone chord is built on the 7th scale degree (the leading tone), which is B-natural in C minor. The diatonic leading-tone diminished seventh chord (`vii°7`) in C harmonic minor is B-D-F-A♭.\n    *   Our chord has B, D, and A♭, but it has an F-sharp instead of an F-natural. The F-sharp is a significant alteration and points away from a simple leading-tone chord.\n\n*   **Secondary Dominant (V/V):** A secondary dominant creates a strong pull to the dominant chord (V, which is G major in this key). The dominant of G is D. A V7/V chord would be a D dominant 7th (D7), with the notes D-F♯-A-C.\n    *   Our chord contains D, F♯, and C. However, it has an A-flat instead of an A-natural, and crucially, the bass note is B-natural, not D, F♯, A, or C. While related, this label does not fully account for the notes present, especially the bass.\n\n*   **Augmented Sixth Chord (+6):** These are highly chromatic pre-dominant chords defined by the interval of an augmented sixth between the lowered 6th scale degree (♭6) and the raised 4th scale degree (♯4). In C minor, this interval is between A♭ and F♯.\n    *   Our chord contains both **A♭ and F♯**. This is a very strong indicator that we are dealing with an augmented sixth chord.\n    *   There are three common types of augmented sixth chords:\n        *   Italian +6 (It⁺⁶): A♭ - C - F♯\n        *   **French +6 (Fr⁺⁶): A♭ - C - D - F♯**\n        *   German +6 (Gr⁺⁶): A♭ - C - E♭ - F♯\n    *   Our chord contains all the notes of the **French augmented sixth chord**: A♭, C, D, and F♯.\n\n**4. Conclusion on the Chord's Identity:**\n\nThe core harmony of measure 30 is a French augmented sixth chord (A♭-C-D-F♯). Beethoven takes this sonority and makes two notable alterations:\n1.  **Unconventional Bass Note:** Instead of placing the standard A♭ in the bass, he places the leading tone, B-natural, in the bass. This intensifies the pull towards the tonic C.\n2.  **Direct Resolution:** Augmented sixth chords typically resolve to the dominant (V), which then resolves to the tonic (i). Here, Beethoven elides the V chord and resolves this chromatic sonority directly to the tonic (i).\n\nDespite these unconventional treatments, the collection of notes (A♭, C, D, F♯) that produces the chord's unique, tense sound is unmistakably that of a French augmented sixth. Therefore, the most accurate Roman numeral analysis for this harmony is **Fr⁺⁶** (or more specifically **Fr⁴₃**, its common inversion).\n\n<<<Fr+⁶>>>"
