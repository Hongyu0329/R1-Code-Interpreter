    "Here is a step-by-step analysis and identification of the rock specimens.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and is full of small holes, known as vesicles. The overall texture is rough and appears to be made of fine material that is not distinctly crystalline to the naked eye (aphanitic).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas was trapped in lava as it cooled rapidly. This points to it being an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color often comes from the oxidation of iron, common in mafic to intermediate lava like basalt or andesite. A highly vesicular, dark-colored volcanic rock is called scoria.\n    *   **Identification:** Scoria.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of many smaller, angular rock fragments of different colors (grey, white, red) and sizes, all cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The mixture of angular volcanic fragments (clasts) and a fine-grained matrix (which is likely volcanic ash) indicates this rock was formed from material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption. This type of pyroclastic rock, made of consolidated volcanic ash often containing larger fragments called lapilli, is known as tuff. If the rock is dominated by large angular blocks, it might be called a volcanic breccia. Given the appearance, tuff is a very appropriate identification.\n    *   **Identification:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia).\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color (white to light grey) and is extremely porous with many small vesicles, similar to specimen H but lighter in color and appearing less dense. It is also fine-grained (aphanitic).\n    *   **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is an extrusive igneous rock that cooled quickly, trapping gasses. The very light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica, like rhyolite). A highly vesicular, light-colored, low-density volcanic rock is called pumice. Pumice is often so low in density that it can float on water.\n    *   **Identification:** Pumice.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture. We can see different colored minerals, including light-colored (white to pinkish, likely feldspar) and dark greenish minerals (like hornblende or biotite).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The large crystals indicate that the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This identifies it as an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (typically larger than 1 cm) is called a pegmatite. The mineral composition appears to be similar to granite.\n    *   **Identification:** Pegmatite.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff / Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
