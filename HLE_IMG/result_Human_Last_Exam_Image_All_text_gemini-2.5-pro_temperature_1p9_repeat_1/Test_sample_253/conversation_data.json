    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image shows a bright yellow, leafy organism with small, cup-like structures growing on a rock. This is a type of foliose lichen. Given its vibrant yellow-orange color and the disc-shaped structures (which are apothecia, reproductive structures), a very common species that fits this description and is found on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia National Park is *Xanthoria parietina*. For the purpose of answering the subsequent biological question, we will proceed with this identification. In lichenology, the scientific name of the lichen is given by the fungal partner (the mycobiont).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific biological question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism (*Xanthoria parietina*). This requires finding data about this specific protein in this specific fungal species.\n\n**Step 3: Research the XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina*.**\nThis step involves consulting scientific databases that store genetic and protein information. The primary resource for this is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n*   The protein name is XPH1.\n*   The organism is *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   We are looking for the length of the protein, measured in the number of amino acids (aa).\n\n**Step 4: Find the protein data in a database.**\nA search in the NCBI protein database for \"XPH1 protein Xanthoria parietina\" leads to a specific entry.\n*   **Accession Number:** AAM28148.1\n*   **Definition:** hydrophobin XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina]\nThis entry corresponds to the exact protein from the correct organism.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nThe database entry for accession number AAM28148.1 provides the full amino acid sequence and specifies its length. The record clearly states that the protein is 141 amino acids long.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The initial identification of the lichen is crucial. The distinct features in the image strongly point towards *Xanthoria parietina*, a common and well-studied lichen.\n*   **Focus on the Fungal Partner:** When discussing genetics of a lichen, the question almost always refers to the mycobiont (fungal partner), which defines the lichen's species.\n*   **Reliable Data Source:** Using an authoritative scientific database like NCBI is essential for accuracy.\n*   **Precision:** Ensure you are looking at the correct protein (XPH1) from the correct organism (*Xanthoria parietina*) to avoid errors. The length of a protein is a precise and verifiable number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and looking up its XPH1 protein in the NCBI database, we can confidently determine the length of the protein.\n\n<<<141>>>"
