    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Images:** The image displays three panels, labeled L, M, and N. Each panel shows a micrograph of a filamentous, tube-like biological structure. The structure is divided into distinct compartments or cells by cross-walls, which are known as septa in fungi and some algae. The contents of the cells appear granular, which is typical of cytoplasm.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Panel L:** This panel shows a relatively straight filament composed of several cells stacked end-to-end. It serves as a reference or a state before a specific event occurs. An arrowhead points to a septum, highlighting the compartmentalized nature of the filament.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Panel M:** This panel shows a similar filament, but a significant change is visible. An arrowhead points to a lateral bulge or swelling emerging from the side of one of the cells, near a septum. This indicates the initiation of a new growth from the side of the existing filament.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Panel N:** This panel appears to show a later stage of the process seen in panel M. The lateral bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new, smaller filament that is extending away from the original one. This new filament is creating a branch. The arrowhead again indicates the site of this new growth.\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Conclusion:** By comparing the panels, we can reconstruct a sequence of events. A mature, septate filament (like in L) initiates a new point of growth on its lateral wall (the bulge in M). This new growth point then elongates to form a new filament tip, resulting in a branch (as seen in N). This process, where a new growing tip emerges from the side of an existing filament (hypha), is known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for the expansion and colonization of substrates by filamentous fungi.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Organism Type:** The septate, filamentous structure is characteristic of fungal hyphae.\n*   **Growth Type:** Fungi typically exhibit polarized growth, meaning growth is concentrated at the tips of the hyphae. Hyphal branching is a process of re-establishing a new pole of growth on the side of a hypha.\n*   **Distinguishing from other processes:**\n    *   It is not **spore germination**, which starts from a single, typically spherical spore.\n    *   It is not **septum formation**, as the main event shown is outgrowth, not the division of a cell.\n    *   It is not **hyphal fusion (anastomosis)**, which would involve two separate hyphae approaching and merging.\n    *   It is not simple **swelling due to turgor pressure changes**, because the swelling in panel N is organized into a new, elongating filament, indicating directed growth.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the process depicted is the formation of a new branch from an existing fungal hypha.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
