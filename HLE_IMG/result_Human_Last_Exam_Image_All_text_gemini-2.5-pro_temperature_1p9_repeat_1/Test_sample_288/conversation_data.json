    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image to Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the location shown in the image. The building has very distinct architectural features:\n    *   Red brickwork, with a section featuring a herringbone pattern.\n    *   A large tan stucco section with a prominent decorative relief in a quatrefoil (four-leaf clover-like) shape.\n    *   An open-air section on the upper right with a white crisscross railing.\n    *   A large tour-style semi-truck and trailer parked in front, suggesting it's a venue for live performances.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Building:** A reverse image search or a descriptive search based on these architectural details (\"red brick theater with quatrefoil design\") identifies the building as the **Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. Comparing online photos of the theater confirms that all the visual details match perfectly.\n\n3.  **Determine the Event on the Specified Date:** The question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on October 12, 2023. Now that the venue is identified, the next step is to find its event schedule for that specific date.\n\n4.  **Search the Venue's Event History:** By searching online for \"Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox events October 2023\" or checking concert databases and the theater's official website archives, we can find the performance schedule.\n\n5.  **Acquire the Final Answer:** Event listings for the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox show that on Thursday, October 12, 2023, the headlining performer was the rock band **Goo Goo Dolls** on their \"The Big Night Out Tour\".\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
