    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Cluster:**\n    *   The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) region. These are at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple chlorine or bromine atoms.\n    *   Let's assume the peak at the lowest mass in this cluster, m/z 260, is the molecular ion (M⁺) containing only the lightest isotopes (e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   We analyze the relative intensities of the peaks in this cluster (the isotope pattern) to determine the number of chlorine atoms. From the table: I(260) = 34.8%, I(262) = 29.0%, I(264) = 12.9%, I(266) = 3.22%.\n    *   The theoretical intensity ratios for a molecule with n chlorine atoms are approximately:\n        *   n=1 (Cl₁): M:M+2 ≈ 3:1 (100:33)\n        *   n=2 (Cl₂): M:M+2:M+4 ≈ 9:6:1 (100:65:11)\n        *   n=3 (Cl₃): M:M+2:M+4:M+6 ≈ 27:27:9:1 (100:98:32:4)\n    *   Let's normalize the observed intensities to the M⁺ peak (m/z 260):\n        *   I(260) = 100% (normalized)\n        *   I(262) = (29.0 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 83%\n        *   I(264) = (12.9 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 37%\n        *   I(266) = (3.22 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 9%\n    *   The observed ratio of approximately 100:83:37:9 is a very good match for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Base Peak and Primary Fragmentation:**\n    *   The base peak (most intense peak) is at **m/z = 225** (I = 100%).\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 amu.\n    *   This loss of 35 corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•). The fragmentation M⁺˙ → [M-Cl]⁺ is a very common pathway for chlorinated compounds. The high intensity of the [M-Cl]⁺ peak suggests that this cleavage forms a particularly stable carbocation.\n    *   To confirm this, let's analyze the isotope pattern of the base peak itself. The fragment at m/z 225, having lost one chlorine, should still contain two chlorine atoms.\n        *   The theoretical pattern for two chlorines is M:M+2 ≈ 100:65.\n        *   We observe a peak at m/z 227 with an intensity of 66.7%. The ratio I(227)/I(225) = 66.7/100 = 0.667. This is an excellent match for the expected 0.65, confirming the fragment at m/z 225 contains two chlorine atoms.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have established the molecule has M=260 and contains three Cl atoms.\n    *   The mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule (let's call it R) is the total mass minus the mass of three ³⁵Cl atoms: Mass(R) = 260 - (3 * 35) = 260 - 105 = 155 amu.\n    *   We need to find a plausible chemical formula for a radical R with mass 155. A hydrocarbon radical CₓHᵧ is a likely candidate.\n    *   For C₁₂H₁₁, the mass is (12 * 12) + (11 * 1) = 144 + 11 = 155. This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ suggests a structure containing a C₁₂ carbon skeleton. The ratio of C to H suggests the presence of aromatic rings. A biphenyl skeleton is C₁₂H₁₀. Our C₁₂H₁₁ moiety has one more hydrogen, which suggests that one of the rings is saturated.\n    *   A very plausible structure is a phenyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring (C₆H₅-C₆H₇), giving a C₁₂ skeleton. Adding three chlorines gives C₆H₅-C₆H₄Cl₃, which has 5+4=9 hydrogens. This is not correct. The total hydrogen on a trichlorocyclohexane attached to phenyl is C₆H₅ + C₆H₆Cl₃ -> H count: 5 from phenyl + 6 from cyclohexane ring = 11 hydrogens. This matches C₁₂**H₁₁**Cl₃.\n    *   Let's propose the structure is a **trichloro-phenylcyclohexane**.\n    *   The fact that the loss of one chlorine atom leads to the base peak (a very stable ion) suggests that this particular chlorine atom is easily removed. This occurs if its loss generates a tertiary and/or benzylic carbocation.\n    *   A structure that fits this is **1,2,3-trichloro-1-phenylcyclohexane**.\n        *   The phenyl group and a chlorine atom are attached to the same carbon (C1).\n        *   Loss of the chlorine atom from C1 generates a carbocation that is both tertiary (bonded to three other carbons) and benzylic (adjacent to the phenyl ring), making it highly stabilized.\n        *   This explains why the fragment at m/z=225 ([M-Cl]⁺) is the most abundant one in the spectrum.\n    *   The subsequent peaks at m/z 190 and 155 can be explained by the sequential loss of the other two chlorine atoms from the cyclohexane ring.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The compound has a molecular ion at m/z 260, contains three chlorine atoms, and a C₁₂H₁₁ hydrocarbon framework. The fragmentation pattern strongly suggests a 1-phenyl-trichlorocyclohexane structure, as the loss of the benzylic/tertiary chlorine leads to the observed stable base peak at m/z 225. A plausible IUPAC name is given for a specific isomer that fits this fragmentation logic.\n\n<<<1,2,3-trichloro-1-phenylcyclohexane>>>"
