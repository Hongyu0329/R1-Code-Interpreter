    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sex.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Order Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (13 in most male bees/wasps vs. 12 in females). In some groups, the tips of the male antennae are distinctly hooked or curled.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** The tip of the female abdomen is often pointed due to the presence of a stinger (a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying tube). The male abdomen is typically more rounded or blunt at the tip and has one more visible segment than the female (7 vs. 6).\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have yellow or white markings on their clypeus (the \"face plate\" above the mouthparts), which females lack.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** The question specifies that these are from taxa where females *lack scopae* (specialized pollen-carrying hairs on the legs). This directs our attention to groups like cuckoo bees (which don't collect pollen), plasterer bees (which carry pollen internally), and wasps. Male bees and wasps do not collect pollen for nests.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys* (sharp-tailed bees). They are brood parasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees, so they do not have scopae.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is distinctly tapered to a sharp point. This is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses her specialized abdomen to pierce the nest cell of a host bee to lay her egg.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The tip of the abdomen is not pointed. Instead, it is blunt and appears to have multiple spines or prongs. This complex terminal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae for collecting pollen, though they visit flowers for nectar.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antenna tip. It is clearly curled or hooked. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight, lacking the curled tips of the male. The abdomen appears slightly more pointed at the tip, housing the stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n**Pair C:** These appear to be plasterer bees of the genus *Colletes*. Females in this group line their nests with a cellophane-like secretion and carry pollen internally in their crop and on thoracic hairs, rather than on prominent leg scopae, fitting the question's criteria.\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has very long antennae that extend well behind its head. Long antennae are a reliable trait for identifying male bees. Additionally, the face has extensive pale, yellowish hairs, and the clypeus appears pale, another common male characteristic.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee's antennae are visibly shorter than the bee on the left. Its face is dark, lacking the extensive pale coloration of the male. The hind legs are hairy but lack the dense, structured brush of a scopa.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Answers:**\n*   Pair A: F, M (Option 4)\n*   Pair B: M, F (Option 3)\n*   Pair C: M, F (Option 3)\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
