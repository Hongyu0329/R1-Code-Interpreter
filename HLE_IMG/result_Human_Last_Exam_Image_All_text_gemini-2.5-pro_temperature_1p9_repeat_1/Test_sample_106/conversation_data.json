    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is a polycyclic alcohol (a triterpenoid derivative). It is treated with a strong acid (HCl) at a high temperature (110 °C). The products are an alkene (as indicated by the double bond in the structure and the chemical formula C30H50, which is C30H52O minus H2O) and water. This is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. Such reactions on complex, fused ring systems often proceed with extensive carbocation rearrangements, known as Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangements. The question explicitly states that the reaction involves a number of [1,2] shifts.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism - Carbocation Formation and Rearrangement Cascade**\n1.  **Protonation and Formation of the Initial Carbocation:** The alcohol group at C3 is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group, -OH2+. This group departs as a water molecule, leaving a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n2.  **Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial secondary carbocation at C3 will undergo a series of [1,2] shifts (of hydride (H) or methyl (CH3) groups) to form more stable carbocations, ultimately leading to a position from which a stable alkene can be formed. The driving force is the formation of more stable tertiary carbocations from less stable ones. The rearrangement propagates the positive charge along the carbon skeleton.\n\n    *   **Shift 1 (C3 → C4):** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from the adjacent quaternary C4 to the C3 carbocation. This converts the secondary C3 cation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4. C4 started with two methyl groups; it now has one, and the other has moved to C3.\n    *   **Shift 2 (C4 → C5):** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C5 to the C4 carbocation occurs. The positive charge moves to C5, forming a new tertiary carbocation. C4 now has a hydrogen atom (in addition to the remaining methyl group).\n    *   **Shift 3 (C5 → C10):** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C10 (at the A/B ring junction) to the C5 carbocation moves the positive charge to C10, another tertiary position. C5 gains a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 4 (C10 → C9):** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C9 to the C10 carbocation moves the positive charge to C9 (tertiary). C10 gains a hydrogen.\n    *   **Shift 5 (C9 → C8):** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C8 to the C9 carbocation moves the charge to C8 (tertiary). C9 gains a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 6 (C8 → C14):** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C14 to the C8 carbocation moves the charge to C14 (tertiary). C8 gains a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 7 (C14 → C13):** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C13 to the C14 carbocation moves the charge to C13. C14 gains a hydrogen.\n\n3.  **Final Elimination Step:** The final carbocation is at C13. To form the thermodynamically stable tetrasubstituted C12=C13 double bond shown in the product, a proton (H+) is eliminated from the adjacent C12.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Substituents at Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**\nNow we track the identity of the substituent at each labeled position in the final product based on the rearrangement cascade.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 starts with two methyl groups. In Shift 1, one methyl group migrates to C3. In Shift 2, a hydrogen atom migrates from C5 to C4. Therefore, the final C4 has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom. The label \"1\" points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C10):** C10 starts with one methyl group. In Shift 3, this methyl group migrates to C5. In Shift 4, a hydrogen atom migrates from C9 to C10. Therefore, the final C10 has a hydrogen atom as its substituent.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C8):** C8 starts with one methyl group. In Shift 5, this methyl group migrates to C9. In Shift 6, a methyl group migrates from C14 to C8. Therefore, the final C8 has a methyl group (the one that was originally on C14).\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C14):** C14 starts with one methyl group. In Shift 6, this methyl group migrates to C8. In Shift 7, a hydrogen atom migrates from C13 to C14. Therefore, the final C14 has a hydrogen atom as its substituent.\n    *   **4 = H**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C13):** C13 starts with one hydrogen atom. In Shift 7, this hydrogen atom migrates to C14. In the final elimination step, C13 becomes sp2-hybridized as it forms a double bond with C12. An sp2 carbon in a double bond within a fused ring system like this does not have any additional H or CH3 substituents. The label \"5\" pointing to a substituent on C13 appears to be an error in the provided diagram. However, if we must assign an identity, we should consider what atoms were associated with this position. The only group (other than ring carbons) that was ever bonded to C13 or migrated from C13 was a hydrogen atom. No methyl group was ever involved at C13. Therefore, the most plausible intended answer, despite the flawed drawing, is H.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nCombining these findings gives the final answer.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
