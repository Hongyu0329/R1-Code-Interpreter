    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image is a raster plot showing neuronal activity over time.\n*   **X-axis:** Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to over 50.\n*   **Y-axis:** Electrode Number, from 0 to 128, representing different recording sites in the neuronal culture.\n*   **Data:** Each black dot signifies a spike (an action potential or firing event) from a neuron at a specific electrode at a specific moment in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\n\"Synchronized bursts\" are periods where a large number of neurons across many electrodes fire simultaneously or in very close succession. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands of black dots spanning a significant portion of the y-axis.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the Timestamps of Each Burst**\nWe need to scan the graph and estimate the time for the center of each major synchronized burst.\n*   **Burst 1:** The first major burst occurs at the beginning of the recording. It's somewhat broad, but its central point of highest activity can be estimated to be at approximately **t₁ = 2.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next clear, strong burst is centered between the 10 s and 20 s markers. A close visual inspection places its center at approximately **t₂ = 17.0 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A third distinct burst occurs between the 30 s and 40 s markers. Its center is estimated to be at **t₃ = 36.0 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The final major burst shown in the graph occurs just before the 50 s mark. Its center is estimated at **t₄ = 49.0 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of consecutive bursts. We have three such intervals to calculate.\n*   **Interval 1 (between Burst 1 and 2):**\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 17.0 s - 2.5 s = 14.5 s\n*   **Interval 2 (between Burst 2 and 3):**\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36.0 s - 17.0 s = 19.0 s\n*   **Interval 3 (between Burst 3 and 4):**\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 49.0 s - 36.0 s = 13.0 s\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nThe average IBI is the sum of all individual IBIs divided by the number of intervals.\n*   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n*   Average IBI = (14.5 s + 19.0 s + 13.0 s) / 3\n*   Average IBI = 46.5 s / 3\n*   Average IBI = 15.5 s\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 15.5 s.\n*   Rounding 15.5 to two significant figures gives **16**. (Standard rounding rules for a trailing 5 often round to the nearest even number, which is 16).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Definition:** It's important to only consider the major, clearly synchronized network bursts and ignore smaller, less-coordinated firing events. The four chosen events are the most prominent.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** Estimating the exact center of a burst from a graph introduces some uncertainty. However, using a consistent method (like targeting the visual center of mass) for all bursts minimizes systematic error. The calculations based on these estimates are straightforward.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final rounding step is crucial to meet the question's requirement.\n\n<<<16>>>"
