    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to find the official designation or ID (e.g., U 123, Sö 45) for the specific Ingvar runestone fragment shown in the image.\n\n2.  **Initial Image Examination:** The image shows a close-up of a runestone with runic script carved into well-defined horizontal bands. The style is clear and typical of the late Viking Age. The characters are runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet.\n\n3.  **Runic Transliteration:** To identify the stone, we need to read the runes. Let's transliterate the visible text, row by row. We will use `x` to represent the dot or cross separators between words.\n    *   **Top row:** The visible runes read `...ᚦᚢᚱᛁᚦ x ᚦᛅᚢᚾ...`.\n        *   `ᚦ` = þ (th)\n        *   `ᚢ` = u\n        *   `ᚱ` = r\n        *   `ᛁ` = i\n        *   `ᚦ` = þ\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᚦ` = þ\n        *   `ᛅ` = a\n        *   `ᚢ` = u\n        *   `ᚾ` = n\n        *   This transliterates to `...þuriþ x þaun...`. In Old Norse, this corresponds to `Þýriðr` (a female name) and `þaun` (\"they\").\n    *   **Middle row:** The visible runes are `...x ᚠᛅᚦᚢᚱ x ᛋᛁᚾ...`.\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᚠ` = f\n        *   `ᛅ` = a\n        *   `ᚦ` = þ (sometimes transliterated as 'ð' or 'd')\n        *   `ᚢ` = u\n        *   `ᚱ` = r\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛋ` = s\n        *   `ᛁ` = i\n        *   `ᚾ` = n\n        *   This transliterates to `...x faþur x sin...`. In Old Norse, this corresponds to `faður sinn` (\"their father\").\n    *   **Bottom row:** The visible runes are `...x ᛅᚢᚴ x ᛅᛏ...`.\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛅ` = a\n        *   `ᚢ` = u\n        *   `ᚴ` = k\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛅ` = a\n        *   `ᛏ` = t\n        *   This transliterates to `...x auk x at...`. In Old Norse, this corresponds to `auk at` (\"and in memory of\").\n\n4.  **Reconstruct the Text Fragment:** Piecing the rows together, we are looking for an inscription that says something like: \"[Name] and Þýriðr, they [...] their father [...] and in memory of [...]\".\n\n5.  **Cross-reference with Ingvar Runestones:** The question specifies this is an Ingvar runestone. This is a known corpus of about 30 stones. We must find which of these stones contains our text fragment. We search for an Ingvar runestone inscription that contains the name `Þýriðr` (Thurid) and the phrases `faður sinn` and `auk at`.\n\n6.  **Identify the Runestone:** The inscription of the runestone **Sö 9** (from Lifsinge/Lävringe in Södermanland, Sweden) reads:\n    *   **Old Norse:** *Haraldr ok Þurið þaun ... ræisa stæin þenna at Ulf, faður sinn, ok at Ingvar, sun sinn...*\n    *   **English:** \"Haraldr and Þýriðr, they ... raised this stone in memory of Ulfr, their father, and in memory of Ingvarr, their son...\"\n\n7.  **Confirmation:** This inscription is a perfect match for the text we deciphered from the image fragment.\n    *   `... ok Þurið þaun ...` matches `...þuriþ x þaun...` on the top row.\n    *   `... at Ulf, faður sinn ...` matches `... faþur x sin ...` on the middle row.\n    *   `... ok at Ingvar ...` matches `... auk x at ...` on the bottom row.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The image shows a fragment of the Ingvar runestone with the identifier Sö 9."
