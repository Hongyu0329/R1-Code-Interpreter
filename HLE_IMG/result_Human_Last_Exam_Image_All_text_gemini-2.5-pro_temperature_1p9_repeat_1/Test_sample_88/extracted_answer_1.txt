The products A, B, and C are formed through three parallel reaction pathways:

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):** Formed by the direct C-acetylation of the starting material at the Î±-carbon (C2) of the proline ring.
**Structure C:** 2-acetyl-1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):** Formed via a domino reaction between the starting material and one molecule of methyl propiolate, followed by the elimination of one molecule of methanol.
**Structure B:** A complex fused heterocyclic product, likely a derivative of pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine.

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):** Formed through a multi-step sequence involving: 1) decarboxylation of the starting material to an azomethine ylide, 2) a [3+2] cycloaddition of the ylide with methyl propiolate to form a primary adduct, and 3) acetylation of this adduct.
**Structure A:** A substituted and acetylated pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole derivative.
