    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing from the source.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the total current (`I_total`) supplied by the voltage source V2. This is achieved by finding the total equivalent resistance (`R_eq`) of the circuit and then applying Ohm's Law (`I = V / R`).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the main circuit structure:**\n    The circuit consists of a 1V DC voltage source (`V2`) connected to two main branches in parallel. Let's call the top wire (connected to the positive terminal) node A and the bottom wire (connected to ground) node G.\n\n2.  **Analyze the left branch:**\n    *   This branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n    *   Careful inspection shows a wire connecting node A directly to the point between R2 and R3.\n    *   This wire acts as a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2. Since current follows the path of least resistance, almost all the current intended for this branch will flow through the wire, bypassing R1 and R2 entirely.\n    *   Therefore, the only resistance in this branch that the current flows through is R3.\n    *   The effective resistance of the left branch (`R_left_eff`) is equal to the resistance of R3.\n    *   `R_left_eff = R3 = 9 Ω`\n\n3.  **Analyze the right branch:**\n    *   This branch contains resistors R8 (100 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω).\n    *   R8 is connected between node A and an intermediate point. R7 is connected between that same intermediate point and node G.\n    *   Since they are connected one after the other in a single path, R7 and R8 are in series.\n    *   The total resistance of the right branch (`R_right`) is the sum of their individual resistances.\n    *   `R_right = R8 + R7 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω`\n\n4.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit:**\n    *   The simplified left branch (`R_left_eff = 9 Ω`) and the right branch (`R_right = 200 Ω`) are connected in parallel across the voltage source.\n    *   The formula for the total equivalent resistance (`R_eq`) of two parallel resistors is: `1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left_eff + 1 / R_right`.\n    *   `1 / R_eq = 1/9 Ω + 1/200 Ω`\n    *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is `9 * 200 = 1800`.\n    *   `1 / R_eq = 200/1800 + 9/1800 = 209/1800 Ω⁻¹`\n    *   `R_eq = 1800 / 209 Ω ≈ 8.61 Ω`\n\n5.  **Calculate the total current:**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law, the total current (`I_total`) is the total voltage (`V2`) divided by the total equivalent resistance (`R_eq`).\n    *   `I_total = V2 / R_eq`\n    *   `I_total = 1 V / (1800 / 209 Ω)`\n    *   `I_total = 209 / 1800 A`\n\n6.  **Convert to a decimal value:**\n    *   `I_total ≈ 0.11611... A`\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is `0.116 A` or `116 mA`.\n\n**Alternative Calculation (Sum of Branch Currents):**\n\n*   **Current in left branch (`I_left`):** `I_left = V2 / R_left_eff = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.111 A`\n*   **Current in right branch (`I_right`):** `I_right = V2 / R_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A`\n*   **Total current (`I_total`):** `I_total = I_left + I_right = (1/9) A + (1/200) A = 209/1800 A ≈ 0.116 A`\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   ✓ The main structure is parallel branches.\n*   ✓ The short circuit across R1 and R2 is correctly identified.\n*   ✓ The series connection of R7 and R8 is correctly identified.\n*   ✓ Parallel resistance formula is applied correctly.\n*   ✓ Ohm's Law is applied correctly.\n*   ✓ The arithmetic is correct.\n\n<<<0.116 A>>>"
