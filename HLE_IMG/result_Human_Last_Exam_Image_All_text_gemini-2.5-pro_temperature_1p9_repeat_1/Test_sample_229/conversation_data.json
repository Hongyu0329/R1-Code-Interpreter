    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song's title, musical style, and country of origin from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Sheet Music's Characteristics:**\n    *   **Notation:** The music is written as a \"lead sheet,\" featuring a melody line on a single staff with chord symbols (C, E7, F, G7, D-, etc.) written above. This format is common in jazz, folk, and pop music to guide accompanists and improvisers.\n    *   **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature is C major / A minor. The chord progression starts and frequently resolves to C major, indicating C as the tonic. The time signature is 4/4.\n    *   **Rhythm and Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated, with many eighth notes, tied notes, and rests on the downbeats. This rhythmic complexity is a hallmark of jazz. The melodic line includes chromatic notes (like the G# in the second full measure) and arpeggios that outline the chords, suggesting a virtuosic, improvisational style.\n    *   **Harmony (Chord Progression):** The progression is more complex than simple pop or folk music. It starts with C | E7 | F | F#dim - G7... The use of a secondary dominant (E7, which would normally lead to A minor) and chromatic chords like the F# diminished seventh is characteristic of early jazz and Tin Pan Alley songwriting.\n    *   **Structure:** The sheet includes standard musical directions like D.S. al Coda (\"Dal Segno al Coda,\" meaning go back to the sign and play to the \"To Coda\" instruction, then jump to the Coda), which is common in structured popular music and jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n    *   The combination of syncopation, complex jazz harmony, and a lead sheet format strongly points to **Jazz**.\n    *   The energetic tempo (indicated partially as J=120 or higher) and the specific arpeggiated, virtuosic melodic patterns are very characteristic of the **Gypsy Jazz** (or *Jazz Manouche*) style, pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt. This song is a classic staple of that repertoire. It can also be broadly categorized as **Swing** or early jazz.\n\n3.  **Identify the Song Title:**\n    *   The opening melodic phrase and chord progression are very distinctive. The melody starting over a C major chord, moving to an E7 with a prominent G# (the major third of the E7 chord), then to an F major chord is the iconic opening of the jazz standard **\"Limehouse Blues\"**. A quick check of the standard sheet music for \"Limehouse Blues\" confirms that this is the correct tune.\n\n4.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n    *   While \"Limehouse Blues\" is most famously associated with American jazz musicians and French Gypsy Jazz artists like Django Reinhardt, the song itself was not written by them.\n    *   \"Limehouse Blues\" was composed in 1921 by **Philip Braham** (music) and **Douglas Furber** (lyrics) for the London musical revue *A to Z*.\n    *   Therefore, the song's country of origin is the **United Kingdom**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, chord progression, and historical context, the sheet music is for the song \"Limehouse Blues.\" It is presented in a style typical of Gypsy Jazz and originates from the United Kingdom.\n\n***\n\n**Title:** Limehouse Blues\n**Musical Style:** Jazz / Gypsy Jazz\n**Country of Origin:** United Kingdom"
