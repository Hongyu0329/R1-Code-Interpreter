The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the **RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products)** receptor. Based on the signaling pathway shown, S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** for neurological disorders. This is because its interaction with RAGE activates downstream pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead directly to the core pathological features of these diseases, including neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Consequently, the level of S100B would likely correlate with the severity and progression of the disease, providing crucial information about the patient's prognosis.
