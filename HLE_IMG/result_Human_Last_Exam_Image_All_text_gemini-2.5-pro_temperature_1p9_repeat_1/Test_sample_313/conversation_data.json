    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This suggests that 'X Y' is a term with a double meaning or a homonym. The key phrase is \"mercury salts.\" A prominent historical use of mercury salts (specifically mercury nitrate) was in the process of felt-making for hats. This process, called \"carroting,\" was hazardous and caused mercury poisoning in the hat makers (hatters), leading to neurological symptoms and coining the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\" This strongly implies that the answer 'X Y' is related to hats or hat-making.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\nThe clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows two men at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The man on the right, who has a beard, is receiving a trophy from the older man on the left. The specific date allows us to identify the event. The 2019 NHL Awards ceremony took place on June 19, 2019. A reverse image search or searching for award winners from that event reveals that the person on the right is Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov, who was receiving the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP award) from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\nWe need to find a two-word term 'X Y' that connects Nikita Kucherov, an ice hockey star, to the historical mercury-based hat-making process.\n*   In ice hockey, a \"hat trick\" is the feat of scoring three goals in a single game. Nikita Kucherov, as an elite goal-scorer, is famously associated with this achievement. So, the picture can be described as showing a person famous for \"Hat Tricks.\"\n*   The term \"hat trick\" originated in the sport of cricket in the mid-19th century, where a bowler who took three consecutive wickets was presented with a new hat to commemorate the achievement.\n*   The hats of that era were often felt top hats. As established in Step 1, the manufacturing process—the craft or \"trick\" of making these felt hats—used toxic mercury salts and has been discontinued.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe term \"Hat Trick\" is the correct answer.\n1.  **\"Hat Trick is pictured\"**: The image shows Nikita Kucherov, a player famous for achieving hat tricks.\n2.  **\"Another Hat Trick has almost ceased to be used\"**: This refers to the old method of manufacturing felt hats (the original reward for a hat trick), a 'trick of the trade' that used toxic mercury salts and is no longer practiced.\n\nTherefore, \"Hat Trick\" successfully bridges the information from both clues.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
