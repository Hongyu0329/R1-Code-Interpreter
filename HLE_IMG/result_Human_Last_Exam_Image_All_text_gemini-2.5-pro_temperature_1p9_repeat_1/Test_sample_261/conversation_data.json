    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image fragment displays a silvery, ethereal, horse-like creature with a single horn on its forehead. This creature is instantly recognizable as a unicorn. The unicorn appears to be in motion, running or leaping. The background is dark and shadowy, suggesting a forest setting at night. To the right of the unicorn, there's a portion of a decorative, pillar-like structure. The art style is painterly and realistic, typical of many fantasy book illustrations.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** The prominent depiction of a unicorn in a dark forest is a very specific and memorable scene. This strongly suggests a connection to the Harry Potter series. Specifically, in the first book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (titled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States), Harry encounters a unicorn in the Forbidden Forest.\n\n3.  **Identify the Artist and Edition:** The illustration style is that of Mary GrandPré, who was the illustrator for the original US editions of the Harry Potter series. She created the cover art as well as the small chapter-heading illustrations for these editions.\n\n4.  **Locate the Image on the Book:** While this specific image is a chapter-heading illustration for Chapter 15 (\"The Forbidden Forest\") inside the book, it is also prominently featured on the cover. A search for the original US cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* reveals that this exact image of the unicorn is part of the collage on the **back cover** of the hardcover and paperback editions illustrated by Mary GrandPré. The pillar-like object is the edge of the vignette's frame on the back cover design.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The fragment is from the back cover artwork of the original US edition of the first Harry Potter book.\n\nTherefore, the title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
