    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Left Hand (Bass Clef)**\n    *   Observe the note in the bottom staff (the bass clef). It is a single chord represented by open noteheads without any stem. This type of note is a whole note.\n    *   A whole note lasts for four beats, where each beat is a quarter note. Therefore, a measure containing a single whole note must have a duration equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Right Hand (Treble Clef)**\n    *   Observe the notes in the top staff (the treble clef). All the notes are connected by two horizontal beams. Notes with two beams (or two flags) are sixteenth notes.\n    *   Let's count how many sixteenth notes are in the measure.\n        *   The first group under a larger beam consists of 8 sixteenth notes (A#, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#).\n        *   The second group, also presumably under a larger beam structure, consists of chords, but each chord is played on a sixteenth note pulse. There are four such chords, followed by another four starting with the E major chord. Counting all these individual sixteenth-note events, we find there are 16 of them in total within the measure bars.\n    *   The total duration of sixteen sixteenth notes is calculated as 16 * (1/16) = 1 whole note. As established in Step 1, a whole note is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Time Signature**\n    *   Both the left hand and the right hand parts fill the measure with a total duration equivalent to four quarter notes.\n    *   A time signature is written as a fraction. The top number indicates the number of beats per measure, and the bottom number indicates the note value that gets one beat.\n    *   In this case, we have a total duration of four quarter notes. This means there are 4 beats in the measure, and the quarter note gets the beat.\n    *   This corresponds to the time signature 4/4.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices**\n    *   A. 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   B. 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   C. 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure. Correct.\n    *   D. 3/8: Three eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   E. 9/8: Nine eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of both staves confirms that the measure contains the equivalent of four quarter notes. Thus, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
