The structure of compound A is (2E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
It can be drawn as:
(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₃
where the C(CH₃)=CH double bond has an E configuration.

Here is a skeletal structure of compound A:
```
      / \
     /   \
    /     \ /
           |

```
This is a simplified line-angle formula attempt, which might not be clear. Let me represent it with explicit carbons:
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. The stereochemistry about the C2-C3 double bond (the one with the methyl group) is trans or E.
