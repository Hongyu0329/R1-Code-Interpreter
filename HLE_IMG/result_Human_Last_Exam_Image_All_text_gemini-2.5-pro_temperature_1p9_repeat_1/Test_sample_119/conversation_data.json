    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of N = 14 u. Remaining mass = 135 - 14 = 121 u.\n    *   This remaining mass must be accounted for by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Dividing 121 by 12 (mass of C) gives ~10. Let's try plausible combinations.\n    *   If C = 9, mass = 9 * 12 = 108. Remaining mass for H = 121 - 108 = 13.\n    *   This gives a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify its mass: (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This matches the M+ peak.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The peak at m/z = 91 is a strong indicator of a tropylium ion ([C₇H₇]⁺), which forms from a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-). This further supports the presence of a substituted benzene ring. The peak at m/z = 30 is characteristic of [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, suggesting an amine function.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two distinct, medium peaks are visible. This is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Sharp peaks indicating C-H stretching of sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicating C-H stretching of sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic groups).\n*   **~1600, 1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~690-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this \"out-of-plane bending\" region suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **δ ~7.2-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This signal corresponds to the five protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The remaining protons (13 total - 5 aromatic = 8) are in the aliphatic region. Let's analyze the signals:\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ≈ 3H):** This represents a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single adjacent proton (-CH). This indicates a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm (complex multiplet, total integration ≈ 3H):** This complex region contains the signals for the remaining two aliphatic groups, a -CH₂- group (2H) and a -CH- group (1H).\n    *   There is also likely a broad signal for the -NH₂ protons (2H), which may be underneath other signals or not clearly resolved. The provided integrations add up to ~13H (5.00 + 1.96 + 0.97 + 3.24 + 1.99 ≈ 13), confirming all protons are accounted for.\n\n**Step 4: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 7 unique carbon signals. A monosubstituted benzene ring has 4 signals due to symmetry (1 ipso-, 1 para-, 1 ortho-, 1 meta-), leaving 3 signals for the side chain. This matches the C₃H₈N side chain deduced earlier.\n*   **Chemical Shifts (δ):**\n    *   Aromatic Region: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. The peak at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon (attached to the side chain). The other three are CH carbons.\n    *   Aliphatic Region: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. These correspond to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** \"one negative and five positive signals.\"\n    *   Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   The 5 positive signals are the 3 aromatic CH carbons, one aliphatic CH, and one aliphatic CH₃.\n    *   The 1 negative signal must be an aliphatic CH₂ group.\n    *   Conclusion: The C₃ side chain is composed of one -CH₃ group, one -CH- group, and one -CH₂- group.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation and HSQC Analysis**\n*   From the above data, we have a monosubstituted phenyl ring (C₆H₅-) attached to a C₃H₈N side chain containing -CH₃, -CH-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂ fragments.\n*   The presence of the -CH-CH₃ fragment (from ¹H NMR) leads to two possible isomers:\n    1.  **1-phenyl-2-propanamine:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    2.  **2-phenyl-1-propanamine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) Analysis** correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   The 1H doublet at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the 13C signal at 19.2 ppm. This confirms the assignment of the **-CH₃** group.\n    *   The ¹H signals in the 2.7-3.0 ppm range (~3H) correlate to the ¹³C signals at 43.5 and 49.6 ppm. By comparing the integrations, we can assign these:\n        *   The ~2H signal (from the -CH₂- group) correlates to the carbon at **43.5 ppm**.\n        *   The ~1H signal (from the -CH- group) correlates to the carbon at **49.6 ppm**.\n*   **Differentiating the Isomers:**\n    *   In **1-phenyl-2-propanamine**, the CH₂ group is benzylic (C₆H₅-CH₂-) and the CH group is attached to the amine (-CH(NH₂)-). The experimental assignment δ(CH₂) = 43.5 ppm and δ(CH) = 49.6 ppm is very plausible (benzylic carbons are typically ~40-45 ppm; carbons attached to N are ~45-55 ppm).\n    *   In **2-phenyl-1-propanamine**, the CH group is benzylic (C₆H₅-CH-) and the CH₂ group is attached to the amine (-CH₂-NH₂). The experimental data would require δ(CH) = 49.6 ppm and δ(CH₂) = 43.5 ppm. This assignment is less likely, as the carbon attached to the nitrogen is usually more deshielded (further downfield) than the benzylic carbon.\n*   Thus, all evidence points to the structure being **1-phenyl-2-propanamine**.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Name**\n*   Identify the principal functional group: Amine. The suffix is \"-amine\".\n*   Identify the longest carbon chain containing the amine: A three-carbon chain (propane). So, the parent name is \"propanamine\".\n*   Number the chain to give the amine the lowest possible number: The amine is on carbon 2. The name becomes \"propan-2-amine\".\n*   Identify and name the substituent: A phenyl group at position 1. The name becomes \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\".\n\nThe final IUPAC name for the compound is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
