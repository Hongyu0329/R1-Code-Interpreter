    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from an ancient Greek vase, painted in the red-figure style with added white paint. The scene is dramatic and full of action. We can identify several key figures and objects:\n    *   A two-wheeled chariot pulled by at least one white horse.\n    *   Two figures are inside the chariot. The one on the left is the driver, wearing a patterned garment and a decorated cap (a Phrygian cap). The figure on the right is a woman, draped in cloth.\n    *   Above the driver, a small winged figure, identifiable as Eros (the god of love), is flying.\n    *   A naked male figure is on the ground, positioned under the chariot's path, seemingly having fallen or been run over. He is in a position suggesting defeat or death.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological context.**\n    The collection of characters—a chariot, a couple, Eros, and a defeated man—points strongly to a specific Greek myth: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus for the hand of the king's daughter, Hippodamia.\n    *   **The Driver:** This is Pelops, the suitor. His Phrygian cap is a common attribute, alluding to his Lydian/Anatolian origins.\n    *   **The Female Passenger:** This is Hippodamia, the princess whose hand Pelops has won in the race.\n    *   **Eros:** His presence signifies that the race was undertaken for love and marriage.\n    *   **The Fallen Man:** This is King Oenomaus, Hippodamia's father. According to the myth, he challenged all of his daughter's suitors to a chariot race, which he had always won, killing the losers. Pelops, with divine help or through subterfuge (bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the chariot), finally defeated and killed him. The figure's position on the ground represents his defeat and death.\n\n*   **Step 3: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This phrasing can be interpreted as the person being left behind by the chariot or the one who has just fallen from a chariot. In this narrative, the victorious chariot of Pelops and Hippodamia is moving forward, leaving the defeated King Oenomaus on the ground. Oenomaus has just been violently ejected from his own chariot (which has crashed, though it is not depicted) during the race. Therefore, the figure who fits the description of \"leaving the chariot\" (involuntarily and violently) and being left behind is Oenomaus.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
