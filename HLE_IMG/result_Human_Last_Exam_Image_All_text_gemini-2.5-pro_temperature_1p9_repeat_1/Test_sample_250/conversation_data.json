    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   **Key Signature**: There is one flat (B♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key of F Major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   **Tonal Center**: The piece begins and ends on an F minor chord (F-). The frequent use of C7 (the dominant of F) confirms that the piece is in the key of F minor.\n*   **Time Signature**: The music is in 4/4 time, common for jazz standards and Bossa Novas.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression (Harmony)**\n*   The first four bars have a very distinctive and recognizable progression:\n    *   **Bar 1:** F- (i chord in F minor)\n    *   **Bar 2:** E-7♭5 (or Eø7). This is the vii°7 chord of F minor, often functioning as a lead-in to the ♭VI chord.\n    *   **Bar 3:** E♭6 (♭VI chord). The 6th (C) is included.\n    *   **Bar 4:** D♭maj7 (♭VIMaj7, but written enharmonically here it's the ♭V maj7). It acts as the ♭VI of F minor, but often written as D♭ in this context. This chromatic descending progression from the tonic (F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭) is a strong identifying feature.\n*   The bridge (the middle section starting at measure 12) has a typical jazz progression using ii-V-I patterns to modulate:\n    *   **Bars 12-13:** D-7♭5 -> G7 (a ii-V progression leading to C)\n    *   **Bars 14-15:** C7 -> F7 (a V-I progression leading to B♭)\n    *   **Bars 16-17:** B♭-7 -> E♭7 (a ii-V progression leading to A♭)\n    *   **Bars 18-20:** A♭ -> G -> C7 (moves from the new tonal area back to the dominant, C7, to resolve to F- at the top of the next section).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   **Bar 1:** The melody starts on C, the 5th of the F minor scale, and moves to G, then A♭. The notes are C - G - A♭.\n*   **Bar 2:** The melody moves to F, then E♭.\n*   **Bar 3:** The melody moves to D♭, then C.\n*   The combination of this melodic contour with the unique chord progression strongly points to a specific tune.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Tune and Composer**\n*   The chord progression `Fm | Eø7 | E♭6 | D♭maj7...` and the opening melodic phrase `C G A♭ | F E♭...` are the signature elements of the jazz standard **\"Recorda Me\"**.\n*   This piece was composed by the acclaimed tenor saxophonist **Joe Henderson**. It was first recorded on his debut album *Page One* in 1963 and is one of his most famous compositions. It's often performed with a Bossa Nova or Latin jazz feel.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   There can be slight variations in the chord changes from one lead sheet to another (e.g., E♭maj7 vs. E♭6, or G7 vs. G-7♭5). However, the core progression identified in Step 2 is unmistakable.\n*   It is important not to confuse this tune with \"Recado Bossa Nova\" by Djalma Ferreira or \"No More Blues (Chega de Saudade)\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim, which are different compositions sometimes confused due to their Bossa Nova style. The melody and harmony in the provided image definitively identify it as Joe Henderson's tune.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the melody and harmony:\n**Title:** Recorda Me\n**Composer:** Joe Henderson\n\n<<<Title: Recorda Me, Composer: Joe Henderson>>>"
