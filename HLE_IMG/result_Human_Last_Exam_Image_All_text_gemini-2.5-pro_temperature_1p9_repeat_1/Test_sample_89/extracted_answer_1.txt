The structure of product A is N-acetyl-Î²-alanine.
The structure of product B is hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one.
The structure of product C is succinimide.

**A:**

        A2 -- double --> O1(O);

        A5 -- single --> O3(O);
        O3 -- single --> H5(H);
    end

**B:**
```mermaid

    subgraph Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one

        N1 --- C5(C);

The graph for B represents the connectivity:
```
      (C3)-[CH2]--(N1)--[CH2]-(C5)
       |           |           |
      [CH2]--[CH]-(C7)--[CH2]-(C6)
       |
      (C2)=O
```
Let's try a better representation for the bicyclic structure B:
*   A 5-membered ring: N1-C5-C6-C7-N1 (this is wrong) -> N1 is connected to C3, C7 and C1. C1-C2-C3 is one chain. C5-C6-C7 is another chain. Let's redraw. A five-membered ring is N-C-C-C-C. And another five membered ring fused.
The structure of hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one is: A nitrogen atom is shared by two fused five-membered rings. One ring contains a carbonyl group at the 3-position.
N(bridgehead)-C1H2-C2H2-C3(=O)-[CH(7a)]-(N)
N(bridgehead)-C7H2-C6H2-C5H2-[CH(7a)]-(N)

**C:**

graph TD
    subgraph Succinimide
        N1(N) --- C1(C);
        N1 --- C2(C);
        N1 --- H1(H);
        C1 -- double --> O1(O);
        C1 --- C3(C);
        C2 -- double --> O2(O);
        C2 --- C4(C);
        C3 -- 2x --> H2(H);
        C3 --- C4;
        C4 -- 2x --> H3(H);
    end
