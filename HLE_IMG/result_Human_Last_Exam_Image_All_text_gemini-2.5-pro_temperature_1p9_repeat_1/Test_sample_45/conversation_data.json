    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry means the property that a shape or pattern looks the same after a certain amount of rotation around a central point. An n-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern looks the same after a rotation of 360/n degrees. We need to find the value(s) of 'n' for this pattern. When a pattern has multiple centers with different symmetries, \"the\" rotational symmetry usually refers to the highest order of symmetry present.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the component shapes and potential centers of rotation**\nThe tiling is constructed from three types of polygons:\n1.  Dark blue regular hexagons.\n2.  Light beige regular squares.\n3.  Orange rhombi (four-sided figures with sides of equal length).\n\nThe centers of the regular polygons (hexagons and squares) are natural candidates for centers of rotational symmetry. The centers of the rhombi are also candidates.\n\n**Step 3: Test the center of a hexagon for rotational symmetry**\nLet's focus on one of the dark blue hexagons and consider its center as a point of rotation.\n*   A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. By itself, it has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   Now, let's examine its surroundings in the tiling. Each side of the hexagon is adjacent to an orange rhombus. Beyond the rhombi are beige squares and other hexagons.\n*   If we rotate the entire tiling by 360/6 = 60 degrees around the center of the hexagon, the central hexagon rotates onto its own footprint.\n*   Observing the surrounding tiles, we see that each of the 6 rhombi moves into the position previously occupied by an identical rhombus. Likewise, each of the 6 nearby squares moves into the position of an identical square.\n*   The entire pattern coincides with its original position after a 60-degree rotation. This can be repeated 6 times in a full 360-degree turn.\n*   Therefore, the center of each hexagon is a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Test the center of a square for rotational symmetry**\nLet's now consider the center of one of the light beige squares as a point of rotation.\n*   A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry by itself.\n*   In the tiling, four orange rhombi are arranged symmetrically around the vertices of the square, forming a star-like motif.\n*   If we rotate the tiling by 360/4 = 90 degrees around the center of the square, the square rotates onto its own footprint.\n*   Each of the four \"arms\" of the star-like motif (made of rhombi) moves into the position of the next arm. The entire local neighborhood maps onto itself.\n*   Therefore, the center of each square is a center of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 5: Test for other rotational symmetries**\nThe pattern also exhibits 2-fold rotational symmetry about the center of each orange rhombus. A 180-degree rotation maps the rhombus and its surroundings onto themselves. The tiling also has centers of 3-fold symmetry, although they are located at vertices that are slightly harder to pinpoint visually than the centers of the polygons.\n\n**Step 6: Determine \"the\" rotational symmetry**\nThe tiling possesses centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. In geometry and crystallography, the symmetry of a pattern is typically classified by its \"wallpaper group,\" and the group's name often reflects the highest order of rotational symmetry present. Since the highest order of rotational symmetry found in this pattern is 6-fold, this is considered the defining rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
