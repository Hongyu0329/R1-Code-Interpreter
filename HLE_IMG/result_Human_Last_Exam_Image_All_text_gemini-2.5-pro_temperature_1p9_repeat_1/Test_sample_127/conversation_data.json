    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, H, J, K, and L, can rotate freely about the single bond that connects them to the main structure of the cation.\n\n2.  **Principle of Rotational Freedom:** For a phenyl ring connected to another ring system by a single bond, \"free rotation\" is primarily dictated by steric hindrance. The key factor is the presence of bulky groups on the atoms adjacent to the point of connection. These are called the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **Hindered Rotation:** If there are bulky substituents at **both** ortho positions on the parent ring, the phenyl ring's rotation will be sterically blocked.\n    *   **Free Rotation:** If **at least one** of the ortho positions on the parent ring is unsubstituted (i.e., has a small hydrogen atom), there is significantly less steric clash, and the phenyl ring is generally considered to be able to rotate freely.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Phenyl Ring's Environment:** We will examine the parent ring for each phenyl substituent and check the groups at its two ortho positions.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   **Attachment Point:** Ring G is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of the pyridine ring F.\n        *   **Ortho Positions on Ring F:** The atoms adjacent to C6 on ring F are the nitrogen atom at position 1 (N1) and the carbon atom at position 5 (C5).\n        *   **Substituents at Ortho Positions:**\n            *   N1 is coordinated to the Iridium (Ir) atom. This is a very bulky and rigid part of the complex.\n            *   C5 is unsubstituted, so it has a hydrogen atom (H), which is very small.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since only one ortho position (N1) is blocked by a bulky group while the other (C5) is open, **Ring G can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring H:**\n        *   **Attachment Point:** Ring H is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of the phenyl ring A.\n        *   **Ortho Positions on Ring A:** The atoms adjacent to C4 are C3 and C5.\n        *   **Substituents at Ortho Positions:**\n            *   C3 of ring A is connected to the pyridine ring B. This is a bulky group.\n            *   C5 of ring A is connected to the phenyl ring K. This is also a bulky group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since both ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, **the rotation of Ring H is hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:**\n        *   **Attachment Point:** Ring J is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of the phenyl ring C.\n        *   **Ortho Positions on Ring C:** The atoms adjacent to C4 are C3 and C5.\n        *   **Substituents at Ortho Positions:**\n            *   C3 of ring C is connected to the pyridine ring D. This is a bulky group.\n            *   C5 of ring C is connected to the phenyl ring L. This is also a bulky group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since both ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, **the rotation of Ring J is hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:**\n        *   **Attachment Point:** Ring K is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of the phenyl ring A.\n        *   **Ortho Positions on Ring A:** The atoms adjacent to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   **Substituents at Ortho Positions:**\n            *   C4 of ring A is connected to the phenyl ring H. This is a bulky group.\n            *   C6 of ring A is bonded to the Iridium (Ir) center (cyclometalation). This creates a very bulky and rigid environment.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since both ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, **the rotation of Ring K is hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:**\n        *   **Attachment Point:** Ring L is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of the phenyl ring C.\n        *   **Ortho Positions on Ring C:** The atoms adjacent to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   **Substituents at Ortho Positions:**\n            *   C4 of ring C is connected to the phenyl ring J. This is a bulky group.\n            *   C6 of ring C is bonded to the Iridium (Ir) center. This creates a very bulky and rigid environment.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since both ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups, **the rotation of Ring L is hindered**.\n\n4.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Ring G: Free rotation (one ortho H).\n    *   Ring H: Hindered rotation (two bulky ortho groups).\n    *   Ring J: Hindered rotation (two bulky ortho groups).\n    *   Ring K: Hindered rotation (two bulky ortho groups).\n    *   Ring L: Hindered rotation (two bulky ortho groups).\n\n    Therefore, only ring G can rotate freely.\n\n<<<K>>>"
