**Product A** is the [2+2] cycloaddition adduct of ketene onto the initial [3+2] cycloadduct. It has a tetracyclic skeleton containing a pyrrolizidine fused with a cyclobutanone ring.

**Product B** is an aromatic pyrrolizine derivative. It is formed by aromatization of the initial cycloadduct followed by oxidation of the N-substituent to a lactam.

**Product C** is a tricyclic fused pyridone derivative, formed from the starting material via an intramolecular cyclization-condensation reaction promoted by acetic anhydride.
