    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided text description.**\n    *   The text describes an \"illusion\" that is similar to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives, and our perception can flip between them. This suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain actively interpreting ambiguous or incomplete sensory information.\n    *   The text also states that this phenomenon \"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's something our brain does automatically in everyday life, not just a laboratory curiosity.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the provided image.**\n    *   The image consists of two graphs. The top graph is a spectrogram, which shows the intensity of different frequencies of a sound over time. We can see a strong, thin horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is interrupted in the middle by a short, vertical smear, which represents a burst of noise (sound across a wide range of frequencies). Critically, the horizontal line for the tone is physically absent during the noise burst.\n    *   The bottom graph is a waveform, showing the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, we see a perfect, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes chaotic and irregular, corresponding to the noise burst. On the right, the perfect sine wave resumes.\n    *   Both graphs visually represent the same event: a pure tone that is stopped, replaced by a short burst of noise, and then started again.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the text and image analysis.**\n    *   The stimulus shown is a sound (a tone) that is physically missing a segment, which is \"filled\" by a different sound (noise).\n    *   When people listen to this sound, they typically do not perceive the tone as stopping and starting. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted *behind* the noise burst.\n    *   The brain \"fills in\" or \"restores\" the missing part of the tone, creating the illusion of continuity. This is a powerful, unconscious perceptual ability that helps us hear continuous speech and music in noisy environments.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" is an active interpretation by the brain, resolving the ambiguity of whether there were two separate tones or one continuous tone masked by noise. The brain defaults to the more likely real-world scenario of a continuous sound.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\n    *   This auditory illusion is known as the **phonemic restoration effect**. It was named by Richard Warren, who first demonstrated it by replacing a phoneme (a basic unit of sound in speech) in a sentence with a cough or a buzz. Listeners reported hearing both the complete word and the noise, believing the noise was merely superimposed on the speech.\n    *   While the term \"phonemic\" refers to speech sounds, the effect works with non-speech sounds like pure tones as well, as shown in the image. In this more general context, it can also be called the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. However, \"phonemic restoration effect\" is the most widely known and cited name for this entire class of perceptual completion phenomena.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
