    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam (an amide in a ring). Let's identify its components.\n    *   The core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. Let's count the atoms in this core structure:\n        *   Carbons: 6 (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7).\n        *   Hydrogens on the unsubstituted core: 7 (one each on C1, C4, C5, C6; two on C7; one on N2). Formula: C6H7NO.\n    *   It has three substituents:\n        *   A carbonyl group (=O) at position C3 (this is part of the lactam name -en-3-one).\n        *   A trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) at position C5.\n        *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (–PMB) on the nitrogen atom (N2). The formula for PMB is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n*   Now, let's calculate the molecular formula of the entire starting molecule:\n    *   Let's count the atoms from the structure:\n        *   PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3): Contains 8 carbons (1+6+1), 9 hydrogens (2+4+3), and 1 oxygen. Formula: C8H9O.\n        *   CF3 group: Contains 1 carbon and 3 fluorines. Formula: CF3.\n        *   Bicyclic lactam core:\n            *   Carbons: C1, C3(C=O), C4, C5(C-CF3), C6, C7(CH2). This is 6 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens: H at C1, H at C4, H at C6, two H's at C7. Total of 5 hydrogens on the carbon framework.\n            *   Nitrogen: 1 N atom.\n            *   Oxygen: 1 O atom (in the C=O group).\n    *   Summing all parts:\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n        *   Fluorines (F): 3 (from CF3)\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 1 (from core)\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB methoxy) = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. The PMB group is cleaved from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group (-C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen to form a secondary amide (lactam).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** Loss of the PMB group means subtracting C8H9O. Adding a hydrogen atom means adding H. The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:** C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) in the bicyclic ring.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene is converted to an alkane. This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** Addition of H2.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 2 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide (in this case, a cyclic amide or lactam). The strong acid and heat cause the cleavage of the amide bond (the N2-C3 bond).\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The amide bond is broken, opening the ring. The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** Addition of one water molecule (H2O).\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n*   The product is an amino acid with a cyclopentane core, specifically 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (the exact numbering depends on IUPAC conventions, but the connectivity and atom count are determined by the ring-opening).\n\n**Final Calculation Summary:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (CAN): - C8H8O → Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (Pd/C, H2): + H2 → Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (HCl, H2O, heat): + H2O → Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
