The reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is that the starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a rigid bicyclic munchone intermediate. This rigidity is due to the pyrrolidine ring connecting the N3 and C4 positions of the munchone core. This structural constraint prevents the munchone from undergoing thermal isomerization to an isomeric munchone. This isomerization, which is responsible for the scrambling of substituents observed in Reactions 1 and 2, proceeds through a transient acylamino ketene intermediate. The formation of this ketene from the proline-derived munchone is geometrically prohibited (a violation of Bredt's rule), as it would require forming a highly strained allene at a bridgehead carbon. Since isomerization is blocked, only a single munchone intermediate is formed and reacts, leading to a single product. Reactions 1 and 2 provide crucial evidence for this mechanism by showing that in an analogous acyclic system where there is no such geometric constraint, the isomerization does occur, leading to a loss of regiochemical integrity (scrambling) as observed by the 13C labeling experiment. Thus, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 confirm that the structural difference between the acyclic and cyclic starting materials is the origin of the differing outcomes.
