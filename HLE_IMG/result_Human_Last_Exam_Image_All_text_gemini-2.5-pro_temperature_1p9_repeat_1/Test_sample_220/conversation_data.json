    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**1. Understanding the FCC Crystal Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n**2. Understanding the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction corresponds to a vector pointing along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. Viewing the crystal along this direction means we are looking at the projection of the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to this direction. The primary axes on this projection plane will be the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction, which are perpendicular to each other and to the [110] viewing direction.\n\n**3. Theoretical Projection of FCC along [110]**\nWhen an FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D pattern. The atoms in an FCC structure lie on a series of parallel (110) planes. These planes are stacked in an ABABAB... sequence.\n*   **Layer A** atoms will project onto the corners of a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle correspond to the lattice constant 'a' (along the [001] direction) and 'a√2' (along the [1-10] direction).\n*   **Layer B** atoms are shifted relative to Layer A. They project onto the exact center of the rectangle formed by the atoms of Layer A.\nThe resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the pattern consists of repeating rectangular units, each having atoms at its four corners and one atom in its center.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Given Images**\n\nNow, let's analyze each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangular lattice\" pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. You can identify repeating rectangular units with atoms only at the corners. There are no atoms in the center of these rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a **simple cubic (SC)** lattice viewed along the [110] direction. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in this image appear to be arranged in a parallelogram or oblique lattice rather than a rectangular one. The overall arrangement seems less ordered and does not fit the high symmetry of a [110] projection. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** In this image, the atoms are arranged in a pattern that exhibits six-fold rotational symmetry (or hexagonal/triangular arrangements). For instance, an atom is surrounded by six neighbors in a somewhat hexagonal fashion. This pattern is characteristic of an **FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction**, where one is looking down onto the stacked hexagonal (111) planes. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular pattern**. We can identify a repeating unit:\n    *   A rectangle can be formed by four atoms, for example, those at approximate coordinates (1.5, 6), (5, 6), (1.5, 12), and (5, 12).\n    *   In the center of this rectangle, at approximately (3.25, 9) — which is the geometric center of `((1.5+5)/2, (6+12)/2)` — there is another atom.\n    *   This \"corner atoms + center atom\" unit repeats throughout the structure shown in the image.\n    This pattern perfectly matches the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, Image D is the only one that shows the characteristic centered rectangular lattice pattern of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
