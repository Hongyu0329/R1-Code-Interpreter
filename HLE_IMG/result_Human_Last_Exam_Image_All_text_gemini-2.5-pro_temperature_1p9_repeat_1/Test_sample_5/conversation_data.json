    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis of Musical Elements:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The score is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** It is in 4/4 time, also known as common time.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature. This indicates the key is likely C major or its relative, A minor.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80 bpm (beats per minute), which is a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Measure-by-Measure Musical Character Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins softly (`p` for piano). The right hand plays a simple, ascending melodic line (G4, then B4-C5-D5-E5), while the left hand holds a G major chord and then a low C. This opening is gentle and lyrical. The melody is memorable and has a hopeful or nostalgic quality.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic changes abruptly to forte (`f`). The character becomes agitated and energetic, with fast, continuous 16th notes in both hands.\n    *   **Harmonic Shift:** The harmony also changes drastically. While the opening is in a clear C major/G major context, measure 3 is strongly rooted in A minor. The left hand plays A minor octaves, and the right hand plays a fast passage based on the A harmonic minor scale (E-F#-G#-A).\n    *   **Measures 4-11:** The piece continues with this fast-paced, virtuosic 16th-note texture. There are shifts in dynamics (mp in measure 4, mf in measure 8) and complex harmonic progressions, creating a very rich and powerful sound. The writing style is highly pianistic, with block chords and rapid arpeggios.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Piece:**\n    *   The most significant clue is the stark contrast between the simple, gentle opening theme and the immediate explosion into a fast, agitated A minor section. This dramatic transition is a hallmark of the piece.\n    *   The melodic fragment B-C-D-E in measure 2 is the core of the main theme.\n    *   While the style might initially suggest a romantic-era composer like Chopin or Liszt due to its virtuosity and emotional range, the specific combination of this gentle melody and the subsequent A minor passage points directly to a famous piece from a film score.\n    *   The music is \"A Town with an Ocean View\" (Japanese: 海の見える街, Umi no Mieru Machi), composed by Joe Hisaishi for the 1989 Studio Ghibli animated film *Kiki's Delivery Service*. This specific score is a virtuosic piano arrangement of the original orchestral piece.\n\nIn conclusion, the piece is identifiable by its iconic melodic opening in C major, followed by a sudden, energetic development in A minor, a structure that perfectly matches Joe Hisaishi's composition.\n\n<<<A Town with an Ocean View>>>"
