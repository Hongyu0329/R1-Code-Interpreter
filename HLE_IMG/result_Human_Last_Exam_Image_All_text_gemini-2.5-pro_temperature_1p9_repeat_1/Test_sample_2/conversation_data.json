    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Logic**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its execution for `n > 1`:\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)`: First, it recursively calls itself to sort the prefix of the array, i.e., the first `n-1` elements `a[0...n-2]`. After this step, we can assume `a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`.\n    - `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then compares the last element of the segment (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last (`a[n-2]`). Since the prefix `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element within that prefix.\n    - `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, they are swapped. This operation might disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix because the old `a[n-2]` is moved to position `n-1` but a new, smaller element (the old `a[n-1]`) is moved to position `n-2`.\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the potentially disordered prefix, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` once more.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Scenario**\n    The time complexity depends on how many times the recursive calls are made. The most expensive path is taken when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, because this triggers a second recursive call on `sort(a, n - 1)`. We need to find an input that makes this condition true at every step of the recursion.\n    - The condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is checked *after* the first `sort(a, n - 1)` has executed.\n    - At this point, the subarray `a[0...n-2]` is sorted. So, `a[n-2]` is the maximum element among the original first `n-1` elements.\n    - To make the condition true, the element at `a[n-1]` must be smaller than the maximum of the other elements.\n    - A classic example of an input that causes this behavior is an array sorted in reverse (descending) order, like `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. For any `n`, the element at `a[n-1]` will be the smallest, and `a[n-2]` (after the first sort) will be the largest. The condition will always be met.\n    - Therefore, the worst-case scenario occurs when the input array is sorted in descending order, forcing both recursive calls to be executed at every level of recursion.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Recurrence Relation**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for sorting an array of size `n` in the worst case.\n    - The base case is for `n <= 1`, which takes constant time. We can denote this as `T(1) = c₁`.\n    - For `n > 1`, in the worst case, the algorithm performs:\n        1.  One call to `sort(a, n - 1)`: `T(n-1)`\n        2.  A comparison and a swap: constant time, `c₂`\n        3.  A second call to `sort(a, n - 1)`: `T(n-1)`\n    - Combining these gives the recurrence relation for the worst-case time:\n      `T(n) = T(n - 1) + c₂ + T(n - 1) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c₂`\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` by expansion:\n    - `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    - `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    - `T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    - After `k` steps, the pattern is: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n    - The recursion stops when it reaches the base case `T(1)`, which happens when `n-k = 1`, or `k = n-1`.\n    - Substituting `k = n-1`:\n      `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    - `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c₁ + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    - `T(n) = (c₁ + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    - The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n5.  **Final Complexity**\n    The time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is exponential. In Big O notation, constants are ignored, and `O(2^(n-1))` is simplified to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is `O(2^n)`. This matches option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
