The prominent peaks in the provided XRD patterns for CuO nanoparticles are indexed by comparing their 2θ positions with the standard JCPDS data (Card No. 45-0937) for monoclinic CuO (tenorite). The following table lists the approximate peak positions and their corresponding Miller indices (h k l).

| Approximate 2θ (degree) | Miller Indices (h k l) |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 32.5                    | (110)                  |
| 35.5                    | (-111)                 |
| 38.7                    | (111)                  |
| 48.7                    | (-202)                 |
| 53.5                    | (020)                  |
