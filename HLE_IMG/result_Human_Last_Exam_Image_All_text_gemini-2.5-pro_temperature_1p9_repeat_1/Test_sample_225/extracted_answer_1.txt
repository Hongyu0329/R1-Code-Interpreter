The structure of compound A is Tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methanol.
A central carbon atom is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and three 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl groups. Each 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl group is a benzene ring substituted by two hydroxyl groups at the ortho (2) and meta (3) positions relative to the point of attachment to the central carbon.
The chemical formula is C₁₉H₁₆O₇.
Here is the structure represented by a SMILES string: OC(c1cccc(O)c1O)(c1cccc(O)c1O)c1cccc(O)c1O.
The image representation would be a central carbon atom with tetrahedral geometry, connected to an OH group and three identical 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl radicals.
