    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** A substituted cyclobutene. The structure is 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene. Let's analyze its stereochemistry. The double bond is between C1 and C2. A methoxy (MeO) group is on C1. A quaternary center is at C4, with a methyl (Me) group shown as a wedge (pointing out of the page) and a methoxy (OMe) group shown as a dash (pointing into the page). This is a chiral molecule, and a single enantiomer is drawn.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCO2Et). This is the dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Condition:** Heat (Δ). This indicates that the reactions are thermally promoted pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step 2: The Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n*   The first step is a 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n*   The bond that breaks is the σ-bond between the two sp3-hybridized carbons, C3 and C4.\n*   This reaction transforms the cyclobutene into a conjugated 1,3-diene. Let's determine the structure and stereochemistry of the diene intermediate.\n*   The substituents on the original sp2 carbons (C1, C2) will be on the internal carbons of the new diene. The substituents on the original sp3 carbons (C3, C4) will be on the terminal carbons of the new diene.\n*   Let's trace the atoms and substituents:\n    *   Original C1 had a `MeO` group.\n    *   Original C2 had a hydrogen.\n    *   Original C3 had two hydrogens.\n    *   Original C4 had a `Me` and an `OMe` group.\n*   The resulting diene will have the structure `(subs on C3)-C=C(subs on C2)-C(subs on C1)=C-(subs on C4)`.\n*   Let's substitute them in: `H2C = CH - C(OMe) = C(Me,OMe)`.\n*   A carbon atom cannot be part of a double bond and also have two other substituents like `Me` and `OMe` (this would make it pentavalent). This indicates that the initial interpretation of the starting material's connectivity or the standard opening mechanism is incorrect for this specific substrate, or there is a typo in the reactant's structure.\n*   A more plausible scenario that leads to the observed products is a retro-Diels-Alder analysis of the products. Let's work backward from the products.\n\n**Step 3: Retro-Diels-Alder Analysis of the Products**\n*   All the product options (A-H) are stereoisomers of the same cyclohexene derivative. Let's deduce the structure of the diene and dienophile that would form them.\n*   The dienophile is given as ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CHCO2Et`). In the cyclohexene product, its atoms will be a `CH2` group adjacent to a `CH(CO2Et)` group.\n*   Let's examine the structure of Product A. It is a six-membered ring with one double bond. We can identify a `CH(CO2Et)` group next to a `CH2` group. The rest of the ring must come from the diene.\n*   Let's number the ring in product A starting from the quaternary carbon as C1 and going clockwise: `C1(Me,OMe) - C2(H) = C3(MeO) - C4(CHCO2Et) - C5(CH2) - C6(CH2) - C1`.\n*   The dienophile fragment is `C4-C5`. So, the diene must have come from the `C6-C1-C2-C3` fragment.\n*   The structure of the diene must therefore be `C6=C1-C2=C3` with its substituents: `CH2=C(Me,OMe)-CH=C(H,OMe)`.\n*   This diene is `2-methyl-2,4-dimethoxy-1,3-butadiene`. Let's recheck valency: C at the C2 position has 4 bonds (to Me, OMe, C1 and C3), so it should be sp3, but here it's shown as part of a double bond.\n*   There seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement (either the reactant or the products). However, there is a way to solve this by focusing on the stereochemical rules and the final product structures.\n    *   The problem asks for two products from an *endo* Diels-Alder.\n    *   The *endo rule* states that the electron-withdrawing group on the dienophile (`-CO2Et`) orients itself under the π-system of the diene in the transition state. This results in the `CO2Et` group being *cis* to the substituents on the nearby internal carbons of the diene in the final product.\n    *   In the product structure, the `CO2Et` is at C4. The nearest substituent from the diene's internal carbons is the `MeO` group at C3. Therefore, for an *endo* product, the `CO2Et` group and the `MeO` group must be *cis* (both wedge or both dash).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Endo Products**\nLet's examine the stereochemistry of products A-H to see which ones satisfy the *endo* condition (`cis` relationship between MeO at C3 and CO2Et at C4).\n*   **A:** MeO at C3 is dash (down), CO2Et at C4 is dash (down). They are **cis**. This is an **endo** product.\n*   **B:** MeO at C3 is wedge (up), CO2Et at C4 is dash (down). They are *trans*. This is an *exo* product.\n*   **C:** MeO at C3 is dash (down), CO2Et at C4 is dash (down). They are **cis**. This is an **endo** product.\n*   **D:** MeO at C3 is wedge (up), CO2Et at C4 is dash (down). They are *trans*. This is an *exo* product.\n*   **E:** MeO at C3 is dash (down), CO2Et at C4 is wedge (up). They are *trans*. This is an *exo* product.\n*   **F:** MeO at C3 is wedge (up), CO2Et at C4 is wedge (up). They are **cis**. This is an **endo** product.\n*   **G:** MeO at C3 is dash (down), CO2Et at C4 is wedge (up). They are *trans*. This is an *exo* product.\n*   **H:** MeO at C3 is wedge (up), CO2Et at C4 is wedge (up). They are **cis**. This is an **endo** product.\n\nThe potential endo products are A, C, F, and H.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Two Final Products**\n*   The reaction starts with a single enantiomer of a chiral cyclobutene.\n*   The conrotatory ring opening can generally occur in two different ways, leading to two diastereomeric diene intermediates (e.g., an E-isomer and a Z-isomer). These intermediates are also chiral and are diastereomers of each other.\n*   Each of these two diastereomeric dienes will react with the achiral ethyl acrylate in an endo fashion to produce two final products that are diastereomers of each other.\n*   Let's compare the structures of the endo products A and C.\n    *   Product A: Stereochemistry at C1 is Me(wedge), OMe(dash).\n    *   Product C: Stereochemistry at C1 is Me(wedge), OMe(dash).\n*   Since A and C have the same stereochemistry at the quaternary center (C1), they must have originated from the same enantiomer of the starting material. They differ in the stereochemistry at the C2 carbon (relative position of the hydrogen atom), which reflects the E/Z geometry of the diene precursor. Thus, A and C are the two diastereomeric products formed from the reaction of the two diastereomeric diene intermediates.\n*   A similar analysis shows that F and H are the two diastereomeric products that would be formed from the enantiomer of the starting material. (Note that A and H are enantiomers, and C and F are enantiomers).\n*   Given that we start with the specific enantiomer of the cyclobutene shown, the two products will be the diastereomers **A** and **C**."
