    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to identify the full name of the artist of the provided watercolor painting.\n2.  **Initial Observation:** The painting is a landscape, likely of a coast or lakeside, done in watercolor. This style can provide clues, but the most direct evidence will be a signature.\n3.  **Locating the Signature:** By carefully examining the original image and the provided cropped images, a signature can be found in the lower-right corner.\n4.  **Deciphering the Signature:** The signature consists of a name and a two-digit number, likely representing a year. The name can be interpreted as \"Augusto Pinacrusas\", and the number is \"'70\", which stands for the year 1970. The crop showing the bottom right corner makes the signature clearer.\n5.  **Verifying the Artist's Name:** A search for the name \"Augusto Pinacrusas\" confirms the existence of a Brazilian artist with this name.
