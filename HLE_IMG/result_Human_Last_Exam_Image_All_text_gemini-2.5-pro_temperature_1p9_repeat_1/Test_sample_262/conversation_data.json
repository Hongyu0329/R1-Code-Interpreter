    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four iridium(III) complexes will have shorter excited-state lifetimes. The lifetime (τ) of a phosphorescent molecule is the inverse of the total decay rate from its excited state.\n    2.  **Analyze the Structures:** The four molecules are cationic iridium(III) complexes with an octahedral geometry. They share a common structure: [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻.\n        *   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n        *   The N^N ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, which is identical in all four complexes.\n        *   The C^N ligands are cyclometalating ligands based on 2-phenylpyridine. The key difference between the complexes lies in the fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring of these C^N ligands.\n            *   **Complex 1:** Two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands.\n            *   **Complex 2:** One 2-phenylpyridine ligand (no fluorine) and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. This is a heteroleptic complex (with respect to C^N ligands).\n            *   **Complex 3:** Two 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligands.\n            *   **Complex 4:** The structure shown is identical to Complex 1. We will treat it as such for comparison.\n    3.  **Relate Structure to Photophysical Properties:** The lifetime of these phosphorescent emitters is governed primarily by the energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T₁). The **Energy Gap Law** states that the rate of non-radiative decay (k_nr), a process that competes with light emission and shortens the lifetime, increases as the energy gap between the T₁ state and the ground state (S₀) decreases.\n        *   **Lower T₁ energy → Faster non-radiative decay (k_nr) → Shorter lifetime (τ)**\n        *   **Higher T₁ energy → Slower non-radiative decay (k_nr) → Longer lifetime (τ)**\n    4.  **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Adding fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand acts to withdraw electron density. This has a strong stabilizing effect on the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which has significant contribution from the phenyl ring and the iridium center. The Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), located mainly on the pyridine rings, is less affected. The net result is an increase in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which in turn increases the energy of the T₁ state.\n        *   **More Fluorination → Higher T₁ energy → Longer lifetime.**\n        *   **Less Fluorination → Lower T₁ energy → Shorter lifetime.**\n    5.  **Rank the Complexes:** We can now rank the complexes based on their expected T₁ energy, and thus their lifetime.\n        *   **Complex 2:** This complex is heteroleptic, containing both a non-fluorinated (ppy) and a di-fluorinated (dfppy) C^N ligand. The excited state energy will be determined by the ligand with the lower energy gap, which is the ppy ligand. Therefore, Complex 2 is expected to have the lowest T₁ energy in the series. This will result in the **shortest lifetime**.\n        *   **Complex 3:** This complex has two mono-fluorinated C^N ligands. The T₁ energy will be higher than that of Complex 2 but lower than that of Complex 1. This will result in a **short lifetime**, but longer than that of Complex 2.\n        *   **Complex 1 (and 4):** This complex has two di-fluorinated C^N ligands, representing the highest level of fluorination in this series. It will have the highest T₁ energy and consequently the **longest lifetime**.\n    6.  **Conclusion:** The order of lifetimes is expected to be: τ(Complex 2) < τ(Complex 3) < τ(Complex 1/4). The question asks for the complexes with **shorter** lifetimes. These are Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n*   **Final Answer:** Based on the analysis, complexes [2, 3] are expected to have shorter lifetimes compared to complexes [1, 4].\n\n<<<H>>>"
