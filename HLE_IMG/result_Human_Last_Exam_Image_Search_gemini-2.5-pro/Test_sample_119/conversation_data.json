    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectra, the compound is identified as **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n### **Analysis Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   A molecular ion (M+) peak at m/z 135 indicates a molecular weight of 135 g/mol.\n    *   The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (the Nitrogen Rule).\n    *   This leads to a likely molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N, which has a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Peaks around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ and 1600, 1500, 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring.\n    *   Strong absorptions below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H bonds.\n    *   The pattern in the 700-750 cm⁻¹ region is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Weak signals in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region suggest an N-H bond, likely from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Seven distinct carbon signals are observed: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The four signals in the range of 126-146 ppm are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary ipso-carbon and three distinct protonated carbons due to symmetry).\n    *   The three signals in the aliphatic region (19.2, 43.5, 49.6 ppm) correspond to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n\n4.  **DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The data indicates one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   In a DEPT-135 spectrum, CH₂ groups give negative signals, while CH and CH₃ groups give positive signals. Quaternary carbons are not observed.\n    *   This confirms the presence of one CH₂ group (the negative signal at 43.5 ppm) and five CH/CH₃ groups (the positive signals). These five consist of the CH₃ at 19.2 ppm, the CH at 49.6 ppm, and the three protonated aromatic carbons.\n\n5.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **~7.2 ppm (5H, multiplet):** Characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~2.8 ppm (1H, multiplet):** A methine (CH) group coupled to several neighboring protons.\n    *   **~2.7 ppm (2H, multiplet):** A methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to a chiral center, making its protons diastereotopic and appear as a complex multiplet. This is the benzylic -CH₂- group.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single proton (the CH group).\n    *   The proton count (5+1+2+3 = 11H) compared to the molecular formula (C₉H₁₃N, 13H) indicates two missing exchangeable protons, consistent with a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n6.  **HSQC Spectroscopy:**\n    *   This 2D spectrum confirms the direct connections between protons and the carbons they are attached to:\n        *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm (-CH₃).\n        *   ¹H at 2.7 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 43.5 ppm (-CH₂-).\n        *   ¹H at 2.8 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 49.6 ppm (-CH-).\n        *   Aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAssembling these pieces of information—a monosubstituted phenyl group, a -CH₂- group, a -CH(NH₂)- group, and a -CH₃ group—and considering the coupling patterns from the ¹H NMR, the only possible structure is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```\n      NH₂\n      |\nPh - CH₂ - CH - CH₃\n```\n\n**IUPAC Name:** 1-phenylpropan-2-amine\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
