    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak**: The cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appears to start at m/z 260. The peaks are observed at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%). Normalizing the intensities relative to the peak at m/z 260 gives a ratio of approximately 100:83:37:9. This isotopic pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing **three chlorine atoms**. The theoretical intensity ratio for three chlorine atoms (a mix of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes) is approximately 100:98:32:3.5. The observed pattern is a reasonable match. The peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the molecular ion containing three ³⁵Cl atoms.\n\n2.  **Base Peak**: The most intense peak in the spectrum (the base peak) is at m/z 225. This peak is part of an isotopic cluster with peaks at m/z 225 (I=100%), 227 (I=66.7%), and 229 (I=22.2%). The intensity ratio of the peaks at m/z 225 and 227 is approximately 100:67, or 3:2. This is the characteristic pattern for an ion containing **two chlorine atoms** (theoretical ratio is ~100:65).\n\n3.  **Fragmentation Analysis**:\n    *   The molecular ion (with three ³⁵Cl atoms) is at m/z 260. The base peak is at m/z 225. The mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 Da.\n    *   This mass loss of 35 corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine radical (³⁵Cl•). This is a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds ([M]⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺ + Cl•).\n    *   This confirms that the base peak at m/z 225 is the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment, which correctly contains two chlorine atoms as indicated by its isotope pattern.\n    *   Another significant fragmentation involves the peak at m/z 143 (I=27.8%). The mass difference from the molecular ion is 260 - 143 = 117 Da. This corresponds to the loss of a trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃, mass ≈ 117 for the ³⁵Cl₃ isotopologue). The peak at m/z 118 (I=43.5%) likely represents the [CCl₃]⁺ fragment itself (cluster starts at m/z 117). This indicates the presence of a -CCl₃ group in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Determination**:\n    *   From the M⁺ peak at m/z 260, we know the mass of the molecule with three ³⁵Cl atoms is 260 Da. The mass of the three chlorine atoms is 3 × 35 = 105 Da.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (CₓHᵧOₙ...) is 260 - 105 = 155 Da.\n    *   From the fragmentation [M]⁺ → [M-CCl₃]⁺, we identified the fragment [CₓHᵧOₙ...]⁺ at m/z 143. This corresponds to the part of the molecule without the -CCl₃ group. This fragment is likely a stable aromatic cation.\n    *   A naphthoxy cation ([C₁₀H₇O]⁺) has a mass of (10×12) + (7×1) + 16 = 120 + 7 + 16 = 143 Da. This is a very good fit.\n    *   If the molecule consists of a naphthoxy group and a trichloromethyl group attached via an ether linkage, we must reconsider the structure. A structure like 2-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene (C₁₀H₇-O-CCl₃) would have the formula C₁₁H₇OCl₃.\n    *   Let's verify the mass of C₁₁H₇OCl₃ (with ³⁵Cl): (11×12) + (7×1) + 16 + (3×35) = 132 + 7 + 16 + 105 = **260 Da**.\n\nThis matches the molecular ion peak perfectly. The fragmentation pattern is also consistent with this structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is an isomer of trichloromethoxynaphthalene. Without further information, the exact position of the substituent on the naphthalene ring cannot be determined. A plausible candidate is **2-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene**.\n\n<<<2-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene>>>"
