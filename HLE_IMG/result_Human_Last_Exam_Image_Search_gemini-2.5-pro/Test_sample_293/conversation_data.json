    "Based on the histopathological features presented in the image, the diagnosis is **crescentic glomerulonephritis**.\n\nThe key findings that support this diagnosis are:\n\n*   **Extracapillary Cellular Proliferation (Crescent Formation):** The most prominent feature is a large, crescent-shaped collection of cells filling the Bowman's space (the area surrounding the central glomerular tuft). This \"crescent\" is composed of proliferating parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, which compress the glomerular capillaries. When crescents are found in over 50% of the glomeruli in a biopsy, the condition is termed crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n*   **Glomerular Hypercellularity:** The glomerular tuft itself is hypercellular, meaning it contains an increased number of cells.\n*   **Fibrinoid Necrosis:** There are eosinophilic (pink), amorphous areas within the glomerular tuft, which are characteristic of fibrinoid necrosis. This indicates severe capillary wall injury and is often associated with crescent formation.\n*   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** A significant number of inflammatory cells are visible both within the glomerular tuft and as part of the crescent.\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis is not a single disease but rather a pattern of severe glomerular injury. It is the hallmark histological finding in patients with the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), which is characterized by a swift decline in kidney function over days to weeks. Further classification of crescentic glomerulonephritis into types such as pauci-immune, immune complex-mediated, or anti-GBM disease would require additional tests like immunofluorescence and serology.\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"
