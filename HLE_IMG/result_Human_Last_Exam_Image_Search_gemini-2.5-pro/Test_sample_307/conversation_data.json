    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized, the source of the image and the specific parameters used for the plots must be identified.\n\nThe image is Figure 7 from the scientific paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén, published in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. The figure caption specifies that the nine plots visualize the Wigner 3-j symbols `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` where `j3` is fixed at 12, `j1` takes values from {7, 8, 9} (top to bottom), and `j2` takes values from {9, 10, 11} (left to right).\n\nThe infinity-norm of each symbol corresponds to its maximum absolute value over all possible `m1` and `m2`. These values are provided in Table III of the aforementioned paper. The norms for each of the nine plots are:\n*   Plot 1 (j1=7, j2=9): 0.05307\n*   Plot 2 (j1=7, j2=10): 0.06381\n*   Plot 3 (j1=7, j2=11): 0.07685\n*   Plot 4 (j1=8, j2=9): 0.07340\n*   Plot 5 (j1=8, j2=10): 0.08801\n*   Plot 6 (j1=8, j2=11): 0.1133\n*   Plot 7 (j1=9, j2=9): 0.06323\n*   Plot 8 (j1=9, j2=10): 0.09841\n*   Plot 9 (j1=9, j2=11): 0.09210\n\nFrom this data, the following can be determined:\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** 0.1133 (from Plot 6, where j1=8, j2=11, j3=12)\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** 0.05307 (from Plot 1, where j1=7, j2=9, j3=12)\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is calculated as:\n\nRatio = 0.1133 / 0.05307 ≈ 2.13509\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives 2.135.\n\n<<<2.135>>>"
