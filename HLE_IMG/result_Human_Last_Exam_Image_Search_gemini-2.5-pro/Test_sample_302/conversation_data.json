    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 翰墨图书 (hàn mò tú shū).\n\nThis is a classical Chinese phrase that translates to \"brush, ink, pictures, and books.\" It evokes the traditional pursuits of a scholar or artist. Chinese seals, also known as chops, are used to sign documents and artwork. The script used on this seal is a form of seal script (篆书, zhuànshū), an ancient style of writing Chinese characters that was widely used for decorative engraving and seals.\n\nThe characters are:\n*   **翰 (hàn):** Refers to a writing brush.\n*   **墨 (mò):** Means ink.\n*   **图 (tú):** The simplified version of 圖, meaning picture or drawing.\n*   **书 (shū):** The simplified version of 書, meaning book or writing.\n\n<<<翰墨图书>>>"
