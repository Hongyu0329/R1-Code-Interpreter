    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule in the picture, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nFirst, we identify the full structure and IUPAC name of the molecule. The drawing shows a carbon backbone with several substituents indicating stereochemistry. Based on the connectivity, the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the hydroxyl, -OH, group) has five carbons. The correct IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4. We will determine the configuration (R or S) for each one.\n\n### **Configuration at C2**\n1.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C2:\n    *   1: -OH (highest atomic number)\n    *   2: -C3(CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2) (the rest of the carbon chain)\n    *   3: -CH3 (C1 of the chain)\n    *   4: -H (lowest atomic number)\n2.  **Determine orientation**: In the provided drawing, the -OH group is on a solid wedge (pointing out of the page), and the -CH3 group is on a dashed wedge (pointing into the page). The C2-C3 bond and the C2-H bond are in the plane of the drawing.\n3.  **Assign configuration**: To assign the configuration, we orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away from the viewer. Let's mentally rotate the molecule. An easier method is to determine the direction of the 1-2-3 sequence and then apply a correction if the lowest priority group is not pointing away. Visualizing the arrangement, the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3) is clockwise. Since the lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane and not pointed directly away or towards the viewer, a careful 3D visualization or rotation is needed. By rotating the molecule to place the hydrogen atom in the back, the sequence of the remaining groups (1-2-3) is clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is (R)**.\n\n### **Configuration at C3**\n1.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C3:\n    *   1: -C2(OH) (The carbon is attached to an Oxygen)\n    *   2: -C4(CH(Me)CH2NH2) (The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen further down)\n    *   3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    *   4: -H\n2.  **Determine orientation**: The ethyl group is on a solid wedge (pointing out), so the implicit hydrogen atom (-H) is on a dashed wedge (pointing in).\n3.  **Assign configuration**: With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, we look at the sequence 1-2-3. The path from -C2 to -C4 to the ethyl group is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is (S)**.\n\n### **Configuration at C4**\n1.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C4:\n    *   1: -CH2NH2 (The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen)\n    *   2: -C3(CH(Et)C2(OH)) (The carbon is attached to other carbons, one of which leads to an Oxygen)\n    *   3: -CH3\n    *   4: -H\n2.  **Determine orientation**: The methyl group (-CH3) is on a dashed wedge (pointing in), which means the implicit hydrogen atom (-H) is on a solid wedge (pointing out).\n3.  **Assign configuration**: Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer, we determine the direction of the 1-2-3 sequence and then reverse the result. The path from -CH2NH2 to -C3 to -CH3 is counter-clockwise, which would normally indicate (S). However, because the hydrogen is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C4 is (R)**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3S, 4R)>>>"
