    "The figure leaving the chariot is **Hippodamia**.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure vase, dating to around 320â€“310 B.C., depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus for the hand of Hippodamia.\n\nIn the myth, King Oenomaus, Hippodamia's father, challenged all her suitors to a chariot race; the prize was Hippodamia's hand in marriage, but the penalty for losing was death. The figure driving the chariot is Pelops, the hero who accepted the challenge. He is shown here with Hippodamia after winning the race and defeating her father, who is the nude figure depicted falling to the ground in front of the chariot. Pelops won either with the help of divine winged horses from Poseidon or by convincing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot. The winged figure hovering above is likely Nike, the goddess of victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
