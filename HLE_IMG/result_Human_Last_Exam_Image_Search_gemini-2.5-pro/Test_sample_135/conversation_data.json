    "The author of this detailed relief from the Altarpiece is Andrea Sansovino.\n\nThe relief is a depiction of the \"Last Supper\" and is a part of the predella of the **Altar of the Sacrament**, also known as the **Corbinelli Altar**. This significant work of the early Renaissance was created by Sansovino between 1485 and 1492. It is located in the Corbinelli Chapel within the Basilica di Santo Spirito in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe altarpiece is a sculptural and architectural work made of marble and includes several reliefs. Among them are a lunette with the Coronation of the Virgin, an Annunciation, a Piet√†, and the Last Supper. The scene in the image, showing Christ giving communion to the apostles, is a representation of the institution of the Eucharist, which is the sacrament of the altar.\n\nThe inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL\" is French for \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" While the altarpiece is in Italy, this French inscription is likely a title added to a later photograph or print of the relief, rather than being part of the original marble sculpture.\n\n<<<Andrea Sansovino>>>"
