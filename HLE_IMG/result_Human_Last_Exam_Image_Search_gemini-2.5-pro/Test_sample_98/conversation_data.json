    "The medallion in the image is a Roman artifact. Roman medallions, often larger and more detailed than regular coins, were used as commemorative pieces and donatives. The style of the busts is consistent with Roman portraiture of the Imperial period.\n\nBased on the iconography, which often depicted emperors, empresses, or deities, this is likely a silver phalera, a type of military decoration worn on the cuirass. The figures depicted are probably members of the imperial family. The search results point to a number of Roman medallions and phalerae featuring emperors from the 1st to the 4th centuries A.D. Specifically, several artifacts show portraits of Emperor Hadrian (reigned 117-138 A.D.) and his successor Antoninus Pius (reigned 138-161 A.D.).\n\nA particularly relevant artifact mentioned is a denarius struck in 140 A.D. with a portrait of Antoninus Pius on the obverse and his adoptive son, the future emperor Marcus Aurelius, on the reverse. Another example is a colossal portrait of Antoninus Pius dated to the mid-2nd century A.D., around the time of his decennalia in 148 A.D. Furthermore, the great series of bronze medallions was inaugurated during Hadrian's principate.\n\nConsidering the portrait styles and the common practice of depicting successive or co-ruling emperors, it is highly probable that the figures on the medallion are from the Nerva-Antonine dynasty. The reign of Antoninus Pius, in particular, was a period of peace and stability, and he honored his predecessor Hadrian. The production of such medallions was common during this era.\n\nGiven this evidence, the medallion can be ascribed to the 2nd century A.D.\n\n<<<2nd century A.D.>>>"
