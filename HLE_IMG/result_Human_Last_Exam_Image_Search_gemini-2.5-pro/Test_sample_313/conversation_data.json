    "The \"X Y\" is a **Hat Trick**.\n\nThe image from June 2019 shows Russian hockey player Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning at the NHL Awards. During the event, he won three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer), an accomplishment widely referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards.\n\nThe second clue refers to the historic use of mercury salts in the felt-making process for hats. This process, known as \"carroting,\" involved treating fur with mercuric nitrate to make it easier to felt. Hat makers who were exposed to the mercury vapors often developed neurological damage and symptoms of mercury poisoning, such as tremors and psychosis. This gave rise to the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" The use of mercury in hat production has long been discontinued due to its toxicity, with the United States banning it in 1941.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
