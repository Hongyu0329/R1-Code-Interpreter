    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur are an **electrocyclic reaction** followed by a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step involves the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene. Upon irradiation with UV light (`hv`), hexafluorobenzene undergoes a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction to form its highly strained valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). Electrocyclic reactions are a class of pericyclic reactions that involve the concerted rearrangement of electrons within a single conjugated system to form or break a ring. For a system with 4n π-electrons (here, n=1, so 4π electrons), the reaction is photochemically allowed.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate then reacts with cyclobutene. This is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition, where one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction forms a new four-membered ring, linking the two reactant molecules. This type of cycloaddition between two alkene (2π electron) systems is a well-known photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\nIn summary, the overall transformation is initiated by light, which first converts hexafluorobenzene into a reactive intermediate via an electrocyclization. This intermediate is then trapped by cyclobutene in a subsequent photocycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, [2+2] cycloaddition]>>>"
