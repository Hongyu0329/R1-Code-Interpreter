    "The process being depicted in the series of images (L, M, N) is the lateral branching of a fungal hypha.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what is shown:\n*   **The Structure:** The images show a microscopic view of a hypha, which is a long, branching, filamentous structure that is the main mode of growth for most fungi. This hypha is septate, meaning it is divided into individual cells by cross-walls called septa. The arrowhead in image L points to one of these septa.\n*   **The Process:** The sequence from L to N illustrates the formation of a new branch. In many fungi, branches form from sub-apical cells (cells behind the growing tip), often in close proximity to a septum.\n    *   **Image L:** Shows the mature hypha before the branching event begins.\n    *   **Image M:** A new growth point has emerged on the side of the hypha, forming a small bulge. This is the initiation of the lateral branch.\n    *   **Image N:** The bulge has elongated and is growing into a new hyphal filament, forming a distinct branch from the parent hypha.\n*   **Significance:** Hyphal branching is a fundamental process for fungi. It allows the fungus to expand and explore its environment, forming a complex network called a mycelium. This network is essential for absorbing nutrients and for the development of larger fungal structures.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
