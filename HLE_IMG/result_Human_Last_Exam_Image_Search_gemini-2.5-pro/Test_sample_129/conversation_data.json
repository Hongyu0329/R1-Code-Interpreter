    "Based on the visual information and search results, the image displays the **crystal structure of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin**.\n\nSpecifically, this is the structure of a conjugating enzyme-ubiquitin thiolester intermediate, identified in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the code **1FXT**.\n\nThe larger, dark blue protein is the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast). The smaller, light blue protein is ubiquitin from *Homo sapiens*. This complex represents a key intermediate step in the process of ubiquitination, where ubiquitin is attached to target proteins to signal for their degradation or to modify their function.\n\n<<<Crystal structure of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-ubiquitin complex (PDB: 1FXT)>>>"
