    "The provided reaction scheme outlines a three-step synthesis. To determine the molecular formula of the final product, each reaction step must be analyzed.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection of the starting material**\nThe initial reactant is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The first step involves ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in an acetonitrile/water solvent mixture. CAN is a well-known reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. This reaction removes the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom, which then becomes a secondary amine (or in this case, a lactam with an N-H bond).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Group Removed (PMB):** -C8H9O\n*   **Group Added:** -H\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The resulting structure is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The molecular formula is calculated as follows: C(15-8)H(14-9+1)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrogenation of Intermediate 1**\nThe second step is a catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). Electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl (CF3) do not prevent this reaction. Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C7H6F3NO\n*   **Atoms Added:** H2\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. Its molecular formula is C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis of Intermediate 2**\nThe final step is the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 using aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl) at 70 Â°C. These conditions cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond is cleaved, and a molecule of water is consumed, resulting in a carboxylic acid and an amine. This opens the bicyclic ring system to form a substituted cyclopentane amino acid.\n\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7H8F3NO\n*   **Atoms Added:** H2O\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting structure is an amino acid, specifically an isomer of (amino)(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The molecular formula is C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
