    "Based on a visual analysis of the artworks and search results, here are the authors of the nine works, from left to right and top to bottom:\n\n1.  **Liao Chi-chun (廖繼春)**: The top-left painting of stylized fish with human-like faces is characteristic of the work of Taiwanese artist Liao Chi-chun (1902-1976). He was a prominent figure in the development of modern art in Taiwan and was known for his use of vibrant colors and incorporation of abstract and Fauvist elements into his work.\n\n2.  **Pan Tianshou (潘天壽)**: The ink wash painting of chrysanthemums in the top-middle is in the distinct style of Pan Tianshou (1897–1971), a master of traditional Chinese painting. He was celebrated for his forceful brushwork and unique compositions, often focusing on flowers, birds, and landscapes.\n\n3.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**: The top-right portrait is the famous oil painting *Tajik Bride* (塔吉克新娘), created in 1983 by Jin Shangyi (born 1934). Jin is a leading figure in Chinese Neoclassical oil painting, and this work is one of his most recognized masterpieces, praised for its realism and psychological depth.\n\n4.  **Wang Duo (王鐸)**: The middle-left calligraphy scroll is in the dynamic and powerful cursive script of Wang Duo (1592-1652), a highly esteemed calligrapher of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. He was known for his study of ancient masters and his expressive, large-scale works.\n\n5.  **Hsiao Chin (蕭勤)**: The modern abstract painting in the middle-center, with its characteristic circles and vibrant colors, is the work of Hsiao Chin (1935-2023). A key figure in Chinese abstract art, he founded the \"Ton Fan Group\" and the \"Punto Art Movement,\" focusing on themes of cosmic energy and spirituality.\n\n6.  **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)**: The calligraphy in the middle-right is a rubbing from a famous stele engraved with the *Preface to the Sacred Teachings* (雁塔聖教序). The calligraphy is by Chu Suiliang (596–658), one of the great masters of the early Tang dynasty. This work is a cornerstone model for standard script (Kai shu) in the history of Chinese calligraphy.\n\n7.  **Wang Duo (王鐸)**: The bottom-left scroll features calligraphy in a style identical to the one in the middle-left, confirming it is also by Wang Duo (1592-1652). His cursive script is recognizable for its energy and rhythmic flow.\n\n8.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**: The bottom-middle portrait is *Young Singer* (青年女歌手), another well-known oil painting by Jin Shangyi, created in 1984. This work, a portrait of the famous singer Peng Liyuan, is an exemplary piece of Jin's Neoclassical style.\n\n9.  **He Jiaying (何家英)**: The bottom-right painting of a woman in an ornate headdress and veil is by He Jiaying (born 1957), a contemporary artist renowned for his meticulous and elegant figure paintings. He skillfully blends traditional Chinese ink wash techniques with a highly realistic and modern sensibility.\n\n<<<1. Liao Chi-chun\n2. Pan Tianshou\n3. Jin Shangyi\n4. Wang Duo\n5. Hsiao Chin\n6.
