    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is Augusto Rodrigues. He was a Brazilian artist, born in Recife in 1913 and died in Resende in 1993. He was a painter, illustrator, caricaturist, and educator. In 1935, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, which is consistent with the partially legible \"Rio\" in the painting's signature. The signature also clearly indicates the year \"39\", which aligns with his active years as an artist. While he is also known for other styles, this watercolor landscape is an example of his work.\n\n<<<Augusto Rodrigues>>>"
