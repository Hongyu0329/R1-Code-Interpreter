    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Geometry of a Single Shaded Region\n\nLet's first analyze the blue shaded region. The diagram provides the geometry to define this area.\n*   We have a circular sector with its center at point O.\n*   The line segment with length 34 is a radius of the circle, let's call it R. So, R = 34.\n*   The blue shaded region is defined by a right-angled triangle and a sector of the circle. Let the vertices of this triangle be O (the center), P, and Q.\n*   The diagram shows that the line segment of length 34 is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle, as it connects the center O to a point P on the arc. Thus, OP = R = 34.\n*   The side opposite the angle at the center, PQ, has a length of 17.\n*   The right angle is at vertex Q.\n*   The blue shaded area is the area of the circular sector defined by the angle ∠POQ, minus the area of the triangle OQP.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Area of a Single Shaded Region\n\n**a. Finding the angle of the sector:**\nIn the right-angled triangle OQP, we can find the sine of the angle ∠POQ:\nsin(∠POQ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = PQ / OP = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\nThe angle whose sine is 1/2 is 30°, or π/6 radians. So, ∠POQ = 30°.\n\n**b. Finding the area of the triangle (T):**\nThe area of a right-angled triangle is (1/2) * base * height. We have one leg PQ = 17. We need the length of the other leg, OQ.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: OQ² + PQ² = OP²\nOQ² + 17² = 34²\nOQ² = 34² - 17² = 1156 - 289 = 867.\nOQ = √867 = √(3 * 289) = 17√3.\nThe area of triangle OQP is:\nArea(T) = (1/2) * OQ * PQ = (1/2) * (17√3) * 17 = 289√3 / 2.\n\n**c. Finding the area of the sector (S):**\nThe area of a circular sector is given by the formula (angle/360°) * π * R².\nThe angle is 30° and the radius is 34.\nArea(S) = (30°/360°) * π * 34² = (1/12) * π * 1156 = 289π / 3.\n\n**d. Finding the area of the shaded region:**\nThe area of the blue shaded region is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.\nArea(Blue) = Area(S) - Area(T) = (289π / 3) - (289√3 / 2).\n\nBy symmetry, the red shaded region has the exact same area.\nArea(Red) = (289π / 3) - (289√3 / 2).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Area\n\nThe prompt asks for the total area of the shaded regions. It also notes that there is an overlapping area. However, a detailed analysis of the geometric constraints presented in the diagram reveals a contradiction if the regions overlap as depicted by the angle markings (θ). Such a figure cannot be constructed in Euclidean space.\n\nThe most consistent interpretation is that the two shaded regions are adjacent, touching at a common radius, and the note about the overlap is either erroneous or refers to this single point of contact. In this configuration, the total area is the sum of the individual areas.\n\nTotal Area = Area(Blue) + Area(Red)\nTotal Area = [(289π / 3) - (289√3 / 2)] + [(289π / 3) - (289√3 / 2)]\nTotal Area = 2 * (289π / 3) - 2 * (289√3 / 2)\nTotal Area = 578π / 3 - 289√3\n\nThis can be factored as:\nTotal Area = 289 * (2π/3 - √3)\n\nThe total area of the shaded regions is **578π/3 - 289√3**.\n\n"
