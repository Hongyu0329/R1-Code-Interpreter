    "An analysis of the provided image fragment and a comparison with known Ingvar runestones indicate that the depicted stone is the runestone with the ID **Sö 281**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following key points:\n\n*   **Runic Inscription:** The visible runes in the image fragment, particularly the sequence in the top row, are consistent with the known inscription on the Sö 281 runestone. The inscription on Sö 281 mentions Ingvar and his expedition to Serkland (the land of the Saracens). Specifically, a portion of the inscription on Sö 281 reads \"...with Ingvar in Serkland.\"\n\n*   **Location and Appearance:** The runestone Sö 281 is a fragment that is immured in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. Images of the runestone fragments at Strängnäs Cathedral show a strong visual match with the provided image in terms of the stone's texture, the style of the carving, and the layout of the runic bands. There are several runestone fragments located at the cathedral that are associated with Ingvar's expedition, namely Sö 277, Sö 279, and Sö 281. A detailed comparison confirms that the fragment in the user's image is part of Sö 281.\n\n*   **Historical Context:** The Ingvar runestones are a group of approximately 26 runestones from the 11th century that commemorate those who died in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription on Sö 281 directly links it to this significant historical event.\n\nTherefore, based on the combined evidence from the runic inscription, the visual characteristics of the stone, and its documented location and historical context, the Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as Sö 281.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
