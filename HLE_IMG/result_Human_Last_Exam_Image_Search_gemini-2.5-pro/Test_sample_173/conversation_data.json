    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes and rests within it for one of the staves.\n\n**Analysis of the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):**\n*   The bass clef contains four distinct notes.\n*   Each of these notes is a quarter note.\n*   Therefore, the total duration in the bass clef is four quarter notes.\n\n**Analysis of the Treble Clef (Top Staff):**\n*   The notes in the treble clef are grouped by beams.\n*   **Beat 1:** A sixteenth note chord, a sixteenth rest, and two more sixteenth notes. This combination adds up to the duration of four sixteenth notes, which is equal to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 2:** A group of four sixteenth notes, which is equal to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 3:** A group of four sixteenth notes, which is equal to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 4:** A group of four sixteenth notes, which is equal to one quarter note.\n*   The total duration in the treble clef is also four quarter notes.\n\nSince both staves contain music that adds up to four quarter notes, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
