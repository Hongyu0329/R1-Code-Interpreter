    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its appearance, it is most likely the Red-brown Longhorn Beetle. The scientific name for this beetle is *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\nThis species exhibits significant sexual dimorphism. The female is distinguished by its uniformly reddish-brown or reddish-orange elytra (wing cases) and pronotum (the part of the body just behind the head). In contrast, the male has a black head and pronotum, with brown or pale ochre elytra. The beetle can reach a length of 10â€“20 millimeters. The larvae of *Stictoleptura rubra* develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees, and the adult beetles are often found on flowers during the summer.\n\nIt is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. While it is considered uncommon and has a southerly distribution in Britain, it has been recorded there.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
