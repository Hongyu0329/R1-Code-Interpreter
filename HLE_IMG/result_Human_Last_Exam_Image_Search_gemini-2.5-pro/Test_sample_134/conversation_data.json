    "The molecule shown is **cyclocarbon**, a carbon allotrope with the molecular formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds. This structure makes it a type of molecule known as a polyyne and a cyclocarbon.\n\nFirst synthesized in 2019 by a collaboration between researchers at IBM and the University of Oxford, cyclocarbon was a long-sought-after molecule. Its existence had been theorized and detected in the gas phase, but due to its high reactivity, it could not be isolated and structurally characterized until this breakthrough.\n\nThe synthesis was achieved by using atomic manipulation on an inert sodium chloride surface at very low temperatures (5 Kelvin). The researchers started with a larger precursor molecule, a cyclocarbon oxide (C₂₄O₆), and used voltage pulses from the tip of an atomic force microscope to remove the six carbon monoxide (CO) groups, leaving the pure C₁₈ ring.\n\nHigh-resolution atomic force microscopy confirmed that the molecule has a polyynic structure, with alternating triple and single bonds, rather than a cumulenic structure with consecutive double bonds. Cyclocarbon is the smallest cyclocarbon predicted to be relatively stable and is considered a semiconductor. Its successful synthesis and characterization open possibilities for creating more complex carbon-rich molecules and new carbon allotropes.\n\n<<<Cyclocarbon>>>"
