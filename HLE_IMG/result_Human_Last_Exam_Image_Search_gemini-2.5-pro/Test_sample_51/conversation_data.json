    "The Greek word in the manuscript is a corrupt form of **ὀφθαλμόν** (ophthalmón), which means \"eye\" (in the accusative case).\n\nThe literal transcription of the text as written is **μθἄλαν** (mthálan). However, this is not a recognizable Greek word, and the placement of the smooth breathing mark (the `c`-shaped diacritic) on a vowel that is not at the beginning of the word is incorrect in Greek orthography.\n\nPalaeographers (scholars who study ancient and historical handwriting) have identified this specific example from a Byzantine manuscript as a notoriously error-prone rendering of the common word `ὀφθαλμόν`. The scribe likely made several mistakes:\n*   **μ** instead of **ὀφ** (oph)\n*   **θ** (theta) is correct.\n*   **ἄ** (alpha with a misplaced accent and an erroneous breathing mark) instead of **α** (alpha).\n*   **λ** (lambda) is correct.\n*   **α** (alpha) instead of **μ** (mu).\n*   The letter **ο** (omicron) was omitted.\n*   **ν** (nu) is correct.\n\nDespite the significant corruption of the spelling, the intended word is \"eye.\"\n\n<<<ὀφθαλμόν>>>"
