    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. The VMT for each scenario is the sum of the VMT for each distance category.\n\nThe formula to calculate VMT for each segment is:\n*VMT = (Share of total trips) x (Car Mode Share for that distance) x (Average trip distance)*\n\nLet's assume a total of 100 trips for simplicity.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT\n\nFirst, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Baseline table by adding the share of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT for each distance category:\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 48% of trips x 53% car share x 1 mile = 0.48 x 0.53 x 1 = 0.2544 VMT units\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 22% of trips x 81% car share x 4 miles = 0.22 x 0.81 x 4 = 0.7128 VMT units\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 14% of trips x 85% car share x 7.5 miles = 0.14 x 0.85 x 7.5 = 0.8925 VMT units\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 16% of trips x 89% car share x 20 miles = 0.16 x 0.89 x 20 = 2.8480 VMT units\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077 VMT units**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT\n\nNext, we repeat the process for the Proposed scenario. First, the total car mode share for each distance:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT for each distance category:\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 48% of trips x 3% car share x 1 mile = 0.48 x 0.03 x 1 = 0.0144 VMT units\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 22% of trips x 27% car share x 4 miles = 0.22 x 0.27 x 4 = 0.2376 VMT units\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 14% of trips x 41% car share x 7.5 miles = 0.14 x 0.41 x 7.5 = 0.4305 VMT units\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 16% of trips x 49% car share x 20 miles = 0.16 x 0.49 x 20 = 1.5680 VMT units\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505 VMT units**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the following formula:\n*Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) x 100*\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572 VMT units\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) x 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
