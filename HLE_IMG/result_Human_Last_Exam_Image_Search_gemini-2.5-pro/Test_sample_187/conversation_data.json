    "The reaction involves two sequential pericyclic reactions, and the stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide.\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  **1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition:** The reaction begins with a [3+2] cycloaddition, which is a type of pericyclic reaction. The mesoionic compound, a münchnone, acts as a 1,3-dipole. It reacts with the dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which serves as the dipolarophile. This step forms a bicyclic intermediate.\n2.  **Cheletropic Elimination:** The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is unstable and undergoes a cycloreversion reaction to achieve a more stable, aromatic state. This specific type of cycloreversion involves the extrusion of a small, stable molecule, which is characteristic of a cheletropic reaction. In this process, two sigma bonds are broken, leading to the formation of the pyrrole ring and the byproduct.\n\nThe stoichiometric byproduct is:\n*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** By comparing the atomic composition of the reactants (münchnone and DMAD) with the final pyrrole product, it is determined that a molecule of carbon dioxide is eliminated during the reaction. This elimination drives the reaction towards the formation of the stable aromatic pyrrole.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and a cheletropic elimination. The stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO₂).>>>"
