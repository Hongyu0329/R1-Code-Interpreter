    "The image displays a large, ornate scientific instrument from the 18th century. Based on its components—a large wheel with handles for manual operation, a prominent brass conductor, and a spherical terminal for accumulating charge—it is identifiable as an electrostatic generator.\n\nThis specific apparatus is the famous large electrostatic generator designed by Martin van Marum in 1784. It was built by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam and is now the centerpiece of the instrument room at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands. The machine was used for research and public demonstrations in the new science of electricity. Such devices, also known as frictional electrical machines, work by using friction to create a static electric charge. This particular generator features two large glass disks, 1.65 meters in diameter, that are rotated by two men turning the cranks, and it was capable of producing voltages up to 330,000 volts.\n\n<<<B>>>"
