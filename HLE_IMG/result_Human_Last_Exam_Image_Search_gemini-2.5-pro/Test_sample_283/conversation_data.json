    "The Google Trends graph displays recurring annual search interest peaks that correspond to significant historical commemorations in the **United States**. A historian would likely identify the country based on the timing of these peaks, which align with major American days of remembrance related to past conflicts.\n\nThe three events represented by the colored lines are:\n\n*   **Red Line - Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day:** The consistent spikes in early December point to National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, which is observed annually on December 7. This day commemorates the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to the United States' entry into World War II. Congress designated December 7 as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day on August 23, 1994.\n\n*   **Yellow Line - Memorial Day:** The prominent peaks at the end of May correspond to Memorial Day, a major U.S. federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May. This day honors military personnel who died while serving in the United States armed forces. Its observance as a three-day weekend for federal employees was established in 1971.\n\n*   **Blue Line - D-Day:** The smaller, yet consistent, peaks in early June align with the anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. While not a federal holiday, this is a significant date in U.S. and world history, marking the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe.\n\nThe pattern of these three distinct, annually recurring search peaks strongly indicates that the country in question is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
