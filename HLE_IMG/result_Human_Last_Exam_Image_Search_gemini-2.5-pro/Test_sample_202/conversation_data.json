    "Based on the visual analysis and the search results, here is the identification of each rock specimen:\n\n*   **Specimen H: Scoria**\n    This rock is reddish-brown and has many visible, bubble-like cavities called vesicles. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools quickly. The red color is due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption. Scoria is typically dark in color (black, brown, or red) and has a composition similar to basalt. Unlike pumice, scoria has a higher density and does not float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen I: Breccia**\n    This specimen is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is the defining characteristic of breccia. Breccias can form in various ways, including from volcanic activity (volcanic breccia), where fragments of lava and ash are compacted together. The angular nature of the fragments indicates they were not transported far from their source before being cemented.\n\n*   **Specimen J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, highly porous, and lightweight volcanic rock. Its frothy appearance is due to a very high concentration of gas bubbles (vesicles) that were trapped as the lava cooled extremely rapidly during an explosive volcanic eruption. Pumice is typically white, gray, or cream-colored and has such a low density that it can often float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K: Pegmatite**\n    This rock is characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals, indicating it is a coarse-grained igneous rock. The exceptionally large size of the crystals, which appear to be greater than 1 centimeter, is characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites form from the slow cooling of magma, often in the final stages of a magma chamber's crystallization, which allows the crystals to grow to a large size.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
