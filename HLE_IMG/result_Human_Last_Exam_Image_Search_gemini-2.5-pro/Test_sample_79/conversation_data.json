    "Based on the provided coordinates, the square structure shown in the image is the archaeological remains of a Spanish mission and an earlier Native American pueblo at a location known as the **Polvo Site (41PS21)**. It is situated near the present-day community of Redford, Texas, in an area that was historically called El Polvo.\n\nHistorically, this site was the location of the Tapacolmes pueblo. Around the late 17th century, a Spanish mission was established here. Sources suggest it may have been named San Pedro de Alcántara de los Tapalcomes or San Antonio de los Puliques. By 1747, a Spanish expedition noted that the pueblo had been abandoned and the church walls were in ruins, likely due to raids by the Apache.\n\nIn the 1870s, the area was resettled as the community of El Polvo. The last of the mission's crumbling adobe walls were reportedly leveled by county officials around 1956.\n\n### Historic Landmark Status\n\nYes, this site is a significant historic landmark.\n\n*   It was listed on the **National Register of Historic Places** on March 25, 1976.\n*   It is also designated as a **State Archeological Landmark**.\n\nThe Polvo Site is part of the larger La Junta de los Ríos archeological district, which contains evidence of both historic and prehistoric cultural deposits, including pithouses from as early as A.D. 1200.\n\n<<<The square ancient structure is the Polvo Site (41PS21), which includes the ruins of a Spanish mission (likely San Pedro de Alcántara de los Tapalcomes) and the earlier Tapacolmes pueblo.
