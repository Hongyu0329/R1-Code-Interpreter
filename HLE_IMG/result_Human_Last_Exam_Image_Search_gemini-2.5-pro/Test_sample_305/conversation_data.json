    "The product is Bourjois lipstick.\n\nDuring World War II, as millions of British women entered factories and took on new roles to support the war effort, advertisers adapted their messages. The French cosmetics company Bourjois marketed its lipstick as a tool for maintaining femininity and morale. In an era where women in factories often had to wear drab overalls and hide their hair, lipstick was promoted as one of the few remaining ways to express individuality and boost confidence. The underlying message was that maintaining one's appearance was a patriotic duty that contributed to the overall spirit of the nation.\n\nThe full advertisement, of which you provided a cropped version, features the Bourjois brand name and its products, confirming it as the subject of the \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" campaign. The name \"Bourjois\" is distinctly French, as the company was founded in Paris.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
