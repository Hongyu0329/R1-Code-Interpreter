    "Based on a visual analysis of the provided image, the painting is titled **\"A Windmill and Houses beside Water, Stormy Sky\"**.\n\nThe artwork was created by the Dutch artist **Jacob Henricus Maris** between 1880 and 1890. The painting is an oil on canvas and is currently housed in The National Gallery in London. It is a characteristic example of Maris's later work, known for its loose, sketchy style and use of thick paint. The piece captures a typical Dutch landscape dominated by a dramatic, stormy sky, which led to its former title, *La Tourmente* (Turmoil or Turbulence).\n\n<<<A Windmill and Houses beside Water, Stormy Sky>>>"
