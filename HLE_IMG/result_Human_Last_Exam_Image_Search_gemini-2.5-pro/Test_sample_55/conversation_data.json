    "The chord circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, contains the notes G#, B, C, and E. An accurate Roman numeral for this chord is V⁶₅/V (a secondary dominant in first inversion).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Dominant Key:** The dominant key of D minor is A minor, which is frequently majorized to A major (the V chord).\n*   **The Chord's Notes:** The notes in the circled measure are G#, B, C, and E.\n*   **Function:** This chord functions as a secondary dominant, creating tension that leads to the dominant chord (A major). The chord built on E is the dominant of A.\n*   **Analysis:** The notes E, G#, B, and D would form a standard E major dominant seventh chord (V7 of A). In the circled chord, the D is replaced by a C natural. The G# in the bass puts the chord in its first inversion (⁶₅). The C natural is a chromatic alteration, specifically a lowered 13th (b13), which adds to the dramatic tension of the passage.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate Roman numeral is V⁶₅/V, indicating a first-inversion secondary dominant of the dominant, with a chromatically altered note.\n\n<<<V⁶₅/V>>>"
