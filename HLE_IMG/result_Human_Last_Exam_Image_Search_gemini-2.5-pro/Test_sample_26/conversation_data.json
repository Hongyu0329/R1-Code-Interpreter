    "Following a harmonic analysis of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata, the chord in measure 30 is a dominant seventh chord.\n\nThe sonata is in the key of C minor. Measure 30 contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F in the right hand, with a G octave in the left hand. These notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G7). In the key of C minor, the G major chord is the dominant chord, and the G7 is the dominant seventh. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral for this measure is V7.\n\nThis V7 chord resolves to the tonic chord (i), C minor, in the following measure, creating a standard V7-i authentic cadence that is a fundamental element of classical harmony. Some analyses also point out the use of augmented 6th chords in measures 30 and 34.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
