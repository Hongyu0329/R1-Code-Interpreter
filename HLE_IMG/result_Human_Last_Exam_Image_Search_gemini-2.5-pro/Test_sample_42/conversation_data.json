    "This icon depicts Moses the Prophet. It is a fresco by the renowned Russian iconographer Dionisy (or Dionysius) and his sons, created around 1502.\n\nThe fresco is located in the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Theotokos at the Ferapontov Monastery in the Vologda region of Russia. The monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage site, noted for being an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Russian Orthodox monastic complex from the 15th-17th centuries. The interior of the cathedral is famed for the magnificent wall paintings by Dionisy, which are considered the highest expression of Russian mural art of that period.\n\nThis particular image of Moses is part of the \"Prophet tier\" of the iconostasis, a wall of icons and religious paintings that separates the nave from the sanctuary in an Orthodox church. In such portrait icons, Old Testament prophets are often depicted holding an unfurled scroll. The scroll typically contains a passage from their own writings that is interpreted as a prophecy of the coming of Jesus Christ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
