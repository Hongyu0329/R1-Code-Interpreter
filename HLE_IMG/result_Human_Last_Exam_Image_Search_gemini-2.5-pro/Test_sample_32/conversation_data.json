    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is **straight**. This means the capsule is held erect and straight above the leafy part of the plant.\n\nIn contrast, ***Grimmia curviseta*** has an **arcuate**, or curved, seta. This gives the capsule a distinct arching or bent appearance. The species name *curviseta* itself refers to this curved seta.\n\nTherefore, by observing whether the capsule's stalk is straight or curved, one can readily distinguish between the sporophytes of these two moss species.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
