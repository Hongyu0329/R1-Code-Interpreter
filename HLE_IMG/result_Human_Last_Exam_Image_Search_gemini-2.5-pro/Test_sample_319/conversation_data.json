    "The image and description point to the **auditory continuity illusion**, also known as **temporal induction**.\n\nThis perceptual phenomenon occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is interrupted by a brief burst of another sound, like noise. If the interrupting noise is loud enough to mask the gap, the human brain perceives the original tone as continuing without interruption. The spectrogram in the image illustrates this: a continuous horizontal line (the tone) is physically broken, and that gap is filled by a vertical blur (the noise burst). However, a listener would likely hear the tone as a single, unbroken sound.\n\nThis \"filling-in\" is an unconscious process that helps us perceive sounds as continuous in noisy environments, where signals are often momentarily obscured. The illusion demonstrates the brain's active role in constructing a coherent perceptual experience from incomplete sensory information.\n\nA well-known specific example of this illusion related to language is the **phonemic restoration effect**, where a missing speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence is perceptually restored when replaced by a cough or a burst of noise.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
