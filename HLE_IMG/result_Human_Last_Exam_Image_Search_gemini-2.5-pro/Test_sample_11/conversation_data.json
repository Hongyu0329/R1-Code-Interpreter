    "Based on the provided image, the flag is that of Yemen.\n\nThe national flag of Yemen consists of three equal horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and black at the bottom. The colors are derived from the Pan-Arab colors and have the following symbolism:\n\n*   **Red**: Represents the blood of martyrs and the unity of the country.\n*   **White**: Symbolizes a bright future.\n*   **Black**: Signifies the dark past.\n\nThe image provided shows the colors in the reverse order (black, white, red), which suggests the flag is being displayed upside down. This is a common feature in this type of guessing game. Other countries in the region, such as Egypt and Syria, also use the red, white, and black tricolor, but their flags include central emblems (the Eagle of Saladin for Egypt and two green stars for Syria). The flag in the image has no emblem, pointing to Yemen.\n\nThe black, white, and red horizontal tricolor was also historically used by the German Empire (1871-1918). However, since the question asks to \"Guess the Country,\" the most logical answer is a currently recognized sovereign state.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
