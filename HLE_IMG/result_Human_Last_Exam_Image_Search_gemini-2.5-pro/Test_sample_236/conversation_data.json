    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis insect is a species of seed bug found in Central and North America. Adults are characterized by their orange or red and black coloring, reaching a length of 10 to 12 mm. A key identifying feature is the reddish-orange \"X\" pattern on the back, which does not quite meet in the middle, and a black heart-shaped pattern inside the \"X\". The head is black with a distinct red spot in the center.\n\nThe Small Milkweed Bug is often found on milkweed plants, where it lays its eggs in the spring, but it can also be found on other plants like goldenrod, as seen in the picture. It is frequently confused with the Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), but the Large Milkweed Bug is bigger and has a different black and orange pattern on its back.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies of the Small Milkweed Bug: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus* (the eastern subspecies) and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii* (the western subspecies).\n\n<<<*Lygaeus kalmii*>>>"
