    "Based on the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify multiple splice species by analyzing the bands produced by different primer pairs. A unique splice species is defined by its specific combination of exons resulting from splicing events and its polyadenylation site (early AE or late AL).\n\nHere is a systematic analysis of the splice species revealed in each panel:\n\n1.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This reaction uses primer E1F2, which specifically amplifies transcripts containing the **929^3465 splice**. The reverse primer is in the early region. This panel shows one band (551 bp), indicating **one early splice species** with the 929^3465 splice.\n\n2.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This also uses the E1F2 primer (929^3465 splice) but with a reverse primer in the late region. The single band (972 bp) indicates **one late splice species** with the 929^3465 splice.\n\n3.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This reaction uses primer E1F3, specific for transcripts with the **929^3506 splice**, and a late reverse primer. There are two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). This reveals **two different late splice species**, both containing the 929^3506 splice but differing due to another alternative splicing event.\n\n4.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This uses the general E1F1 primer and an early reverse primer. It amplifies transcripts that do not have the major splices mentioned above and terminate early. The two bands (190 bp and 159 bp) indicate **two distinct early splice species**. The 31 bp difference is due to a minor alternative splice.\n\n5.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This uses the general E1F1 primer and a late reverse primer, amplifying late transcripts that lack the major splices. This panel is the most informative for this class of transcripts, revealing four distinct bands (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp). These correspond to **four different late splice species**. The top two bands (450 bp and 419 bp) show the same 31 bp difference seen in panel B, indicating they are the late-terminated versions of the species seen in that panel.\n\n**Summary of identified splice species:**\n*   **Early Transcripts (Terminating at AE):**\n    1.  Species with the 929^3465 splice (Panel D).\n    2.  Species without the major splice, variant 1 (Panel B, band 1).\n    3.  Species without the major splice, variant 2 (Panel B, band 2).\n*   **Late Transcripts (Terminating at AL):**\n    4.  Species with the 929^3465 splice (Panel F).\n    5.  Species with the 929^3506 splice, variant 1 (Panel G, band 1).\n    6.  Species with the 929^3506 splice, variant 2 (Panel G, band 2).\n    7.  Species without the major splice, variant 1 (Panel I, band 1).\n    8.  Species without the major splice, variant 2 (Panel I, band 2).\n    9.  Species without the major splice, variant 3 (Panel I, band 3).\n    10. Species without the major splice, variant 4 (Panel I, band 4).\n\nCounting these distinct categories gives a total of 3 early species and 7 late species.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, we can identify 10 different splice species.\n\n<<<10>>>"
