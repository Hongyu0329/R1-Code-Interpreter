    "To determine the substituents at the numbered positions, we must first identify the product of the reaction. The starting material is a derivative of the triterpene friedelane, specifically friedelan-3-ol. When treated with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat, it undergoes a dehydration followed by a complex series of methyl and hydride shifts. This extensive skeletal rearrangement is known as the friedelane-oleanane rearrangement.\n\nThe thermodynamically stable product of this reaction is Olean-12-ene (also known as β-amyrene). The structure shown in the final product corresponds to this oleanane skeleton. By comparing the numbered positions in the question's diagram to the known structure of Olean-12-ene, we can identify each substituent.\n\nThe standard numbering for the oleanane skeleton allows us to locate each position:\n*   **Position 1:** This substituent is located on carbon-4 (C-4) of the A ring. The oleanane skeleton has two methyl groups at this position. Therefore, substituent 1 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 2:** This is attached to the carbon at the junction of rings A and B, which is C-10. In the oleanane skeleton, there is a methyl group at C-10. Thus, substituent 2 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 3:** This substituent is on C-5, also at the A/B ring junction. Oleanane has a hydrogen atom at this position, typically in the alpha (α) configuration (dashed bond), which matches the diagram. So, substituent 3 is a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Position 4:** Located at the junction of rings B and C, on C-8. The oleanane skeleton features a methyl group at C-8. Therefore, substituent 4 is a methyl group.\n*   **Position 5:** This is on C-14, at the junction of rings C and D. The established structure of Olean-12-ene has a methyl group at this position, in the alpha (α) configuration, which is consistent with the dashed bond shown. Hence, substituent 5 is a methyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the substituents are as follows:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
