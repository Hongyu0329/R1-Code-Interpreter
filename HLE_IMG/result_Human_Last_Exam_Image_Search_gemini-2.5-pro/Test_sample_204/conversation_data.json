    "The four mineral specimens are ordered below based on the increasing complexity of their silicate structure.\n\n### **1. Specimen C: Olivine**\nThis specimen is a granular mass of olive-green crystals, characteristic of the mineral olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which has the simplest silicate structure. This structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra (SiOâ‚„) linked by iron and magnesium ions.\n\n### **2. Specimen A: Pyroxene**\nSpecimen A is a dark, prismatic crystal. Its form is typical of the pyroxene group of minerals. Pyroxenes are single-chain **inosilicates**, where silica tetrahedra link together to form long chains. This represents the next level of complexity after the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n### **3. Specimen B: Mica**\nThis green, flaky mineral displays perfect basal cleavage, allowing it to be split into thin, flexible sheets. This is a defining characteristic of the mica mineral group. Micas are **phyllosilicates**, or sheet silicates, where tetrahedra are linked in two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure is more complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n### **4. Specimen D: Quartz**\nSpecimen D is a translucent, brownish (smoky) crystal with a hexagonal-like form, which is characteristic of quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate**, or framework silicate. In this structure, every oxygen atom is shared between two silica tetrahedra, creating a complex and strong three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\nTherefore, the order of the specimens from least to most complex silicate structure is C, A, B, D.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
