    "Based on the provided clinical information and the histopathological image, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  **Histopathological Findings**: The image displays characteristic features of mucormycosis. The fungal elements are broad, ribbon-like hyphae that are pauciseptate (having few or no septa). A key diagnostic feature visible is the irregular, wide-angle branching of the hyphae, often approaching 90 degrees. The stain used appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains the fungal walls magenta, making them prominent against the background tissue. The surrounding tissue shows an intense inflammatory infiltrate and areas of necrosis, which are common findings as these fungi are known to be angioinvasive, leading to thrombosis and tissue death.\n\n2.  **Clinical Context**: The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is located adjacent to the sphenoid sinus. The most common form of mucormycosis is rhinocerebral, which often begins in the paranasal sinuses and can invade adjacent structures like the sella turcica and brain. While often seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., those with diabetes mellitus or hematologic malignancies), it can occur in immunocompetent people as well. A fungal infection extending from the sphenoid sinus is a known, though less common, cause of a sellar mass and can mimic a pituitary tumor.\n\n3.  **Differential Diagnosis**: Other fungal infections like Aspergillosis are considered; however, *Aspergillus* typically has thinner, septate hyphae with acute-angle (45-degree) branching, which is inconsistent with the image. The primary differential for a sellar mass is a pituitary adenoma, but the histology for that would show sheets of neuroendocrine cells, not fungal organisms. The histopathology seen here is pathognomonic for mucormycosis.\n\nIn summary, the combination of a sellar mass and the classic histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching strongly supports the diagnosis of mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
