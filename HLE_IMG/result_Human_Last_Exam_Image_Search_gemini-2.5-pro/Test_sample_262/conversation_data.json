    "The stability and, consequently, the operational lifetime of iridium(III) complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are strongly influenced by the nature of their ligands. A key factor in determining the robustness of these complexes is the strength of the cyclometalating bond between the iridium center and the carbon of the phenylpyridine (C^N) ligand.\n\n### Factors Affecting Stability:\n\n*   **Fluorination of Phenylpyridine (C^N) Ligands:** The introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand is a well-established strategy to enhance the stability of the complex. Fluorination strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the complex more resistant to degradation under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. A stronger Ir-C bond generally correlates with a longer device lifetime. Additionally, fluorination tends to lower the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which can affect the emission color and electrochemical properties.\n*   **Number of Fluorine Substituents:** Generally, a higher degree of fluorination on the C^N ligand leads to greater stability. However, some studies have noted that increasing the fluorine content excessively can sometimes lead to decreased stability, suggesting a complex relationship and the importance of the specific substitution pattern. Nevertheless, complexes with no fluorine atoms are consistently less stable than their fluorinated counterparts.\n\n### Analysis of the Complexes:\n\n1.  **Complex 4** has two unsubstituted phenylpyridine ligands. Lacking any stabilizing fluorine atoms, its Ir-C bonds are the weakest among the four complexes. This makes it the most susceptible to degradation pathways that involve the cleavage of this bond, leading to a significantly shorter operational lifetime.\n2.  **Complex 3** features two mono-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligands. The single fluorine atom on each ligand provides a degree of stabilization to the Ir-C bond compared to the non-fluorinated Complex 4. However, it is less stable than the difluorinated complexes.\n3.  **Complexes 1 and 2** both contain two difluorinated phenylpyridine ligands. The two fluorine atoms on each C^N ligand provide substantial stabilization to the Ir-C bonds, making these complexes the most robust in the series. They are therefore expected to have the longest lifetimes. The difference between Complex 1 and 2 lies in the ancillary bipyridine ligand (unsubstituted in 2, and with electron-donating tert-butyl groups in 1). While this can influence properties, the dominant factor for lifetime in this comparison is the fluorination of the C^N ligands.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the degree of fluorination of the cyclometalating ligands, the expected order of stability (from longest to shortest lifetime) is: > >.\n\nThe question asks which complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes. Complexes 3 and 4 are the least stable due to having fewer or no fluorine substituents on the critical phenylpyridine ligands. Therefore, they are expected to degrade more quickly and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes in LEC devices.\n\n<<<J>>>"
