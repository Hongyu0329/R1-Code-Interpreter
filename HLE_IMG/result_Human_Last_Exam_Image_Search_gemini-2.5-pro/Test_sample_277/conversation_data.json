    "I am sorry, but the image you provided is completely black, so I cannot see the molecules you are referring to. To determine the relationship between the molecules (conformational isomers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers), I would need to see their chemical structures.\n\nPlease provide the images of the molecules, and I will be happy to help you identify their isomeric relationship."
