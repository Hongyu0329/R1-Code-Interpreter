    "The image displays several organisms common to a rocky intertidal zone, including barnacles and marine snails. To definitively place the photograph on the Atlantic Coast, one must identify a species present that is exclusive to that region and absent from the Pacific.\n\nThe key indicator in this photograph is the common periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*. The small, dark, ridged snails visible in the image are identifiable as this species.\n\n*Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It has since become one of the most common marine snails along the North Atlantic coast, with a range from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware, USA. While there have been isolated reports of this species on the Pacific coast, established and sustained populations have not been documented. Its abundant presence, as suggested by the photo, is a strong indicator of an Atlantic coastal location.\n\nOther organisms in the photo, such as the acorn barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*) and the dog whelk (*Nucella lapillus*), are also found on North Atlantic shores, but their geographic ranges can overlap with or be similar to related species on the Pacific Coast, making them less definitive indicators on their own.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
