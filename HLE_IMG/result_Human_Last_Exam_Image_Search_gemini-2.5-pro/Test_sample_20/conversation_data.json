The house, built in 1566, showcases a rich Renaissance-style facade. It is a notable example of a patrician house, reflecting the wealth of its original owner.\n\nThe photograph captures the building from across a canal, a common feature in Dutch cities, with a cobblestone path in the foreground. The distinctive stepped gable of the building is a well-known characteristic of historic Dutch architecture. Search results confirm that this architectural style, along with canals and red and white shutters on houses, are prominent in Gorinchem.\n\nThe specific address of the building is Gasthuisstraat 25, Gorinchem. The surrounding area, including the canal which is part of the Linge river, and the historic ambiance are characteristic of this fortified city. Gorinchem itself is recognized for its well-preserved city walls and historic buildings.\n\n<<<Netherlands>>>"
