    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the 9_42 knot. It is one of the 49 distinct knots with nine crossings.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9_42 knot is:\n\nt^−4 - t^−3 + t^−2 - t^−1 + 1 - t + t^2\n\nFormatting this in decreasing degree order results in:\n\nt^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4\n\nInterestingly, the 9_42 knot and its mirror image are distinct, yet they share the same Kauffman polynomial, an invariant that is often able to distinguish a knot from its mirror. The chirality of the 9_42 knot is also not detected by the standard Jones polynomial.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
