    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, also known as the s-invariant, for the 8₁₉ knot is -6.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is a non-alternating knot with 8 crossings. It is also known as the torus knot T(4,3) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). The Rasmussen invariant is a powerful tool in knot theory that provides a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
