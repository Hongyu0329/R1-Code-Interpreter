    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper. The strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. At this speed, each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds.\n\nThe R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves, which are the prominent upward spikes of the QRS complex. By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, the longest pause between heartbeats is identifiable in the fourth row of tracings.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval, we can count the number of large squares between the two R-waves surrounding the pause. The peak of the R-wave before the pause and the peak of the R-wave after the pause are separated by exactly 8 large squares.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   **Number of large squares:** 8\n*   **Time per large square:** 0.2 seconds\n*   **Longest R-R interval:** 8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds\n\nThe surrounding, more regular R-R intervals span approximately 4 large squares (4 x 0.2s = 0.8s), which corresponds to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. The long pause of 1.6 seconds is exactly double the preceding interval, which is characteristic of a second-degree AV block where a beat is dropped.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
