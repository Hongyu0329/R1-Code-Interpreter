    "The tiling shown in the image has a **10-fold rotational symmetry**. This means that if the tiling is rotated by an angle of 36 degrees (360Â°/10) around specific points, it will appear identical to its original state.\n\nThis type of pattern is an example of a quasicrystalline tiling. Unlike traditional periodic crystals which can only have 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold rotational symmetries, quasicrystals can possess symmetries that were once thought to be impossible for ordered structures, such as the 10-fold symmetry seen here. These tilings are ordered but not periodic, meaning they have long-range order but lack translational symmetry.\n\nThe specific tiling in the image is constructed from a set of shapes often referred to as \"girih tiles\" in the context of Islamic architecture. These sets typically include shapes like decagons, pentagons, hexagons, and rhombi, all with angles that are multiples of 36 degrees. The decagon shape, in particular, possesses a tenfold rotational symmetry. The discovery that these historical patterns correspond to the mathematics of quasicrystals, a concept formalized in the West in the 1970s and 1980s, revealed that Islamic architects were creating these complex aperiodic tilings centuries earlier.\n\nThe visual appearance of 10-fold symmetry is evident in the prominent star-like motifs distributed throughout the pattern. Each of these motifs serves as a center of rotation. While some quasicrystalline tilings, like the famous Penrose tiling, are more commonly associated with 5-fold symmetry, they also exhibit a statistical 10-fold symmetry. The tiling in the image is a clear example of a decagonal quasicrystal, which has a distinct 10-fold rotational axis.\n\n<<<10-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
