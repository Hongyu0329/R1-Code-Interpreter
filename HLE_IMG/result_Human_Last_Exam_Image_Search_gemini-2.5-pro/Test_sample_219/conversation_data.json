    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of dense firing activity across multiple electrodes, occur at the following approximate timestamps:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** ~2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~15 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~26 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~36 s\n*   **Burst 5:** ~48 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval (IBI), we first determine the time difference between the onsets of consecutive bursts:\n\n*   **IBI 1:** 15 s - 2 s = 13 s\n*   **IBI 2:** 26 s - 15 s = 11 s\n*   **IBI 3:** 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   **IBI 4:** 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\nNext, we calculate the average of these intervals:\n\nAverage IBI = (13 s + 11 s + 10 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
