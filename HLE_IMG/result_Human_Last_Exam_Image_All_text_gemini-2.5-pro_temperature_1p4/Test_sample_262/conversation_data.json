    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes will have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). A shorter lifetime implies lower chemical stability of the complex under the operating conditions of an LEC.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.**\nAll four compounds are cationic, octahedral iridium(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-.\n*   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III) is the central metal in all complexes.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All complexes use the same ancillary ligand, which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The bulky tert-butyl groups are generally used to improve solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions, which often enhances stability. Since this ligand is common to all four complexes, it is not the source of the difference in their expected lifetimes.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligand (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the two cyclometalating ligands. These are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), where the iridium atom forms a bond with the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (ortho-metalation).\n*   **Counterion:** The counterion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) for all complexes and is considered a non-coordinating, stable anion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify factors affecting the stability and lifetime of these complexes.**\nThe stability of these iridium complexes, and thus their lifetime in a device, is highly dependent on the strength and inertness of the coordinate bonds, especially the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. Degradation often occurs through pathways that involve the breaking of this bond. One of the most significant factors that can weaken this bond and destabilize the entire complex is steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the specific C^N ligands in each complex for steric effects.**\nWe need to examine the position of the fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring of the 2-phenylpyridine ligand. Let's number the positions on the phenyl ring starting from the carbon attached to the pyridine ring as C1'. The metalated carbon is C2'. The other positions are C3', C4', C5', and C6'.\n*   **Complex 2:** This complex uses the unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. It serves as a stable benchmark with no additional steric hindrance from substituents.\n*   **Complex 1:** In this complex, the phenyl ring has two fluorine atoms. Looking at the drawing, they are at the C4' and C5' positions. Relative to the Ir-C2' bond, these are *meta* and *para* positions, respectively. Substituents at these positions do not cause significant steric crowding around the metal center. In fact, electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms in such positions often enhance the stability of the complex.\n*   **Complex 3:** This complex has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring. The drawing shows the fluorine atom is at the C6' position. A substituent at the C6' position is ortho to the C1'-C2 (phenyl-pyridine) bond. This creates a significant steric clash with the hydrogen atom at the C3 position of the pyridine ring. This forces the phenyl and pyridine rings to twist out of their preferred co-planar arrangement, which induces strain in the five-membered chelate ring. This strain weakens the coordination bonds (Ir-C and/or Ir-N) and makes the entire complex more prone to degradation.\n*   **Complex 4:** This complex has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring. One is at the C6' position, and the other is at the C4' position. Similar to Complex 3, the fluorine atom at the C6' position introduces the same detrimental steric hindrance. The presence of another fluorine at the C4' position does not alleviate this strain. Therefore, this complex is also expected to be destabilized.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe presence of a substituent at the C6' position of the 2-phenylpyridine ligand is a well-known structural feature that leads to instability due to steric strain.\n*   Complexes 1 and 2 do *not* have a substituent at the C6' position. They are expected to be relatively stable.\n*   Complexes 3 and 4 both *do* have a fluorine atom at the C6' position. They are expected to be sterically strained and, as a result, less stable, leading to shorter operational lifetimes in LECs.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [3] and [4].\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis identifies complexes [3] and [4] as the least stable. The correct option is the one that lists both 3 and 4. This corresponds to option J.\n\n<<<J>>>"
