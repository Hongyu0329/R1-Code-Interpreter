The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformational rigidity of its bicyclic Münchnone intermediate. The starting material, N-acetyl-proline, has its nitrogen and α-carbon locked within a five-membered ring. This structural constraint is maintained in the resulting Münchnone and its corresponding valence tautomer (a cyclic N-acylaminoketene). This rigidity prevents a rearrangement pathway that scrambles the substituents.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial to this rationale because they establish the existence of this rearrangement pathway for flexible, acyclic systems. Reaction 2 shows that for the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, the intermediate is conformationally flexible enough to allow for an isomerization (likely via its open-chain ketene valence tautomer) that makes the acetyl-derived and alanine-derived methyl groups equivalent. This explains the 1:1 scrambling of the 13C label. Therefore, the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is explained by the inhibition of a known scrambling mechanism due to the conformational constraints imposed by its cyclic structure.
