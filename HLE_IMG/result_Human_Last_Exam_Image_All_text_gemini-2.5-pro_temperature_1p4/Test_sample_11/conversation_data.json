    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to guess the country from the small part of the flag.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information**\nThe provided image shows the top-left portion of a flag. The visible elements, from top to bottom, are:\n1.  A solid black horizontal stripe.\n2.  A thin white horizontal stripe below the black one.\n3.  A thicker red horizontal stripe below the white one.\n\nThe overall pattern is a horizontal tricolor of black, white, and red.\n\n**Step 2: Search for countries with a matching flag**\nWe need to find a national flag that consists of horizontal stripes of black, white, and red, in that specific order.\n\n*   **Initial Search:** A direct search for a \"black, white, red horizontal tricolor flag\" primarily brings up historical flags:\n    *   The flag of the **German Empire** (1871–1918).\n    *   The flag of the **Republic of Upper Volta** (1958–1984), which is now Burkina Faso and uses a different flag.\n    Since the quiz asks to \"Guess the Country,\" it most likely refers to a current sovereign state. Neither of these is a current country.\n\n**Step 3: Consider alternative interpretations**\nSince no current country's flag is a direct match, we must consider other possibilities. A common trick in flag quizzes is to show the flag in a non-standard way.\n\n*   **Inversion:** The most likely possibility is that the flag is shown upside down.\n*   If the flag is inverted, the correct orientation would have the colors in the reverse order: red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom.\n\n**Step 4: Search for countries with an inverted-match flag**\nNow, we search for a national flag that is a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black. This is a very common pattern, known as the Arab Liberation colors. Several countries use this design:\n\n*   **Yemen:** The flag of Yemen is a plain horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black.\n*   **Egypt:** The flag of Egypt is a red, white, and black tricolor, but with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center of the white stripe.\n*   **Syria:** The flag of Syria is a red, white, and black tricolor, but with two green stars in the middle of the white stripe.\n*   **Iraq:** The flag of Iraq is a red, white, and black tricolor, but with the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is the greatest) in green Kufic script on the white stripe.\n\n**Step 5: Select the most plausible answer**\nOut of the countries with a red-white-black tricolor, the fragment in the image shows only plain stripes. It does not show any part of an eagle, stars, or script. While it's possible the fragment is taken from a part of the flag that avoids the central emblem, the simplest and most direct explanation is that the flag itself is a plain tricolor.\n\n*   The flag of **Yemen** is the only one among these candidates that is a simple, unadorned red-white-black tricolor.\n*   Therefore, an inverted flag of Yemen would perfectly match the image provided: black on top, white in the middle, and red at the bottom.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe image displays an inverted flag. The original flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black. This design corresponds to the national flag of Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
