    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight and Presence of Halogens**\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion cluster. In this spectrum, this cluster is seen at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n2.  **Isotope Pattern:** The relative intensities of these peaks provide information about the presence of isotopes, particularly halogens like chlorine or bromine.\n    *   I(m/z 260) = 34.8%\n    *   I(m/z 262) = 29.0%\n    *   I(m/z 264) = 12.9%\n    *   I(m/z 266) = 3.22%\n    The theoretical intensity ratio for a molecule with three chlorine atoms (due to ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes) is approximately 100:98:32:3. The observed pattern (approx. 100:83:37:9 when normalized to the peak at 260) is a reasonable match for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms**.\n3.  **Nominal Molecular Weight:** The peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the molecule containing only the lighter isotope of chlorine (³⁵Cl). Thus, the nominal molecular weight of the compound is **260 u**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n1.  **Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (relative intensity = 100%).\n2.  **Initial Fragmentation (Loss of Cl):** The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a chlorine radical (•Cl). This is a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds.\n    *   [M]⁺˙ → [M - Cl]⁺ + •Cl\n    *   The ion at m/z 225 is the [M - Cl]⁺ fragment. Its isotopic pattern (peaks at 225, 227, 229) should correspond to a species with two remaining chlorine atoms. The observed intensity ratio I(225):I(227) is 100:66.7, which closely matches the theoretical ratio for two Cl atoms (~100:65). This confirms the initial loss of one chlorine atom.\n3.  **Identification of a -CCl₃ Group:** There is a significant peak at m/z 143. The mass difference from the molecular ion is 260 - 143 = 117 u. This mass loss corresponds exactly to a trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃, where all Cl are ³⁵Cl).\n    *   [M]⁺˙ → [M - CCl₃]⁺ + •CCl₃\n    This suggests that the molecule has a trichloromethyl group, and its structure can be represented as R'-CCl₃. The fragment ion at m/z 143 is therefore the [R']⁺ cation.\n4.  **Confirming the R'-CCl₃ Structure:** This structural hypothesis consistently explains the other major peaks:\n    *   **Molecular Ion (m/z 260):** [R'CCl₃]⁺˙\n    *   **Base Peak (m/z 225):** Loss of •Cl from the molecular ion gives [R'CCl₂]⁺. The mass is m(R') + m(CCl₂) = 143 + (12 + 2*35) = 143 + 82 = 225. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 190:** A subsequent loss of •Cl from the base peak gives [R'CCl]⁺. The mass is m(R') + m(CCl) = 143 + (12 + 35) = 143 + 47 = 190. This also matches the peak in the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the R' Group**\n1.  The R' fragment has a mass of 143 u. We need to find a plausible chemical formula.\n2.  A common chemical structure with a mass of 143 u is the naphthoxy group, C₁₀H₇O-. The cation [C₁₀H₇O]⁺ would have m/z = 143.\n3.  The molecular formula of the entire compound would be C₁₁H₇OCl₃. Let's verify the mass: (11 × 12) + (7 × 1) + (1 × 16) + (3 × 35) = 132 + 7 + 16 + 105 = 260 u. This matches the determined molecular weight.\n4.  The proposed structure is **(naphthoxy)trichloromethane**, C₁₀H₇-O-CCl₃. This structure is consistent with all the major fragments observed. The peak at m/z 141 can be explained by the loss of H₂ from the [C₁₀H₇O]⁺ ion at m/z 143, which is typical for aromatic ions.\n\n**Step 4: Give the IUPAC Name**\nThe molecule is a naphthalene ring attached via an oxygen bridge to a trichloromethyl group. It is named as a substituted naphthalene. The substituent -O-CCl₃ is called **(trichloromethoxy)**. The attachment can be at position 1 or 2 of the naphthalene ring. The mass spectrum cannot distinguish between these isomers. A correct systematic IUPAC name is 1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene.\n\n<<<1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene>>>"
