    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Object**\nThe image displays a circular medallion with a flat tab at the top, likely for suspension or mounting. The medallion is made of a reflective material, probably precious metal like gold or silver, and is shown in a black and white photograph. It features two figures in profile, facing each other in high relief.\n\n**Step 2: Iconographic Analysis of the Figures**\n*   **Figure on the Left:** This figure is more prominent and detailed. It is a male bust with a commanding presence. The most distinctive feature is a large, curved ram's horn emerging from his temple area, just above the ear. The hair is arranged in stylized, comma-shaped locks. The figure wears a cloak (a Roman *chlamys* or *paludamentum*) fastened at the shoulder. The eye is large and staring.\n*   **Figure on the Right:** This figure is also a bust, but it is less clear due to lighting and perhaps a slightly less detailed execution. It appears to be another male figure, likely younger, with similar stylized hair and clothing.\n*   **Symbolism of the Ram's Horn:** The ram's horn is a powerful symbol with a long history in the ancient world. It is most famously associated with the Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon. Alexander the Great famously visited the oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis and was subsequently depicted with ram's horns, symbolizing his divine parentage and immense power. Later Roman emperors adopted this imagery to associate themselves with Alexander's legacy and divinity.\n\n**Step 3: Stylistic Analysis**\nThe style of the portraits is characteristic of the Late Roman Empire. Key features include:\n*   **Hieratic and Formal:** The figures are not depicted with the naturalism of earlier Greek or Roman art. Instead, they have a rigid, formal, and almost abstract quality.\n*   **Large, Staring Eyes:** The emphasis on large, soul-searching eyes is a hallmark of late antique portraiture, meant to convey spiritual depth and authority.\n*   **Stylized Hair and Drapery:** The hair and the folds of the clothing are rendered in a patterned, linear fashion rather than a soft, naturalistic one.\n*   **High Relief:** The use of high relief on medallions was common in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD for imperial presentation pieces.\n\n**Step 4: Identification and Dating**\nBased on the iconography and style, the object can be identified as a famous gold medallion from the Late Roman Empire.\n*   The figure with the ram's horns is the Emperor **Constantius II** (reigned 337-361 A.D.), who is deliberately linking himself to Alexander the Great.\n*   The figure on the right is his cousin, **Constantius Gallus**, who he appointed as Caesar (a junior emperor) in the East.\n*   Gallus served as Caesar from March 351 A.D. until he was executed in late 354 A.D.\n*   Therefore, this medallion, commemorating their joint rule, must have been minted between **351 and 354 A.D.**\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe date of the medallion is firmly established in the mid-4th century A.D. (specifically 351-354 A.D.). Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
