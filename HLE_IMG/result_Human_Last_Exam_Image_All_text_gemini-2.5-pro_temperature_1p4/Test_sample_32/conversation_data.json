    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find the most obvious, visually distinct feature (\"at a glance\") of the **sporophyte** that separates *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Sporophyte Structures:** A moss sporophyte consists of a foot, a seta (stalk), and a capsule (sporangium). The features that are generally visible are the seta and the capsule. Their shape, size, color, and orientation are all potential distinguishing characteristics.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Species Names:** Often, the scientific name (specifically, the specific epithet) provides a clue.\n    *   *montana* means \"of the mountains,\" referring to its habitat.\n    *   *curviseta* is a combination of Latin words: *curvus* meaning \"curved\" and *seta* meaning \"bristle\" or, in bryological terms, the stalk of the sporophyte. This name strongly suggests that a curved seta is a key feature of this species.\n\n4.  **Compare Botanical Descriptions:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: This species is characterized by having a **short, straight seta**. Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect and is typically described as immersed (hidden among the leaves) or emergent (just peeking out), but not bent over.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: As its name implies, this species is defined by its **strongly curved or arcuate seta**. This sharp bend in the stalk causes the capsule to be turned sideways or downward (cernuous to pendulous), often appearing nestled beside the stem among the leaves rather than sitting on top.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the \"At a Glance\" Difference:**\n    *   The most significant and easily observable difference is the **shape of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, you would look for an erect capsule on a straight seta.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, you would look for a capsule that is bent over or nodding on a distinctly curved seta.\n    *   This difference in posture is a reliable field characteristic that allows for rapid identification without the need for a microscope.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Maturity:** This feature is most obvious when the sporophyte is mature but before the capsule has completely decayed.\n*   **Environmental Conditions:** The curvature of the seta in *Grimmia curviseta* can be more pronounced when dry (a process called hygroscopic movement). However, it remains curved even when moist.\n*   **Other Features:** While other differences may exist (e.g., subtle variations in leaf hair-points, cell structure, or peristome teeth), they are not \"at a glance\" features and require microscopic examination. The seta shape is the primary macroscopic sporophyte character.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved (arcuate), causing the capsule to be bent over or nodding."
