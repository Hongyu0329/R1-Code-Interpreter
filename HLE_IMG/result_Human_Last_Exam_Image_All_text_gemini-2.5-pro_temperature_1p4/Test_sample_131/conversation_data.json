    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic structural features.**\nThe provided image shows a molecule with a complex ring system.\n*   **Heterocyclic rings:** The molecule contains multiple rings, and several of these rings include nitrogen atoms. This is a characteristic feature of alkaloids.\n*   **Nitrogen atoms:** There are two nitrogen atoms in the structure, both of which are tertiary amines integrated into the fused ring system.\n*   **Functional groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a six-membered ring. This functional group is a lactam.\n*   **Ring system:** The molecule is tetracyclic, meaning it is composed of four fused rings. All rings are saturated (or partially saturated in the case of the lactam ring).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The use of wedges (bonds coming out of the plane) and dashes (bonds going into the plane) indicates that the molecule is chiral and has a specific three-dimensional structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core alkaloid skeleton.**\nThe core structure is based on a quinolizidine skeleton. A quinolizidine system consists of two fused six-membered rings sharing a nitrogen atom. This molecule contains multiple such arrangements. This particular tetracyclic nitrogen-containing framework is characteristic of a group of alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids, which are commonly found in plants of the Lupinus genus (lupins).\n\n**Step 3: Compare with known lupin alkaloids.**\nLet's consider some common lupin alkaloids:\n*   **Sparteine:** Sparteine has the same tetracyclic nitrogen framework but lacks the carbonyl group. It is the parent hydrocarbon skeleton (in a sense) for this compound.\n*   **Lupanine:** Lupanine is the oxidized derivative of sparteine where one of the methylene groups adjacent to a nitrogen has been converted to a carbonyl group, forming a lactam. The structure of lupanine perfectly matches the given molecule.\n*   **Cytisine:** Cytisine is another lupin alkaloid, but it contains an aromatic pyridone ring, which is structurally distinct from the given compound.\n*   **Matrine:** Matrine is another tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid but has a different ring fusion pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nBased on the comparison, the molecule is the lactam derivative of sparteine. This compound is widely known by its common name, lupanine. The specific stereochemistry shown in the diagram corresponds to the naturally occurring enantiomer, (-)-lupanine.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Recognizing the class:** The presence of nitrogen in heterocyclic rings is the primary clue that this is an alkaloid.\n*   **Identifying the functional group:** The C=O next to an N in a ring defines it as a lactam, which is a key structural feature differentiating it from other related alkaloids like sparteine.\n*   **Using common names:** For complex natural products, common names are standard practice and much more frequently used than systematic IUPAC names. \"Lupanine\" is the universally accepted common name.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** While assigning the absolute configuration (R/S) for all chiral centers is complex without specific rules and conventions for bridged systems, recognizing the overall shape and comparing it to known structures is a practical approach. The depicted structure is the standard representation for lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
