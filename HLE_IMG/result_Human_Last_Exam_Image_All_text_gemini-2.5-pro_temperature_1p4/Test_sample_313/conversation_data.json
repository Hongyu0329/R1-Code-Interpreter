    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **The Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **The Image:** The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   **The Event:** A quick search for major awards events around June 20, 2019, points to the **2019 NHL Awards**, which were held in Las Vegas on June 19, 2019. The date is a very close match. The image, therefore, depicts a scene from the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **The Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **The Riddle:** This is a word puzzle. We need to find a two-word name \"X Y\" that has a connection to the NHL Awards (from Step 1) and also has a namesake (\"another X Y\") related to a disused substance containing toxic mercury salts.\n*   **Connecting to Mercury:** A notable historical substance containing mercury salts is **Calder's solution** (or Calder's chromic acid), a fixative once used in microscopy and histology. It contained mercuric chloride, a highly toxic mercury salt, and its use has largely been discontinued for safety reasons.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   The key name from the second clue is **Calder**.\n*   We look for an award or a person at the 2019 NHL Awards with the name \"Calder\".\n*   The **Calder Memorial Trophy**, commonly known as the **Calder Trophy**, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's rookie of the year. This award was presented at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n*   This creates a perfect link: The trophy is the Calder Trophy, named after Frank Calder. The toxic substance is Calder's solution, named after a different Calder (J.F. Calder). Thus, the Calder Trophy is an \"X Y\", and \"another Calder\" (the solution) fits the description in the second clue.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\n*   The \"X Y\" in question is the name of the award.\n*   Based on the analysis, X = Calder and Y = Trophy.\n*   Let's check the clues one last time with the answer \"Calder Trophy\":\n    1.  \"Calder Trophy is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" This is correct. The image is from the 2019 NHL Awards, the event where the Calder Trophy was awarded. The phrase \"pictured at an event\" correctly identifies the context.\n    2.  \"Another Calder Trophy has almost ceased to be used...\" This is interpreted as \"Another 'Calder' thing...\" which correctly refers to Calder's solution, the disused chemical mixture containing mercury salts.\n\nBoth clues are satisfied.\n\n<<<Calder Trophy>>>"
