The image displays a fungus characterized by a dimorphic morphology, showing both round-to-oval budding **yeast** cells and elongated, filament-like **pseudohyphae**. Pseudohyphae are chains of elongated yeast cells with constrictions at the septa. This morphological presentation is classic for a species of **Candida**, such as *Candida albicans*, in an invasive infection.
