    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the island where the plant is endemic:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant**\n1.  **Observe Key Features:** The plant in the image has very distinct characteristics. The leaves are evergreen, dark green, and lanceolate to elliptical in shape. The most striking feature is the prominent, intricate network of silvery-white or pale cream-colored veins that stand out against the dark green leaf surface. This pattern is known as reticulate venation. The overall plant appears to be a shrub.\n2.  **Search for a Match:** A search for plants with \"dark green leaves and white net-like veins\" or \"reticulated leaf venation shrub\" leads to a few candidates. The appearance strongly matches certain species within the genus *Daphne*.\n3.  **Narrow Down the Species:** Two species in particular are known for this dramatic leaf venation:\n    *   ***Daphne kamtschatica var. jezoensis***: This variety's name, *jezoensis*, refers to \"Jezo\" or \"Yezo,\" which is a historical name for the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Its common name is Ezo-Yuzuriha.\n    *   ***Daphne miyabeana***: This is another closely related species that is visually very similar, also native to Japan.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Endemic Location**\n1.  **Define \"Endemic\":** A species is endemic to a location if it is found only in that specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world.\n2.  **Check the Distribution of *Daphne kamtschatica var. jezoensis***: Botanical sources indicate that this plant is native to Hokkaido (Japan), Sakhalin (a large Russian island), and the Kuril Islands. Since it grows naturally in several different locations (multiple islands), it is not strictly endemic to a single island.\n3.  **Check the Distribution of *Daphne miyabeana***: Botanical sources consistently state that *Daphne miyabeana* is endemic to the island of Hokkaido, Japan. It is found specifically in limestone areas of that island.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both plants are a very strong visual match for the image. However, the question specifically asks for the island to which the plant was **endemic**. Between the two primary candidates, *Daphne miyabeana* fits this criterion perfectly, as its natural range is restricted solely to the island of Hokkaido. The name of the other likely candidate (*Daphne kamtschatica var. jezoensis*) also strongly points to the same island.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the plant shown is visually consistent with *Daphne miyabeana* (or the very similar *D. kamtschatica var. jezoensis*). *Daphne miyabeana* is strictly endemic to one island. That island is Hokkaido.\n\n<<<Hokkaido>>>"
