    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the cover fragment.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Fragment:** The image displays a section of a book cover. The most prominent feature is a creature that is clearly a unicorn, identifiable by its horse-like body and the single horn on its forehead. The unicorn is depicted in shades of white and light blue, giving it a ghostly or ethereal appearance. It seems to be in motion, possibly running, as suggested by the blurred rendering of its form. The background is dark, likely representing a nighttime or forest setting. On the right edge of the fragment, there is a part of a pillar or archway, painted in warmer tones of yellow and brown.\n\n2.  **Identify the Art Style:** The painterly and slightly whimsical style of the illustration is characteristic of a specific, well-known series. It strongly resembles the artwork of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original US editions of the Harry Potter books.\n\n3.  **Connect to a Specific Book/Scene:** The presence of a unicorn in a dark forest is a key scene in the first Harry Potter book. In the story, Harry encounters a spectral figure drinking the blood of a slain unicorn in the Forbidden Forest. The ethereal depiction of the unicorn in the fragment aligns with this narrative.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Full Book Cover:** A search for the book cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (the US title for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*), specifically the edition illustrated by Mary GrandPré, confirms this identification. The full cover shows Harry on his broomstick flying through arches. In the bottom-left archway, the exact image of this running, ethereal unicorn is present. The fragment is a cropped view of this specific detail from the cover art.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The fragment is definitively from the original US cover of the first book in the Harry Potter series.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe title of the book that has the presented fragment on the cover is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
