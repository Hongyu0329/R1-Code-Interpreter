    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a prominent windmill as its central subject. The atmosphere is dramatic, characterized by a dark, stormy sky with brooding clouds, contrasted by a small patch of blue sky. To the right of the windmill, in the background, a building is visibly on fire, with orange flames and smoke rising. The overall style is painterly and evokes a sense of drama and turmoil, which is characteristic of the Romantic period in art.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the constraints given in the question.**\nThe question specifies that the painting is from the **19th century**. This is a crucial piece of information. While the composition might evoke famous 17th-century Dutch works, such as Rembrandt's \"The Mill\" (c. 1645–1648), we must look for an artist and painting from the 1800s. The resemblance to Rembrandt's work might suggest the 19th-century artist was influenced by or was copying the Old Masters.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a search based on the elements and constraints.**\nA search combining the key elements—\"windmill,\" \"fire,\" \"stormy sky,\" \"19th-century painting\"—is necessary. The dramatic style points towards Romanticism.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the artist and the painting.**\nThe search leads to the Russian Romantic painter **Maxim Vorobiev** (1787-1855). He was known for his dramatic landscapes and cityscapes, often depicting catastrophic events like fires and floods. The image fragment is a perfect match for his painting from **1841**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the title of the painting.**\nThe painting by Maxim Vorobiev is titled **\"The Burning Mill\"** (in Russian: Пожар на мельнице). It is sometimes noted that this painting was created as a \"copy from the painting by Rembrandt,\" which explains the strong stylistic and compositional connection to Rembrandt's work while being a distinct piece with the added dramatic element of the fire.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the visual evidence and the 19th-century timeframe, the painting is identified as \"The Burning Mill\" by the Russian artist Maxim Vorobiev.\n\n<<<The Burning Mill>>>"
