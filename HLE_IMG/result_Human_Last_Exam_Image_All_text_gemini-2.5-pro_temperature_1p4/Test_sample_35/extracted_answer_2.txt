The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-type immunoglobulin domain (labeled "V")** of the RAGE receptor.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. The provided diagram and text show that S100B is over-expressed in neurological disorders and its binding to RAGE directly activates downstream pathways (such as NFÎºB and JNK) that lead to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since the levels of S100B directly correlate with the activity of these core pathological processes, measuring its concentration can help predict the severity, progression, and ultimate outcome of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. It provides more than just supplementary information; it reflects the intensity of the underlying disease mechanism.
