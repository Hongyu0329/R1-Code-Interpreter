The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
The starting material undergoes a Michael addition with methyl propiolate, followed by C-acylation at the alpha-carbon of the ester using acetic anhydride, and finally decarboxylation of the original carboxylic acid.
The structure is 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-[1-(acetyl)-2-(methoxycarbonyl)ethenyl]pyrrolidine.
 

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
The starting material undergoes a Michael addition of the proline nitrogen to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the carboxylic acid attacks the methyl ester, forming a 7-membered cyclic anhydride and eliminating methanol.
 

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
This is the mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material with acetic anhydride.
