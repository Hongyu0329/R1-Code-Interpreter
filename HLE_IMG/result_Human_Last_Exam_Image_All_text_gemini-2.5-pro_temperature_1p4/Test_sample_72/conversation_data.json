    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is a 6π-electron aromatic system.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (C₄H₆, assuming the two vinylic hydrogens are not drawn for simplicity). This contains one double bond, making it a 2π-electron system.\n    *   **Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light).\n    *   **Information from the question:** We are told that two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions take place.\n\n2.  **Identify Plausible Reaction Pathways:**\n    A pericyclic reaction is a concerted reaction that proceeds through a single cyclic transition state. The main types are electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. Given the reactants, we can propose a logical sequence of two pericyclic reactions. A highly plausible pathway involves the initial photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene, which is a well-known reaction.\n\n3.  **Step 1: The First Pericyclic Reaction (Valence Isomerization)**\n    *   Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo photochemical isomerization to form non-aromatic valence isomers. For hexafluorobenzene, this process is particularly favorable, leading to the formation of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (systematic name: hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   This transformation involves the reorganization of the π-electron system to form new σ bonds within the molecule. It is a classic example of an **electrocyclic reaction**. This type of reaction is photochemically allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n    *   So, the first reaction is: Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n    *   **Reaction Type 1: Electrocyclic reaction.**\n\n4.  **Step 2: The Second Pericyclic Reaction (Intermolecular Addition)**\n    *   The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, now contains two reactive double bonds (two 2π systems). It reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene, which has one double bond (a 2π system).\n    *   The reaction between two molecules containing π systems under photochemical conditions is typically a cycloaddition. Specifically, the reaction between two 2π systems (one from Dewar benzene and one from cyclobutene) to form a four-membered ring is called a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction is also photochemically allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. It joins the two molecules together to form the final, more complex product.\n    *   So, the second reaction is: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene → Final Product.\n    *   **Reaction Type 2: [2π+2π] cycloaddition.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Reaction Types:**\n    Based on the analysis, the two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. It's important to note that the final product's drawing seems to be a schematic or contains inconsistencies regarding the atom count of its skeleton. However, identifying the reaction types relies on the established reactivity of the starting materials under the given conditions, not on a potentially erroneous drawing.\n\nThe two pericyclic reactions are:\n*   An **electrocyclic reaction** (the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar isomer).\n*   A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** (the reaction of the Dewar benzene intermediate with cyclobutene).\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition>>>"
