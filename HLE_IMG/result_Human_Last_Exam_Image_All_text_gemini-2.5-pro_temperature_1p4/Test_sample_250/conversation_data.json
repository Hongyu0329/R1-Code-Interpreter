    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Time Signature.**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (Bb), which suggests the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n    *   The piece begins on an F minor chord (F-), which establishes F minor as the tonal center.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4 (common time), which is standard for most jazz tunes. Each measure contains four beats.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Melody.**\n    *   The melody begins with a very distinct four-note phrase in the first measure: C, F, G, A.\n    *   Over the next three bars, the melody descends: Eb (in measure 2), D (in measure 3), C (in measure 4).\n    *   This melodic pattern, especially the opening four notes, is a strong identifier for the tune.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression.**\n    *   The chord progression in the A section is highly characteristic. Let's look at the first four bars:\n        *   `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 |`\n    *   This progression, featuring a descending bass line and chromatic movement, is famous in jazz harmony. It is strongly associated with a specific composer and tune.\n    *   Let's examine the B section (or bridge), which starts on the third line of the music:\n        *   `| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n    *   This progression is a series of ii-V and V-I patterns that modulate through different keys before returning to the home key. Jazz musicians will recognize this as being derived from the chord changes of another famous standard, \"Cherokee\".\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize the Information to Identify the Tune.**\n    *   A jazz standard that uses the \"Cherokee\" bridge but has its own unique A section is known as a contrafact.\n    *   The specific A section melody (starting C-F-G-A) and the chord progression (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7...`) are the defining features of the tune \"Lazy Bird\".\n    *   \"Lazy Bird\" was composed by the legendary saxophonist John Coltrane. It was first recorded for his 1957 album *Blue Train*. The tune is famous for its challenging harmony and its use of the \"Cherokee\" bridge.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   Based on the unique melodic content and the distinctive chord progression (A section) combined with the use of the \"Cherokee\" bridge (B section), the piece is identified as \"Lazy Bird\".\n    *   The composer of \"Lazy Bird\" is John Coltrane.\n\n<<<Title: Lazy Bird, Composer: John Coltrane>>>"
