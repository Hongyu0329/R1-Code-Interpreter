    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the piece of music from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Elements of the Score**\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is written on a grand staff, which consists of a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff joined by a brace. This indicates the music is for a keyboard instrument, most commonly the piano.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature at the beginning of the piece shows two flats (B♭ and E♭). This suggests the key is either G minor or B♭ major.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 'C', which represents common time, or 4/4 (four quarter-note beats per measure).\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo, often described as Andante or walking pace.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Content and Style**\n\n*   **Opening (Measures 1-2):** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano) with a simple, ascending melodic line in the right hand. The notes are G, A, B♭, C, D, E♭, F♯, G. This is a complete G harmonic minor scale. The left hand sustains a low G octave. This opening creates a sense of anticipation and has a distinct Russian character.\n*   **Sudden Contrast (Measure 3):** There is an immediate and dramatic shift in dynamics to *f* (forte) and texture. The music explodes into powerful, fast-moving arpeggios based on the G minor chord. This sudden contrast between a quiet, simple theme and a loud, virtuosic section is a significant stylistic clue.\n*   **Harmonic Language (Measure 4 onwards):** The harmony becomes more complex. For example, measure 4 features a C♯ diminished seventh chord over a D pedal point in the bass, creating intense tension that resolves back to G minor. This type of rich, chromatic harmony is typical of the late Romantic period.\n*   **Rhythmic Character (Measure 8 onwards):** The section starting at measure 8 is marked *mf* (mezzo-forte) and features thick, percussive block chords in both hands. The rhythm is strong, driving, and distinctly march-like (*alla marcia*). This powerful, chordal writing style is very recognizable.\n*   **Overall Impression:** The piece is highly dramatic, virtuosic, and passionate. It demands a powerful piano technique with its wide dynamic range, rapid passagework, and dense chordal textures.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Identify the Piece**\n\n*   The combination of the G minor key, the march-like rhythm, the dramatic dynamic shifts, the virtuosic writing, and the specific opening theme (the ascending G harmonic minor scale) are all iconic hallmarks of a single, very famous piano piece.\n*   These features point overwhelmingly to the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**.\n*   The piece is his **Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5**. It is one of the most famous and beloved pieces in the piano repertoire, renowned for its militaristic A-section and lyrical, contrasting B-section (not shown in this excerpt).\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5>>>"
