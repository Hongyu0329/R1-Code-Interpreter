    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image displays two representations of a sound stimulus.\n    *   The top panel is a **spectrogram**, which plots frequency on the y-axis against time on the x-axis. The intensity of a frequency at a particular time is shown by color or brightness. In this spectrogram, we see a thin, consistent horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. This tone is interrupted by a short, vertical, broad band of energy. This vertical band represents a burst of noise containing a wide range of frequencies. Critically, the horizontal line of the tone is *absent* during the noise burst, meaning the tone was physically removed from the recording at that point.\n    *   The bottom panel is the **waveform** of the same sound, plotting amplitude against time. It shows a regular, periodic sine wave (the pure tone), which is then replaced by a complex, high-amplitude, non-periodic signal (the noise burst), after which the sine wave resumes. This confirms what the spectrogram shows: the tone is physically not present during the noise.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question Text:**\n    *   The phenomenon is described as an **illusion**. This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality presented by the stimulus.\n    *   It is compared to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a line drawing that can be perceived in two different 3D orientations, and our perception can flip between them. This comparison suggests the illusion in question involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous or incomplete stimulus and \"settling\" on a stable perception.\n    *   It reveals a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's a fundamental process our brain uses to make sense of the world, often without our awareness.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Image and Text:**\n    *   The physical stimulus is a tone, followed by noise, followed by the same tone.\n    *   The illusion is what a listener hears. Despite the physical gap, a listener typically perceives the tone as **continuous**, as if it carried on \"behind\" the burst of noise.\n    *   The brain, faced with an unlikely coincidence (a tone stopping exactly as a noise begins, and starting again exactly as it ends), prefers a more probable interpretation: a continuous tone was temporarily masked by a louder sound. This is the \"perceptual ability\" mentioned—the brain fills in the missing sensory information based on context and probability. This process is called perceptual completion or restoration.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   This specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuing through an interrupting, louder sound, is a well-documented psychoacoustic effect.\n    *   When the sound being filled in is a phoneme (a basic unit of speech), the effect is famously called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**, discovered by Richard M. Warren in 1970. For example, if a cough replaces the /s/ sound in \"legislature,\" listeners report hearing the full, uninterrupted word.\n    *   The image uses a simple tone instead of speech, which demonstrates the more general principle of the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration**. The Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most famous example of this broader phenomenon.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The gap is real:** It is essential to understand from the spectrogram and waveform that the tone is physically absent during the noise, not just quieter. The illusion is entirely a creation of the perceptual system.\n*   **The role of the noise:** The effect only works if the interrupting sound is loud enough and has the right frequency characteristics to plausibly \"mask\" the original sound. If the interruption were a silent gap, we would simply perceive the tone stopping and starting.\n*   **Analogy to Necker Cube:** While not perfectly bistable (you don't flip between hearing the tone and not hearing it), the analogy points to the constructive nature of perception—the brain isn't a passive recorder but an active interpreter that resolves ambiguity.\n*   **Unconscious Ability:** This process is crucial for understanding speech in noisy environments, as our brains constantly fill in sounds masked by background noise. We are rarely aware it is happening.\n\nBy combining the analysis of the visual data with the clues in the text, we can confidently identify the name of this specific and well-known perceptual phenomenon.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect"
