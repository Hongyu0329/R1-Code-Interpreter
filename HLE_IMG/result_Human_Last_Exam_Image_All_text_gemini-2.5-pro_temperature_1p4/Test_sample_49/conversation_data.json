    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. This node is connected to a capacitor $C$ and an infinite resistor ladder network. A cutoff frequency arises from the interaction of resistive and reactive components, forming a filter. In this case, it's an RC filter. The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second), is determined by the time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$.\nThe formula for the angular cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with the capacitor $C$ removed and all independent sources deactivated. The input source \"IN\" at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so deactivating it means connecting node $c_0$ to ground. Node $b_0$ is already at ground potential. Therefore, we need to find the resistance between node $a_0$ (which is identical to node $d_0$) and ground.\n\n**Step 3: Setting up the Equations for the Infinite Ladder**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder. We can solve for the resistance by applying a test voltage $V_T$ at node $d_0$ and calculating the resulting current $I_T$ flowing from the source. Then $R_{th} = V_T / I_T$.\nLet $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ for $n \\geq 0$.\nThe boundary conditions for our test setup are:\n*   $v_0 = 0$ (since $c_0$ is grounded)\n*   $u_0 = V_T$ (our test voltage at $a_0 = d_0$)\n\nFor any stage $n \\geq 1$, we can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations.\nAt node $c_n$:\n$\\frac{v_n - v_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - v_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - u_n}{r} = 0$\n$\\implies v_{n-1} + v_{n+1} + u_n - 3v_n = 0$ (Eq. 1)\n\nAt node $d_n$:\n$\\frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - u_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - v_n}{r} = 0$\n$\\implies u_{n-1} + u_{n+1} + v_n - 3u_n = 0$ (Eq. 2)\n\n**Step 4: Solving the System of Difference Equations**\nWe look for solutions of the form $v_n = A k^n$ and $u_n = B k^n$. Substituting these into the equations yields two independent modes:\n1.  A \"common mode\" where $u_n = v_n$, which leads to a characteristic equation $k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0$, with a root $k_c=1$.\n2.  A \"differential mode\" where $u_n = -v_n$, which leads to a characteristic equation $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, with roots $2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. For the voltage to decay or be bounded as $n \\to \\infty$, we choose the root $|k| \\le 1$, so $k_d = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these modes. To satisfy the physical condition of bounded voltages at infinity, we can write:\n$v_n = A \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^n + B$\n$u_n = -A \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^n + B$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions at $n=0$:\n*   $v_0 = 0 \\implies A + B = 0 \\implies B = -A$\n*   $u_0 = V_T \\implies -A + B = V_T$\n\nSubstituting $B = -A$ into the second equation:\n$-A - A = V_T \\implies -2A = V_T \\implies A = -\\frac{V_T}{2}$\nAnd thus, $B = \\frac{V_T}{2}$.\n\nThe voltage at any node $u_n$ is given by:\n$u_n = -(-\\frac{V_T}{2})(2-\\sqrt{3})^n + \\frac{V_T}{2} = \\frac{V_T}{2} \\left[ 1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^n \\right]$\n\n**Step 5: Calculating $R_{th}$**\nThe current $I_T$ from the test source at $d_0$ flows into the resistor connecting $d_0$ to $d_1$.\n$I_T = \\frac{u_0 - u_1}{r}$\n\nWe know $u_0 = V_T$. We calculate $u_1$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{V_T}{2} \\left[ 1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^1 \\right] = \\frac{V_T}{2} (3-\\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $I_T$:\n$I_T = \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ V_T - \\frac{V_T}{2}(3-\\sqrt{3}) \\right] = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right] = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\left[ \\frac{2 - 3 + \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right] = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_T}{I_T}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_T}{\\frac{V_T}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}} = r \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 6: Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency in terms of $r$ and $C$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}}$.\n\n<<<1/(r*(1+sqrt(3))*C)>>>"
