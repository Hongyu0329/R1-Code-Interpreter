    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Goal:** Identify and count all unique splice species (mRNA variants) detected in the experiments shown in panels B through I.\n\n**Method:** We will analyze each RT-PCR experiment (defined by a primer pair) and count the number of unique bands. We must be careful not to double-count a splice species if it is detected in multiple experiments.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each panel:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R) & Panel C (E1F1/E5R):**\n    *   **Panel B** uses the primer pair E1F1/E4R and shows two distinct bands (labeled 1 and 2), with sizes 190 bp and 159 bp. This indicates the presence of **2 splice species**.\n    *   **Panel C** uses the primer pair E1F1/E5R. The reverse primer E5R is located slightly downstream of E4R. It also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). The size difference between the two bands in both panels B (190-159 = 31 bp) and C (584-553 = 31 bp) is identical. This strongly suggests that panels B and C are detecting the same two initial splice species.\n    *   **Conclusion from B & C:** We have identified **2 distinct splice species** so far.\n\n2.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R) & Panel F (E1F2/L2R):**\n    *   **Panel D** uses the primer E1F2, which is a splice-junction primer specific for the 929^3465 splice. It produces a single band of 551 bp. Because it requires a specific splice event that is not required for the species in Panel B/C, this represents a new, distinct splice species.\n    *   **Panel F** uses the same specific forward primer (E1F2) but a different reverse primer (L2R). It also shows a single band (972 bp). This is a longer PCR product from the same splice species identified in Panel D.\n    *   **Conclusion from D & F:** We have identified **1 new splice species**.\n\n3.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):**\n    *   This experiment uses the general forward primer E1F1 and a late reverse primer L2R. It shows one prominent band of 1,005 bp.\n    *   We must check if this is a species we have already counted. It cannot be the same as those from Panels B/C (which are early transcripts) or Panel D/F (which require the specific E1F2 primer). It is also different from the species in Panel G (which require the E1F3 primer). The product size is also distinct. Therefore, this is a new species.\n    *   **Conclusion from E:** We have identified **1 new splice species**.\n\n4.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):**\n    *   This experiment uses the primer E1F3, which is specific for a different splice junction (929^3506). It produces two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp).\n    *   Since these species are defined by a unique splice junction not seen before, they are both new.\n    *   **Conclusion from G:** We have identified **2 new splice species**.\n\n5.  **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles) & Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):**\n    *   These panels use the general E1F1 primer and a reverse primer in the L1 region (L1R), which is downstream of all other reverse primers.\n    *   **Panel H** (20 cycles) clearly shows two bands (450 bp and 419 bp).\n    *   **Panel I** (30 cycles) is a more sensitive amplification of the same region. It reveals the two bands from Panel H plus two additional, fainter bands (378 bp and 187 bp). This means this primer pair detects a total of four different splice species.\n    *   These four species are distinct from those previously identified because they are amplified with a unique reverse primer (L1R) and yield products of unique sizes.\n    *   **Conclusion from H & I:** We have identified **4 new splice species**.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nTo find the total number of unique splice species, we sum the new species identified at each step:\n*   From Panels B/C: 2 species\n*   From Panels D/F: 1 species\n*   From Panel E: 1 species\n*   From Panel G: 2 species\n*   From Panels H/I: 4 species\n\n**Total = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 10**\n\nThere are a total of 10 distinct splice species identified in this series of experiments.\n\n<<<10>>>"
