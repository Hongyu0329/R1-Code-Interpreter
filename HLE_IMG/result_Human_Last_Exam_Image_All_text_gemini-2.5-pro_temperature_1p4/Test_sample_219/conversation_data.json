    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the synchronized bursts and calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The provided image is a raster plot. The y-axis represents 128 different electrodes, and the x-axis represents time in seconds. Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing (an action potential or \"spike\") recorded by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in close temporal proximity. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands on the raster plot. We can identify five such major bursts within the 50-second recording period.\n\n3.  **Determine the Timestamps of the Bursts:** To calculate the interval between bursts, we need to assign a single timestamp to each one. A reliable method is to use the approximate time of peak firing density for each burst.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first burst has its peak activity centered at approximately **t₁ = 3.5 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 15.0 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 25.5 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36.0 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** The fifth burst is centered at approximately **t₅ = 47.0 s**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The IBI is the time difference between the timestamps of consecutive bursts. With five bursts, we can calculate four IBIs.\n    *   **IBI 1:** Time between burst 2 and burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 15.0 s - 3.5 s = **11.5 s**.\n    *   **IBI 2:** Time between burst 3 and burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 25.5 s - 15.0 s = **10.5 s**.\n    *   **IBI 3:** Time between burst 4 and burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 36.0 s - 25.5 s = **10.5 s**.\n    *   **IBI 4:** Time between burst 5 and burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 47.0 s - 36.0 s = **11.0 s**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** We now find the average of the four calculated IBIs.\n    *   Average IBI = (IBI 1 + IBI 2 + IBI 3 + IBI 4) / 4\n    *   Average IBI = (11.5 + 10.5 + 10.5 + 11.0) / 4\n    *   Average IBI = 43.5 / 4\n    *   Average IBI = 10.875 s\n\n6.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated value is 10.875 s.\n    *   The first two significant figures are '1' and '0'.\n    *   The third digit is '8', which is 5 or greater, so we round up the second significant figure.\n    *   Rounding '10' up gives '11'.\n\nTherefore, the average inter-burst interval is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
