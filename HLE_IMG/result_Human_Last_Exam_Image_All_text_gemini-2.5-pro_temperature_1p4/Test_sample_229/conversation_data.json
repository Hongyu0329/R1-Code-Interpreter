    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the musical elements:**\n        *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, indicated by the 'C' symbol (common time) at the beginning.\n        *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking at the top left says \"Med.\" (Medium) and gives a metronome marking of a quarter note equals 128 (â™©=128), which is a moderately fast tempo.\n        *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is characterized by heavy syncopation, use of eighth and sixteenth notes, and arpeggiated figures (notes of a chord played one after another). This creates a driving, \"swinging\" rhythm.\n        *   **Harmony:** Chord symbols (e.g., C, E7, F, G7) are written above the staff. This format, known as a lead sheet, is common in jazz and popular music. The chord progression itself, with frequent use of dominant 7th chords, is typical of jazz.\n        *   **Structure:** The sheet includes repeat signs, and instructions like \"To go out - Take D.S. to Coda\", which indicates a standard song form with repeats and a designated ending section (Coda).\n\n    2.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n        *   The combination of the syncopated, arpeggio-heavy melody, the \"swing\" feel, and the typical instrumentation these pieces are written for (often violin, and acoustic guitars) strongly points to the style of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Sinti Swing). This style was pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n\n    3.  **Identify the Song Title:**\n        *   The opening melodic phrase is highly distinctive. The melody in the first full measure (E-G-A-C-B-A-G-F-E) over a C major chord is the primary theme of the song **\"Tchavolo Swing\"**.\n        *   This tune was composed by the renowned Gypsy Jazz guitarist Tchavolo Schmitt, and this opening lick is his signature on the piece. While there are other famous Gypsy Jazz tunes, this specific melodic and harmonic opening is unique to \"Tchavolo Swing\".\n\n    4.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n        *   The style, Gypsy Jazz, originated in and around Paris, **France**, in the 1930s.\n        *   The composer of \"Tchavolo Swing,\" Tchavolo Schmitt, is a French guitarist of Manouche heritage.\n        *   Therefore, both the genre and the specific song have their origins in France.\n\n*   **Careful points:**\n    *   The score is a handwritten lead sheet, which can sometimes contain variations or simplified chords compared to a fully orchestrated version. The core melody is the most reliable identifier.\n    *   One must differentiate this tune from other popular Gypsy Jazz standards like \"Minor Swing\" or \"Les Yeux Noirs,\" which have different melodies and chord structures, even though they share the same general style. The specific melodic contour in C major confirms it's \"Tchavolo Swing.\"\n    *   The \"country of origin\" refers to where the musical style and this particular song were created, which is definitively France.\n\n<<<Title: Tchavolo Swing, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: France>>>"
