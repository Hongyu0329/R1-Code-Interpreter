    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\n*   **Medium and Style:** The artwork is a bas-relief sculpture. The smooth, white, slightly glossy surface and the style are characteristic of glazed terracotta, a technique famously perfected and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in Renaissance Florence. The figures are rendered with a gentle, serene quality, typical of this school.\n*   **Composition:** The scene is enclosed in a circular frame, known as a tondo. This tondo is part of a larger, decorated panel. The frame of the tondo itself has a classic egg-and-dart motif, surrounded by garlands of fruit and leaves, which are also common elements in Della Robbia works.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The relief depicts a religious scene. A priest is administering communion (the Eucharist) to a group of kneeling figures, including what appear to be friars and a child. This theme is known as the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"The Last Communion.\"\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a small banner (cartouche) with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL.\" This is an archaic Italian spelling for \"Sacramenti de l'Autel,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" explicitly confirming the subject.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual evidence to a specific artist or workshop.**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta, the tondo format, the specific religious subject matter, and the overall serene style strongly points to the workshop of the Della Robbia family.\n*   The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a crucial clue. Searching for this inscription along with \"Della Robbia\" helps pinpoint the exact artwork.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and its creator.**\n*   Research reveals that this tondo is a detail from the predella (the base) of a large altarpiece known as the *Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament* (or *Pala dei Sacramentini*).\n*   This altarpiece was created for the Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament at the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Fiesole, Italy.\n*   Art historical consensus attributes this major work, including its predella with the tondi, to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525), the nephew and principal successor of Luca della Robbia. The work is dated to circa 1464-1466.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n*   The image shows a detail, specifically a tondo from the predella, of the *Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament*.\n*   The author of this altarpiece is well-documented as the Florentine Renaissance sculptor Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
