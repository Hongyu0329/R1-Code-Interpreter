    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in the given cation.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Molecular Structure**\nThe image displays a complex cation with a central Iridium (Ir) ion. The Iridium ion is octahedrally coordinated by three ligands.\n*   Two ligands are of the cyclometalated 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) type. One consists of phenyl ring A and pyridyl ring B. The other consists of phenyl ring C and pyridyl ring D. In these ligands, the Ir is bonded to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring (N from B, N from D) and a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (C6 of A, C6 of C). This C-N bidentate coordination forms a rigid 5-membered ring (a metallacycle).\n*   The third ligand is a 2,2'-bipyridine (`bpy`) type, consisting of pyridyl rings E and F. The Ir is bonded to the nitrogen atoms of both rings (N from E, N from F). This also forms a rigid 5-membered metallacycle.\n*   The overall structure is crowded, with several additional phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) attached as substituents to the main ligand framework.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Free Rotation\"**\nIn this context, a ring can \"rotate freely\" if the energy barrier to rotation around the single bond connecting it to the main structure is low. This barrier is primarily determined by steric hindrance â€“ the repulsive interaction that occurs when atoms are forced into close proximity. A high steric hindrance leads to a high rotational barrier, and the ring's rotation is considered restricted or \"locked\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Phenyl Ring for Steric Hindrance**\n\n*   **Ring L:** This ring is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring C. Position C5 is directly adjacent to position C6, which is covalently bonded to the large Iridium atom. The rotation of ring L would cause its ortho-hydrogens to clash severely with the Iridium atom and the other ligands coordinated to it. This creates a very high energy barrier. Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring J:** This ring is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring C. Position C4 is adjacent to position C5, where the bulky ring L is attached. As established, ring L is locked in place. For ring J to rotate, its ortho-hydrogens would have to pass very close to the ortho-hydrogens of the fixed ring L. Phenyl groups on adjacent carbons of a benzene ring (a 1,2-disubstitution pattern) lead to significant steric clash, resulting in a very high rotational barrier. Therefore, **ring J cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring K:** This ring is attached to position C3 of the phenyl ring A. This position is adjacent to C2, which is bonded to the pyridyl ring B. The formation of the metallacycle forces rings A and B into a relatively coplanar arrangement, so the rotation of ring K would be hindered by the pyridyl ring B. Additionally, the diagram shows a dotted line between Ir and C3, suggesting a close spatial proximity or a specific electronic interaction (like an agostic interaction). This interaction would further lock the ring in place. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring H:** This ring is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring A. Position C4 is adjacent to position C3, where the bulky and locked ring K is attached. Similar to the situation with rings J and L, the proximity of ring H to the fixed ring K creates a major steric barrier to rotation. Therefore, **ring H cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to position C4 of the pyridyl ring F. The positions adjacent to C4 on ring F are C3 and C5. Both these positions are occupied by hydrogen atoms, which are small. Ring F is part of the `bpy` ligand, and the C4 position is located on the periphery of the complex, pointing away from the most crowded regions around the metal center. The rotation of ring G is only hindered by the small hydrogens on the adjacent carbons, which presents a very low energy barrier. Therefore, **ring G can rotate freely.**\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the Findings and Select the Answer**\nBased on the analysis of steric hindrance for each ring:\n*   Ring G: Free to rotate.\n*   Ring H: Hindered/Locked.\n*   Ring J: Hindered/Locked.\n*   Ring K: Hindered/Locked.\n*   Ring L: Hindered/Locked.\n\nOnly ring G can rotate freely. This corresponds to answer choice K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
