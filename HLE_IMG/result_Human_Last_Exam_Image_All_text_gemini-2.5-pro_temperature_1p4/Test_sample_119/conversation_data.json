    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule (1, 3, 5, etc.). Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   The fragmentation pattern provides crucial information. There is a very intense peak at m/z = 91, which is characteristic of the benzyl cation ([C₆H₅CH₂]⁺). This indicates the presence of a C₆H₅-CH₂- group.\n*   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 44. This is a common fragment for amines resulting from α-cleavage (cleavage of the bond adjacent to the C-N bond). The fragment [CH(CH₃)NH₂]⁺ would rearrange to the stable iminium ion [CH₃-CH=NH₂]⁺, which has an m/z of 44.\n*   Combining these fragments, [C₆H₅CH₂]⁺ and [CH(CH₃)NH₂]⁺, suggests the parent molecule is C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula and weight for this structure: C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   MW = (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This matches the molecular ion peak.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecular formula is likely C₉H₁₃N, and the structure is likely 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ (~3030-3080 cm⁻¹) correspond to sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n*   Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ (~2850-2960 cm⁻¹) correspond to sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n*   The pair of peaks in the 1600-1450 cm⁻¹ range are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The region around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ shows weak absorptions, consistent with the N-H stretching of a primary amine (R-NH₂), which typically shows two bands (symmetric and asymmetric stretch).\n*   The absence of a strong, broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹ rules out an alcohol (O-H).\n*   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The spectrum supports a structure with aromatic and aliphatic components, and a primary amine group.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals (7 total):** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   The signals from δ 126 to 146 ppm are in the aromatic region. The signals from δ 19 to 50 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n*   **DEPT-135:** one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate CH or CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) are absent in DEPT-135.\n*   Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals and the DEPT spectrum shows 1 + 5 = 6 signals, there must be one quaternary carbon.\n*   **Assignment based on DEPT and chemical shifts:**\n    *   **Quaternary C (1):** The signal at δ 145.1 ppm is in the aromatic region and has no proton attached (absent in DEPT). This is the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring (the one attached to the side chain).\n    *   **CH (aromatic, 3 signals):** The signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm correspond to the C-H carbons of the phenyl ring. These are positive in DEPT. Due to symmetry, some of these may represent two carbons. A monosubstituted phenyl ring has 3 types of C-H carbons (ortho, meta, para).\n    *   **Aliphatic carbons (3):**\n        *   **CH₂ (1):** One of the aliphatic signals must be negative. Given the benzylic position, the signal at δ 43.5 ppm is a good candidate for the -CH₂- group.\n        *   **CH (1):** The signal at δ 49.6 ppm is in the typical range for a carbon atom bonded to a nitrogen atom (-CH-N). This would be a positive signal.\n        *   **CH₃ (1):** The most upfield signal at δ 19.2 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (-CH₃). This would be a positive signal.\n*   **Summary of Carbon types:** 1 Cq, 3 types of aromatic CH, 1 CH₂, 1 aliphatic CH, 1 CH₃. This perfectly matches the proposed structure C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃. The five positive DEPT signals are the 3 aromatic CHs, the aliphatic CH, and the CH₃. The one negative signal is the aliphatic CH₂.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR signals:**\n    *   δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H): This is the characteristic signal for the 5 protons of a monosubstituted phenyl ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   δ ~2.8-2.9 ppm (multiplet, integration ~2H): This corresponds to the two benzylic protons (-CH₂-). They appear as a complex multiplet because they are adjacent to a chiral center (the CH carbon), making them diastereotopic.\n    *   δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ~3H): A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n*   The proton on the CH carbon (~1H) and the two protons on the primary amine (-NH₂, ~2H) are not clearly resolved or integrated in the provided spectrum, which is common for these types of protons. The CH proton is likely a multiplet around 3.1 ppm, and the NH₂ protons are a broad signal.\n*   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) Analysis:** This spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm).\n    *   The methyl protons (~1.2 ppm) correlate with the methyl carbon (19.2 ppm).\n    *   The CH₂ protons (~2.8 ppm) correlate with the CH₂ carbon (43.5 ppm).\n    *   There is also a likely correlation (though less clear in the image) between a proton around 3.1 ppm and the CH carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR and HSQC:** The data confirms the fragments C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, and -CH-CH₃, and their connectivity as C₆H₅-CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name**\n*   All spectroscopic data consistently point to the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n*   **Structure:** C₆H₅ - CH₂ - CH(NH₂) - CH₃\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  Identify the principal functional group: Amine (-NH₂). The suffix is \"-amine\".\n    2.  Identify the parent alkane chain that includes the carbon attached to the amine. The longest such chain is three carbons long (propane).\n    3.  Number the carbon chain to give the functional group (-NH₂) the lowest possible locant.\n        C¹H₃ - C²H(NH₂) - C³H₂ - C₆H₅\n        This numbering gives the amine group position 2.\n    4.  Identify and name the substituent(s). There is a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) on carbon 1.\n    5.  Combine the parts: locant-substituent + parent-locant-suffix.\n        The name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
