    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the visible organisms in the image.**\nThe photograph displays a community of marine invertebrates on a wet rock surface, characteristic of an intertidal zone. We can clearly identify several types of organisms:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are attached to the rock. They have cone-shaped calcareous plates.\n*   **Large Snails:** Two prominent gastropod snails with thick shells. One is whitish/eroded, and the other has visible brown spiral stripes. Their shape is robust with a short spire, which is typical of dog whelks.\n*   **Small Dark Snails:** There are at least three smaller, dark-colored, conical snails. Their shells appear to have fine spiral ridges.\n*   **Tiny Specks:** The rock surface is also covered with very small, grayish, dot-like organisms, which could be juvenile snails or newly settled barnacles.\n\n**Step 2: Attempt to identify the species and their native ranges.**\nTo answer the question, we need to find a species in the photo that is found on the Atlantic Coast but not the Pacific Coast.\n*   **Barnacles:** The barnacles are likely the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is common in the North Atlantic. While not native to the Pacific, its identification isn't as visually certain as the snails, and other barnacle species exist on both coasts.\n*   **Large Snails (Dog Whelks):** These strongly resemble the Common Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This carnivorous snail is a very common inhabitant of rocky shores in the North Atlantic. However, it has been introduced to and established populations on the Pacific Coast of North America. Therefore, its presence is a strong clue for the Atlantic but not a *definitive* one.\n*   **Small Dark Snails (Periwinkles):** These snails are identifiable as the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. They have the characteristic shape, size, and coloration of this species.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the geographic distribution of the key indicator species.**\nThe crucial part of the question is the word \"definitively\". We must compare the ranges of the potential species.\n*   *Nucella lapillus* (Dog Whelk): Native to the North Atlantic. Introduced and established in the Pacific. **Not a definitive indicator.**\n*   ***Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle):** Native to the coasts of the northeast Atlantic (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now one of the most common intertidal animals there. **Crucially, it is not established on the Pacific Coast.** While isolated findings have been reported, there are no widespread, self-sustaining populations like those seen in the photo.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe presence of a thriving community that includes the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, alongside other typical Atlantic species like *Nucella lapillus*, is definitive evidence that the photograph was taken on a shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean (either in Europe or North America), and not the Pacific. The scientific name of this definitive indicator species is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
