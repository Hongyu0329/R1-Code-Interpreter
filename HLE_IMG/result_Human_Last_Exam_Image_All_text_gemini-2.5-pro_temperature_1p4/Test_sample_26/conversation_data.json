    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key**\nFirst, we must establish the key of the piece. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates either E♭ major or its relative minor, C minor. The \"Pathetique\" sonata is famously in C minor. The movement begins and ends in C minor, confirming it as the home key.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Examine Measure 30**\nThe question directs us to measure 30, which is clearly circled in the provided image. We need to identify all the notes played in this measure in both the right and left hands.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays octave Gs as a tremolo throughout the entire measure. This strongly establishes G as the root of the harmony.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a more complex melodic figure. The notes present are G, B-natural (B♮), F-sharp (F♯), E-flat (E♭), and D.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmony**\nLet's assemble the notes from both staves to identify the chord.\n*   The primary chord tones are established by the strong bass note (G) and the main notes of the right-hand arpeggiations. The notes G, B♮, and D are all present and outline a G major triad.\n*   Now, we must consider the function of the remaining notes, F♯ and E♭. In this context, they function as non-chord tones (or non-harmonic tones) that embellish the main harmony.\n    *   **F♯:** This note appears briefly on the first beat and acts as a chromatic lower neighbor, leading up to the G.\n    *   **E♭:** This note appears on the second and third beats. It can be analyzed as an appoggiatura (a non-chord tone approached by leap and resolved by step) that resolves down to D, which is a member of the G major chord. It creates momentary tension before resolving.\n*   Therefore, the underlying and structural harmony for the entire measure is a G major chord (G-B♮-D).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral**\nNow we relate the G major chord back to the home key of C minor.\n*   The scale of C minor (harmonic form, which is typical for dominant chords) is C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♮.\n*   The fifth degree of the C minor scale is G.\n*   A chord built on the fifth degree is the dominant chord.\n*   In C minor, the dominant chord is typically major (G-B♮-D) because the 7th degree of the scale (B♭) is raised to B♮ to create a leading tone that pulls strongly back to the tonic (C).\n*   A major chord is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral. A chord on the fifth scale degree is represented by the numeral V.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe harmony in measure 30 is a G major chord, which functions as the dominant in the key of C minor. The correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
