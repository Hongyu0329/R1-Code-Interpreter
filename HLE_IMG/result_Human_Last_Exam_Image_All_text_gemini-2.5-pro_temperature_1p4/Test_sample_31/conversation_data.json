    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot from the provided diagram.**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** The provided image shows a knot diagram. Let's count the number of crossings. There is one small twist at the very top of the knot, and then six other crossings throughout the main body of the knot. This gives a total of 7 crossings in this specific diagram.\n\n2.  **Simplify the diagram:** The topmost crossing is a simple kink or twist in the strand. This can be undone by a Reidemeister I move, which does not change the knot type. After untwisting this kink, we are left with a diagram that has 6 crossings. Let's call the original knot K and the knot from the simplified diagram K'. K and K' are the same knot.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 6-crossing diagram (K'):** We need to identify which 6-crossing knot this is. A key property to check is whether the diagram is alternating. An alternating diagram is one where, as you trace along the strand, you pass alternately over and under at the crossings.\n    *   Let's trace the path of the knot in the 6-crossing diagram. Start with the uppermost horizontal strand and follow it from left to right.\n    *   It first passes **over** the vertical strand on the left side.\n    *   It continues to the right and then passes **over** the vertical strand on the right side.\n    *   Since we encountered two consecutive \"over\" crossings, the diagram is **non-alternating**.\n\n4.  **Identify the knot type:** Now we consult the classification of knots with a small number of crossings.\n    *   There are three prime knots with 6 crossings: 6₁, 6₂, and 6₃.\n    *   The knots 6₁ (the Stevedore knot) and 6₂ are both alternating knots. This means all their minimal diagrams are alternating.\n    *   The knot 6₃ is the only **non-alternating** prime knot with 6 crossings.\n    *   Since our 6-crossing diagram is non-alternating, we can confidently identify the knot K as the **6₃ knot**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the 6₃ knot.**\n\n1.  **Definition of the Rasmussen invariant:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer-valued knot invariant that arises from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the slice genus of the knot.\n\n2.  **Property for quasi-alternating knots:** A crucial property of the Rasmussen invariant relates it to the classical knot signature, `σ(K)`. For a class of knots known as **quasi-alternating knots**, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the signature: `s(K) = σ(K)`.\n\n3.  **Is 6₃ quasi-alternating?** A knot is quasi-alternating if it's a \"small\" perturbation of an alternating knot. It has been proven that all prime knots with up to 7 crossings are quasi-alternating. The 6₃ knot is a prime knot with 6 crossings, so it is indeed quasi-alternating. Therefore, the formula `s(6₃) = σ(6₃)` applies.\n\n4.  **Find the signature of 6₃:** The signature `σ(K)` is another integer invariant of knots. We can find its value for standard knots from knot theory tables or databases (like the Knot Atlas or KnotInfo).\n    *   According to these established sources, the signature of the 6₃ knot is **`σ(6₃) = 0`**.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   We have established that the knot is 6₃.\n    *   We know `s(6₃) = σ(6₃)` because 6₃ is quasi-alternating.\n    *   We know `σ(6₃) = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `s(6₃) = 0`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe knot in the picture is the 6₃ knot. Its Rasmussen invariant `s` is equal to its signature `σ`, which is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
