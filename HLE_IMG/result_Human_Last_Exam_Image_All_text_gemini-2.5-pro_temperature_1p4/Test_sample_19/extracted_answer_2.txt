1. The music modulates to the key of E minor.

2. The original key of the piece is C# minor. E is the mediant (the third scale degree) of C# minor. The diatonic mediant chord would be E major (the relative major). By modulating to E minor instead, Beethoven uses a "chromatic mediant" relationship. This is a common and justifiable harmonic device that allows for a shift in tonal center while maintaining the overall somber mood.

3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 functions as the dominant of the new key, E minor. Since E minor is the chromatic mediant (iii) of the home key C# minor, the chord is a secondary dominant. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking is V/iii.
