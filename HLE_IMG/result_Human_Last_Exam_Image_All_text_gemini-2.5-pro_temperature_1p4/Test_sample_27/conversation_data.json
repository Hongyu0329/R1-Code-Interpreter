    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Painting and Identify Key Features**\nThe image provided is a watercolor painting of a landscape. It features a body of water in the foreground, with a shoreline and green, rolling hills in the background. A key element for identification is often a signature from the artist.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Examine the Signature**\nBy carefully inspecting the painting, particularly the bottom right corner, a signature and a date can be found. The cropped images provided help to see this detail more clearly.\n\n**Step 3: Decipher the Signature**\nThe signature is handwritten. The last part is clearly the name \"Prat Cros\", followed by the year \"'79\" (which stands for 1979). There is another word before \"Prat Cros\", which is likely the name of the location where the painting was made, a common practice for landscape artists. The prominent and recurring part of the signature is \"Prat Cros\".\n\n**Step 4: Research the Artist**\nUsing the name \"Prat Cros\" as a search query for artists, especially painters from the 20th century, leads to the Catalan artist Agustí Prat i Cros.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the Artist's Identity and Style**\nFurther research on Agustí Prat i Cros (1910-1982) confirms that he was a prolific watercolorist known for his landscapes of the Empordà and Costa Brava regions of Catalonia, Spain. The style, subject matter (coastal scene), medium (watercolor), and signature in the painting are all consistent with his known works. The date, 1979, falls within his active years as an artist.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\nBased on the signature \"Prat Cros\" and the consistent artistic style, the artist is identified. The question asks for the full name.\n\nThe full name of the artist is Agustí Prat i Cros.\n\n<<<Agustí Prat i Cros>>>"
