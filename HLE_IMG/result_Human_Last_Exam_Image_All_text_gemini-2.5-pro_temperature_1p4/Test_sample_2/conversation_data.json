    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe provided pseudocode defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    \n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      \n    # 3. Second recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array with one or zero elements is considered sorted.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the algorithm does the following:\n    1.  It calls itself to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n    2.  It compares the last two elements of the current subarray, `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n    3.  It calls itself *again* to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n*   **Indentation:** The indentation in the provided image shows the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call is at the same level as the `if` statement. This means it is executed regardless of whether the swap occurs or not. It is not inside the `if` block.\n\nEven if we were to assume the second call is inside the `if` block (a different interpretation of the indentation), for a worst-case analysis, we must consider an input that triggers the `if` condition at every step, leading to the same recurrence relation. A reverse-sorted array would cause this behavior. Therefore, the worst-case complexity is the same under both interpretations.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort(a, n)` function in the worst case.\n*   **Base Case:** For `n <= 1`, the function does constant work. So, `T(1) = c_1` (a constant).\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n    1.  One recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    2.  A comparison and a potential swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`, let's call it `c_2`.\n    3.  A second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nSince the second call is unconditional (or we are analyzing the worst case where it is always triggered), the total time is the sum of these parts.\nThe recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c_2`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\nSubstitute `k = n-1` into the equation:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-2} + ... + 1)`\n\nThe term `(2^{n-2} + ... + 1)` is a geometric series sum, which equals `(2^{n-1} - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^{n-1} - 1`.\nSince `T(1)` is also a constant, let's call it `d`.\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * d + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = d*2^{n-1} + c*2^{n-1} - c`\n*   `T(n) = (d+c)*2^{n-1} - c`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Big-O Complexity\n\nThe dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d+c)*2^{n-1}`. In Big-O notation, we ignore constant factors and lower-order terms.\n\n*   `T(n) = O(2^{n-1})`\n\nSince `2^{n-1} = (1/2) * 2^n`, and we ignore constant factors, the time complexity is:\n\n*   `T(n) = O(2^n)`\n\nThis is an exponential time complexity, which is highly inefficient for a sorting algorithm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe recurrence relation for the given algorithm is `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This matches option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
