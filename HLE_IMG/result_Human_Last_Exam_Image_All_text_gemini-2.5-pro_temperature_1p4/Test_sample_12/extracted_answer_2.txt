No, the salience in the framework is defined by the objective properties of the diagnostic information within the simulation, not by the learner's individual differences. The framework breaks salience down into four components—Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity—all of which are described as designable characteristics of the simulation itself (e.g., physical availability of information, audiovisual cues, amount of data). The text and the diagram do not include any elements to suggest that these properties are determined by or vary with the individual learner's characteristics.
