    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the rotational symmetry of the given tiling pattern. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' (or n-fold rotational symmetry) means that the pattern looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point. We need to find the largest value of 'n' for which this is true.\n\n2.  **Identify repeating elements and potential centers of rotation:** The tiling is composed of three types of colored polygons: dark blue hexagons, tan squares, and orange rhombi. Points that are candidates for centers of rotation are typically the geometric centers of these polygons or the vertices where multiple polygons meet.\n\n3.  **Analyze potential 6-fold rotation:** Let's examine the points where six of the orange rhombi meet at their acute-angled corners. These points form the center of a prominent six-pointed star or rosette motif.\n    *   **Action:** Imagine placing a pin at the center of one of these rosettes and rotating the entire image.\n    *   **Rotation by 60° (360°/6):** If we rotate the pattern by 60 degrees around this central point, each orange rhombus moves into the position of the adjacent orange rhombus. The tan squares located between the points of the star also move into the positions of their adjacent counterparts. The surrounding blue hexagons also rotate into the positions of their neighbors. The entire pattern, including shapes and colors, maps perfectly onto itself.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since a rotation of 60° leaves the pattern unchanged, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry. The center of each of these rosettes is a center of 6-fold rotation.\n\n4.  **Analyze potential 4-fold rotation:** Let's consider the center of one of the tan squares. A square itself has 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Action:** Imagine rotating the pattern around the center of a tan square.\n    *   **Rotation by 90° (360°/4):** A 90-degree rotation will map the square onto itself. We must check if the surrounding pattern also maps onto itself. The square is bounded by four blue hexagons and has an orange rhombus at each of its four corners. A 90-degree rotation would permute these surrounding shapes. A closer look at the blue hexagons reveals they are not regular hexagons (their internal angles are not all equal). The way they connect to the square and the rhombi is not identical on all four sides with respect to a 90-degree rotation. Specifically, the arrangement of vertices on one side of the square is mirrored on the adjacent side, not simply rotated. Therefore, a 90-degree rotation does not leave the overall pattern unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The center of the square is not a center of 4-fold rotation. It is, however, a center of 2-fold rotation (a 180° rotation works).\n\n5.  **Analyze potential 2-fold and 3-fold rotations:**\n    *   A 6-fold symmetry center is automatically also a center for 2-fold (180°) and 3-fold (120°) rotations.\n    *   As mentioned, the centers of the tan squares are centers of 2-fold rotation.\n    *   The centers of the blue hexagons are also centers of 2-fold rotation.\n\n6.  **Final Determination:** We have identified centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry of the tiling. This is conventionally understood as the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern. The highest order we have found is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
