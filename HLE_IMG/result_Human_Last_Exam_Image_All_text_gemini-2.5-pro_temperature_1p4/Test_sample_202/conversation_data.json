    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, bubbly appearance. The holes (vesicles) are quite large and irregular. Individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye, indicating a fine-grained (aphanitic) or glassy texture.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas was trapped within lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. This points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron. This combination of features is characteristic of scoria.\n*   **Identification:** **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of various smaller, angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained, light-gray matrix. The fragments (clasts) vary in color (including reddish and dark gray pieces) and size.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a clastic rock, meaning it's made of fragments of other rocks. The angular nature of the clasts and the mix of volcanic materials (the fragments and the fine ash matrix) indicate it was formed from a violent, explosive volcanic eruption where airborne material settled and consolidated.\n*   **Identification:** **Volcanic Breccia** (a type of pyroclastic rock).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This is a light-colored (off-white to light gray) rock with a very high number of small vesicles, giving it a frothy or spongy texture. It appears to be very lightweight. The texture is fine-grained or glassy.\n*   **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is a vesicular, extrusive igneous rock. However, its light color suggests a felsic (silica-rich) composition, and its extremely high porosity is distinctive. This rock is essentially volcanic glass froth.\n*   **Identification:** **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. The crystals are of different minerals, with light-colored (white, pinkish) and dark-colored components. The grain size is very coarse.\n*   **Interpretation:** The large, interlocking crystals indicate the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock. The mineral colors suggest a composition similar to granite (feldspar, quartz, and some dark minerals like biotite or hornblende). The exceptionally large crystal size is the defining feature.\n*   **Identification:** **Pegmatite**.\n\n**Final Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
