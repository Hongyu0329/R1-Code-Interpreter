    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the animal.**\nThe image displays a small insect on a yellow flower. Key features of the insect include:\n*   **Classification:** It has six legs, two antennae, and a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), which are characteristics of an insect. Its mouthparts, though not clearly visible, are likely piercing-sucking, typical of the order Hemiptera (true bugs).\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. The head is entirely black. The pronotum (the part of the thorax just behind the head) has a prominent orange or reddish-orange band across its top. The rest of the body and wings appear to be a combination of this same orange-red color and black.\n*   **Shape:** The body is oval and somewhat flattened, consistent with many species of \"seed bugs\".\n*   **Environment:** The insect is seen on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago*).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the species based on the features.**\nThe combination of a black head and a prominent orange-red band directly behind it is a key diagnostic feature. This pattern is characteristic of the **Small Milkweed Bug**.\n\nLet's compare this to other similar-looking insects:\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** While also orange and black, its pattern is different. It typically has a black band across the middle of its wings and its pronotum is mostly orange with a black edge, not a distinct orange band on a black pronotum.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** This bug is generally more slender and has red lines outlining its body and wings, rather than the broad patches of color seen here.\n\nThe insect in the photo perfectly matches the description and appearance of the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 3: Find the scientific name.**\nThe common name of the insect identified is the Small Milkweed Bug. The corresponding scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*. The species is named after the botanist Pehr Kalm.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nBy carefully observing the insect's distinct coloration, body shape, and comparing it to known species, the animal is identified as the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
