    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It is treated with catalytic acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 °C). The products are an alkene (C30H50) and water. This indicates an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a carbocation rearrangement. The question explicitly mentions that the rearrangement involves a series of [1,2] shifts. This type of reaction is a classic Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically known in triterpenoid chemistry as a \"backbone rearrangement.\" The driving force is the relief of conformational strain present in the reactant's skeleton (a friedelane type) to form a more stable skeleton (an oleanane type).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Skeletons**\n*   **Reactant:** The reactant has a friedelane-type skeleton, which is known to be conformationally strained. Although the drawing has some inconsistencies with the standard friedelane structure (particularly at the C5/C10 positions), we will analyze the canonical transformation.\n*   **Product:** The product has an oleanane-type skeleton with a double bond between C13 and C18. This product is known as olean-13(18)-ene, also called glutinene or δ-amyrin. The problem asks for the identity of the substituents at five specific positions in this final product.\n\n**3. Propose the Rearrangement Mechanism (The Friedelane-Oleanane Rearrangement)**\nThe rearrangement proceeds via a cascade of [1,2]-hydride (H-) and [1,2]-methyl (CH3-) shifts, propagating a positive charge across the carbon backbone.\n\n*   **Step A: Formation of the initial carbocation.** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C3 is protonated by HCl to form -OH2+, a good leaving group. Loss of water generates a secondary carbocation at C3.\n*   **Step B: The [1,2] shift cascade.** The cation at C3 initiates a series of shifts. We will trace the movement of both hydride and methyl groups. To resolve inconsistencies between the provided drawing and the known reaction, we will use the structure of a standard precursor (like epifriedelinol, which has a Me at C5 and H at C10, and gem-dimethyl at C4) as this leads to the correct final product skeleton and explains the final positions of the substituents.\n    1.  **Cation at C3:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from the gem-dimethyl group at C4 to C3. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4. C4 now has one methyl group remaining from the original pair.\n    2.  **Cation at C4:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C5 to C4. This relieves significant steric strain. The carbocation moves to C5. C4 now has two methyl groups again (its original one and the one from C5). This is consistent with the gem-dimethyl group shown at position 1 in the product.\n    3.  **Cation at C5:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C10 to C5 moves the carbocation to C10. C5 now has a hydrogen atom.\n    4.  **Cation at C10:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C9 to C10 moves the carbocation to C9.\n    5.  **Cation at C9:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C8 to C9 moves the carbocation to C8.\n    6.  **Cation at C8:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C14 to C8 moves the carbocation to C14. C8 now has a methyl group.\n    7.  **Cation at C14:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C13 to C14 moves the carbocation to C13.\n*   **Step C: Elimination.** The cascade terminates when the cation is at C13. A proton is removed from the adjacent carbon C18 by a base (H2O), forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C13 and C18.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Substituents**\nThis reaction is a known named transformation in organic chemistry. The product is definitively olean-13(18)-ene (glutinene). We can determine the substituents by examining the known structure of this molecule. The mechanistic analysis, while complex and sensitive to the exact starting isomer, ultimately leads to this specific, thermodynamically favored product.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This label points to the carbon C4. The rearrangement results in C4 having a gem-dimethyl group. Thus, the substituents are methyl groups. A single substituent at position 1 (e.g., the α-position) is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2:** This label points to the β-position on C10. In the oleanane skeleton of the product, this position is occupied by a **CH3** group.\n*   **Position 3:** This label points to the α-position on C5. In the final product, this position is occupied by a **H** atom.\n*   **Position 4:** This label points to the β-position on C8. As a result of the rearrangement, a methyl group ends up at C8. This position is occupied by a **CH3** group.\n*   **Position 5:** This label points to the α-position on C14. In the final oleanane product, this position is occupied by a **CH3** group.\n\n**Summary of Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = CH3\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = CH3\n\nFinal answer format: 1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z.\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
