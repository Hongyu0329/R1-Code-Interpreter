    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Grid**\nThe objective is to determine the two numbers in the topmost horizontal run of two white squares. Let's call these cells A (left) and B (right). Kakuro puzzles require filling white squares with digits from 1 to 9 such that the sum of digits in each run (a contiguous block of white cells) equals the associated clue. All digits within a single run must be unique.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Clues**\nThe provided Kakuro puzzle uses a non-standard and ambiguous layout for its clues. A standard Kakuro places clues within black cells adjacent to the runs they correspond to. In this diagram, clues are placed outside the grid with lines that are not always clear. This ambiguity leads to multiple possible interpretations.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Contradictions from Standard Interpretations**\nLet's try a common-sense interpretation where clues on the left apply to horizontal runs and clues on top apply to vertical runs. This leads to several direct contradictions within the puzzle's constraints.\n\nFor example, a very clear contradiction arises in the lower part of the grid:\n1.  The clue `28` on the left corresponds to the horizontal run of four cells in the fourth row (let's call the cells K, L, M, N). The sum `K+L+M+N = 28`. For four unique digits to sum to 28, the digits must be either `{4, 7, 8, 9}` or `{5, 6, 8, 9}`. In either case, every digit in this run must be 4 or greater. Therefore, `L ≥ 4`.\n2.  The clue `16` on the left corresponds to the horizontal run of two cells in the fifth row (let's call them O, P). The sum `O+P = 16`. The only unique pair of digits that sums to 16 is `{7, 9}`. Therefore, cell `O` must be either 7 or 9.\n3.  The clue `6` in the central black square corresponds to the vertical run below it, which consists of cells L and O. Thus, `L+O = 6`.\n4.  From points 1 and 2, we know `L ≥ 4` and `O ≥ 7`. This means their minimum possible sum is `L+O ≥ 4+7 = 11`. This directly contradicts the third point, which states `L+O = 6`.\n\nSince this and other interpretations lead to logical impossibilities, the puzzle as depicted contains flaws and is unsolvable through pure, straightforward deduction.\n\n**Step 4: Infer the Intended Clue for the Target Cells**\nThe question implies that there is a correct solution. This suggests we must infer the puzzle-maker's intent, likely assuming a typo or that one interpretation is the \"correct\" one despite the diagram's ambiguity.\n\nLet's focus on the top row containing cells A and B. There are three clues located near this run: `10` (to the left), `15` (above, between runs), and `17` (above the first cell). Let's consider each as the potential sum for `A+B`.\n*   If `A+B = 10`, the possible pairs are `{1,9}`, `{2,8}`, `{3,7}`, `{4,6}`.\n*   If `A+B = 15`, the possible pairs are `{6,9}`, `{7,8}`.\n*   If `A+B = 17`, the only possible pair is `{8,9}`.\n\nWell-designed puzzles often have clues that lead to unique deductions. The fact that `A+B=17` yields a single, unique pair of digits (`8` and `9`) makes it the most likely intended clue for the primary row in question. While the placement of the `17` is ambiguous, choosing it as the horizontal sum provides a direct path to a unique answer for the specific question asked.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Determination**\nBased on the inference that the intended sum for the top two squares is 17 (as it's the only one that provides a unique solution), the two numbers must be 8 and 9.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9"
