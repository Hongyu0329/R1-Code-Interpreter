    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles of Sex Determination in Bees and Wasps:**\n\nSeveral morphological traits (sexual dimorphism) can be used to distinguish between male and female Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with one more segment (13) than females (12). In some species, male antennae are distinctly different in shape (e.g., curled at the tip).\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments and a stinger (a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying tube) at the tip. Males have 7 visible segments and lack a stinger; their abdomen is often more rounded or blunt at the tip. In some specific groups, the tip of the abdomen has unique structures for each sex.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Structures (Scopae):** In many bee species, females have specialized hair structures called scopae for carrying pollen. These can be on the hind legs or on the underside of the abdomen (a ventral scopa). Males lack scopae. The question specifies that the collected taxa do not have scopae on their legs.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In some bees, males have yellow or white markings on their faces (clypeus), while females have dark faces.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\nThis pair belongs to a group of kleptoparasitic bees known as cuckoo bees. The females do not build their own nests or collect pollen, hence they lack scopae, which fits the problem description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This specialized shape is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*. She uses this pointed abdomen to pierce the nest cell wall of her host bee (like a leafcutter bee) to lay her egg inside.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee has a blunt abdomen that terminates in a series of spines or prongs. This multi-pronged abdominal tip is the characteristic feature of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female (F), Right is Male (M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\nThese are social wasps. Wasps are predators or scavengers, not pollen collectors, so they lack scopae, which fits the problem description. Both sexes will visit flowers for nectar.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most prominent feature for sexing this wasp is its antennae. The tips of the antennae are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic and reliable trait of male wasps in the family Vespidae, including *Polistes*.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae of this wasp are straight, without the curled tips seen on the left insect. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Bees (likely different genera)**\nThis pair consists of two different types of bees. The prompt's condition of \"no scopae on their legs\" is key here.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee is identifiable by its exceptionally long antennae, which curve back significantly. This is the defining characteristic of a male \"long-horned bee\" (tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*). His face also appears to be marked with yellow, another common male trait. Males do not have scopae.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical of a female bee. Furthermore, its abdomen is very hairy underneath, with the hairs appearing dense and yellow (likely with pollen). This is a \"ventral scopa\" — a pollen-collecting structure on the abdomen, not the legs. This is characteristic of female bees in the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees). The presence of any scopa, regardless of location, confirms the individual is a female.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: F, M — Index 4\n*   Pair B: M, F — Index 3\n*   Pair C: M, F — Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
