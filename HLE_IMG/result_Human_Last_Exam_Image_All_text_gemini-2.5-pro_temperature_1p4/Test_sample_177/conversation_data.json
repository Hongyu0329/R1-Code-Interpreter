    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the \"Baseline\" (Table 1) travel patterns to the \"Proposed\" (Table 2) patterns. The formula for percentage reduction is:\n`((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\n**Step 2: Define and Formulate VMT Calculation**\nVMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) is a measure of the total mileage traveled by vehicles. In this problem, we are interested in cars. The tables show two categories of car travel: 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'. For VMT, both are treated as one vehicle.\nTotal VMT is the sum of the VMT from each distance category. The VMT for any given category is calculated as:\n`VMT_category = (Share of Total Trips in category) × (Total Car Mode Share in category) × (Average Trip Distance for category)`\nTo simplify, we can calculate a \"weighted VMT\" per 100 total trips, which is equivalent to working with the percentages directly.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The question is about *Vehicle* Miles Traveled, not *Person* Miles Traveled. Therefore, the data on \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is extraneous and should not be used in the calculation.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** VMT must be calculated for each distance segment (0-3 miles, 3-5 miles, etc.) separately and then summed. Using the \"Total\" column for mode share directly would be incorrect because it does not properly weight the different average trip distances.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\nWe will calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category and then sum them. The \"Total Car Mode Share\" is the sum of the shares for 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT:**\n    *   VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\nWe repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16%\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT:**\n    *   VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed\n    *   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100%\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n    *   Percentage Reduction ≈ 52.1957%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
