    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereocenters (chiral centers) in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given structure, there are three such centers along the main carbon backbone. Let's label them C2, C3, and C4 from left to right for the purpose of this analysis (this may not correspond to official IUPAC numbering).\n\n*   **C2**: The leftmost chiral center, bonded to -OH, -CH3, -H (implied), and the rest of the carbon chain (at C3).\n*   **C3**: The central chiral center, bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), -H (implied), the C2 part of the chain, and the C4 part of the chain.\n*   **C4**: The rightmost chiral center, bonded to -CH3, -CH2NH2, -H (implied), and the rest of the carbon chain (at C3).\n\n**2. Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S) for Each Chiral Center**\n\nWe will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to assign priorities (1-4, with 1 being the highest) to the groups attached to each chiral center. Then, we determine the configuration as either R (rectus, clockwise) or S (sinister, counter-clockwise).\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C2 (leftmost)**\n\n*   **Groups attached to C2**:\n    1.  -OH\n    2.  -C3H(Et)... (rest of the chain)\n    3.  -CH3 (part of the main chain, to the left)\n    4.  -H (implied)\n\n*   **Assigning CIP Priorities**:\n    1.  **-OH**: Priority 1 (Oxygen, atomic number 8, is highest).\n    2.  **-C3H(Et)...**: This is a carbon attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen. It has higher priority than the methyl group. Priority 2.\n    3.  **-CH3**: A carbon attached to three hydrogens. Priority 3.\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4 (lowest).\n\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    *   In the drawing, the bond to -OH is dashed (pointing away from the viewer).\n    *   The bonds to -CH3 and -C3 are shown in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   The implied -H must be on a solid wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (4, -H) is pointing towards the viewer, we determine the direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from -OH (1, back) -> -C3 (2, down-right) -> -CH3 (3, up-left) traces a **clockwise** circle.\n    *   Because the H is pointing forward, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes **S**.\n    *   Alternatively, using the swap method: Swap H(4, wedge) and OH(1, dash). Now H is back. OH(1) is on a wedge (front), C3(2) is plane-down-right, and CH3(3) is plane-up-left. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 (front -> down-right -> up-left) is clockwise, meaning the swapped molecule is R. Therefore, the original molecule is **S**.\n\n    **Configuration at C2 is S.**\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C3 (central)**\n\n*   **Groups attached to C3**:\n    1.  -C2H(OH)CH3 group\n    2.  -C4H(CH3)(CH2NH2) group\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    4.  -H (implied)\n\n*   **Assigning CIP Priorities**:\n    1.  **-C2H(OH)CH3**: The carbon C2 is attached to (O, C, H). Highest priority among the carbon groups. Priority 1.\n    2.  **-C4H(CH3)(CH2NH2)**: The carbon C4 is attached to (C, C, H). Priority 2.\n    3.  **-CH2CH3**: The first carbon of the ethyl group is attached to (C, H, H). Priority 3.\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4.\n\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    *   The bond to the ethyl group is wedged (forward).\n    *   The implied -H must be dashed (backward).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (4, -H) is pointing away from the viewer, we can directly determine the configuration from the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from the C2-group (1, up-left) -> C4-group (2, down-right) -> ethyl group (3, front) traces a **clockwise** circle.\n\n    **Configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C4 (rightmost)**\n\n*   **Groups attached to C4**:\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl group)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)... (rest of the chain)\n    3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n    4.  -H (implied)\n\n*   **Assigning CIP Priorities**:\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is attached to Nitrogen (N, atomic number 7). This takes precedence over other carbon attachments. Priority 1.\n    2.  **-C3H(Et)...**: Carbon C3 is attached to (C, C, H). Priority 2.\n    3.  **-CH3**: Carbon is attached to (H, H, H). Priority 3.\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4.\n\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    *   In the drawing, the bond to -CH2NH2 is wedged (forward) and the bond to -CH3 is dashed (backward). This implies the bonds to -C3 and -H are in the plane.\n    *   The lowest priority group (4, -H) is in the plane of the drawing. We can use the swap method.\n    *   Let's swap the positions of H(4) and the dashed group, CH3(3).\n    *   In the new (swapped) molecule, H(4) is dashed (back), and CH3(3) is in the plane.\n    *   Now, we look at the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   -CH2NH2 (1) is wedged (front).\n    *   -C3 (2) is in the plane (up-left).\n    *   -CH3 (3) is now in the plane (where H was).\n    *   The path 1 (front) -> 2 (up-left) -> 3 (down-right) traces a **clockwise** circle.\n    *   This means the configuration of the swapped molecule is R.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n\n    **Configuration at C4 is S.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers from left to right are S, R, and S.\n\nFinal Answer should list the configuration for each center in order.\n*   Chiral center with -OH group: S\n*   Chiral center with ethyl group: R\n*   Chiral center with -CH3 and -CH2NH2 groups: S\n\nThe final answer is S, R, S.\n\n<<<S, R, S>>>"
