    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule is a bicyclic lactam. It is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The nitrogen atom is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group, and there is a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O. CAN is a well-known oxidizing agent used for the deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group is oxidatively cleaved from the nitrogen atom, which is then protonated to form a secondary amide (lactam with N-H).\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is the deprotected lactam: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Carbons (C): There are 6 carbons in the bicyclic framework and 1 carbon in the CF3 group. Total = 7 C.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 1H on N, 1H on bridgehead C1, 1H on bridgehead C4, 1H on the double bond at C5, and 2H on the methylene bridge C7. Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 H.\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3 F in the CF3 group.\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 N in the lactam ring.\n    *   Oxygen (O): 1 O in the carbonyl group of the lactam.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in MeOH. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The lactam carbonyl and the CF3 group are generally stable under these conditions. The reaction involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the double bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product, Intermediate 2, is the saturated bicyclic lactam: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Starting from Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO), we add two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction and the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C. These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n*   **Transformation:** The lactam (a cyclic amide) is hydrolyzed. The amide bond (N-C=O) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). This opens the ring. The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Product:** The final product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid. Specifically, it is an isomer of 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water.\n    *   Starting from Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO), we add one molecule of H2O.\n    *   Carbons: 7 C (unchanged).\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 H + 2 H (from H2O) = 10 H.\n    *   Fluorines: 3 F (unchanged).\n    *   Nitrogen: 1 N (unchanged).\n    *   Oxygens: 1 O + 1 O (from H2O) = 2 O.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the **Final Product** is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Atomic Changes:**\n1.  **Start to Intermediate 1:** Removal of PMB group (-C8H9O) and addition of H. Net change: -C8H8O.\n2.  **Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2:** Addition of H2. Net change: +H2.\n3.  **Intermediate 2 to Product:** Addition of H2O. Net change: +H2O.\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
