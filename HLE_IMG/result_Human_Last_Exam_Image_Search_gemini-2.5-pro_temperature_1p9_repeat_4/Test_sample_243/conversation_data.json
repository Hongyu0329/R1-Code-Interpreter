    "Based on the visual characteristics of the plant in the image, particularly the dark green leaves with prominent, reticulated white veins, the plant is identified as *Sideroxylon socorrense*.\n\nThis plant species is endemic to Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico. It also grows on the Pacific coast of mainland Mexico in the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. On Socorro Island, this small tree is typically found in seasonally humid woodland areas at elevations between 650 and 900 meters. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to threats from introduced species like sheep and locusts. The fruits of *Sideroxylon socorrense* are a known food source for the nearly-extinct Socorro mockingbird and the Socorro dove, which now survives only in captivity.\n\n<<<Socorro Island>>>"
