    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements.**\n    *   The image displays two plots representing a sound signal over time.\n    *   The top plot is a **spectrogram**. It shows the frequency content of the sound on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. We can see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the spectrogram, this tone is interrupted and replaced by a wide vertical smear of frequencies, which represents a burst of noise. After the noise, the pure tone resumes. This shows that physically, the tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then starts again.\n    *   The bottom plot is a **waveform**. It shows the amplitude of the sound signal over time. Initially, we see a regular, smooth sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. Then, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the noise burst. Afterward, the smooth sine wave returns. This confirms the sequence of events shown in the spectrogram: Tone -> Noise -> Tone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the textual clues in the question.**\n    *   **\"Illusion\":** The phenomenon is a perceptual illusion, meaning what we perceive is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n    *   **\"Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets an ambiguous 2D image as one of two possible 3D cubes. The brain actively constructs a stable perception from an ambiguous input. The analogy suggests that the auditory illusion in question also involves the brain \"filling in\" or actively interpreting an ambiguous or interrupted signal to create a coherent perception.\n    *   **\"Reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that the illusion makes us aware of a mental process that our brain performs automatically in everyday life. For example, when listening to someone speak in a noisy environment, we often perceive their speech as continuous even if parts of it are momentarily drowned out by other sounds (like a door slamming or a cough).\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information.**\n    *   The stimulus is a tone that is physically replaced by a burst of noise.\n    *   The question implies that our perception of this event is an illusion where our brain \"completes\" the stimulus.\n    *   Listeners subjected to this sound typically do not perceive a tone that stops, is followed by noise, and then restarts. Instead, they perceive the tone as *continuing uninterrupted through the noise*.\n    *   The brain fills in the gap, creating the perception of continuity. This \"filling in\" is the unconscious perceptual ability mentioned. The brain assumes that the tone is more likely to have continued and been masked by the noise, rather than stopping and starting again perfectly around the noise.\n    *   This specific psychoacoustic phenomenon is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**. A well-known specific case involving speech sounds is called the Phonemic Restoration Effect. Given the stimulus is a generic tone, the broader term is more appropriate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final conclusion.**\n    *   The image depicts the stimulus for the Auditory Continuity Illusion. The description in the question accurately characterizes the nature of this illusion. Therefore, the name of the phenomenon is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
