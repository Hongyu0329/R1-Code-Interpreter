    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the total current that flows from the positive terminal of the voltage source, V2. This is the total current consumed by the entire circuit.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Circuit's Structure**\nThe circuit consists of a 1 V DC voltage source (V2) connected to two parallel branches of resistors.\n*   The top horizontal wire is connected to the positive terminal of the source and is at a potential of +1 V (relative to ground).\n*   The bottom horizontal wire is connected to the negative terminal of the source and to the ground symbol, meaning it is at a potential of 0 V.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Left Branch**\n*   This branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n*   At first glance, R1, R2, and R3 appear to be in series. However, there is a crucial connecting wire that changes the configuration.\n*   **Careful Point:** A wire connects the top rail (+1 V) directly to the node between resistor R2 and resistor R3.\n*   Let's analyze the effect of this wire. The voltage at the top of the R1-R2 series combination is +1 V. The voltage at the bottom of the R1-R2 series combination (at the node between R2 and R3) is also +1 V, due to the direct connection to the top rail.\n*   Since the voltage potential at both ends of the series combination of R1 and R2 is the same (+1 V), the voltage difference across them is 0 V.\n*   According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), if the voltage (V) is 0, the current (I) is also 0. Therefore, no current flows through R1 and R2. They are effectively short-circuited or bypassed.\n*   So, for the left branch, the current flows from the +1 V rail, through the shorting wire, to the top of R3, then through R3 (9 Ω) to the ground (0 V).\n*   The effective resistance of this entire branch is simply the resistance of R3.\n*   R_left = R3 = 9 Ω.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Right Branch**\n*   This branch contains resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω).\n*   R8 is connected between the top rail (+1 V) and the top of R7.\n*   R7 is connected between the bottom of R8 and the ground rail (0 V).\n*   R7 and R8 are connected in series.\n*   The total resistance of the right branch is the sum of the individual resistances.\n*   R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Current in Each Branch**\nNow we can use Ohm's Law (I = V/R) to find the current flowing through each of the two parallel branches.\n*   Current in the left branch (I_left) = V2 / R_left = 1 V / 9 Ω = 1/9 A.\n*   Current in the right branch (I_right) = V2 / R_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 1/200 A.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Current**\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current leaving the voltage source is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\n*   I_total = I_left + I_right\n*   I_total = (1/9) A + (1/200) A\n*   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9 * 200 = 1800.\n*   I_total = (200/1800) A + (9/1800) A\n*   I_total = (200 + 9) / 1800 A = 209/1800 A\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer in Decimal Form**\nTo get a numerical value, we convert the fraction to a decimal.\n*   I_total = 209 ÷ 1800 ≈ 0.116111... A.\n*   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.116 A.\n\nThe total current flowing from the source V2 is approximately 0.116 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.116>>>"
