    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Goal**\nThe circuit shown is an infinite resistive ladder network connected to an input at node $g_0$ and terminated with a capacitor $C$ at node $a_0$. The question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This is characteristic of a low-pass filter, where the cutoff frequency is determined by the time constant formed by the capacitor $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor. The cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\n**2. Strategy: Finding the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nOur primary task is to find the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ with respect to the terminals of the capacitor, which are nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground). To do this, we follow two steps:\n- Remove the capacitor $C$ from the circuit.\n- Deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source (implied), so we connect node $g_0$ to ground.\n\nNow, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit contains an infinite ladder network that begins \"upwards\" from nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$. To find the resistance of the overall circuit, we must first find the equivalent resistance of this infinite ladder.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Correctly model the repeating unit of the ladder.**\n    The ladder consists of repeating sections. Let's look at the structure from the perspective of a pair of nodes $(c_n, d_n)$. The resistance looking into the ladder from these nodes, let's call it $R_L$, is made up of:\n    1.  A horizontal resistor `r` connecting nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$.\n    2.  This is in parallel with a path that goes up the ladder through two vertical resistors `r` (from $c_n$ to $c_{n+1}$ and from $d_n$ to $d_{n+1}$) to the next section.\n    3.  Because the ladder is infinite, the resistance looking into the next section at $(c_{n+1}, d_{n+1})$ is also $R_L$.\n\n*   **Step-by-step calculation of the ladder's equivalent resistance, $R_L$:**\n    The total resistance of the path going \"up\" from $(c_n, d_n)$ is the sum of the two vertical resistors and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder: $r + r + R_L = 2r + R_L$.\n    This path is in parallel with the horizontal resistor `r`. Thus, the total equivalent resistance $R_L$ is given by the recurrence relation:\n    $R_L = r \\parallel (2r + R_L)$\n\n    Let's solve for $R_L$:\n    $R_L = \\frac{r (2r + R_L)}{r + (2r + R_L)} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_L}{3r + R_L}$\n    $R_L(3r + R_L) = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n    $3rR_L + R_L^2 = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n    $R_L^2 + 2rR_L - 2r^2 = 0$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Solve the quadratic equation correctly and choose the physical solution.**\n    Using the quadratic formula, $R_L = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n    $R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2}$\n    $R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n    Since resistance must be positive, we choose the positive root:\n    $R_L = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**4. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nNow we can simplify the circuit to find $R_{th}$. The entire infinite ladder (from nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$ upwards) can be replaced by its equivalent resistance $R_L$ connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Combine all resistances correctly to find $R_{th}$.**\n    With the input node $g_0$ grounded, the resistance path from $a_0$ to ground is as follows:\n    - From node $a_0$, there is a resistor $r$ to node $d_1$.\n    - From node $d_1$, there is the equivalent ladder resistance $R_L$ to node $c_1$.\n    - From node $c_1$, there is a resistor $r$ to node $g_0$ (which is grounded).\n\n    These three resistive elements are in series. Therefore, the total Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ is their sum:\n    $R_{th} = r + R_L + r = 2r + R_L$\n    Substitute the expression for $R_L$:\n    $R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 2r + r\\sqrt{3} - r = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**5. Determining the Cutoff Frequency ($\\omega_c$)**\nFinally, we substitute the calculated $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff frequency.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Use the correct formula for cutoff frequency.**\n    The cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ for this first-order RC low-pass filter is:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n    Substituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ in terms of $r$ and $C$."
