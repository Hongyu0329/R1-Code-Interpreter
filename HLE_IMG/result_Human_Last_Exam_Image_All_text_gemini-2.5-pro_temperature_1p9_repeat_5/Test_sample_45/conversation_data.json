    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Rotational Symmetry:** Rotational symmetry means that if you rotate an object around a central point by a certain angle (less than a full 360 degrees), it looks exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the object looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which usually refers to the highest order of symmetry found anywhere in the pattern.\n\n2.  **Identify the Tiles:** The tiling is constructed from several repeating shapes (polygons):\n    *   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow squares.\n    *   Orange rhombi (a type of parallelogram with four equal sides).\n\n3.  **Find Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we look for points in the tiling that can act as centers of rotation. We can test the centers of the most prominent shapes.\n\n4.  **Test the Center of a Hexagon:**\n    *   Let's choose one of the dark blue hexagons as a reference. Its center is a potential center of rotation.\n    *   A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it maps onto itself when rotated by multiples of 60 degrees (360° / 6 = 60°).\n    *   Now, we must check if the *entire pattern* also remains unchanged with a 60-degree rotation around the hexagon's center.\n    *   Observe the tiles surrounding the central hexagon. There is a ring of six light yellow squares, with their sides attached to the sides of the hexagon. There is also a ring of six orange rhombi in the gaps between the squares.\n    *   If we rotate the entire pattern by 60 degrees around the center of the hexagon, the hexagon itself looks the same. Each square moves into the position previously occupied by the next square, and each rhombus moves into the position of the next rhombus. The pattern of surrounding hexagons also rotates perfectly into place.\n    *   Since the tiling maps onto itself after a 60-degree rotation, it possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n5.  **Test Other Potential Centers (for completeness):**\n    *   **Center of a Square:** If we pick the center of a light yellow square, we can see that a 90-degree rotation (360° / 4) also maps the pattern onto itself. The square maps to itself, and the surrounding hexagons and rhombi move into the positions of identical tiles. This means the tiling also has centers of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Other points:** There are other points of symmetry. For example, the point where two rhombi meet is a center of 2-fold rotational symmetry (180-degree rotation).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The tiling has points with 6-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold rotational symmetry. According to standard convention, the rotational symmetry of the entire pattern is defined by the highest order of rotation it possesses. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the tiling has a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
