The structures of the three products are as follows:

*   **Product A:**
    A bicyclic lactam derived from the ring-opening of the dihydropyrrole moiety, followed by acetylation and a cascade reaction with the proline and methyl propiolate components.
     

*   **Product B:**
    A tetracyclic cage-like compound formed through a sequence of Michael addition of the imine to methyl propiolate, followed by two intramolecular cyclization/condensation steps with the loss of methanol.
