    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the **main difference** in the **sporophyte** that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* **at a glance**. This means we need to find the most obvious visual character of the spore-producing generation (the capsule and its stalk).\n\n2.  **Identify the Sporophyte Structures:** In mosses, the sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Foot:** The part embedded in the parent gametophyte plant, anchoring it and absorbing nutrients. This is not usually visible.\n    *   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape are important identification characters.\n    *   **Capsule:** The structure at the top of the seta that contains the spores. Its shape, orientation, and features are also key characters.\n\n3.  **Analyze the provided image of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   The image shows mature, dehisced (opened) capsules.\n    *   The capsules are sitting low among the leafy shoots of the gametophyte. They appear erect and are not held high on a long stalk.\n    *   This appearance indicates that the **seta** (stalk) is very short and straight, making the capsule either **immersed** (completely hidden among the leaves) or **emergent** (peeking out just above the leaves). This is a known characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   The name of the species itself provides a crucial clue. The specific epithet \"**curviseta**\" is derived from Latin: *curvus* meaning \"curved\" and *seta* meaning \"stalk\" or \"bristle\".\n    *   Therefore, *Grimmia curviseta* translates to \"the *Grimmia* with the curved seta\".\n    *   Botanical descriptions confirm this. The defining feature of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte is its **long and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta**.\n\n5.  **Compare the two species and identify the main difference:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **short, straight seta**, which results in an erect capsule that is immersed or emergent among the leaves.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a **long, strongly curved seta**, which causes the capsule to be bent downwards or to the side, making it appear nodding or pendulous.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While there may be subtle differences in capsule shape, the most striking and reliable difference for field identification is the morphology of the seta.\n*   **Glance Value:** The straight, erect posture of the *G. montana* capsule versus the bent, nodding posture of the *G. curviseta* capsule is a high-contrast difference, easily seen \"at a glance.\"\n*   **Fertile Plants:** This distinguishing feature is only present on fertile plants that have produced sporophytes. When sterile, the two species can be much harder to tell apart.\n*   **Image Interpretation:** The provided image clearly shows the immersed/emergent and erect capsules of *G. montana*, perfectly illustrating one side of this comparison.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between the two species is the structure of the seta. This fundamental difference in the stalk leads to a dramatically different presentation of the capsule.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be erect and either immersed or emergent from the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or pendulous."
