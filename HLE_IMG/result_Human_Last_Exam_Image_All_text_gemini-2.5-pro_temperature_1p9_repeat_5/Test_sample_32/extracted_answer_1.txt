The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be erect and either immersed or emergent from the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or pendulous.
