Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The prominent white, fuzzy sphere on the branch is an insect gall, specifically a woolly oak gall. This structure is created by a gall wasp. The female wasp laid her egg inside the tissue of the oak twig, and the gall then formed around the developing larva to provide food and protection. Therefore, the egg was laid inside the oak twig where the gall is located.
