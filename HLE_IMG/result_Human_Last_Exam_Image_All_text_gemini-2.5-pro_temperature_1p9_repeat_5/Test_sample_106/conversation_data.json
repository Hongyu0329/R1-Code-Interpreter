    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a polycyclic alcohol, a type of reaction known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a triterpene backbone rearrangement. To determine the substituents at the numbered positions in the product, we must trace the reaction mechanism step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (SM) and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   The starting material is a saturated pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It has a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 and various methyl groups and hydrogens at specific stereocenters along the fused ring system.\n    *   The reaction is carried out with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 °C. These are typical conditions for acid-catalyzed dehydration and carbocation rearrangements, often leading to the thermodynamically most stable product.\n\n2.  **Propose the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step A: Formation of a Carbocation.** The hydroxyl group at C-3 is protonated by the acid (HCl) to form a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺). This group departs, generating a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n    *   **Step B: Carbocation Rearrangement.** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and will rearrange to form more stable carbocations (preferably tertiary) or to relieve ring strain. The problem states that a \"number of [1,2] shifts\" are involved, which indicates a cascade of migrating groups (hydrides, H⁻, or methyls, CH₃⁻) to an adjacent carbocation center. The goal of this cascade is to move the positive charge to a position from which a stable alkene can be formed. The product shown has a C12=C13 double bond (a stable, tetrasubstituted alkene), which is a common \"thermodynamic sink\" for these rearrangements. This means the carbocation must migrate from C-3 all the way to C-13.\n\n3.  **Trace the Cascade of Shifts:**\n    *   **Initial Carbocation:** C⁺ at C-3.\n    *   The product diagram shows that the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 remains intact. If the carbocation at C-3 initiated a [1,2]-methyl shift from C-4, C-4 would lose a methyl group and gain a hydrogen later in the sequence, which contradicts the product structure.\n    *   A more plausible initiation is a **[1,3]-hydride shift**, where the hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates directly to the C-3 carbocation. This is a valid carbocation rearrangement that bypasses the C-4 center, leaving the gem-dimethyl group untouched, and directly forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-5.\n        *   **Cation moves from C-3 to C-5.** C-3 gains an H. C-5 loses an H and becomes C⁺.\n\n    *   Now the cascade of **[1,2]-shifts** begins from the tertiary carbocation at C-5:\n        1.  **C⁺ at C-5.** To move the charge further, the methyl group (CH₃) from C-10 migrates to C-5. The carbocation moves to C-10 (tertiary).\n            *   **Result:** C-5 now has a CH₃ group. C-10 becomes C⁺.\n        2.  **C⁺ at C-10.** The hydrogen atom (H) from C-9 migrates to C-10. The carbocation moves to C-9 (tertiary).\n            *   **Result:** C-10 now has an H atom. C-9 becomes C⁺.\n        3.  **C⁺ at C-9.** The methyl group (CH₃) from C-8 migrates to C-9. The carbocation moves to C-8 (tertiary).\n            *   **Result:** C-9 now has a CH₃ group. C-8 becomes C⁺.\n        4.  **C⁺ at C-8.** The methyl group (CH₃) from C-14 migrates to C-8. The carbocation moves to C-14 (tertiary).\n            *   **Result:** C-8 keeps a CH₃ group (albeit a different one). C-14 becomes C⁺.\n        5.  **C⁺ at C-14.** The hydrogen atom (H) from C-13 migrates to C-14. The carbocation moves to C-13 (tertiary).\n            *   **Result:** C-14 now has an H atom. C-13 becomes C⁺.\n\n    *   **Step C: Termination.** The carbocation is now at C-13. The molecule eliminates a proton from the adjacent C-12 position to form the stable tetrasubstituted C12=C13 double bond shown in the product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Substituents at the Final Positions (1-5):**\n    We now determine what substituent ends up at each numbered position in the final product molecule.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (on C-4):** This position belongs to one of the methyl groups of the original gem-dimethyl pair at C-4. Since our proposed mechanism bypasses C-4, this methyl group is not involved in the rearrangement and remains a methyl group.\n        *   **1 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 3 (on C-5):** In the starting material, C-5 has a hydrogen atom. This H migrates to C-3 in the initial step. Later, the methyl group from C-10 migrates *to* C-5. Therefore, position 3 is now a methyl group.\n        *   **3 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 2 (on C-10):** In the starting material, C-10 has a methyl group. This CH₃ migrates away to C-5. Later, the hydrogen atom from C-9 migrates *to* C-10. Therefore, position 2 is now a hydrogen atom.\n        *   **2 = H**\n\n    *   **Position 5 (on C-9):** In the starting material, C-9 has a hydrogen atom. This H migrates away to C-10. Later, the methyl group from C-8 migrates *to* C-9. Therefore, position 5 is now a methyl group.\n        *   **5 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 4 (on C-8):** In the starting material, C-8 has a methyl group. This CH₃ migrates away to C-9. However, a methyl group from C-14 then migrates *to* C-8. Therefore, position 4 still holds a methyl group.\n        *   **4 = CH₃**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis, the substituents at the specified positions in the final product are:\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH₃\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = CH₃\n\nThis analysis resolves the apparent contradictions with a simple reading of the product structure by correctly identifying that the diagram is a template whose substituents must be determined via the mechanism.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
