    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and Identify the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity (spikes) of multiple neurons over time.\n-   The y-axis, \"Electrode Number,\" represents the individual neurons or recording sites (from 0 to 128).\n-   The x-axis, \"Time (s),\" represents the time in seconds.\n-   Each small black dot represents an action potential (a \"firing\" or \"spike\") from a specific neuron at a specific time.\n-   \"Synchronized bursts\" are periods of intense, coordinated firing across a large population of neurons. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands on the raster plot.\n-   The goal is to first identify the times at which these bursts occur and then calculate the average time duration between them (the average inter-burst interval, IBI), rounding the final answer to two significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nBy visually inspecting the raster plot, we can identify the distinct, vertically-aligned, dense regions of firing. We will estimate the start time for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first clear burst begins shortly after t=0 s. Its starting edge appears to be at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The second burst occurs after the 10 s mark. Its starting edge is at approximately **t₂ = 12 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** The third burst is visible between 20 s and 30 s. It starts at approximately **t₃ = 23 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A prominent burst starts between 30 s and 40 s. Its leading edge is at approximately **t₄ = 34 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The last clear burst in the recorded window starts just before 50 s, at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps for the starts of the five synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 12 s, 23 s, 34 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between the start of one burst and the start of the next. With five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n\n-   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 2 s = 10 s.\n-   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 23 s - 12 s = 11 s.\n-   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 34 s - 23 s = 11 s.\n-   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4.\n    IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 34 s = 14 s.\n\nThe calculated intervals are 10 s, 11 s, 11 s, and 14 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n-   Sum of all IBIs = 10 s + 11 s + 11 s + 14 s = 46 s.\n-   Number of intervals = 4.\n-   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s.\n\n**Step 5: Round the Result to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n-   The calculated average is 11.5 s.\n-   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1.\n-   The digit following the second significant figure is 5, so we round the second significant figure up.\n-   Rounding 11.5 to two significant figures gives 12.\n\nTherefore, the average inter-burst interval is 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12>>>"
