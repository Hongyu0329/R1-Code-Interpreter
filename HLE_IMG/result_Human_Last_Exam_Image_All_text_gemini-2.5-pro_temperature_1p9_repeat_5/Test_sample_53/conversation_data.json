    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements.** The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase, specifically using the red-figure technique with added white paint. It shows a dramatic scene involving a chariot.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the main characters.**\n    *   **Charioteer:** A figure wearing an ornate, patterned, long-sleeved garment and a Phrygian cap is driving the chariot. In Greek art, this style of dress often identifies a character as being from the East (a \"barbarian\" from a Greek perspective). This specific iconography is strongly associated with the mythological figure Medea.\n    *   **Other figure in the chariot:** Next to the driver is a figure draped in white cloth, seemingly a passenger.\n    *   **Falling figure:** A nude male figure is shown tumbling out of the chariot. His body is limp and contorted, suggesting he is either dead or dying.\n    *   **Figure on the ground:** Another nude male figure, identical in appearance to the one falling, lies lifelessly on the ground below the chariot.\n    *   **Chariot and surroundings:** The chariot is being pulled by a white horse (partially visible), and a large white wing is depicted above, indicating that the chariot is flying.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reconstruct the mythological narrative.** The combination of these elements—the Eastern-dressed woman (Medea), a flying chariot, and dead children—points to the famous climax of the myth of Medea. After her husband Jason abandons her for the princess of Corinth, Medea enacts a terrible revenge. She murders the princess and her father, and then, in her final act of vengeance against Jason, she kills their own two sons. She then escapes from Corinth in a magical, winged (or dragon-pulled) chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios, taking the bodies of her children with her to deny Jason the right to bury them.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the question.** The question asks to identify the figure \"leaving the chariot.\" This refers to the male figure depicted falling over the side. Based on the mythological context, this figure is one of the two sons of Medea and Jason whom she has just murdered. The artist shows one son falling and the other already on the ground to depict the murder of both children.\n\n<<<One of the sons of Medea>>>"
