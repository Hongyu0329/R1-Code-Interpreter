    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic compound. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system.\n*   Let's identify the components and count the atoms:\n    *   **Bicyclic skeleton (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one)**: This contains 6 carbon atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, 1 oxygen atom, and several hydrogen atoms.\n        *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   N2: 1 N\n        *   C3 (carbonyl): 1 C, 1 O\n        *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C5 (alkene): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C6 (alkene): 1 C, no H (bonded to C1, C5, and CF3)\n        *   C7 (bridge): 1 C, 2 H\n        *   Total for the bare skeleton: C6H5NO\n    *   **Substituents**:\n        *   **PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group on N2**: This group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n            *   Carbons: 1 (in CH2) + 6 (in benzene ring) + 1 (in OCH3) = 8 C\n            *   Hydrogens: 2 (in CH2) + 4 (in C6H4) + 3 (in OCH3) = 9 H\n            *   Oxygens: 1 (in OCH3)\n            *   Formula: C8H9O\n        *   **F3C (trifluoromethyl) group on C6**: This group has the formula -CF3.\n            *   Carbons: 1 C\n            *   Fluorines: 3 F\n*   **Total molecular formula of the starting material**:\n    *   C: 6 (skeleton) + 8 (PMB) + 1 (CF3) = 15 C\n    *   H: 5 (skeleton) + 9 (PMB) = 14 H\n    *   F: 3 F\n    *   N: 1 (skeleton) = 1 N\n    *   O: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB) = 2 O\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Intermediate 1 and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: The starting material is treated with CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation**: CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in molecular formula**:\n    *   We remove the PMB group: -C8H9O.\n    *   We add a hydrogen atom: +H.\n    *   The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1**:\n    *   Starting formula: C15H14F3NO2\n    *   Subtract: C8H8O\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1 = C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Intermediate 2 and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in methanol.\n*   **Transformation**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) to a single bond. The lactam (amide) and trifluoromethyl groups are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in molecular formula**:\n    *   The hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n    *   The net change is the addition of H2.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2**:\n    *   Starting formula (Intermediate 1): C7H6F3NO\n    *   Add: H2\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2 = C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the formation of the final Product and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation**: These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or, in this case, a lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (N2-C3) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule.\n*   **Change in molecular formula**:\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O), opening the lactam ring to form an amino acid.\n    *   The net change is the addition of H2O.\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product**:\n    *   Starting formula (Intermediate 2): C7H8F3NO\n    *   Add: H2O\n    *   Formula of the final product = C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nFinal careful points check:\n*   The reactions are standard and their outcomes are predictable.\n*   Atom counting for each group (PMB, CF3, skeleton) is done correctly.\n*   The change in formula at each step corresponds to the known transformation.\n*   The final formula is derived logically from the starting material through the sequence of reactions. The formula should be written in standard order (C, H, then alphabetical for other elements).\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
