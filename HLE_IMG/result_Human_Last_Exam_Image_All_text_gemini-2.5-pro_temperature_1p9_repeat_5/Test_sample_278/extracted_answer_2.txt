The image displays a dimorphic fungus, most likely of the genus *Candida*. The morphology observed consists of two forms: 1) ovoid, budding yeast cells, and 2) filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated yeast cells with characteristic constrictions at the septations. This dual morphology is a classic sign of a *Candida* infection within tissue.
