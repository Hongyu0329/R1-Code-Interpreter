    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule in the picture has three such centers. Let's label them from left to right for initial analysis.\n\n*   **C_left:** The leftmost chiral center, bonded to an -OH group, a -CH3 group, the rest of the carbon chain to the right, and an implicit hydrogen atom.\n*   **C_middle:** The central chiral center, bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), connected to the left and right parts of the chain, and an implicit hydrogen atom.\n*   **C_right:** The rightmost chiral center, bonded to a -CH2NH2 group, a -CH3 group, the rest of the carbon chain to the left, and an implicit hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Priorities and Determine Configuration for C_left**\n\n1.  **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups on C_left:**\n    *   The atom attached to C_left with the highest atomic number gets the highest priority.\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n    *   Priority 2: The rest of the carbon chain to the right (-C_middle...) is a carbon attached to other carbons, so it's higher priority than a simple methyl group.\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (a carbon attached only to hydrogens).\n    *   Priority 4: -H (implied hydrogen, lowest priority).\n\n2.  **Determine the spatial arrangement and configuration:**\n    *   The -OH group (1) has a wedged bond (coming out of the plane).\n    *   The -CH3 group (3) has a dashed bond (going into the plane).\n    *   The bond to -C_middle (2) and the implicit bond to -H (4) are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, 4) is in the plane, we can use the \"swap\" method. Let's mentally swap the positions of the -H group (4) and the group with the dashed bond, -CH3 (3).\n    *   After the swap, the -H group is now pointing away (dashed). We can now determine the configuration of this hypothetical molecule.\n    *   Tracing the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 gives: -OH (wedged) → -C_middle (in plane) → -CH3 (now in plane). This path traces a counter-clockwise circle.\n    *   Thus, the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original C_left center is the opposite, which is **R**.\n\n**Step 3: Assign Priorities and Determine Configuration for C_middle**\n\n1.  **Assign CIP priorities to the groups on C_middle:**\n    *   All three non-hydrogen groups are attached via carbon. We must look at the atoms attached to these carbons.\n    *   Priority 1: -C_left group. The C_left atom is attached to (O, C, H).\n    *   Priority 2: -C_right group. The C_right atom is attached to (C that is bonded to N, C, H). Comparing the lists of atoms attached (O,C,H) vs (C,C,H - looking just at atoms attached to C_right, not further), the oxygen gives the C_left group higher priority. Let's re-evaluate C_right's neighbours more accurately: C_right is attached to a C (in CH2NH2), another C (in CH3) and C_middle, H. So atoms are (C,C,C,H). The C from CH2NH2 is attached to an N. The C from C_left is attached to an O. O has a higher atomic number than N. Thus, the C_left group has higher priority than the C_right group.\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl group). The first carbon is attached to (C, H, H).\n    *   Priority 4: -H (implicit hydrogen).\n    *   The priority order is: -C_left > -C_right > -Ethyl > -H.\n\n2.  **Determine the spatial arrangement and configuration:**\n    *   The ethyl group (3) has a wedged bond (out).\n    *   The implicit -H group (4) has a dashed bond (in), as is standard for a vertex with one wedged substituent.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, 4) is pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration.\n    *   Tracing the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 gives: -C_left → -C_right → -Ethyl. This path traces a clockwise circle.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration of the C_middle center is **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign Priorities and Determine Configuration for C_right**\n\n1.  **Assign CIP priorities to the groups on C_right:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to N, H, H. Nitrogen has a higher atomic number than carbon).\n    *   Priority 2: -C_middle group (a carbon attached to other carbons).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (a carbon attached to hydrogens).\n    *   Priority 4: -H (implicit hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Determine the spatial arrangement and configuration:**\n    *   The -CH2NH2 group (1) is wedged (out).\n    *   The -CH3 group (3) is dashed (in).\n    *   The bond to -C_middle (2) and the implicit bond to -H (4) are in the plane.\n    *   Again, let's use the swap method. Swap the -H group (4) with the -CH3 group (3).\n    *   Now, the -H group is dashed. Tracing the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 gives: -CH2NH2 (wedged) → -C_middle (in plane) → -CH3 (now in plane). This path is counter-clockwise.\n    *   The swapped molecule has an S configuration. Therefore, the original C_right center's configuration is **R**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion with IUPAC Numbering**\n\nTo provide a standard answer, we need the IUPAC name to number the chiral centers correctly.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** The alcohol (-OH) has higher priority than the amine (-NH2).\n*   **Parent Chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is a pentane (5-carbon) chain.\n*   **Numbering:** Numbering the pentane chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number (position 2) leads to the name **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n*   **Mapping configurations to IUPAC numbers:**\n    *   C_left corresponds to **C2**. Configuration is R. → **(2R)**\n    *   C_middle corresponds to **C3**. Configuration is R. → **(3R)**\n    *   C_right corresponds to **C4**. Configuration is R. → **(4R)**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<< (2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
