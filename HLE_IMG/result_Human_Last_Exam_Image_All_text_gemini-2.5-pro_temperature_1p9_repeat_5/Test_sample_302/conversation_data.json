    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the seal characters:\n\n1.  **Seal Type and Script:** The object in the image is a traditional Chinese seal (印章, yìnzhāng). The characters are carved in an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy known as Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū).\n\n2.  **Reading Direction:** The characters on a seal are carved in reverse (as a mirror image). When the seal is stamped onto paper to create an impression, the characters appear in the correct orientation. The standard reading order for a four-character seal impression is from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n\n3.  **Character Identification (in reading order of the impression):**\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This character is 萬 (wàn). It means \"ten thousand\" or \"myriad\".\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This is the character 壽 (shòu). It means \"longevity\" or \"long life\". It is highly stylized in seal script.\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This character is 無 (wú). It means \"without\" or \" limitless\".\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This character is 疆 (jiāng). It means \"border\" or \"limit\".\n\n4.  **Assembling the Phrase:** When read in the correct order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left), the characters form the well-known Chinese idiom: **萬壽無疆** (Wàn Shòu Wú Jiāng). This is a traditional blessing that means \"limitless longevity\" or \"may you live ten thousand years.\"\n\n5.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese:** The question asks for the content in simplified Chinese characters. We need to convert the traditional characters:\n    *   Traditional 萬 becomes Simplified 万.\n    *   Traditional 壽 becomes Simplified 寿.\n    *   Traditional 無 becomes Simplified 无.\n    *   The character 疆 is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the simplified Chinese content on the seal is **万寿无疆**.\n\n<<<万寿无疆>>>"
