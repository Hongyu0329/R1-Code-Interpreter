    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = [(VMT_baseline - VMT_proposed) / VMT_baseline] * 100%\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1.  **VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled):** This measures the total miles traveled by vehicles, not people. It's calculated as (Number of Vehicle Trips) × (Trip Distance).\n2.  **Person Trips vs. Vehicle Trips:** The tables provide mode shares for *person trips*. To calculate VMT, we must convert person trips into vehicle trips.\n    *   For 'car, 1 occupant' (Single Occupancy Vehicle or SOV), 1 person trip = 1 vehicle trip.\n    *   For 'car, with more than 2 occupants' (High Occupancy Vehicle or HOV/Carpool), vehicle trips = person trips / average occupancy.\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a sum of the VMT from each of the four distance categories, weighted by the 'share of total trips' for each category.\n\n---\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT**\n\nWe will calculate a VMT index, which represents the average VMT per person trip across the entire system. This is done by summing the contribution from each of the four trip distance categories.\n\n**Formula for VMT index:**\nVMT_index = Σ [ (Share of total trips) × (Average trip distance) × (Vehicle trips per person trip for cars) ]\n\nFor a given distance category:\nVehicle trips per person trip for cars = [ (Mode share of 'car, 1 occ') / 1 ] + [ (Mode share of 'car, >2 occ') / Average Carpool Occupancy ]\n\n**Baseline Data (Table 1):**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy = 2.8\n\n**Calculation by Distance Category:**\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.48 (share) × 1 (dist) × [(0.25 / 1) + (0.28 / 2.8)]\n    *   = 0.48 × 1 × [0.25 + 0.10] = 0.48 × 0.35 = **0.168**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.22 (share) × 4 (dist) × [(0.38 / 1) + (0.43 / 2.8)]\n    *   = 0.88 × [0.38 + 0.1536] = 0.88 × 0.5336 = **0.4695**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.14 (share) × 7.5 (dist) × [(0.40 / 1) + (0.45 / 2.8)]\n    *   = 1.05 × [0.40 + 0.1607] = 1.05 × 0.5607 = **0.5888**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.16 (share) × 20 (dist) × [(0.42 / 1) + (0.47 / 2.8)]\n    *   = 3.2 × [0.42 + 0.1679] = 3.2 × 0.5879 = **1.8811**\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index:**\nVMT_baseline = 0.168 + 0.4695 + 0.5888 + 1.8811 = **3.1074**\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n**Proposed Data (Table 2):**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy = 3.0\n\n**Calculation by Distance Category:**\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.48 (share) × 1 (dist) × [(0.01 / 1) + (0.02 / 3.0)]\n    *   = 0.48 × [0.01 + 0.0067] = 0.48 × 0.0167 = **0.0080**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.22 (share) × 4 (dist) × [(0.08 / 1) + (0.19 / 3.0)]\n    *   = 0.88 × [0.08 + 0.0633] = 0.88 × 0.1433 = **0.1261**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.14 (share) × 7.5 (dist) × [(0.14 / 1) + (0.27 / 3.0)]\n    *   = 1.05 × [0.14 + 0.09] = 1.05 × 0.23 = **0.2415**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Contribution = 0.16 (share) × 20 (dist) × [(0.16 / 1) + (0.33 / 3.0)]\n    *   = 3.2 × [0.16 + 0.11] = 3.2 × 0.27 = **0.8640**\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index:**\nVMT_proposed = 0.0080 + 0.1261 + 0.2415 + 0.8640 = **1.2396**\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   VMT Reduction = VMT_baseline - VMT_proposed\n    *   = 3.1074 - 1.2396 = **1.8678**\n*   Percentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / VMT_baseline) × 100%\n    *   = (1.8678 / 3.1074) × 100%\n    *   = 0.601075... × 100%\n    *   ≈ **60.1%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
