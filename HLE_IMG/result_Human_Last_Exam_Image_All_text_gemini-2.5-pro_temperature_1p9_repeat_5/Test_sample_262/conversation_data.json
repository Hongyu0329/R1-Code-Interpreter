    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context of the question.**\nThe question asks about the \"lifetimes\" of four Iridium(III) complexes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). In this context, \"lifetime\" refers to the operational stability of the emitter molecule. A shorter lifetime implies that the complex is less stable and degrades more quickly under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. We need to identify the complexes that are most prone to degradation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.**\nAll four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+` and a hexafluorophosphate (`PF6-`) counter-ion.\n*   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III), a `d6` metal ion common for phosphorescent emitters due to strong spin-orbit coupling.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** This is the bidentate diimine ligand. In all four complexes, it is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is identical in all four complexes, it will not be the differentiating factor for their relative stability. The bulky `tert`-butyl groups are known to enhance solubility and provide some steric protection to the complex, which generally increases stability.\n*   **C^N Ligands:** These are the bidentate, monoanionic cyclometalating ligands. They consist of a phenyl ring and a pyridine ring. The differences between the four complexes lie in the substituents on the phenyl part of these ligands. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the strength of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the cyclometalated Ir-C bond.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the key structural feature affecting stability and lifetime.**\nA primary degradation pathway for such Ir(III) complexes is the dissociation of a ligand, which often starts with the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, as it is typically the kinetically most labile bond in the coordination sphere. The strength of this Ir-C bond is therefore a critical factor for the overall stability and operational lifetime of the emitter.\n\nA well-established strategy to increase the stability of these complexes is to introduce electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand. Fluorine (F) is a very strong EWG due to its high electronegativity. Adding fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring makes the carbon atom that binds to Iridium more electrophilic, which strengthens the covalent character and the overall strength of the Ir-C bond. Consequently, complexes with more fluorination on the C^N ligands are generally more stable and exhibit longer lifetimes.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the C^N ligands in the four complexes.**\nLet's analyze the fluorination pattern of the C^N ligands in each complex:\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has **no fluorine substituents**. This serves as the baseline, un-stabilized complex in the series.\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one fluorine atom** at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring. This single fluorine atom will strengthen the Ir-C bond compared to Complex 2.\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two fluorine atoms** at the ortho- and para-positions. Both positions are electronically effective at withdrawing electron density. This ligand should provide significantly more stability than the ligands in Complexes 2 and 3.\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2',5'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two fluorine atoms** at the ortho- and meta-positions. Having two fluorine atoms should also lead to a highly stable complex, more stable than those with one or zero fluorine atoms.\n\n**Step 5: Rank the complexes by expected lifetime.**\nBased on the principle that fluorination strengthens the Ir-C bond and increases stability, we can rank the complexes from shortest expected lifetime to longest expected lifetime:\n1.  **Complex 2:** No fluorination, weakest Ir-C bond, expected shortest lifetime.\n2.  **Complex 3:** Mono-fluorinated, more stable than Complex 2, but less stable than the di-fluorinated complexes.\n3.  **Complexes 1 and 4:** Di-fluorinated, strongest Ir-C bonds, expected longest lifetimes.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude and select the answer.**\nThe question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". According to our stability ranking, Complexes 2 and 3 are the least stable in the series.\n*   Complex 2 is the least stable overall.\n*   Complex 3 is more stable than 2 but less stable than 1 and 4.\nTherefore, relative to the highly stable complexes 1 and 4, both 2 and 3 can be considered to have shorter lifetimes.\n\nThe answer choice corresponding to the set {2, 3} is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
