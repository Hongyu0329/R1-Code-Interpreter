    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image provided is a black-and-white photograph of a circular relief sculpture (a tondo) set within an ornate, decorative frame. The scene depicted is religious in nature. We can observe a priest-like figure on the left, administering what appears to be a communion wafer to a kneeling figure. Other figures are also kneeling in prayer. The style of the figures, their drapery, and the composition are characteristic of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n**Step 2: Deciphering the Inscription**\nAt the bottom of the circular relief, there is a cartouche with an inscription. Examining it closely, particularly with the help of the cropped detail images, we can read the words: \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is a mix of Latin (\"Sacramenti\" - meaning \"of the sacrament\") and Old French/Italian (\"de l'autel\" - meaning \"of the altar\"). The inscription translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is another term for the Eucharist or Holy Communion, confirming the subject matter of the relief.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Style and Medium**\nThe artistic style, characterized by its calm grace, balanced composition, and refined figures, is typical of the Florentine Renaissance of the 15th century. The medium, a relief sculpture often made from glazed terracotta, along with this specific aesthetic, is a hallmark of the Della Robbia family workshop, a famous dynasty of artists in Florence. The ornate frame with fruit and foliage motifs further supports this attribution.\n\n**Step 4: Research and Attribution**\nUsing the key clues— \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" \"Della Robbia,\" \"relief,\" and the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\"—we can search for the specific artwork. This search leads to the identification of the **Izzalini Altarpiece**. This large, glazed terracotta altarpiece is located in the Church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Izzalini, a village near Todi in Umbria, Italy. The relief in the photo is the central roundel of the altarpiece's predella (the base section). Art historical sources consistently attribute this significant work to the Florentine sculptor **Andrea della Robbia** (1435–1525), the nephew of the famous Luca della Robbia.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe artwork is a detail, specifically the predella roundel depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" from the Izzalini Altarpiece. The creator of this masterpiece of glazed terracotta sculpture is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
