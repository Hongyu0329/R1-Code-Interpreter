    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The sheet music has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n    *   **Chord Analysis:** The piece begins and ends on F chords (F- or F major implied at the very end). The tonic chord throughout the A section is F minor (F-). This confirms the key is **F minor**.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The music is in 4/4 common time.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the A-section (First 8 Bars):**\n    *   **Chord Progression:** Let's list the chords for the first eight bars:\n        *   Bar 1: F-\n        *   Bar 2: E-7♭5 (written as Eøb5)\n        *   Bar 3: E♭-6\n        *   Bar 4: D♭maj7\n        *   Bar 5: G7\n        *   Bar 6: C7\n        *   Bar 7: F-\n        *   Bar 8: C7 (in both endings)\n    *   **Melody:** Let's analyze the melodic contour over these chords. The pitches are written relative to the treble clef (E-G-B-D-F on the lines, F-A-C-E in the spaces).\n        *   Over F-, the melody plays F (root) and C (fifth).\n        *   Over E-7♭5, the melody plays E (root) and B♭ (flat fifth).\n        *   Over E♭-6, the melody plays E♭ (root) and B♭ (fifth).\n        *   Over D♭maj7, the melody plays D♭ (root) and A♭ (fifth).\n    *   **Pattern Recognition:** The first four bars present a very distinct and memorable pattern: the harmony descends chromatically (`F- -> Eø7 -> Eb-6 -> Dbmaj7`), and the melody follows a \"root-fifth\" pattern on each chord. This specific harmonic and melodic sequence is the primary signature of a well-known jazz standard.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Tune:**\n    *   This characteristic descending line is the hallmark of the composition **\"Minority\"**.\n    *   \"Minority\" is typically played in G minor, but the provided sheet music is in F minor, a whole step lower. Let's compare the transposed changes from \"Minority\" to the sheet music.\n        *   \"Minority\" in G minor: | Gm | F♯ø7 | Fm6 | E♭maj7 | Am7♭5 | D7 | Gm | D7 |\n        *   Transposing to F minor: | Fm | Eø7 | E♭m6 | D♭maj7 | Gm7♭5 | C7 | Fm | C7 |\n    *   The first four bars are an exact match. The following bars (`G7 | C7`) in the sheet music are a slight variation of the standard changes (`Gm7b5 | C7`). Using a G7 (V7 of C) instead of a Gm7b5 (iiø7 of F minor) is a very common reharmonization (a secondary dominant). Therefore, the A-section is functionally and melodically identical to \"Minority\".\n\n4.  **Identification of the Composer:**\n    *   The composer of the jazz standard \"Minority\" is the saxophonist and arranger **Gigi Gryce**. It was first recorded in 1953 by Clifford Brown.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the unmistakable harmonic progression and melodic contour of the A-section, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Minority\".\n    *   The composer is Gigi Gryce.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The handwriting on the lead sheet is not perfectly clear, but the essential notes and chords are legible.\n*   The key is F minor, a common but not the most frequent key for this tune, which requires transposition for comparison with standard versions.\n*   The chord in bar 5 (G7) is a common substitution for Gm7♭5 in a ii-V-i progression in minor, which shouldn't prevent identification.\n*   The B-section (the middle part of the song starting at bar 13) in this particular lead sheet appears to use a different set of chord changes than the \"standard\" version of \"Minority\". This is common in \"fake books\", which can contain errors or alternative arrangements. However, the A-section is so iconic that it is sufficient for a definitive identification.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe title of the jazz standard is \"Minority\" and the composer is Gigi Gryce.\n\n<<<\"Minority\" by Gigi Gryce>>>"
