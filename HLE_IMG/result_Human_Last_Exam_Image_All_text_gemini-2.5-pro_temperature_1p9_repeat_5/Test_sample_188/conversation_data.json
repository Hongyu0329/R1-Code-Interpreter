    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph G**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the connections in the figure, we can list the edges:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}. Edges: (1,2), (1,5).\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}. Edges: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4).\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}. Edges: (3,2), (3,4), (3,5).\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}. Edges: (4,2), (4,3), (4,5).\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}. Edges: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\nThe complete set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is |E| = 7.\n\nThe graph has an interesting structure. Let's consider the subgraph H formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges within this subgraph are {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. A complete graph on these 4 vertices (K4) would have 6 edges. The missing edge is (2,5). So, H is a K4 with one edge removed, denoted as K4-e.\nThe entire graph G consists of this subgraph H, with vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5 of H.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computation**\n\nWe can use the method of **Deletion-Contraction** or **direct counting with casework**. Both will be used here to ensure the result is correct.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Counting by partitioning the graph**\n\nWe can compute the chromatic polynomial by considering the coloring of subgraph H first, and then coloring the remaining vertex 1. The number of ways to color vertex 1 depends on the colors of its neighbors, 2 and 5. So we need to separate the colorings of H into two cases: one where c(2) = c(5) and one where c(2) ≠ c(5).\n\n*   **Subproblem: Find the chromatic polynomial of H = K4 - e, where e=(2,5).**\n    We use Deletion-Contraction on H. Let's choose an edge in H, say (3,4).\n    P(H, k) = P(H - (3,4), k) - P(H · (3,4), k).\n    1.  **H - (3,4):** Deleting edge (3,4) from H leaves the edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. These form a 4-cycle: 2-3-5-4-2.\n        The chromatic polynomial of a cycle Cn is P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1).\n        So, P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1) = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 4k + 1 + k - 1 = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k = k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3).\n    2.  **H · (3,4):** Contracting edge (3,4) merges vertices 3 and 4 into a single vertex '34'. The new graph has vertices {2, 5, '34'}. Vertex 2 was connected to 3 and 4, so it's now connected to '34'. Vertex 5 was connected to 3 and 4, so it's also connected to '34'. There is no edge between 2 and 5 in H. So the resulting graph is a path of length 2 (2--'34'--5).\n        The chromatic polynomial of a path P3 is P(P3, k) = k(k-1)^2.\n    3.  Therefore, P(H, k) = P(C4, k) - P(P3, k) = k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3) - k(k-1)^2\n        P(H, k) = k(k-1) * [(k^2 - 3k + 3) - (k-1)]\n        P(H, k) = k(k-1) * (k^2 - 4k + 4) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\n*   **Main Problem: Find P(G, k)**\n    Let N_eq be the number of ways to color H such that c(2) = c(5).\n    Let N_neq be the number of ways to color H such that c(2) ≠ c(5).\n    The chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = N_eq * (k-1) + N_neq * (k-2).\n\n    1.  **Calculate N_eq:** We want to count the colorings of H where c(2)=c(5).\n        *   Choose a color for both 2 and 5: k choices.\n        *   Vertex 3 is adjacent to 2, so it needs a different color: k-1 choices.\n        *   Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. Since c(2)=c(5) and c(2)≠c(3), vertex 4 has two distinct neighbors. So, it has k-2 choices.\n        *   N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2).\n    2.  **Calculate N_neq:** We know N_eq + N_neq = P(H, k).\n        *   N_neq = P(H, k) - N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)\n        *   N_neq = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    3.  **Combine to find P(G, k):**\n        *   P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\n        *   Factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n        *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]\n        *   Simplify the term in the brackets: (k-1) + (k^2 - 5k + 6) = k^2 - 4k + 5.\n        *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n\n**Method 2: Deletion-Contraction on the entire graph G**\n\nLet's apply deletion-contraction on an edge involving vertex 1, for example, e = (1,2).\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k).\n\n1.  **G - e = G - (1,2):** In this graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. The rest of the graph is the subgraph H = K4 - e(2,5). The number of ways to color G - e is the number of ways to color H, multiplied by the number of choices for vertex 1. Vertex 1 must have a color different from vertex 5, so there are (k-1) choices for it.\n    P(G-e, k) = P(H, k) * (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)^2] * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2.\n2.  **G · e = G · (1,2):** Contract the edge (1,2) into a new vertex '12'. This new graph has 4 vertices: {'12', 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The vertex '12' is connected to any vertex that was connected to 1 or 2.\n        *   1 was connected to 5.\n        *   2 was connected to 3 and 4.\n        *   So '12' is connected to {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The original edges between {3, 4, 5} are still present: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). These form a triangle (K3).\n    *   Thus, the contracted graph G · e is a complete graph K4 on vertices {'12', 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K4 is P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n3.  **Combine to find P(G, k):**\n    *   P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G·e, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    *   Factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n    *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3)]\n    *   Simplify the term in brackets: (k^2 - 3k + 2) - (k - 3) = k^2 - 4k + 5.\n    *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n\nWe can also expand this polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n= k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k\n= k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k.\n\nThe factored form is generally more informative.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   The degree of the polynomial is 5 (the number of vertices).\n*   The leading coefficient is 1.\n*   The coefficient of k^4 is -7, which equals -|E|.\n*   The constant term is 0 as the graph is connected.\n*   The roots are k=0, 1, 2. The quadratic factor k^2-4k+5 = (k-2)^2+1 has no real roots. Thus, the chromatic number is 3 (the smallest integer k > 0 for which P(G,k) > 0). This is consistent with the graph containing triangles (e.g., {2,3,4}).\n\nThe result is consistent and verified by multiple methods.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)>>>"
