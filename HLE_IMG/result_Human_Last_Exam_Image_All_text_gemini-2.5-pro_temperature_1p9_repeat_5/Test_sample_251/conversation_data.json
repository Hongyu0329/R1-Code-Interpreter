    "*   **Step 1: Determine the ECG paper calibration.**\n    The calibration is provided at the top left of the ECG strip: \"25 mm/sec\". This means the paper moves at a speed of 25 millimeters every second.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the time representation on the grid.**\n    The ECG paper is marked with a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   One small square is 1 mm wide. Time = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   One large square consists of 5 small squares, so it is 5 mm wide. Time = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the R-waves and R-R intervals.**\n    The R-wave is the large, sharp, upward spike of the QRS complex, representing ventricular depolarization. The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n*   **Step 4: Scan the entire rhythm strip to find the longest R-R interval.**\n    By visually inspecting all the leads on the ECG, we look for the greatest distance between two consecutive R-waves. The rhythm is mostly regular, but there is a clear, long pause in the fourth row of tracings (the strip that begins near the timestamp `0:06:08`). This pause is visibly much longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n*   **Step 5: Measure the longest R-R interval using the grid.**\n    We will measure the distance between the R-wave preceding the pause and the R-wave ending the pause.\n    *   The R-wave at the beginning of the pause is conveniently located on a heavy vertical grid line.\n    *   The R-wave at the end of the pause is also located on a heavy vertical grid line.\n    *   Counting the number of large squares between these two R-wave peaks, we find there are exactly 7 large squares.\n\n*   **Step 6: Convert the measured distance into time (seconds).**\n    Since one large square represents 0.2 seconds, we can calculate the duration of the longest R-R interval.\n    *   Longest R-R interval = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 7 × 0.2 seconds\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 1.4 seconds.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Always confirm the paper speed (25 mm/sec is standard, but 50 mm/sec is sometimes used).\n    *   Identify the R-wave peak accurately for measurement. Using the grid lines as a reference improves precision.\n    *   Scan the entire strip, as arrhythmias like pauses or blocks can be intermittent. In this case, the pause is the most obvious feature leading to the longest R-R interval.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
