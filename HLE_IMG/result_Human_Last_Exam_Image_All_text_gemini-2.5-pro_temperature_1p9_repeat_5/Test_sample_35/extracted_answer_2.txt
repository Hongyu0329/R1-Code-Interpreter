The protein S100B shows a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor, as depicted in the diagram where S100B directly interacts with this outermost domain.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. Here's the explanation: The diagram illustrates that S100B initiates a signaling pathway that leads directly to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, which are the key factors determining the severity and progression of neurological disorders. As the text mentions S100B is "over-expressed" in these conditions, its concentration level would directly correlate with the intensity of this pathological damage. Therefore, measuring S100B levels can provide crucial information about the future course and outcome of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. It is not *solely* an adjunct marker because its role goes beyond simply aiding in diagnosis; it has predictive power regarding the disease's trajectory.
