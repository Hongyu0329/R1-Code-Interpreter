    "**Step-by-step analysis of the algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The provided code defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n` is less than or equal to 1, as an array with 0 or 1 element is already considered sorted. This is handled by the `if n > 1:` condition.\n    -   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the algorithm performs three main actions:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(...)`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the now-largest element of the sorted part (`a[n-2]`). If the `n`-th element is smaller, it swaps them. This is similar to a single step of Bubble Sort, moving an out-of-place element one position towards its correct location.\n        3.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: If the swap occurred, the order of the first `n-1` elements might be disturbed. The algorithm makes a second recursive call to sort the `n-1` elements again to correct the order.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function.\n    -   The work done outside the recursive calls is constant: one comparison and a potential swap, which we can denote as `O(1)`.\n    -   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens and contributes `T(n-1)` to the complexity.\n    -   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` only happens if the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true.\n    -   To find the **worst-case** time complexity, we must assume the scenario where the second recursive call is made as frequently as possible. This means we assume the `if` condition is true at every level of the recursion.\n\n    Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Solving the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`. Let's expand this relation:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   Continuing this pattern for `k` steps:\n        `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    We can substitute `k = n - 1` to reach the base case `T(1)`:\n    `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-2} + ... + 1)`\n\n    The sum is a geometric series `Î£_{i=0}^{n-2} 2^i = (2^{n-1} - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^{n-1} - 1`.\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * c' + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n    `T(n) = c' * 2^{n-1} + c * 2^{n-1} - c`\n    `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^{n-1} - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^{n-1}`. In Big O notation, this is `O(2^n)`.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition is consistently true. This happens when we are sorting an array that is in reverse order (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`). In this case, at each step `n`, the element `a[n-1]` (the smallest remaining element) is compared with `a[n-2]` (the largest element in the sorted prefix) and will always be smaller, triggering the swap and the second expensive recursive call.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe recurrence relation `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` describes the worst-case behavior of the algorithm. Solving this recurrence leads to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^n)`. The algorithm is highly inefficient because it re-solves the entire subproblem from scratch after a single swap, leading to an exponential number of function calls.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n---\n**List of careful points:**\n\n-   **Identify the recursive structure:** The function calls itself, reducing the problem size from `n` to `n-1`.\n-   **Note the two recursive calls:** Crucially, there are two potential recursive calls to `sort(a, n - 1)` within the `if n > 1` block.\n-   **Analyze the condition for the second call:** The second call `sort(a, n-1)` is conditional. To determine the worst-case complexity, we must assume this condition is met at every step.\n-   **Formulate the recurrence relation correctly:** The worst-case relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`, not `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`.\n-   **Recognize the type of growth:** The recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1)` leads to exponential growth, similar to a naive Fibonacci implementation, but growing even faster.\n-   **Solve the recurrence:** The expansion method shows the complexity is dominated by `2^n`.\n-   **Check for termination:** The problem size `n` decreases with each call, ensuring the base case `n <= 1` is eventually reached, so the algorithm terminates.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe algorithm's worst-case time complexity is defined by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)`. This is because in the worst-case scenario (like a reverse-sorted array), the `if` condition is always true, triggering two recursive calls for a subproblem of size `n-1`. This recurrence relation resolves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
