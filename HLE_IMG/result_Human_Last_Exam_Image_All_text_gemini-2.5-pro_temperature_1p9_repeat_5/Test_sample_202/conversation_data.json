    "Here is a step-by-step analysis and identification of each rock specimen:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy texture with many small holes (vesicles). It appears relatively lightweight.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that this is a volcanic (extrusive igneous) rock. Gas was trapped in the lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. This type of dark-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock is known as **scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like H, is extremely porous with many vesicles. The structure appears glassy and frothy.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is also a volcanic (extrusive igneous) rock that cooled rapidly from a gas-rich, frothy lava. Its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. A lightweight, light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock is identified as **pumice**. Pumice is often so low in density that it can float on water.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of many smaller, angular fragments (clasts) of different rocks and minerals cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. We can see clasts that are reddish, gray, and white.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A rock made of cemented fragments is a clastic rock. Because the fragments are angular rather than rounded, it is classified as a **breccia**. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. Breccias can be either sedimentary (formed from rockslides) or volcanic (formed from explosive eruptions).\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. We can see large, light-colored (pinkish to white) crystals, which are likely feldspar, and darker minerals. The texture is very coarse-grained (phaneritic).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The large crystal size indicates that this is an intrusive igneous rock, which cooled very slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (typically over 1 cm) is known as a **pegmatite**. This specimen appears to be a granite pegmatite due to the likely presence of feldspar and other granitic minerals.\n\n**Final Identification:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
