    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the image:** The image provided is a cuneiform sign. Cuneiform is one of the earliest systems of writing, developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia.\n2.  **Analyze the form of the sign:** The sign has a clear pictographic origin. It visually resembles a structure with a rectangular base and a triangular or gabled roof. The base contains nested lines, which might represent the reed bundles or mud bricks used in construction. The overall shape strongly suggests a building or dwelling.\n3.  **Consider the historical context:** The question specifies the \"third-millennium form\". During the third millennium BC (c. 3000-2001 BC), cuneiform evolved from more pictographic forms (like the one shown, typical of the Early Dynastic period) to more abstract and simplified wedge-based forms. The sign in the image is a classic example of an archaic cuneiform sign that clearly shows what it represents.\n4.  **Identify the specific cuneiform sign:** This sign is well-known to Assyriologists. It is the sign **Ã‰** (pronounced /eâ‚‚/).\n5.  **Determine the meaning of the sign:** The Sumerian word *Ã©* means \"house\" or \"temple\". Since a temple was considered the house of a deity, the sign represents both concepts. By extension, it could also mean \"household\" or \"estate\".\n6.  **Evaluate the given answer choices:**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Signs for tools, like the plow (APIN) or pickaxe (AL), have distinctly different pictographic origins and shapes.\n    *   **B. Guard:** There isn't a single pictograph for \"guard\" in this manner. The concept would typically be written differently, often involving the determinative for a person (LÃš).\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA) looks like a bowl or a round loaf, completely different from the image.\n    *   **D. Home:** This is a synonym for \"house\", which is the primary meaning of the sign Ã‰. The pictographic representation of a dwelling directly supports this meaning.\n    *   **E. Deity:** The sign for deity or god (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­). It does not resemble the sign in the image.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for beard (SUâ‚†) is part of a depiction of a human head and looks very different.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the pictographic evidence and established knowledge of Sumerian cuneiform, the sign shown is Ã‰, which means \"house\" or \"temple\". Among the given choices, \"Home\" is the correct meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
