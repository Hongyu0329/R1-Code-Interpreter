    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure:**\n    An FCC lattice is a cubic structure with atoms positioned at each of the 8 corners of the cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. A conventional unit cell contains a total of 4 atoms (8 corners × 1/8 atom/corner + 6 faces × 1/2 atom/face = 4 atoms).\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    The direction [110] in a cubic system corresponds to a vector along the diagonal of a face of the cube. We are looking at the crystal structure as projected onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] direction. This plane is the (110) crystallographic plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    When the FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D pattern. This pattern can be analyzed by considering the positions of atoms relative to the (110) planes.\n    *   The basis vectors of the 2D projected lattice are along the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction.\n    *   Let the lattice constant of the cubic cell be 'a'. The length of the repeating unit along the [001] direction is `a`. The length of the repeating unit along the [1-10] direction is the distance between equivalent points, which turns out to be `a√2`.\n    *   The resulting 2D unit cell is a rectangle with side lengths in the ratio `a : a√2`, which simplifies to `1 : √2` (approximately 1 : 1.414).\n    *   Within this rectangular unit cell, there are atoms at the corners and one atom precisely in the center. This pattern is known as a **centered rectangle**. The atoms at the corners and the atom at the center belong to different atomic planes stacked along the [110] viewing direction, which means they are at different depths, but they project onto these positions.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Images:**\n    We need to examine each image (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. The images show atoms within a 3D box, and we need to consider their projection onto the front face.\n\n    *   **Image A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are two columns of atoms, forming a basic rectangular pattern. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles formed by the grid points. This pattern is not a centered rectangle.\n\n    *   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms is complex and does not form a recognizable simple or centered rectangular pattern. The positions seem irregular relative to a rectangular grid.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern shows two interlocking simple rectangular grids that are shifted relative to each other. If you take one set of four atoms, they form a rectangle, and another set of four atoms forms another rectangle. The second rectangle is shifted relative to the first one, but not to its center. This is not a centered rectangular pattern. (This pattern is characteristic of a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure viewed along the c-axis, [0001]).\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image displays a pattern where some atoms form the vertices of a quadrilateral, and there is at least one atom located near the center of this quadrilateral. Let's analyze it more closely. The four corner-like atoms `(3,3), (1, 5.5), (7, 6.5), (5,9)` form a parallelogram. The center of this parallelogram is at `( (3+1+7+5)/4, (3+5.5+6.5+9)/4 ) = (4, 6)`. We can observe several atoms near this central point, such as the ones at `(4, 4.5)` and `(5.5, 6)`. This arrangement, despite perspective distortion and potential reading inaccuracies, is topologically consistent with a centered rectangle. Among the four options, it is the only one that exhibits the characteristic feature of a centered pattern.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the theoretical pattern of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction being a centered rectangle, Image B is the only option that displays this characteristic arrangement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
