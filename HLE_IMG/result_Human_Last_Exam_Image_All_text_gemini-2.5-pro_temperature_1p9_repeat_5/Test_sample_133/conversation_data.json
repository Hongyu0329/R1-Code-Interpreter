    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak and Isotope Pattern**\n\n1.  **Identify the highest mass cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are likely to represent the molecular ion and its isotopic variants. We observe a significant cluster of peaks around m/z 260-266. Specifically, the table shows prominent peaks at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), and 264 (I=12.9%).\n2.  **Determine the presence of halogens:** The presence of multiple peaks in the molecular ion region, separated by 2 amu, is characteristic of elements with common heavy isotopes, like Chlorine (³⁵Cl/~75.8%, ³⁷Cl/~24.2%, ratio ~3:1) or Bromine (⁷⁹Br/~50.7%, ⁸¹Br/~49.3%, ratio ~1:1).\n3.  **Test the Chlorine hypothesis:**\n    *   **Four Cl atoms:** Would give M, M+2, M+4, M+6 peaks with theoretical intensity ratio ~1 : 1.28 : 0.61 : 0.13. If M⁺ is at m/z 260, the observed ratio is 1 : 0.83 : 0.37, which is a poor match.\n    *   **Two Cl atoms:** Would give M, M+2, M+4 peaks with theoretical ratio ~1 : 0.65 : 0.11. Let's assume the molecular ion M⁺ is at m/z 262. The observed peaks are at m/z 262, 264, 266 with intensities 29.0, 12.9, 3.22. The ratio is approximately 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22, which normalized is 1 : 0.45 : 0.11. This is a reasonable, although not perfect, match for a molecule containing two chlorine atoms. Therefore, we hypothesize that the molecular weight is 262 amu and the molecule contains two Cl atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n2.  **Relate major fragments to the molecular ion:** Let's analyze the major fragments assuming M⁺ is at m/z 262.\n3.  **Analyze the fragment at m/z 227:** There is a very intense peak at m/z 227 (I=66.7%). The mass difference from the proposed molecular ion is 262 - 227 = 35 amu. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This is a very common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds. This fragment is [M-Cl]⁺.\n4.  **Confirm the composition of the m/z 227 fragment:** A fragment containing one chlorine atom should have an isotope peak at [M+2] with about 1/3 of its intensity. We check the peak at m/z 229. The table shows I(227) = 66.7% and I(229) = 22.2%. The ratio 66.7 / 22.2 is approximately 3.0, which perfectly confirms that the fragment at m/z 227 contains exactly one chlorine atom.\n5.  **Explain the base peak at m/z 225:** The base peak at m/z 225 is 2 amu less than the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment at m/z 227. This suggests a further loss of a hydrogen molecule (H₂) from the [M-Cl]⁺ ion. The reaction is [M-Cl]⁺ → [M-Cl-H₂]⁺ + H₂. The loss of H₂ is a common process in polycyclic aromatic ions, as it leads to a more conjugated and stable cation. This explains why m/z 225 is the most abundant ion (the base peak).\n6.  **Analyze the fragment at m/z 190:** This peak has an intensity of 48.4%. Let's see how it could be formed. Starting from the base peak ion at m/z 225 ([M-Cl-H₂]⁺), a loss of the second chlorine atom (mass 35) would result in a fragment at 225 - 35 = 190. This suggests the peak at m/z 190 is the [M-2Cl-H₂]⁺ ion.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\n1.  **From M=262 and 2 Cl atoms:** The non-halogen part of the molecule has a nominal mass of 262 - (2 × 35) = 192 amu.\n2.  **Determine the formula for mass 192:** Since the molecule exhibits behavior of a polycyclic aromatic compound (stable fragments, loss of H₂), we look for a formula CₓHᵧO₂ with high degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **C₁₅H₁₂** has a mass of 15×12 + 12 = 192. DoU = 9. Possible.\n    *   **C₁₄H₈O** has a mass of 14×12 + 8 + 16 = 168 + 8 + 16 = 192. DoU = 14 - 8/2 + 1 = 11. This is also very plausible.\n3.  **Distinguish between possibilities using the m/z 190 fragment:** We identified the fragment at m/z 190 as [M-2Cl-H₂]⁺•.\n    *   If the formula is C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂, this fragment would be [C₁₅H₁₀]⁺•, which has a mass of 15×12 + 10 = 190. This fits.\n    *   If the formula is C₁₄H₈OCl₂, this fragment would be [C₁₄H₆O]⁺•, which has a mass of 14×12 + 6 + 16 = 168 + 6 + 16 = 190. This also fits.\n4.  **Identify a likely parent structure:** C₁₄H₁₀O is the formula for stable aromatic ketones like anthracen-9(10H)-one (also known as anthrone) and its isomers. A dichloro-derivative of this would have the formula C₁₄H₈OCl₂ and fit all the evidence perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has a molecular weight of 262 amu and the formula is C₁₄H₈OCl₂. The fragmentation pattern is consistent with a dichloroanthracenone structure. Since the exact positions of the chlorine atoms cannot be determined from the mass spectrum alone, a general but correct IUPAC name for this class of compounds is required. A representative systematic name can be formulated.\n\nThe compound is a dichloro-derivative of anthracen-9(10H)-one. A possible systematic IUPAC name is **1,4-dichloroanthracen-9(10H)-one**. Other isomers (e.g., 2,7-dichloroanthracen-9(10H)-one) would give very similar spectra.\n\n<<<1,4-dichloroanthracen-9(10H)-one>>>"
