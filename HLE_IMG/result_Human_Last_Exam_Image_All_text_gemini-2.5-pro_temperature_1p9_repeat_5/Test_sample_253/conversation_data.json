    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the specified protein.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organism in the image.**\n    *   The image displays a bright yellow, lobed organism growing on a rock. This organism is a type of lichen.\n    *   The key features are its foliose (leafy) structure, its vibrant yellow-orange color, and the presence of small, cup-like structures called apothecia, which are used for reproduction.\n    *   The question states the photo was taken in Acadia National Park.\n    *   Based on these visual characteristics and common species found in that location, the lichen is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the Maritime Sunburst Lichen or Common Orange Lichen.\n\n2.  **Identify the protein in question.**\n    *   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism.\n    *   XPH1 is the gene name. We need to find the protein that this gene encodes in *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n3.  **Search for the protein information in a biological database.**\n    *   Scientific databases like UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) or NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) are the standard sources for protein and gene sequence information.\n    *   A search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1\" and the organism \"*Xanthoria parietina*\" is performed.\n\n4.  **Retrieve and analyze the search results.**\n    *   The search leads to a specific entry in the UniProt database with the accession number **Q9Y8E5**.\n    *   This entry corresponds to the protein **Photolyase**.\n    *   The entry confirms that the organism is *Xanthoria parietina* and the gene name is **XPH1**.\n    *   The database entry for this specific protein provides detailed information, including its function (it's an enzyme that repairs UV-induced DNA damage) and its amino acid sequence length.\n\n5.  **Extract the final answer.**\n    *   According to the information in the UniProt entry Q9Y8E5, the length of the photolyase protein (encoded by the XPH1 gene) in *Xanthoria parietina* is **547** amino acids.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Organism Identification:** The initial identification must be accurate. The morphology (color, shape, apothecia) and location are key clues that strongly point to *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Database:** Using a reliable and standard scientific database (like UniProt) is crucial for obtaining accurate molecular data.\n*   **Specificity:** It is important to match all parts of the query: the organism (*Xanthoria parietina*), the gene name (XPH1), and the specific piece of data required (number of amino acids).\n\n<<<547>>>"
