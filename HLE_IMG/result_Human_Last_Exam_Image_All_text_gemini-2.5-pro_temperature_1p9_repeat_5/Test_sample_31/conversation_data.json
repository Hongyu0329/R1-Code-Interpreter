    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Knot\n1.  **Examine the knot diagram:** The first step is to identify the knot shown in the picture. We can do this by counting its crossings and observing its structure.\n2.  **Count the crossings:** Let's systematically count the number of crossings in the diagram.\n    *   There is a small twisted loop at the top, which contributes two crossings.\n    *   There is a central \"spine\" with three more crossings along it.\n    *   There is one crossing on the left loop.\n    *   There is one crossing on the right loop.\n    *   There is one crossing at the very bottom.\n    Totaling these up: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 crossings.\n3.  **Check for properties:** Let's trace a path along the knot. If we start anywhere and follow the strand, we go over a crossing, then under the next, then over, then under, and so on. This pattern of over-under-over-under... means the knot diagram is **alternating**.\n4.  **Identify from knot tables:** A knot with 8 crossings is denoted as 8_n for some index n. By comparing the given diagram to standard knot tables (like those found in Rolfsen's \"Knots and Links\", the Knot Atlas, or KnotInfo websites), we can identify this specific diagram as that of the knot **8_18**. The overall shape, with a central twisted core and looping sides, is characteristic of the 8_18 knot.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant for Alternating Knots\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted s(K), is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot K. It is derived from a specialized version of Khovanov homology called Lee homology.\n2.  **Key Property for Alternating Knots:** Calculating the Rasmussen invariant from its definition is computationally intensive. However, for the special class of alternating knots, there are much simpler formulas that relate s(K) to other well-known knot invariants. Two of the most useful relations for an alternating knot K are:\n    *   **s(K) = -σ(K)**, where σ(K) is the **signature** of the knot.\n    *   **s(K) = 2g_4(K)**, where g_4(K) is the **slice genus** (or 4-ball genus) of the knot.\n    These two formulas are consistent with each other, as for alternating knots, it's known that g_4(K) = -σ(K)/2. We can use either formula to find the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Necessary Invariants for the 8_18 Knot\nTo use the formulas from Step 2, we need to find either the signature or the slice genus of the 8_18 knot. These are standard invariants tabulated in knot theory resources.\n1.  **Look up the invariants:** Consulting a reliable knot theory database such as KnotInfo or the Knot Atlas for the knot 8_18, we find:\n    *   The signature: **σ(8_18) = -4**\n    *   The slice genus: **g_4(8_18) = 2**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant\nNow we can apply the formulas from Step 2 using the values from Step 3.\n*   **Method 1 (using the signature):**\n    s(8_18) = -σ(8_18) = -(-4) = 4\n\n*   **Method 2 (using the slice genus):**\n    s(8_18) = 2 * g_4(8_18) = 2 * 2 = 4\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Rasmussen invariant must be an even integer, and our result of 4 is consistent with this property.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe knot in the picture is the 8_18 knot. It is an alternating knot. Its signature is -4 and its slice genus is 2. Using the known properties of the Rasmussen invariant for alternating knots, its value is calculated to be 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
