    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Puzzle's Rules**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black cells are clues for the sum of the digits in the connected block of white cells (either to the right or below). A key rule in Kakuro is that within any single block, digits cannot be repeated. The question asks for the two numbers in the top-most horizontal block.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Target Cells and Relevant Clues**\nThe two top white squares form a horizontal block. Let's call them Cell A (left) and Cell B (right). These correspond to coordinates (1,3) and (1,4) in a grid system.\nWe need to determine the clue for the sum of this block (Cell A + Cell B). The diagram is stylized, so interpreting the clues is the main challenge.\nThere are three clues written along the top edge of the puzzle: 15, 17, and 29. The clue `17` is positioned most directly above the block containing Cell A and Cell B. The diagonal line from `17` appears to refer to this horizontal block.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Top Row Clue**\nLet's hypothesize that the clue `17` applies to the top horizontal block of two cells.\n*   Hypothesis: The sum of the numbers in the two top white squares is 17.\n*   Equation: `Cell A + Cell B = 17`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Consequences of the Hypothesis**\nWe need to find two different digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} that add up to 17.\nLet's list the possibilities:\n*   The highest possible digit is 9. If one number is 9, the other must be `17 - 9 = 8`.\n*   The next highest digit is 8. If one number is 8, the other must be `17 - 8 = 9`.\n*   If we try a smaller digit, like 7, the other would have to be `17 - 7 = 10`, which is not a valid digit.\nTherefore, the only possible pair of unique digits that sum to 17 is {8, 9}.\n\n**Step 5: Check for Contradictions with Other Clues (Sanity Check)**\nWhile solving the entire puzzle is not required, it's good practice to see if this hypothesis creates obvious problems. The diagram has many ambiguous or even seemingly impossible clues if read naively (e.g., a sum of 27 for two cells). A careful re-interpretation of the clue system is required to solve the whole puzzle, but the interpretation that `17` is the clue for the top two squares is visually the most direct and does not lead to an immediate mathematical impossibility. In fact, it's a very common sum for a 2-cell block in Kakuro puzzles.\nFor instance, if we assume the clue `15` applies to the first vertical block `(1,3) + (2,3) = 15`, and the numbers in the top are {8, 9}, this is still consistent:\n*   If Cell A is 8, then the cell below it, (2,3), would be `15 - 8 = 7`.\n*   If Cell A is 9, then the cell below it, (2,3), would be `15 - 9 = 6`.\nBoth scenarios are valid. Without fully solving the puzzle, the conclusion that the top two squares must contain the numbers 8 and 9 holds strong.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the most plausible reading of the diagram for the specified cells, the sum of the two top numbers is 17. The only combination of two unique digits (1-9) that adds up to 17 is 8 and 9. The order is not specified in the question, just the two numbers that are present.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9\n<<<8,9>>>"
