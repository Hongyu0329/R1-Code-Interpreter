    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem's Text:** First, we need to read all the words that form the poem. The words are collaged onto a page from an old book. Reading them in a logical order, typically from top to bottom and left to right, we get the following phrase:\n    \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n2.  **Count the Syllables:** Next, let's count the syllables in this phrase to analyze its meter.\n    *   `rules`: 1 syllable\n    *   `and`: 1 syllable\n    *   `lines,`: 1 syllable\n    *   `an`: 1 syllable\n    *   `in-tri-cate`: 3 syllables\n    *   `spi-der's`: 2 syllables\n    *   `web`: 1 syllable\n    *   `work`: 1 syllable\n    *   **Total syllables in the pasted text: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:** Now let's see how our syllable count fits the given metric patterns.\n    *   **A. free verse:** This means the poem has no regular meter or rhythm. Since the line structure is irregular and no obvious pattern exists in the 11-syllable phrase, this is a possibility.\n    *   **B. iambic pentameter:** This requires a line of 10 syllables with an unstressed-stressed pattern. Our count is 11, not 10, and the rhythm doesn't fit.\n    *   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our count is 11.\n    *   **D. sapphic:** This is a specific stanzaic form with lines of 11 and 5 syllables, which doesn't match this single phrase.\n    *   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This involves lines of roughly 6 syllables (3 iambic feet). The poem isn't structured this way.\n    *   **F. american sentence:** This is a specific poetic form created by Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence that is **exactly 17 syllables long**. Our count of 11 does not match.\n\n4.  **Re-examine the Image for More Information:** The syllable count of 11 doesn't match any of the specific forms except the general \"free verse.\" However, the inclusion of a very precise option like \"American Sentence\" suggests there might be more to the poem than just the pasted words. Erasure poems and altered book art often incorporate elements from the original source page. Let's look for other text on the page.\n    *   The title at the top: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n    *   The page number: \"35\"\n\n5.  **Recalculate Syllables with Additional Text:** Let's count the syllables of these elements and add them to our total.\n    *   \"THE FIRST STEP\": `the` (1) + `first` (1) + `step` (1) = **3 syllables**.\n    *   \"35\" (read aloud as \"thirty-five\"): `thir-ty` (2) + `five` (1) = **3 syllables**.\n    *   **New Total:** 11 (pasted words) + 3 (title) + 3 (page number) = **17 syllables**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The total number of syllables from all the prominent text on the page (title, page number, and pasted words) is exactly 17. This perfectly matches the definition of an **American Sentence**. Although the resulting phrase (\"The First Step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\") isn't a conventional sentence, poetic forms, especially experimental ones, often bend grammatical rules. The exact match of the syllable count is the strongest clue.\n\nTherefore, the words in the erasure poem follow the metric pattern of an American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
