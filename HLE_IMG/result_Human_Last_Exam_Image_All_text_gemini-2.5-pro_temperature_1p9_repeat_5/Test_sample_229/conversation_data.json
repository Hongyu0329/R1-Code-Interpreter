    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music's General Characteristics:** The provided image is a handwritten lead sheet. A lead sheet contains the essential elements of a song: the melody written in standard musical notation, and the harmony indicated by chord symbols (e.g., C, E7, F) written above the staff. This format is very common in jazz and related genres. The key signature has no sharps or flats, and the piece predominantly uses a C major chord as its tonal center, indicating the key is C major. The time signature is 4/4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Style:**\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression is characteristic of early jazz and swing music. The progression begins with `C | E7 | F | G7...`. The use of `E7` (the V7 of A minor) leading to `F` is a common harmonic device in this style, creating a distinctive sound. The overall progression is typical for a 32-bar form song structure found in jazz standards.\n    *   **Rhythm and Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated and uses many arpeggiated figures and chromatic passing tones. For instance, the melody often outlines the underlying chords (e.g., using notes of the C chord over the C chord symbol). This melodic approach, combined with a presumed swing rhythm (where eighth notes are played unevenly), strongly points towards a style of swing jazz. Specifically, the energetic, string-instrument-oriented melodic lines are hallmarks of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as *Jazz Manouche* or *Sinti Swing*).\n\n3.  **Identify the Song Title:** The melody is quite distinctive and well-known within the Gypsy Jazz repertoire. The opening phrase, with its characteristic ascending line over a C major chord followed by a move to an E7 chord, is the main theme of the song **\"Swing Gitan\"**. This piece was composed by the legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n\n4.  **Determine the Country of Origin:** The musical style, Gypsy Jazz, was developed in **France** during the 1930s. Its main progenitors were guitarist Django Reinhardt (a Belgian-born French-Romani musician) and violinist St√©phane Grappelli (a French musician). They famously led the \"Quintette du Hot Club de France.\" Therefore, the origin of both the genre and this specific song is France.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Title:** \"Swing Gitan\"\n    *   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\n    *   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<Title: Swing Gitan, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: France>>>"
