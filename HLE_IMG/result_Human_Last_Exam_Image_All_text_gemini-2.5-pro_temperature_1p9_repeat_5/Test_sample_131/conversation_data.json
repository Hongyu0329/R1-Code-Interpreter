    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Structure**\nFirst, we examine the molecular structure provided.\n*   The molecule is polycyclic, meaning it is composed of multiple fused rings.\n*   It contains nitrogen atoms within the ring systems, which classifies it as a heterocyclic compound.\n*   The presence of nitrogen, its complex structure, and its origin (implied by the term \"alkaloid\") suggest it is a natural product from a plant or other living organism.\n*   We can count four fused rings in total, making it a tetracyclic system.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Functional Groups**\n*   There are two nitrogen atoms, both of which are tertiary amines integrated into the ring system.\n*   There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is part of a six-membered ring and is adjacent to a nitrogen atom. This specific functional group is called a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Core Skeleton**\nThe tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a group of alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids. Specifically, this particular arrangement of four fused six-membered rings is known as the **matrine** skeleton.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Stereochemistry**\nThe use of wedge (bold) and dash (hashed) bonds indicates that the molecule has a specific three-dimensional arrangement (stereochemistry). There are several chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n*   Alkaloids with the matrine skeleton can exist as different stereoisomers, such as matrine, sophoridine, and allomatrine, which differ in the spatial orientation of the hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions.\n*   By comparing the given stereochemistry with known structures, we can identify the specific isomer. The stereochemical configuration shown in the image (e.g., the relative orientations at the ring fusions) precisely matches that of the most common natural isomer, which is **(-)-matrine**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Name**\nBased on the tetracyclic lactam structure derived from the matrine skeleton and the specific stereochemistry shown, the compound is correctly identified by its common name, **matrine**. It is a major alkaloid found in plants of the *Sophora* genus.\n\n<<<matrine>>>"
