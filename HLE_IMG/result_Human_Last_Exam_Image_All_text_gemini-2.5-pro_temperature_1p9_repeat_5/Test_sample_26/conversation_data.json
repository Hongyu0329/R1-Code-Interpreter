    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key and the Measure**\n*   The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13. The first movement is in the key of C minor.\n*   The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The movement is established in C minor.\n*   Measure 30 is the third measure of the second system on the page, which is clearly circled in the provided image.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in the Measure**\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on G (G2 and G3) on the first beat.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a repeating thirty-second note pattern.\n*   **Careful Point - Potential Score Error:** The score provided shows the right-hand notes as B-natural, D, F-sharp, and A-natural. This is a very unusual spelling for a dominant chord in C minor and is inconsistent with standard editions of the sonata (like Henle or Schenker). These reliable editions have the notes as B-natural, D, F-natural, and A-flat. The F# and A-natural in the provided image are likely a misprint. The analysis will proceed based on the notes found in standard, correct editions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Corrected Notes to Identify the Chord**\n*   Combining the notes from both hands (using the corrected version), we have:\n    *   **Root:** G (in the bass)\n    *   **Upper voices:** B-natural, D, F-natural, A-flat.\n*   Let's stack these notes in thirds above the root G:\n    *   G - B-natural (the major third, which is the leading tone to C)\n    *   G - D (the perfect fifth)\n    *   G - F-natural (the minor seventh)\n    *   G - A-flat (the minor ninth)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chord's Quality and Function**\n*   The notes G, B-natural, and D form a **G Major triad**. In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree, so this is the **dominant (V)** chord.\n*   Adding the F-natural creates a **G dominant seventh chord (G7)**. The Roman numeral for this is **V7**.\n*   Adding the A-flat creates a **G dominant seventh chord with a minor ninth (G7♭9)**. This chord has a very strong pull towards the tonic (C minor).\n*   **Alternative View:** The notes in the right hand (B-natural, D, F-natural, A-flat) spell out a B fully diminished seventh chord (B°7). This chord is the leading-tone seventh chord in C minor (vii°7). When the dominant root (G) is placed in the bass under the leading-tone seventh chord, the resulting sonority is a V9 chord (specifically V7♭9) with the root in the bass.\n\n**Step 5: Write the Final Roman Numeral**\n*   The chord is the dominant (V).\n*   It is a seventh chord with a minor ninth.\n*   The complete and most accurate Roman numeral is **V7♭9**. It is also commonly abbreviated as **V9** in the context of a minor key, where the minor ninth on the dominant is standard.\n\n<<<V9>>>"
