The products A and B are regioisomers formed from the vicinal difunctionalization of styrene.
Product A is 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate, formed from the initial addition of a tert-butoxyl radical to styrene.
Product B is 1-(tert-butoxy)-2-benzoyloxy-1-phenylethane, formed from the initial addition of a benzoyloxyl radical to styrene.

The structures are:
A: Phenyl-CH(O-C(=O)-Phenyl)-CH₂-O-C(CH₃)₃
B: Phenyl-CH(O-C(CH₃)₃)-CH₂-O-C(=O)-Phenyl
