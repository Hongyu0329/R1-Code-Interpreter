    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene, propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl), and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **Mechanism:** AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, commonly known as propiophenone.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:**\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C - CH₂ - CH₃\n     /\n    (Benzene Ring)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** 1-phenylpropan-1-one (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr₃).\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors for subsequent electrophilic substitution. The electrophile, Br⁺, generated from Br₂/FeBr₃, will therefore attack the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:**\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        C - CH₂ - CH₃\n       /\n      (Benzene Ring with Br at meta position)\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction reduces the ketone group. For aryl ketones, catalytic hydrogenation typically reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). The reaction proceeds via a benzylic alcohol intermediate which is then reduced further by hydrogenolysis. The C(aryl)-Br bond is less reactive under these conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone is reduced to an alkane, yielding 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:**\n    ```\n        CH₂ - CH₂ - CH₃\n       /\n      (Benzene Ring with Br at position 1, propyl at position 3)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂), in an inert solvent (CCl₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of allylic or benzylic positions. The reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. A hydrogen atom is abstracted from the position that forms the most stable radical. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the most stable radical is the benzylic radical, formed by abstracting a hydrogen from the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring (-**C**H₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   **Final Product:** A bromine atom replaces one of the benzylic hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:**\n    ```\n          Br\n          |\n        CH - CH₂ - CH₃\n       /\n      (Benzene Ring with Br at meta position)\n    ```\n*   **Name of the Final Product:** The parent alkane is propane. On carbon 1 of the propane chain, there is a bromo group and a (3-bromophenyl) group. The systematic IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
