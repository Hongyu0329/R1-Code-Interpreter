    "The user wants me to identify the biological process shown in the provided images.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the image series:** The images L, M, and N show a sequence of events in a filamentous, multicellular organism, likely a fungal hypha.\n2.  **Identify key structures:** I can see septa (cross-walls) dividing the filament into cells. The key event, highlighted by the arrowheads, is the formation of a small, hook-like structure near a septum.\n3.  **Trace the process:**\n    *   Image L shows the initial state, with a straight hypha and a septum.\n    *   Image M shows the beginning of a lateral outgrowth or hook near the septum.\n    *   Image N shows this hook has grown backward and is fusing with the adjacent (subapical) cell, forming a bypass or a \"clamp\" around the original septum.\n4.  **Identify the biological process:** This sequence of events is the classic depiction of **clamp connection formation**, a process unique to certain types of fungi (Basidiomycetes). This process ensures that when the apical cell divides, both daughter cells receive a pair of compatible nuclei, thus maintaining the dikaryotic state.\n5.  **Formulate the response:** I will write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to explain the process shown in the images.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the biological process depicted in the images.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Clamp connection formation in a fungal hypha.\"\n  explanation = \"\"\"\nThe image series (L, M, N) depicts the formation of a clamp connection, a specialized structure found in the hyphae of most Basidiomycete fungi.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of what is happening:\n- Image L: Shows a segment of a fungal hypha with a cross-wall (septum), indicated by the arrowhead.\n- Image M: A small hook-like outgrowth, which is the beginning of the clamp connection, starts to form near the septum and grows backward.\n- Image N: The clamp connection has grown and fused with the adjacent cell, creating a bridge that bypasses the septum.\n\nThe primary function of this process is to maintain the dikaryotic state (having two genetically distinct nuclei) in the cells after mitosis. It ensures that when the terminal cell divides, each of the two new cells receives one of each type of nucleus.\n\"\"\"\n\n  print(f\"The process shown in the image is: {process_name}\")\n  print(\"\\nDetailed Explanation:\")\n  print(explanation)\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Clamp connection formation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
