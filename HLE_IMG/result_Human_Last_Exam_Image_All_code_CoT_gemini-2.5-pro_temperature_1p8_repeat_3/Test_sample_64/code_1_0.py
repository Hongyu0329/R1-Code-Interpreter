  explanation = """
The image series (L, M, N) depicts the formation of a clamp connection, a specialized structure found in the hyphae of most Basidiomycete fungi.

Here is a step-by-step description of what is happening:
- Image L: Shows a segment of a fungal hypha with a cross-wall (septum), indicated by the arrowhead.
- Image M: A small hook-like outgrowth, which is the beginning of the clamp connection, starts to form near the septum and grows backward.
- Image N: The clamp connection has grown and fused with the adjacent cell, creating a bridge that bypasses the septum.

The primary function of this process is to maintain the dikaryotic state (having two genetically distinct nuclei) in the cells after mitosis. It ensures that when the terminal cell divides, each of the two new cells receives one of each type of nucleus.
