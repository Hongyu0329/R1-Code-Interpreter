    """
    This function provides a detailed analysis of the S100B protein's interaction
    and its role as a biological marker based on the provided pathway diagram.
    """

    response = """**Receptor Identification:**
Based on the provided diagram, the protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products)**. The image clearly depicts S100B binding to the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (labeled V, C1, and C2) of the RAGE receptor.

**Marker Type Explanation:**
S100B would serve as a powerful **prognostic marker** rather than just an adjunct marker for neurological disorders. Here is the rationale:
- **Causative Role:** The diagram shows that S100B is not merely present during the disease but is an active trigger of the pathology. Its binding to RAGE directly initiates downstream pathways that cause cellular damage.
- **Predicts Severity:** The activation of these pathways leads to critical pathological outcomes like apoptosis (via the JNK/JUN pathway), neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration (all mediated by NFÎºB activation).
- **Correlation with Outcome:** Because higher levels of S100B would lead to increased activation of these destructive pathways, its concentration in a patient would directly correlate with the severity and progression rate of the neurodegeneration. Therefore, measuring S100B levels can provide a prognosis, helping to predict the future course and outcome of the disease.
