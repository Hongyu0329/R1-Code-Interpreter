# Plan:
# 1. Represent each complex with its identifying number and the total number of fluorine atoms.
#    The number of fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands is the key structural variable.
# 2. The chemical principle is that fluorine atoms, being strongly electron-withdrawing,
#    strengthen the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand.
# 3. Stronger bonds lead to higher molecular stability and thus a longer operational lifetime.
# 4. Therefore, complexes with fewer fluorine atoms are expected to have shorter lifetimes.
# 5. We will identify the complexes with the lowest number of fluorine atoms as those with shorter lifetimes.
#

# Step 1: Define the complexes and their total number of fluorine atoms.
# Complex 1: 0 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 0
# Complex 2: 2 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 4
# Complex 3: 1 F atom per ligand * 2 ligands = 2
# Complex 4: 3 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 6
