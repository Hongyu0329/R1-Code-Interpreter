    "Answering this question requires understanding the relationship between the chemical structure of the emitter molecules and their stability, which in turn affects their operational lifetime in a device like an LEC.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** The image displays four iridium(III) complexes. They share a common core structure: a central iridium ion, two identical cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands (C^N), and one bidentate 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand (N^N). The sole difference between the four complexes lies in the number and position of fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the cyclometalating ligands.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** In organometallic complexes like these, a primary factor determining their stability and, consequently, their operational lifetime is the strength of the metal-ligand bonds. The cyclometalating Ir-C bond (between the iridium and the phenyl ring) is often considered the most vulnerable point for degradation.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two key effects:\n    *   It lowers the energy of the molecular orbitals of the ligand, particularly the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which has significant character on the phenyl ring.\n    *   This energy lowering leads to a stronger Ir-C bond. A stronger bond means the ligand is less likely to detach from the metal center, making the complex more robust and resistant to degradation.\n\n4.  **Compare the Complexes:** We can rank the complexes based on the degree of fluorination, which serves as a proxy for the Ir-C bond strength and expected stability/lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has zero fluorine atoms on its phenylpyridine ligands. It has the weakest Ir-C bonds.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has one fluorine atom on each of its two phenylpyridine ligands (total of 2 fluorine atoms). The Ir-C bonds are stronger than in Complex 1.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has two fluorine atoms on each of its two phenylpyridine ligands (total of 4 fluorine atoms). The Ir-C bonds are even stronger.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has three fluorine atoms on each of its two phenylpyridine ligands (total of 6 fluorine atoms). It has the strongest Ir-C bonds.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Lifetime:** A shorter lifetime is expected for less stable complexes. Based on our analysis, stability increases with the degree of fluorination. Therefore, the expected order of lifetime is:\n    Complex 1 < Complex 3 < Complex 2 < Complex 4.\n\n    The question asks which complexes are expected to show **shorter lifetimes**. This would be the least stable ones in the series, which are **Complex 1** and **Complex 3**.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically determine this based on the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n```python\n#\n# Plan:\n# 1. Represent each complex with its identifying number and the total number of fluorine atoms.\n#    The number of fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands is the key structural variable.\n# 2. The chemical principle is that fluorine atoms, being strongly electron-withdrawing,\n#    strengthen the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand.\n# 3. Stronger bonds lead to higher molecular stability and thus a longer operational lifetime.\n# 4. Therefore, complexes with fewer fluorine atoms are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n# 5. We will identify the complexes with the lowest number of fluorine atoms as those with shorter lifetimes.\n#\n\n# Step 1: Define the complexes and their total number of fluorine atoms.\n# Complex 1: 0 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 0\n# Complex 2: 2 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 4\n# Complex 3: 1 F atom per ligand * 2 ligands = 2\n# Complex 4: 3 F atoms per ligand * 2 ligands = 6\ncomplexes = {\n    1: {'name': 'Complex 1', 'fluorine_atoms': 0},\n    2: {'name': 'Complex 2', 'fluorine_atoms': 4},\n    3: {'name': 'Complex 3', 'fluorine_atoms': 2},\n    4: {'name': 'Complex 4', 'fluorine_atoms': 6}\n}\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Iridium Complex Stability and Expected Lifetime\")\nprint(\"=\"*60)\nprint(\"The operational lifetime of these emitters is related to their chemical stability.\")\nprint(\"A key factor for stability is the strength of the Ir-C bond.\")\nprint(\"Fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring strengthen this bond, increasing stability.\\n\")\nprint(\"Number of fluorine atoms in each complex:\")\nfor num, data in complexes.items():\n    print(f\"- {data['name']}: {data['fluorine_atoms']} fluorine atoms\")\n\n# Step 2: Sort the complexes by the number of fluorine atoms in ascending order.\n# The lambda function tells sorted() to use the 'fluorine_atoms' value for sorting.\nsorted_complexes = sorted(complexes.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['fluorine_atoms'])\n\n# Step 3: Identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes (the two with the fewest fluorine atoms).\nshorter_lifetime_complexes = [sorted_complexes[0][0], sorted_complexes[1][0]]\nshorter_lifetime_complexes.sort() # Sort the numbers for a clean output\n\nprint(\"\\nRanking by stability (based on fluorine count, from lowest to highest):\")\nranked_names = [f\"Complex {item[0]}\" for item in sorted_complexes]\nprint(\" -> \".join(ranked_names))\n\nprint(\"\\nConclusion:\")\nprint(\"Complexes with fewer fluorine atoms have weaker Ir-C bonds, are less stable, and thus are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\")\nprint(f\"The two complexes with the fewest fluorine atoms are Complex {shorter_lifetime_complexes[0]} and Complex {shorter_lifetime_complexes[1]}.\")\n\n# The final answer corresponds to the option \"[1, 3]\".\nfinal_answer = shorter_lifetime_complexes\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are {final_answer[0]} and {final_answer[1]}.\")\n```\n<<<F>>>"
