**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A fused tricyclic system. A pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core. One pyrrole ring has a methyl ester substituent. The bridgehead carbon is part of an acetylated amidine group.

A more conventional drawing would show a 5-membered ring fused with another 5-membered ring. One ring is a pyrrole with a COOCH3 group. The other is a dihydropyrrole. The bridgehead nitrogen is bonded to the rest of the original proline ring. The bridgehead carbon is bonded to the acetylated amidine group. A likely structure is 3-acetyl-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-1-(pyrrolidin-2-ylidene)-1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-pyrrolizin-3-ium.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
A tricyclic system containing a lactone ring fused to the starting material's core, with a carboxylic acid side chain.

A plausible structure is a derivative of 2-oxo-hexahydro-2H-quinolizine, where one nitrogen is part of the original amidine structure and the molecule has a (2-carboxyvinyl) group.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
The zwitterionic azomethine ylide.

The structure is 1-[1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-2-carboxypyrrolidin-1-ium-2-ide.
