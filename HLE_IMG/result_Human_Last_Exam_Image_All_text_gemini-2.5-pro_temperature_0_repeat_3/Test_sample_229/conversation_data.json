    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Sheet Music**\n*   **Notation Style:** The music is presented as a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the main melody, basic chord changes (indicated by symbols like C, E7, F), and rhythmic notation. This format is common in jazz, pop, and related genres for improvisation and accompaniment.\n*   **Instrumentation:** It's written on a single staff with a treble clef, suitable for a C instrument like piano, guitar, or a solo instrument like a flute or saxophone.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as \"common time.\"\n*   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which typically indicates the key of C major or its relative, A minor. The piece starts and ends on a C chord, strongly suggesting the key is C major.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\n*   **Tempo Marking:** At the very top left of the sheet music, the tempo marking \"Med. Bossa\" is visible. \"Med.\" is an abbreviation for \"Medium,\" and \"Bossa\" refers to Bossa Nova.\n*   **Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated (rhythms that emphasize off-beats), which is a defining characteristic of Bossa Nova.\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression includes seventh chords (E7, G7), minor chords (C-, D-, A-), and even an augmented chord (G+7). This sophisticated harmonic language is typical of Bossa Nova, which blends Brazilian samba rhythms with the complex harmonies of American jazz.\n*   **Conclusion on Style:** The explicit \"Bossa\" marking, combined with the syncopated rhythm and jazzy chords, definitively identifies the musical style as **Bossa Nova**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Country of Origin**\n*   Bossa Nova is a world-renowned musical genre that originated and was popularized in **Brazil** during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Therefore, the country of origin for this song is Brazil.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Title of the Song**\n*   The title is not written on the sheet music, so it must be identified by its melody.\n*   Let's transcribe the first few notes of the melody, starting from the pickup notes: G-A-B.\n*   The first full measure begins: C-C-B-A | G-F#-G-A.\n*   This melodic phrase is the iconic opening of the famous Bossa Nova song **\"Água de Beber\"** (which translates to \"Water to Drink\"). The song was composed by the legendary Brazilian artist Antônio Carlos Jobim with lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes.\n*   While the original version is often performed in A minor, this lead sheet has transposed it to C major, a common practice for instrumentalists and vocalists. The melody remains identical in its contour and rhythm.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n*   **Title:** The melody is unmistakably that of \"Água de Beber\".\n*   **Musical Style:** The tempo marking explicitly states \"Bossa,\" and all musical elements confirm it is Bossa Nova.\n*   **Country of Origin:** Bossa Nova is a style of music from Brazil.\n\n<<<Title: Água de Beber (Water to Drink), Musical Style: Bossa Nova, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
