    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-3-one.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group. The formula of a PMB group is -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃, which corresponds to C₈H₉O.\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃) attached to the double bond at position C6.\n*   **Atom Counting for the Starting Material:**\n    *   **Bicyclic core (C₆H₅NO):** This is the 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton without the substituents on N and C6. It has 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen.\n    *   **PMB group (C₈H₉O):** Attached to the nitrogen, replacing the H of the NH group.\n    *   **CF₃ group (CF₃):** Attached to C6, replacing a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Let's build the formula from the structure:**\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the bicyclic ring + 8 in the PMB group + 1 in the CF₃ group = 15 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** There are 5 hydrogens on the unsubstituted core (C1-H, C4-H, C5-H, C7-H₂). The PMB group adds 9 hydrogens. Total H = 5 + 9 = 14 hydrogens.\n        *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 from the CF₃ group.\n        *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 in the lactam ring.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the lactam + 1 in the methoxy group of PMB = 2 oxygens.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. It removes the PMB group from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The N-PMB group is converted to an N-H group. The PMB group itself is oxidized and removed, typically as p-methoxybenzaldehyde.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We remove the PMB group (C₈H₉O).\n    *   We add a hydrogen atom (H) to the nitrogen.\n    *   Net change: Subtract C₈H₉O and add H. This is equivalent to a net loss of C₈H₈O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C₇H₆F₃NO. (The structure is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) and the CF₃ group are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** The alkene in the bicyclic ring is saturated.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   One molecule of hydrogen (H₂) is added across the double bond.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C₇H₆F₃NO\n    *   Add H₂: C₇H(₆+₂)F₃NO\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C₇H₈F₃NO. (The structure is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. The lactam, which is a cyclic amide, will undergo ring-opening hydrolysis.\n*   **Transformation:** The amide bond (C-N) within the ring is cleaved. A molecule of water (H₂O) is added across this bond. The carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH₂), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH₃⁺) in the acidic medium. The question asks for the molecular formula, which typically refers to the neutral form of the molecule.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:**\n    *   One molecule of water (H₂O) is added to the molecule.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C₇H₈F₃NO\n    *   Add H₂O: C₇H(₈+₂)F₃NO(₁+₁)\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂. (The structure is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid: 3-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid).\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
