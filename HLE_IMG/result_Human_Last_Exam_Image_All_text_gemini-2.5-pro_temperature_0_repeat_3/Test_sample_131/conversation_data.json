    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the functional groups and the overall structure.**\n    *   The molecule is a complex organic compound.\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms, which are part of heterocyclic rings. The presence of nitrogen in a naturally derived complex molecule suggests it is an alkaloid.\n    *   It contains a carbonyl group (C=O) which is part of a six-membered ring that also contains a nitrogen atom. This specific functional group is a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n    *   The overall structure is tetracyclic, meaning it is composed of four fused rings. All rings are six-membered.\n    *   The stereochemistry is explicitly shown with wedged and dashed bonds, indicating a specific stereoisomer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the parent ring system.**\n    *   The core framework of this molecule is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids.\n    *   This framework can be seen as being derived from the parent alkaloid sparteine, which has the same tetracyclic skeleton but lacks the carbonyl group.\n    *   The structure shown is an oxo-derivative of sparteine. The ketone group is at the C-2 position of one of the quinolizidine systems.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with known alkaloids.**\n    *   By comparing the given structure with the structures of known lupin alkaloids, we can identify it.\n    *   **Sparteine**: Has the same ring system but no C=O group.\n    *   **Lupanine**: Is known as 2-oxosparteine. Its structure perfectly matches the one provided in the image, including the tetracyclic framework, the position of the lactam group, and the relative stereochemistry.\n    *   **Anagyrine** and **Cytisine**: These are also lupin alkaloids but contain an unsaturated pyridone ring, which is not present in the given saturated structure.\n    *   **Matrine**: This is another tetracyclic alkaloid with a lactam, but its ring fusion pattern is different from the one shown.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\n    *   Based on the structural analysis and comparison with known compounds, the alkaloid shown is lupanine. The specific stereoisomer depicted is the most common naturally occurring form.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
