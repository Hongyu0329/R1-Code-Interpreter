**Product A:**
The structure is methyl 1-acetyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate. It is a five-membered pyrrole ring with an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to the nitrogen atom (position 1) and a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃) attached to a carbon atom at position 3.

**Product B:**
The structure is N-(1-oxohexahydropyrrolizin-2-yl)succinimide. This molecule consists of two main parts: a bicyclic lactam (hexahydropyrrolizin-1-one) and a succinimide ring, connected by a C-N bond. The succinimide nitrogen is bonded to the carbon at position 2 of the pyrrolizinone ring system.

**Product C:**
The structure is N-(1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)succinimide. This molecule consists of an N-acetylpyrrolidine ring (derived from proline) and a succinimide ring. The nitrogen of the succinimide ring is bonded to the carbon at position 2 of the N-acetylpyrrolidine ring.
