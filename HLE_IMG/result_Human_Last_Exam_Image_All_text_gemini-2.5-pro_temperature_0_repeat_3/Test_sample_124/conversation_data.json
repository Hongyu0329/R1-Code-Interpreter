    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the total current supplied by the voltage source, V2, to the rest of the circuit. This is often referred to as the total current flowing \"through the circuit\".\n\n**2. Analyze the Circuit Components and Layout**\n*   **Voltage Source (V2):** 1 V DC.\n*   **Resistors:**\n    *   R1 = 3 Ω\n    *   R2 = 7 Ω\n    *   R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   R7 = 100 Ω\n    *   R8 = 100 Ω\n*   **Wiring:** The way the components are connected is crucial. We need to carefully trace the paths of the wires. Let's define the main nodes:\n    *   **Node A:** The top horizontal wire, connected to the positive terminal of V2.\n    *   **Node B:** The bottom horizontal wire, connected to the negative terminal of V2 and ground. The potential difference between Node A and Node B is 1 V.\n\n**3. Simplify the Circuit by Identifying Short Circuits**\nA \"short circuit\" is a path with zero (or negligible) resistance, typically represented by a wire. When a short circuit is in parallel with a resistor, all the current will flow through the short circuit, bypassing the resistor.\n\n*   **Short Circuit 1 (across R1 and R2):**\n    *   Observe the wire that starts at Node A, goes to the left, then down, and connects to the point between R2 and R3.\n    *   This wire creates a direct path from Node A to the top of R3.\n    *   This wire is in parallel with the series combination of R1 and R2.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of a component in parallel with a short circuit is 0 Ω. Therefore, R1 and R2 are short-circuited. No current will flow through them.\n    *   This simplification means the top of R3 is effectively connected directly to Node A. Since its bottom is connected to Node B, R3 is directly across the 1V source.\n\n*   **Short Circuit 2 (across R8):**\n    *   Observe the wire connecting the point between R1 and R2 (let's call it Node C) and the point between R7 and R8 (let's call it Node E).\n    *   From our first simplification, we know that no current flows through R1 because it's part of a shorted path.\n    *   If there is no current through R1, there is no voltage drop across it (V = I*R = 0*3 = 0V).\n    *   This means the potential at Node C is the same as the potential at Node A (V_C = V_A = 1V).\n    *   The wire from Node C to Node E means that Node E must have the same potential as Node C. So, V_E = 1V.\n    *   Now look at resistor R8. It is connected between Node A (potential = 1V) and Node E (potential = 1V).\n    *   The voltage across R8 is V_A - V_E = 1V - 1V = 0V.\n    *   Since there is no voltage across R8, no current flows through it. R8 is also effectively short-circuited and can be removed from the analysis.\n\n**4. The Simplified Circuit**\nAfter analyzing the short circuits, we find that resistors R1, R2, and R8 carry no current. The circuit simplifies to just two resistors, R3 and R7, connected in parallel across the 1V voltage source.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Current**\nThe total current from the source is the sum of the currents flowing through the parallel branches (R3 and R7).\n\n*   **Current through R3 (I_R3):**\n    *   The voltage across R3 is 1 V.\n    *   I_R3 = V2 / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω = 1/9 A.\n\n*   **Current through R7 (I_R7):**\n    *   The voltage across R7 is also 1 V (since the path A -> C -> E puts Node E at 1V).\n    *   I_R7 = V2 / R7 = 1 V / 100 Ω = 1/100 A.\n\n*   **Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   I_total = I_R3 + I_R7\n    *   I_total = (1/9) A + (1/100) A\n    *   To add the fractions, find a common denominator (900):\n    *   I_total = (100/900) A + (9/900) A = 109/900 A.\n\n*   **Convert to Decimal:**\n    *   I_total = 109 / 900 A ≈ 0.12111... A.\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\n<<<0.121>>>"
