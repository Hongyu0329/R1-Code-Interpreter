    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**1. Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n\n**2. Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe [110] direction in a cubic system corresponds to a vector along a face diagonal. When we view a crystal structure along a specific direction, we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to that direction. The plane perpendicular to the [110] direction is the (110) plane.\n\n**3. Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern**\nWhen an FCC lattice is viewed along the [110] direction, the projected pattern of atoms forms a **centered rectangle**.\n*   The vertices of this rectangle are formed by atoms from the corners of the cubic unit cell.\n*   The atom at the center of the rectangle is formed by the projection of atoms at the face centers.\n*   The side lengths of this rectangle are in the ratio of `a` to `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant. The ratio of the side lengths is therefore `√2 ≈ 1.414`. This means the rectangle is not a square.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid (2 columns of 3 atoms). There is no atom in the center of the rectangles formed by any four adjacent atoms. This pattern is a simple rectangular lattice, not a centered rectangular lattice. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image shows a pattern that resembles a distorted hexagon. This type of pattern is characteristic of viewing an FCC or BCC lattice along the [111] direction. It is not a centered rectangle. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a centered pattern. Let's identify the unit cell. We can see four atoms forming the corners of a square, and one atom exactly in the center of that square. For example, consider the atoms at approximately (0.5, 6.5), (6.5, 6.5), (0.5, 12.5), and (6.5, 12.5) as corners. The center atom is at (3.5, 9.5). The side lengths are equal, forming a square. A centered square projection corresponds to a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction, not an FCC lattice viewed along [110]. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** By elimination, this should be the correct option. Let's analyze its pattern. The arrangement of atoms is less regular than in the other images, suggesting a projection that is not perfectly aligned or has some perspective distortion. However, we can still identify the key topological features. The pattern is a centered one. We can identify a parallelogram (a projected rectangle) with an atom in its center. For instance, if we consider the rectangle formed by the approximate corner atoms (1,7), (8,7), (1,18), (8,18), its center would be at (4.5, 12.5). There is an atom at (4,12), which is very close to this central position. The side lengths of this rectangle would be approximately `8-1=7` and `18-7=11`. The ratio of the sides is `11/7 ≈ 1.57`, which is reasonably close to `√2 ≈ 1.414`. This non-square, centered rectangular pattern is consistent with the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the expected projection pattern for an FCC lattice along the [110] direction (a centered rectangle with side ratio √2) and comparing it with the given options, Image C is the only one that matches these characteristics.\n\n<<<C>>>"
