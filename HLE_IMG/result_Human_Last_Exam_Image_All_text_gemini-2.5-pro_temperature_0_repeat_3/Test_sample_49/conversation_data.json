    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The output is taken across the capacitor $C$. This configuration forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the filter's transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. For a simple RC circuit, the angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is determined by the time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Strategy: Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\nWe will find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground ($b_0$). The input voltage source at `IN` (node $c_0$) is set to zero, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground. The cutoff angular frequency will then be given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we calculate the resistance looking into node $a_0$ with node $c_0$ grounded.\nLooking into node $a_0$, we first encounter a resistor $r$ connected to node $d_1$. Therefore, $R_{th}$ is the sum of this resistance $r$ and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the network as seen from node $d_1$ with respect to ground (which is node $c_0$).\n$R_{th} = r + R_{eq}(d_1, c_0)$\nwhere $R_{eq}(d_1, c_0)$ is the equivalent resistance between nodes $d_1$ and $c_0$.\n\n**4. Finding the Characteristic Resistance of the Infinite Ladder**\nThe circuit contains an infinite ladder network starting from the nodes $(c_1, d_1)$. To find $R_{eq}(d_1, c_0)$, we first need to find the characteristic resistance of this infinite ladder. Let's call this resistance $R_{L}$. $R_{L}$ is the resistance looking into any pair of terminals $(c_n, d_n)$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nDue to the repeating structure of the ladder, the resistance looking into terminals $(c_n, d_n)$ is the same as looking into $(c_{n+1}, d_{n+1})$. We can write a self-consistency equation for $R_L$.\n\nLooking into terminals $(c_n, d_n)$, we see:\n*   The horizontal resistor (\"rung\") $r$ between $c_n$ and $d_n$.\n*   This resistor is in parallel with the path through the next section of the ladder. This path consists of the series combination of:\n    1.  The resistor $r$ on the top rail between $c_n$ and $c_{n+1}$.\n    2.  The equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder, which is $R_L$, seen between $c_{n+1}$ and $d_{n+1}$.\n    3.  The resistor $r$ on the bottom rail between $d_{n+1}$ and $d_n$.\nThe total resistance of this second path is $r + R_L + r = 2r + R_L$.\n\nSo, the self-consistency equation for $R_L$ is:\n$R_L = r \\parallel (2r + R_L)$\n$R_L = \\frac{r(2r + R_L)}{r + (2r + R_L)} = \\frac{2r^2 + rR_L}{3r + R_L}$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $R_L$:\n$R_L(3r + R_L) = 2r^2 + rR_L$\n$3rR_L + R_L^2 = 2r^2 + rR_L$\n$R_L^2 + 2rR_L - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_L$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$R_L = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we choose the positive root:\n$R_L = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**5. Calculating $R_{eq}(d_1, c_0)$**\nNow we can find the resistance between node $d_1$ and node $c_0$. The path from $c_0$ to $d_1$ consists of the resistor $r$ between $c_0$ and $c_1$, connected in series with the infinite ladder which starts at terminals $(c_1, d_1)$. The resistance of the infinite ladder between $c_1$ and $d_1$ is $R_L$.\nSo, the circuit between $c_0$ and $d_1$ is a simple series connection:\n$R_{eq}(d_1, c_0) = r + R_L = r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**6. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nNow we can substitute this back into our expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{eq}(d_1, c_0) = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**7. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can find the cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, would be $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. The question asks for the cutoff frequency, and the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is the more fundamental quantity in this context.\n\nThe final expression for the cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<Ï‰_c = 1/((1 + sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
