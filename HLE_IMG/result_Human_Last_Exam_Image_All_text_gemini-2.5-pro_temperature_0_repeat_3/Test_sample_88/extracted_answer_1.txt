**Product A:** A pyrrolizidine derivative with the molecular formula C14H20N2O3. It is formed from the [3+2] cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide (derived from the N-acetylated starting material by decarboxylation) with methyl propiolate. The structure contains a fused pyrrolizidine core, an N-acetyl group, the original spirocyclic moiety, and a methyl ester group.

**Product B:** A substituted pyrrole with the molecular formula C12H14N2O3. It is formed from the [3+2] cycloaddition of a m√ºnchnone intermediate (derived from the N-acetylated starting material by dehydration) with methyl propiolate, followed by the extrusion of CO2. The structure is a pyrrole ring substituted with an acetyl group, a methyl ester group, and the original spirocyclic moiety.

**Product C:** The N-acetylated starting material with the molecular formula C11H16N2O3. It is formed by the initial acetylation of the secondary amine of the spirocyclic amino acid starting material by acetic anhydride.
