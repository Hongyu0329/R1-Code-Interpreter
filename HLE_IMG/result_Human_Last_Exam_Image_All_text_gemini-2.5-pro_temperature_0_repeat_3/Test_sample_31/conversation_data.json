    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By inspecting the image, we can count the number of crossings in the knot diagram. There are 5 crossings arranged vertically in the center, one crossing on the left, and one on the right, for a total of 7 crossings.\n2.  **Check if the knot is alternating:** An alternating knot diagram is one where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as we travel along the strand. Let's trace a single strand starting from the top left and moving downwards: it goes UNDER, then OVER, then UNDER, then OVER, then UNDER, then OVER, then UNDER. Since the crossings alternate, this is an alternating diagram.\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** The knot is a 7-crossing alternating knot. We can compare its structure to a standard knot table. This particular diagram is known as a \"Turk's Head knot\", specifically the one with 3 strands and 5 bights, sometimes denoted T(3,5). This knot is known in knot theory as the **7₄ knot**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen invariant and its properties**\n\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted s(K), is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot K derived from a structure called Khovanov homology. It is always an even integer.\n2.  **Key Property for Alternating Knots:** A major theorem in knot theory, proven by Jacob Rasmussen, states that for any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is equal to its classical signature, σ(K).\n    *   s(K) = σ(K) for alternating knots.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the signature of the 7₄ knot as depicted in the image.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the signature (σ) of the knot**\n\nThe signature of a knot can be calculated in several ways. One of the most systematic methods that avoids the ambiguity of drawing-dependent calculations (like the writhe) is using knot polynomials.\n\n1.  **Find the Alexander Polynomial:** From standard knot theory tables (like those found in textbooks, online databases such as Knot Atlas or KnotInfo), the Alexander polynomial for the 7₄ knot is:\n    Δ(t) = 2t² - 5t + 2.\n    (Note: The Alexander polynomial is the same for a knot and its mirror image).\n\n2.  **Derive the Conway Polynomial:** The Conway polynomial, ∇(z), is related to the symmetrized Alexander polynomial.\n    *   First, we symmetrize Δ(t) by dividing by a power of t to make it symmetric under t ↔ t⁻¹. The degree of Δ(t) is 2.\n        Δ_s(t) = t⁻¹ * (2t² - 5t + 2) = 2t - 5 + 2t⁻¹ = 2(t + t⁻¹) - 5.\n    *   The Conway polynomial is found by the substitution t + t⁻¹ = z² + 2.\n        ∇(z) = 2(z² + 2) - 5 = 2z² + 4 - 5 = 2z² - 1.\n\n3.  **Apply the Signature Formula:** For an alternating knot, the signature is given by the formula σ(K) = -2a₂, where a₂ is the coefficient of the z² term in the Conway polynomial, *normalized to have a constant term of +1*.\n    *   Our derived Conway polynomial is ∇(z) = 2z² - 1. To normalize it, we multiply by -1:\n        ∇_norm(z) = -(2z² - 1) = 1 - 2z².\n    *   In this normalized form, the constant term is a₀ = 1 and the coefficient of z² is a₂ = -2.\n    *   Now, we apply the formula:\n        σ(K) = -2 * a₂ = -2 * (-2) = 4.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  The signature of the knot depicted in the image is σ(K) = 4.\n2.  Since the knot is alternating, its Rasmussen invariant is equal to its signature.\n3.  Therefore, s(K) = 4.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Knot Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the knot. The visual identification as 7₄ is standard.\n*   **Chirality and Conventions:** The 7₄ knot is chiral (it is different from its mirror image). Knot tables often list the version with a negative signature by convention (σ = -4). The knot in the picture is the mirror image of that standard representation. The question asks about the knot *in the picture*, so we must analyze the specific diagram provided or use methods that determine the signature for the corresponding knot type. Our calculation using the standard polynomial and formula consistently yields +4.\n*   **Formulas and Normalizations:** The formulas relating knot polynomials to invariants like the signature depend on specific conventions and normalizations. The steps followed here use a consistent set of standard conventions (from Lickorish's and Kauffman's textbooks on knot theory).\n*   **Rasmussen Invariant Property:** The equality s(K) = σ(K) for alternating knots is the key theoretical tool that makes this calculation feasible.\n\nThe final answer is the calculated value of the Rasmussen invariant.\n\n<<<4>>>"
