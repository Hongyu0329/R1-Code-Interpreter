The final product, compound A, is 1-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole. Its structure is as follows:
A benzene ring is fused to a five-membered ring at positions designated 1a and 3a. The five-membered ring contains a nitrogen atom at position 2. A 2-pyridyl group is attached to this nitrogen atom. A double bond exists between the nitrogen atom (N2) and the adjacent carbon atom (C3). The other carbon atom of the five-membered ring (C1) is sp3-hybridized and is bonded to both a hydrogen atom and a cyano group (-Câ‰¡N).
