    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual elements of the artwork:**\n    *   **Medium and Style:** The image shows a relief sculpture, likely carved in marble or made of terracotta. The style is characteristic of the Italian Early Renaissance (Quattrocento), evident in the classical drapery, the naturalistic yet idealized figures, and the ordered, harmonious composition within the circular frame (tondo or roundel).\n    *   **Subject Matter:** The scene is a Christian sacrament. A priest is giving communion to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This depicts the Eucharist or the \"Sacrament of the Altar.\"\n    *   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a visible inscription: \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an early Italian/Latin phrase meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which confirms the subject matter.\n    *   **Composition:** The scene is enclosed in a decorative roundel, which is part of a larger structure, identified in the question as an altarpiece. The frame of the roundel has classicizing motifs like egg-and-dart.\n\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis based on the style:**\n    *   The combination of graceful figures, gentle piety, and mastery of relief sculpture in Florence during the 15th century strongly points to the workshop of the della Robbia family, particularly its founder, Luca della Robbia. He was renowned for his work in both marble and glazed terracotta.\n\n3.  **Verify the hypothesis with specific details:**\n    *   A search for artworks with the inscription \"Sacramenti de l'autel\" or for Renaissance reliefs depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" by artists like Luca della Robbia confirms the identification.\n    *   This specific roundel is a well-documented work. It is a detail from the predella (the base) of the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* (in Italian: *Tabernacolo del Sacramento*), also known as the Tabernacle of Peretola.\n\n4.  **Confirm the author and context:**\n    *   Art historical sources universally attribute the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* to the Florentine sculptor **Luca della Robbia**.\n    *   He created this masterpiece in marble, with bronze and glazed terracotta additions, between 1441 and 1443. It was originally made for the chapel of the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and is now housed in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, Florence. This specific relief shows the *Institution of the Eucharist*.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The author of this detail from the altarpiece (specifically, the Tabernacle of the Sacrament) is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
