    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to identify all unique splice species (i.e., different mature mRNA molecules) suggested by the RT-PCR data and count them.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Genomic Map (Panel A):**\n    *   The map shows the linear arrangement of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) like E1, E2, L1, L2, etc.\n    *   **Crucial Point 1:** There are two distinct polyadenylation sites indicated by triangles: AE (early) and AL (late). This means that transcripts can terminate at two different locations, creating two major classes of mRNA: \"early transcripts\" ending at AE and \"late transcripts\" ending at AL.\n    *   The locations of various forward (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3) and reverse (E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R) primers are shown.\n    *   **Crucial Point 2:** Specific information is given for splice-junction primers:\n        *   `E1F2` spans the `929^3465` splice junction. It will only amplify transcripts that have this specific splice.\n        *   `E1F3` spans the `929^3506` splice junction. It will only amplify transcripts with this specific splice.\n\n3.  **Analyze the RT-PCR Gels to Identify Early Splice Species:**\n    *   Early transcripts are those that use the early polyadenylation site (AE), which is located just after the E5 ORF.\n    *   The PCR reaction best suited to identify these early transcripts is the one using a forward primer in the early region (like E1F1) and a reverse primer just before the AE site. This corresponds to the **E1F1/E5R** primer pair.\n    *   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This gel shows **two distinct bands** (labeled 1 and 2). Each band represents a different-sized product, indicating two different ways the RNA is spliced between the E1F1 and E5R primer binding sites.\n    *   **Conclusion for Early Species:** There are **2 distinct early splice species**.\n    *   *Confirmation:* Panel D (E1F2/E5R) uses a splice-specific primer and shows one band. This confirms that one of the two early species contains the 929^3465 splice. The other early species must therefore have a different splice pattern. This supports the conclusion of two different early species.\n\n4.  **Analyze the RT-PCR Gels to Identify Late Splice Species:**\n    *   Late transcripts are those that bypass the AE site and use the late polyadenylation site (AL), located after the L1 ORF.\n    *   The PCR reaction best suited to identify these late transcripts is the one using a forward primer in the early region (E1F1) and a reverse primer in the final late exon (L1R). This corresponds to the **E1F1/L1R** primer pair.\n    *   **Crucial Point 3:** We must compare Panels H and I, which use the same primers but different PCR cycle numbers. Panel H (20 cycles) shows 2 bands. Panel I (30 cycles) shows **four distinct bands** (labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4). The higher cycle number in Panel I allowed for the amplification and detection of less abundant transcripts. Therefore, Panel I gives the most complete picture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Late Species:** There are **4 distinct late splice species**.\n    *   *Confirmation:* Panels F and G probe the internal structure of these late transcripts. Panel F (E1F2/L2R) shows one late species has the 929^3465 splice. Panel G (E1F3/L2R) shows two other late species have the 929^3506 splice. This accounts for three of the four late species, confirming they have different internal splice patterns. The fourth late species must have yet another splice pattern in this region.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Calculate the Total Number of Species:**\n    *   We have identified two distinct groups of transcripts based on their termination site.\n        *   **Early Species:** 2 (from Panel C)\n        *   **Late Species:** 4 (from Panel I)\n    *   **Crucial Point 4:** A transcript is either \"early\" or \"late\"; it cannot be both. Therefore, the two groups are mutually exclusive.\n    *   To find the total number of splice species, we simply add the number of species in each group.\n    *   Total Species = (Number of Early Species) + (Number of Late Species) = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the RT-PCR results, we can identify two distinct early splice species (from Panel C) and four distinct late splice species (from Panel I). Since these two categories of transcripts are mutually exclusive, the total number of splice species found is the sum of these two counts.\n\nTotal splice species = 2 (early) + 4 (late) = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
