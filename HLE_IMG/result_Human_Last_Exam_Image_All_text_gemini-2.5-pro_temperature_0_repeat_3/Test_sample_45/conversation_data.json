    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how an object or pattern appears unchanged after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches itself during a full 360-degree rotation. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Tiling for Centers of Rotation**\nThe image displays a complex geometric tiling composed of various polygons. To determine its rotational symmetry, we need to identify points in the pattern around which a rotation will leave the entire tiling unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Different Symmetry Centers in the Tiling**\nBy carefully observing the pattern, we can find several distinct types of symmetry centers:\n\n*   **Centers of Hexagons:** The tiling contains dark blue regular hexagons. A regular hexagon inherently has 6-fold rotational symmetry. Let's test if the pattern around it shares this symmetry. If we pick the center of any hexagon as a rotation point, we can see that rotating the entire tiling by 60° (360°/6) results in the pattern mapping perfectly onto itself. The arrangement of all surrounding tiles (the light-yellow pentagons, squares, and star motifs) around the hexagon is consistent with this 6-fold rotation. Therefore, the tiling possesses **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Centers of Stars:** The tiling features prominent star-shaped motifs. Each star is composed of five orange rhombi meeting at a point. This arrangement clearly has 5-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the tiling by 72° (360°/5) around the center of one of these stars leaves the pattern unchanged. The surrounding squares and hexagons are arranged in a way that respects this 5-fold symmetry. Therefore, the tiling also possesses **5-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Centers of Squares:** The tiling also includes light-yellow squares. The center of each square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the tiling by 90° (360°/4) around the center of a square leaves the pattern invariant.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Findings**\nThe analysis reveals that the tiling is highly unusual. It is an aperiodic tiling (or quasicrystal) that has multiple, coexisting centers of rotational symmetry with different orders: 6-fold, 5-fold, and 4-fold. The presence of both 5-fold and 6-fold symmetry is forbidden in a single periodic crystal lattice (according to the crystallographic restriction theorem), which confirms the aperiodic nature of this pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Determine \"The\" Rotational Symmetry**\nThe question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry of the tiling, which implies a single definitive answer. When a pattern or object has multiple axes of rotational symmetry of different orders, the convention is to identify the highest order of symmetry present.\n\n*   We have found centers of 6-fold symmetry.\n*   We have found centers of 5-fold symmetry.\n*   We have found centers of 4-fold symmetry.\n\nComparing these orders, the highest one is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling exhibits rotational symmetries of order 4, 5, and 6 at different points. The highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
