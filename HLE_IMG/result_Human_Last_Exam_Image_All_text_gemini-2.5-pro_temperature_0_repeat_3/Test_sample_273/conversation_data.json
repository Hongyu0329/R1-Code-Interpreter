    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure and name the molecule according to IUPAC rules.**\nFirst, we need to determine the connectivity of the atoms and find the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2).\n\n1.  **Trace the longest carbon chain:** The longest continuous carbon chain containing the carbon attached to the -NH2 group is a pentane chain.\n    Let's trace it from the left:\n    CH3(C5) - CH(OH)(C4) - CH(CH2CH3)(C3) - CH(CH3)(C2) - CH2NH2(C1 is the carbon attached to NH2, but numbering is for the parent chain).\n    The parent chain is a pentane. The -NH2 group is on a methyl substituent at C2, or the chain is named as an amine.\n    Let's use the preferred IUPAC nomenclature where the amine is the principal functional group. The carbon chain is numbered to give the carbon bearing the -NH2 group the lowest possible number. The group is -CH2NH2.\n    The longest chain is C5-C4-C3-C2, with a -CH2NH2 group attached to C2.\n    Let's re-evaluate the longest chain. The chain is CH3-CH(OH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2. The longest chain containing C1 (the carbon of CH2NH2) is not the one drawn horizontally.\n    Let's find the correct parent chain:\n    - The chain C5-C4-C3-C2-C1 (where C1 is the carbon of CH2NH2) is 5 carbons long.\n    - However, if we include the ethyl group in the main chain: CH3-CH2-C3-C2-C1, this is also 5 carbons.\n    - Let's reconsider the structure: The molecule is 4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine.\n    The parent chain is pentan-1-amine.\n    Numbering starts from the carbon attached to the NH2 group (this is C1 of the pentane chain).\n    - C1: -CH2NH2\n    - C2: has a methyl (-CH3) substituent.\n    - C3: has an ethyl (-CH2CH3) substituent.\n    - C4: has a hydroxyl (-OH) substituent.\n    - C5: is the terminal methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n2.  **Identify the chiral centers:** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    - **C2:** Bonded to H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the rest of the chain (-C3...). All four are different. So, C2 is a chiral center.\n    - **C3:** Bonded to H, -CH2CH3, -C2..., and -C4.... All four are different. So, C3 is a chiral center.\n    - **C4:** Bonded to H, -OH, -CH3 (this is C5), and -C3.... All four are different. So, C4 is a chiral center.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of each chiral center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n**Analysis of C4 (the leftmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify substituents and assign priorities:**\n    - Substituents: -OH, -C3H(Et)..., -CH3 (C5), -H.\n    - Priorities (by atomic number of the atom directly attached to C4):\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  -C3H(Et)... (Carbon, Z=6, attached to other carbons)\n        3.  -CH3 (Carbon, Z=6, attached to hydrogens)\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n        (Priority of -C3 is higher than -CH3 because C3 is bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen, while the methyl carbon is bonded to three hydrogens).\n2.  **Determine orientation:**\n    - The drawing shows the C4-C3 bond and the C4-C5 bond as in-plane.\n    - The -OH group is on a dashed bond (pointing away from the viewer).\n    - The fourth substituent, -H, is not drawn, so it must be on a wedged bond (pointing towards the viewer).\n3.  **Assign R/S configuration:**\n    - The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer (wedge).\n    - Trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: -OH (1, back) -> -C3 (2, right) -> -CH3 (3, left).\n    - This path describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    - Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the result. CCW (S) becomes R.\n    - **Configuration at C4 is R.**\n\n**Analysis of C3 (the middle chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify substituents and assign priorities:**\n    - Substituents: -C4H(OH)CH3, -C2H(CH3)CH2NH2, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H.\n    - Priorities:\n        1.  -C4H(OH)CH3 (C bonded to O, C, H)\n        2.  -C2H(CH3)CH2NH2 (C bonded to C, C, H). We compare C4 and C2: C4 is bonded to O, C2 is not. So C4 group has higher priority.\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (C bonded to C, H, H)\n        4.  -H\n2.  **Determine orientation:**\n    - The C4-C3 and C3-C2 bonds are in the plane.\n    - The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is on a wedged bond (front).\n    - The -H atom must be on a dashed bond (back).\n3.  **Assign R/S configuration:**\n    - The lowest priority group (-H) is in the back.\n    - Trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: -C4 (1, left) -> -C2 (2, right) -> -Et (3, front/up).\n    - This path describes a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    - Since the lowest priority group is in the back, the configuration is R.\n    - **Configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n**Analysis of C2 (the rightmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify substituents and assign priorities:**\n    - Substituents: -CH2NH2, -C3H(Et)..., -CH3, -H.\n    - Priorities:\n        1.  -CH2NH2 (C bonded to N, H, H). The nitrogen (Z=7) gives this group priority over other carbon groups.\n        2.  -C3H(Et)... (C bonded to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH3 (C bonded to H, H, H)\n        4.  -H\n2.  **Determine orientation:**\n    - The C3-C2 bond and the C2-H bond are in the plane.\n    - The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedged bond (front).\n    - The -CH3 group is on a dashed bond (back).\n3.  **Assign R/S configuration:**\n    - The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane of the drawing. This makes direct assignment difficult. We can use the \"swap\" method.\n    - Swap the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) with the group on the dashed bond (-CH3, priority 3).\n    - After the swap: -H is on the dash (back), and -CH3 is in the plane.\n    - Now, determine the configuration of this new, temporary molecule. The lowest priority group (-H) is in the back.\n    - Trace the path from 1 to 2 to 3 (new position): -CH2NH2 (1, front) -> -C3 (2, left) -> -CH3 (3, in plane).\n    - This path is counter-clockwise (CCW). So the temporary molecule is S.\n    - Since we performed one swap, the original molecule has the opposite configuration. S becomes R.\n    - **Configuration at C2 is R.**\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are:\n- C2 is R\n- C3 is R\n- C4 is R\n\nThe full absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
