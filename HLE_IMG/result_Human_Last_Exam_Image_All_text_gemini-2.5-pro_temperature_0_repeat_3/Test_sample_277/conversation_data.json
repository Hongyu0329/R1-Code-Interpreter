    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to determine the relationship between molecules shown in an image and select the correct option from a multiple-choice list.\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Information:**\n    *   **The Image:** The image provided is completely black. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or molecules depicted in the image.\n    *   **The Question:** The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". The phrase \"mentioned above\" refers to the content of the image.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The question requires a comparison of two or more molecules to determine their isomeric relationship. However, the image, which is supposed to contain these molecules, is empty.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Possibilities:**\n    *   **Isomers:** Isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. To determine if molecules are isomers, and what type they are, we need to see their structures.\n    *   **Constitutional Isomers:** Same formula, different connectivity.\n    *   **Stereoisomers:** Same formula and connectivity, different spatial arrangement. This includes conformers (interconvertible by bond rotation) and configurational isomers (not interconvertible, like enantiomers and diastereomers).\n    *   **Identical:** The same molecule, just possibly drawn from a different perspective.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Analysis:** Since no molecules are shown, we cannot determine their molecular formulas, their connectivity, or their spatial arrangements. It is impossible to perform the necessary comparison to classify them.\n\n6.  **Review the Options:**\n    *   (a) conformers isomers: We cannot confirm this without seeing the molecules.\n    *   (b) constitutional isomers: We cannot confirm this without seeing the molecules.\n    *   (c) Identical: We cannot confirm this without seeing the molecules.\n    *   (d) stereoisomers: We cannot confirm this without seeing the molecules.\n    *   (e) None of these: This option is the most appropriate choice when the information required to select any of the other options is missing. Because we are given no molecules to analyze, we cannot classify them into any of the categories (a) through (d).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe question is unanswerable because the necessary information (the structures of the molecules) is not provided in the image. Therefore, none of the specific classifications of isomerism or identity can be applied. The correct choice is (e).\n\n<<<E>>>"
