    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Physical Characteristics**\n*   **Order:** The insect has wings that appear to overlap, with the basal part being leathery and the apical part membranous. This wing structure (hemelytra) is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs\".\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a distinct color pattern. It is predominantly black with prominent orange or reddish-orange markings.\n*   **Head:** The head is black with what appears to be a thin reddish-orange line down the center. It has two long, black antennae.\n*   **Thorax:** The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment, just behind the head) is black with distinct orange-red margins.\n*   **Wings/Abdomen:** The wings are mostly black, but the edges and prominent veins are outlined in the same orange-red color. This creates a clear linear pattern.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Environment**\nThe insect is on a bright yellow flower head. The structure of the flower, with many small individual florets clustered together, is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species). Knowing the host or associated plant can be a significant clue in insect identification.\n\n**Step 4: Identification and Differentiation from Similar Species**\nBased on the features (true bug, black and orange/red coloration, specific linear pattern), we can narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** While also a black and orange true bug, its pattern is different. It typically has a broad orange \"X\" or two bands across its back, not the linear outlines seen here.\n*   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*):** This insect is commonly found on goldenrod and has a similar color scheme. However, it is a beetle (order Coleoptera), not a true bug. Beetles have hardened forewings (elytra) that meet in a straight line down the back, unlike the overlapping wings of the bug in the picture.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** This species perfectly matches the visual evidence. It is a true bug known for its black body with red or orange markings that outline the thorax and wings. The name *trivittata* itself means \"three-striped,\" referring to the lines on its thorax. Although commonly associated with boxelder trees, they are known to feed on other plants, especially during certain times of the year.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe insect's morphology—specifically its being a true bug with black coloration and distinct red/orange linear markings on the thorax and wing edges—is a definitive match for the Boxelder Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
