    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Visual Information**\n\n*   The image consists of two graphs, one above the other, both plotted against a horizontal axis that represents time.\n*   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We see a thin, horizontal blue line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the graph, this line is broken. At the exact moment of the break, there is a vertical, thicker, and more diffuse blue band. This vertical band represents a sound that contains a wide range of frequencies, such as a burst of white noise, a cough, or a static buzz. After this burst of noise, the original pure tone resumes. This graph represents the *physical* reality of the sound: a tone, followed by a noise, followed by the tone again.\n*   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, we see a regular, smooth, repeating patternâ€”a sine wave, which is the waveform of a pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the burst of noise. On the right, the sine wave resumes. This graph confirms the information from the spectrogram.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clues**\n\n*   **\"Illusion\":** The phenomenon is a perceptual illusion, meaning what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   **\"Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a famous optical illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in one of two different 3D orientations. The brain \"flips\" between these two stable perceptions. The analogy suggests that the auditory phenomenon in question also involves the brain resolving an ambiguity or an incomplete signal into a coherent perception.\n*   **\"Reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that the illusion is not just a laboratory curiosity but demonstrates a fundamental way our brain processes sensory information automatically in everyday life. This ability helps us make sense of a complex and often noisy world.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Phenomenon**\n\n*   We have an auditory stimulus where a sound (a tone) is physically replaced by a different, louder sound (noise).\n*   The illusion is that when people listen to this, they do not perceive a gap in the tone. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* \"behind\" the noise.\n*   The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, creating a continuous auditory stream. This is a powerful example of perceptual completion.\n*   This \"filling-in\" ability is crucial in real-world situations, like understanding someone speaking in a noisy room. If a car horn honks while someone is talking, our brain can often \"restore\" the speech sound that was masked by the horn, allowing us to understand the sentence.\n*   This specific auditory illusion, where a missing speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence is perceptually restored when replaced by a noise, was famously studied and named by Richard M. Warren.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe phenomenon described and illustrated is the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Although the image uses a simple tone instead of a speech phoneme, it depicts the fundamental principle of the illusion. The brain's tendency to perceive continuity over fragmentation is the core of the effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
