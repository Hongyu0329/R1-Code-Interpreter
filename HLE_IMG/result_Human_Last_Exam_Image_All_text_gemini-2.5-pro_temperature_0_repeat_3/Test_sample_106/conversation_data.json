    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, specifically friedelan-3β-ol. The conditions are catalytic hydrochloric acid (cat. HCl) and high temperature (110 °C). These conditions promote the formation of a carbocation followed by elimination and rearrangement. The product is a rearranged alkene with the chemical formula C30H50, which is consistent with the loss of one molecule of water (H2O) from the starting material (C30H52O).\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe mechanism involves three main stages:\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 is protonated by the acid to form a good leaving group, -OH2+. This group departs as a water molecule, leaving a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement (Backbone Rearrangement):** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a cascade of [1,2]-shifts of methyl groups (methanide shifts) and hydrogen atoms (hydride shifts) to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This process, known as a backbone rearrangement, moves the positive charge across the ring system.\n3.  **Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade terminates when the carbocation is in a suitable position for a proton to be eliminated from an adjacent carbon, forming a stable alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the [1,2]-Shifts and Track the Substituents**\nLet's trace the sequence of shifts and see how the substituents at the numbered positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) change. The numbered positions correspond to the following carbons in the standard triterpenoid numbering system: 1 is on C-4, 2 is on C-10, 3 is on C-9, 4 is on C-8, and 5 is on C-14.\n\n*   **Initial State (Starting Material):**\n    *   Position 1 (on C-4): CH3\n    *   Position 2 (on C-10): CH3\n    *   Position 3 (on C-9): H\n    *   Position 4 (on C-8): CH3\n    *   Position 5 (on C-14): CH3\n\n*   **The Rearrangement Cascade:**\n    1.  A carbocation forms at C-3.\n    2.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-4 to C-3. This forms a tertiary carbocation at C-4. The methyl group at position 1 is not the one that shifts; it remains at C-4.\n    3.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-5 to C-4, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-5.\n    4.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-10 (Position 2) to C-5. The carbocation is now at C-10. The original substituent at Position 2 has moved.\n    5.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-9 (Position 3) to C-10 (Position 2). The carbocation is now at C-9. Position 2 now has a hydrogen atom. The original substituent at Position 3 has moved.\n    6.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-8 (Position 4) to C-9 (Position 3). The carbocation is now at C-8. Position 3 now has a methyl group. The original substituent at Position 4 has moved.\n    7.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-14 (Position 5) to C-8 (Position 4). The carbocation is now at C-14. Position 4 now has a methyl group. The original substituent at Position 5 has moved.\n    8.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-13 to C-14 (Position 5). The carbocation is now at C-13. Position 5 now has a hydrogen atom.\n    9.  Finally, a proton is eliminated from an adjacent carbon (C-12 or C-18) to form a stable double bond. The product shown has the double bond between C-13 and C-18, which results from the elimination of a proton from C-18.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Substituents**\nBased on the migration sequence, we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position.\n\n*   **Position 1 (C-4):** The methyl group at this position did not participate in the rearrangement.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2 (C-10):** The original methyl group migrated away, and a hydrogen atom from C-9 migrated in.\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3 (C-9):** The original hydrogen atom migrated away, and a methyl group from C-8 migrated in.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4 (C-8):** The original methyl group migrated away, and a methyl group from C-14 migrated in.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n*   **Position 5 (C-14):** The original methyl group migrated away, and a hydrogen atom from C-13 migrated in.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\nThe analysis of the well-established backbone rearrangement mechanism for this transformation leads to the following identities for the substituents at the specified positions.\n\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
