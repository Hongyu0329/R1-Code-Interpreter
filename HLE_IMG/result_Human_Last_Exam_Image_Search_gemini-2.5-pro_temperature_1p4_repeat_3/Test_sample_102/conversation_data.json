    "The reaction shown is a classic example of an **Oxy-Cope rearrangement**. This is a type of pericyclic reaction, specifically a-sigmatropic rearrangement, which is followed by a tautomerization step.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Identification of the Reactant:** The starting material is a 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene. The core structure required for a Cope rearrangement (`C=C-C-C-C=C`) is present, with one double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the other in the side chain. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is at the crucial C-3 position (the carbon on the ring bearing the OH group), which makes this an Oxy-Cope rearrangement.\n2.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** Upon heating, the molecule undergoes a concerted rearrangement. The sigma bond between the C-3 and C-4 of the 1,5-diene system breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between C-1 and C-6. Simultaneously, the two pi bonds shift their positions. This forms an enol intermediate.\n3.  **Keto-Enol Tautomerization:** The enol intermediate formed is generally unstable and rapidly tautomerizes to the much more stable keto form. The `C(OH)=C` (enol) group becomes a `C(=O)-CH` (ketone) group. This tautomerization is the thermodynamic driving force that makes the Oxy-Cope rearrangement effectively irreversible.\n\nThe resulting product is a cyclohexanone ring where the side chain has been rearranged and is now attached at the gamma-position (C-3) relative to the newly formed carbonyl group.\n\nThe final product has the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexanone parent ring.\n*   A substituent at position 3 of the ring.\n*   The substituent is the rearranged side chain, which is a **(4-methoxybut-3-en-2-yl)** group.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **3-(4-methoxybut-3-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone**.\n\n<<<3-(4-methoxybut-3-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone>>>"
