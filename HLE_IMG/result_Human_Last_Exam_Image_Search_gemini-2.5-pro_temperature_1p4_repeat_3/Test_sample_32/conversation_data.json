    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the curvature of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has capsules on a short, **straight** seta.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name suggests, is characterized by a capsule on a curved or **arcuate** seta.\n\nThis distinct difference in the orientation of the seta—straight versus curved—is the most straightforward way to tell the two species apart when their sporophytes are present. The image provided shows capsules on what appear to be curved setae, which is characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
