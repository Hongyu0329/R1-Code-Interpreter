    "The plant in the image is a cultivar of *Clerodendrum trichotomum*, likely the 'Carnival' variety, which is known for its distinctively veined leaves. The species itself, commonly known as harlequin glorybower or peanut butter tree, is not endemic to a single island. Its native range is quite broad, encompassing several countries in East Asia, including China, India, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Japan.\n\nWhile the species has a wide distribution, a particular variant is noted to be naturally found on a specific island. The 'White Ibis' variant of *Clerodendrum trichotomum* was discovered on Sado-ga-Shima Island in Japan, and it appears to grow naturally only on this island. Additionally, another variety is found in southern Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.\n\nTherefore, while the species *Clerodendrum trichotomum* is native to a wide region, specific variations of the plant can be traced to particular islands in Japan.\n\n<<<Japan>>>"
