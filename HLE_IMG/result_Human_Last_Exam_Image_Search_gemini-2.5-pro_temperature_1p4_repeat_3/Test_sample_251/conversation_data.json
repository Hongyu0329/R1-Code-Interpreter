    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper. As indicated on the strip and by standard practice, the paper speed is 25 mm/sec. This means that each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.20 seconds. The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves, the highest peaks in the QRS complex.\n\nUpon visual inspection of the entire rhythm strip, a significant pause is evident in the fourth row, which starts around the time mark `0:06:08`. This pause between two heartbeats is visibly longer than any other on the strip.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval:\n*   **Identify the R-waves** bracketing the longest pause.\n*   **Measure the distance** between the peaks of these two R-waves by counting the number of small squares.\n*   The interval spans approximately 43 small squares.\n*   **Convert the measurement to time** by multiplying the number of small squares by the time value of each square: 43 small squares × 0.04 seconds/square = 1.72 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, using the large squares for estimation, the interval covers approximately 8.6 large squares. The calculation would be: 8.6 large squares × 0.20 seconds/square = 1.72 seconds.\n\n<<<1.72>>>"
