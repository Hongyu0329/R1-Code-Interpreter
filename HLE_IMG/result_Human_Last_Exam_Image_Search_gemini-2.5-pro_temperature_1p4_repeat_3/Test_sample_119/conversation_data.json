    "### Analysis Summary\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectra (MS, IR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC), the structure of the unknown compound has been determined.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z 135 indicates a molecular weight of 135 g/mol. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, most likely one.\n2.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** Analysis of all spectra leads to the molecular formula C₉H₁₃N, which has a molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol, consistent with the MS data. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is calculated to be 4.\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Peaks at ~3050 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of aromatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Peaks around 1600 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂) is indicated by N-H stretching bands around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ and a bending vibration near 1600 cm⁻¹.\n4.  **NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Shows 7 distinct carbon signals.\n        *   Four signals in the aromatic region (δ 126.3, 127.3, 128.5, 145.1), which corresponds to a monosubstituted benzene ring. The peak at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon.\n        *   Three signals in the aliphatic region (δ 19.2, 43.5, 49.6).\n    *   **DEPT-135:** Confirms one CH₂ group (negative signal), and five CH or CH₃ groups (positive signals). The CH₂ corresponds to the signal at δ 43.5. The five positive signals correspond to the three aromatic CH groups and two aliphatic groups (one CH and one CH₃).\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   A multiplet at ~7.2 ppm integrating to 5H, confirming a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n        *   A multiplet for 2H at ~2.85 ppm.\n        *   A multiplet for 1H at ~2.7 ppm.\n        *   A doublet for 3H at ~1.2 ppm, indicating a methyl group adjacent to a single proton (CH).\n    *   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates the proton and carbon signals:\n        *   The 3H doublet at 1.2 ppm correlates to the carbon at 19.2 ppm (the -CH₃ group).\n        *   The 1H multiplet at ~2.7 ppm correlates to the carbon at 49.6 ppm (the -CH(N)- group).\n        *   The 2H multiplet at ~2.85 ppm correlates to the carbon at 43.5 ppm (the benzylic -CH₂- group).\n        *   The 5H aromatic protons correlate to the aromatic carbons between 126-129 ppm.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nThe data pieces are assembled as follows:\n*   Fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a benzylic methylene group (-CH₂-), a methine group bearing an amine (-CH(NH₂)-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   Connectivity: The splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR (specifically the CH₃ doublet) and the chemical shifts confirm the structure is a propyl chain with a phenyl group on one end and an amine on the adjacent carbon.\n*   Final Structure: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is determined by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). This is a three-carbon (propane) chain. Numbering starts from the end closer to the amine group, placing it at position 2. A phenyl group is a substituent at position 1.\n\nThe spectroscopic data found in literature for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine) is consistent with the data provided. For example, reported ¹³C NMR shifts in DMSO-d6 are 140.6, 129.6, 128.6, 126.3, 48.8, 46.8, 23.8, which are comparable to the provided values, accounting for solvent differences. Similarly, the ¹H NMR data from various sources align with the observed spectra.\n\n<<<1-Phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
