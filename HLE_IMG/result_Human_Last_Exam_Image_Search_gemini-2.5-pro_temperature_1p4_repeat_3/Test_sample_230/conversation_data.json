    "The title of the painting is **The Mill**.\n\nThis iconic work was painted by the Dutch artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn around 1645-1648. It is currently housed in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe painting is renowned for its dramatic depiction of a windmill silhouetted against a dark and stormy sky. Nineteenth-century art lovers particularly admired the romantic and atmospheric quality of the scene. While the painting itself is from the 17th century, its significant appreciation and influence during the 19th century may be why it was perceived as being from that later period.\n\n\"The Mill\" portrays a post-mill situated on a bastion, overlooking a body of water. The dramatic use of light and shadow, with the last rays of sun illuminating parts of the sky and the mill, creates a powerful and evocative scene. The painting's composition, featuring the windmill as a commanding presence against the turbulent sky, has made it one of Rembrandt's most celebrated landscapes.\n\nA restoration of the painting between 1977 and 1979 removed layers of darkened varnish, revealing a cooler-toned sky with blue and gray hues that had been obscured for many years. Despite some historical debate over its attribution, it is widely accepted as a work by Rembrandt.\n\n<<<The Mill>>>"
