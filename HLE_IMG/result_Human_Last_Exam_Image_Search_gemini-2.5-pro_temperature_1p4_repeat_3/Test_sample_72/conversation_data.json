    "The user wants me to identify the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in the transformation shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reactants and the product.**\n- **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (a six-membered aromatic ring with six fluorine atoms) and cyclobutene (a four-membered ring with one double bond).\n- **Product:** A fused bicyclic system. It appears that the cyclobutene has added across the benzene ring, and the benzene ring itself has undergone a change. The final product has a cyclobutene ring fused to a cyclohexadiene ring. The stereochemistry of the hydrogens and fluorines is depicted.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a plausible reaction sequence.**\n- The reaction is initiated by light (hv), which suggests photochemical processes.\n- The overall transformation likely doesn't happen in a single step. It's stated that two pericyclic reactions occur.\n- **Reaction 1:** A cycloaddition seems likely between the two reactant molecules. A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition is a common pericyclic reaction. In this case, it would be a [2π+2π] cycloaddition between the double bond of cyclobutene and one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene. This would form a four-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n- **Intermediate:** The product of a [2+2] cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene would be a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative. Let's see if this intermediate can lead to the final product.\n- **Reaction 2:** The intermediate formed from the initial cycloaddition is a conjugated diene system within the original benzene ring, which is now a cyclohexadiene ring. This intermediate is bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This molecule can also be viewed as a derivative of \"Dewar benzene\". Dewar benzene itself can undergo an electrocyclic reaction. An electrocyclic reaction is a pericyclic reaction that involves the cyclization of a conjugated π-system to form a ring by converting a π-bond to a σ-bond. Specifically, Dewar benzene is known to photochemically isomerize. The reaction here seems to be the reverse, an electrocyclic ring opening. However, the initial hexafluorobenzene can first isomerize to its Dewar isomer, hexafluoro Dewar benzene. This is a known photochemical reaction. This is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\n- Let's re-evaluate the sequence.\n\n**Alternative Sequence:**\n- **Reaction 1: Photochemical electrocyclic reaction of hexafluorobenzene.** Under UV light, hexafluorobenzene can undergo a 4π electrocyclic ring-closing reaction to form hexafluoro Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a well-documented photochemical isomerization. This creates a strained, non-aromatic diene.\n- **Reaction 2: Cycloaddition of hexafluoro Dewar benzene with cyclobutene.** The highly strained hexafluoro Dewar benzene now acts as a dienophile and could react with cyclobutene. Wait, Dewar benzene is a diene. It could react with cyclobutene (as a dienophile) in a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. Let's check the product structure. The product has a six-membered ring and two four-membered rings fused together. A Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring.\n- Let's look at the product again. It's a tricycle. It has two fused four-membered rings and a six-membered ring containing a double bond.\n- Let's reconsider the first proposed sequence.\n\n**Revisiting the First Sequence:**\n- **Reaction 1: [2+2] cycloaddition.** Hexafluorobenzene reacts with cyclobutene. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed. The addition occurs between one of the π-bonds of benzene and the π-bond of cyclobutene. This would create a four-membered ring fused to a cyclohexadiene ring. The intermediate is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. The double bonds in the six-membered ring are conjugated.\n- **Intermediate:** Let's call it Intermediate A. It is a substituted 1,3-cyclohexadiene system fused to a cyclobutane ring. Specifically, it would be a tetrafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene.\n- Let's re-examine the image carefully. The reaction is between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n- Wait, I misidentified the product in the initial glance. The product is **not** a fusion of a cyclobutene and a cyclohexadiene. The product shown is the result of addition across the 1,4-positions of the hexafluorobenzene ring by the cyclobutene. This would be a [4+2] cycloaddition. However, photochemical [4+2] cycloadditions are generally less common than [2+2] ones. More importantly, the connectivity in the product shows a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene derivative, which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's look at the product very carefully again.\n- It is a tricyclic structure.\n- It has a central six-membered ring.\n- Fused to this are two four-membered rings.\n- One four-membered ring comes from the cyclobutene reactant.\n- Where does the other four-membered ring come from?\n\n**Aha! This suggests a valence isomerization of the benzene ring itself.**\n1.  **Reaction 1: Photochemical [4π] Electrocyclic Reaction.** Hexafluorobenzene, upon photochemical excitation, undergoes an electrocyclic reaction. Specifically, it's a ring-closing reaction involving 4 π-electrons to form hexafluoro Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a known photochemical valence isomerization. Dewar benzene contains two cyclobutene rings fused together and has two double bonds. It is a strained but isolable compound.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition.** The hexafluoro Dewar benzene, which is a strained diene, then reacts with the cyclobutene molecule. A [2π+2π] cycloaddition occurs between one of the double bonds of the hexafluoro Dewar benzene and the double bond of the cyclobutene. This joins the two molecules and creates a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final tricyclic product.\n\nLet's verify this mechanism:\n- **Starting Materials:** Hexafluorobenzene + Cyclobutene.\n- **Step 1 (Electrocyclic):** Hexafluorobenzene --(hv)--> Hexafluoro Dewar Benzene. This is a 4π electrocyclic reaction. Under photochemical conditions, a 4n π-electron system (like the 4π system here involving two double bonds of benzene para to each other) undergoes a disrotatory ring closure.\n- **Step 2 (Cycloaddition):** Hexafluoro Dewar Benzene + Cyclobutene --(hv)--> Final Product. This is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. Photochemically, a [2πs + 2πs] (suprafacial-suprafacial) cycloaddition is allowed. This would involve one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of the cyclobutene, forming a cyclobutane ring linking the two moieties. The resulting product structure matches the one shown in the image. It is a tricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]decene derivative.\n\nSo, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  A **4π electrocyclic reaction** (valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar isomer).\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between the Dewar benzene intermediate and cyclobutene.\n\nBoth are photochemically allowed processes. The problem statement explicitly says two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. This proposed sequence fits perfectly.The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Analyzing the starting materials and the final product reveals a two-step process:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its highly strained isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction, which is photochemically allowed. This transformation converts the aromatic ring into a bicyclic structure containing two cyclobutene rings fused together.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step is a photochemical [2π+2π] cycloaddition between the hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. One of the double bonds of the strained Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered (cyclobutane) ring. This type of cycloaddition is also photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[4π] Electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
