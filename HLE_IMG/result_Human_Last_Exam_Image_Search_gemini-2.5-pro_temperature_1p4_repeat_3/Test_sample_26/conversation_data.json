    "The chord in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp. This chord functions as a secondary dominant, specifically the dominant of the dominant.\n\nTo determine the Roman numeral, follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the home key:** The sonata's first movement is in C minor.\n2.  **Identify the dominant key:** The dominant of C minor is G major. In Roman numerals, the dominant is represented by \"V\".\n3.  **Identify the chord in measure 30:** The chord is G-B(♮)-D-F(♯). This is a G dominant 7th chord. In a standard G7, the seventh would be F-natural. The F-sharp is a chromatic alteration. However, this chord strongly leads to the dominant chord of the home key. More accurately, the notes G, B-natural, and D form a G major triad, which is the V chord. The F-sharp acts as a leading tone to G.\n4.  **Analyze the harmonic function:** The G7 chord is functioning as the dominant chord of the home key, C minor. The strong pull to the C minor chord that follows in the subsequent measures confirms its dominant function. In the context of C minor, a G major chord (G-B♮-D) is the dominant. Therefore, the chord is V. The addition of the F-natural would make it a V7. The F-sharp in this measure is a chromatic passing tone leading to the G in the next measure.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for the harmony in measure 30 is V (the dominant).\n\n<<<V>>>"
