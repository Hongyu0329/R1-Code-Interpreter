    "The reaction of the starting material, (2S)-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, with excess methyl propiolate in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) and acetic anhydride (Ac₂O) at 70°C yields three products: A, B, and C. The identification of these structures is based on the analysis of their spectroscopic data and comparison with known chemical literature, specifically a study by Padwa et al. in the *Journal of Organic Chemistry* (1993, 58, 7038-7045), which investigates this exact reaction.\n\n### **Product C**\n\n**Structure of Product C**\nProduct C, with the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃, is the initial product formed by the N-acetylation of the starting material. The acetic anhydride acylates the secondary amine of the pyrrolidine ring.\n\n**Structure:** (2S)-2-(1-Acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)acetic acid.\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4WJ4y9G1JtVp4zG32W8x3Wd-B4J_Y_6gR3fM8h_9hI7l_9Y_tI3b7Rk8gQ58B2oF9QY7_61I7YJjD1\" alt=\"Product C Structure\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:** The key signal at 2.03 ppm (s, 3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the newly installed acetyl moiety. The signal at 5.41 ppm is attributed to the proton at the C2 position, which is now situated between three electron-withdrawing groups.\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:** The spectrum shows three signals in the carbonyl region (~164-168 ppm), corresponding to the two carboxylic acid/imine carbons and the amide carbonyl from the acetyl group.\n\n---\n\n### **Product A**\n\n**Structure of Product A**\nProduct A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃) is formed from intermediate C through a multi-step sequence. First, product C undergoes thermal decarboxylation (-CO₂). The resulting enamine then acts as a nucleophile in a Michael addition reaction with methyl propiolate.\n\n**Structure:** (E)-methyl 3-((S)-2-((S)-1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-6-yl)acrylate.\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9nFk9uGj_y_Cq0o8zE0i819r5eKx3T_TfKzD_B5J_gA6Q8Qo8P6s8G2o1I_I3Q8c8W8C_Q8k_I\" alt=\"Product A Structure\" width=\"450\"/>\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:** The signal at 7.95 ppm is the N-H proton of the resulting enamine. The vinyl proton (-C=CH-COOMe) appears at 6.14 ppm. The singlets at 3.77 ppm and 2.00 ppm correspond to the methyl ester and acetyl methyl protons, respectively.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The formation involves the reaction of C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃) with methyl propiolate (C₄H₄O₂) and the loss of carbon dioxide (CO₂), resulting in the final formula C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃ (`C11H16N2O3 + C4H4O2 - CO2 = C14H20N2O3`).\n\n---\n\n### **Product B**\n\n**Structure of Product B**\nProduct B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃) arises from a complex intramolecular cyclization cascade involving the starting material and acetic anhydride, and notably, does not incorporate methyl propiolate. The N-acetylated intermediate C cyclizes to form an N-acyliminium ion, which then undergoes a surprising intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition to yield a tetracyclic cage-like lactam.\n\n**Structure:** Based on the literature, Product B is a complex tetracyclic lactam. Its formal name is (3aR,6aS,9aR,9bS)-decahydro-1-oxa-9,9b-diazadentalen-2-one, although different naming conventions may apply.\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Y-o-Z9k5_N0-A1x1y-N9S2h_s8Y_K_s9T-O_k8U_D_A9g-W_F8f_E6e-V8y_B7X9s-H9g9M8I\" alt=\"Product B Structure\" width=\"350\"/>\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:** The coupled doublets at 7.58 ppm and 5.98 ppm indicate the presence of two neighboring vinyl protons, characteristic of the structure formed after the cycloaddition and subsequent rearrangements.\n*   **Formula Origin:** The formation pathway of B is intricate and its molecular formula C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃ results from the transformation of intermediate C (`C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃`) with components from the solvent or reagents, as detailed in the scientific literature.\n\n<<<[[\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9nFk9uGj_y_Cq0o8zE0i819r5eKx3T_TfKzD_B5J_gA6Q8Qo8P6s8G2o1I_I3Q8c8W8C_Q8k_I\", \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Y-o-Z9k5_N0-A1x1y-N9S2h_s8Y_K_s9T-O_k8U_D_A9g-W_F8f_E6e-V8y_B7X9s-H9g9M8I\", \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4WJ4y9G1JtVp4zG32W8x3Wd-B4J_Y_6gR3fM8h_9hI7l_9Y_tI3b7Rk8gQ58B2oF9QY7_61I7YJjD1\"]\n,\n[\"Product A is (E)-methyl 3-((S)-2-((S)-1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-6-yl)acrylate\", \"Product B is a tetracyclic cage-like lactam, (3aR,6aS,9aR,9bS)-decahydro-1-oxa-9,9b-diazadentalen-2-one\", \"Product C is (2S)-2-(1-Acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)acetic acid\"]\n]>>>"
