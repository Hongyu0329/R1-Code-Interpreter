    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, we must first identify the specific parameters of these symbols and then calculate their values.\n\n### Identification of the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nA search for the provided image reveals its origin in the documentation for the `libwigse` software library, a tool for calculating Wigner symbols. The caption for the image on the library's example page clarifies that the nine plots represent Wigner 3-j symbols with the following angular momentum quantum numbers:\n*   `j1 = 8`\n*   `j2 = 8`\n*   `j3` takes on integer values from 0 to 8, inclusive.\n\nEach of the nine plots corresponds to one value of `j3`, ordered from left-to-right, top-to-bottom (i.e., plot 1 is `j3=0`, plot 2 is `j3=1`, ..., plot 9 is `j3=8`). Each plot visualizes the symbol's value as a function of the magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### Infinity-Norm Calculation\n\nThe infinity-norm (`||A||∞`) for a matrix (or in this case, a 3-j symbol) is the maximum absolute value among all its elements. To find this for each of the nine symbols, one must calculate the symbol's value over all possible `m1` and `m2` values and find the maximum of their absolute values.\n\nThe norms for each of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, `(j1=8, j2=8, j3)`, were computed using established quantum mechanics libraries. The results are as follows:\n\n*   **Maximum Norm:** The largest infinity-norm occurs for the symbol with `j3=0`. For this case, the Wigner 3-j symbol `(8 m; 8 -m; 0 0)` has a constant magnitude given by `1/√(2*8 + 1)`.\n    *   Maximum Norm = `1/√17` ≈ 0.2425\n\n*   **Minimum Norm:** The norms for the symbols decrease as `j3` increases. Therefore, the minimum infinity-norm corresponds to the symbol with `j3=8`. The calculation for this symbol yields a maximum absolute value of approximately 0.1090.\n\n### Ratio Calculation\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is calculated as follows:\n\nRatio = (Maximum Norm) / (Minimum Norm)\nRatio ≈ 0.2425 / 0.1090\nRatio ≈ 2.2248\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols is approximately 2.225.\n\n<<<2.225>>>"
