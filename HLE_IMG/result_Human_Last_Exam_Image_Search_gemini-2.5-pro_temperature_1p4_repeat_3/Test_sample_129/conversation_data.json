    "This image displays the solution structure of the Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier 1, also known as SUMO-1.\n\nThis particular structure is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID 1A5R. SUMO-1 is a type of ubiquitin-like protein that can be attached to other proteins in a process called SUMOylation. This modification plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nuclear transport, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction.\n\nThe protein shown is from *Homo sapiens* and consists of a single chain of 103 amino acids. In the image, the ribbon diagram illustrates the backbone of the protein and highlights its secondary structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The protein has a total structural weight of approximately 11.72 kDa.\n\nDefects in the SUMO1 gene can be the cause of non-syndromic orofacial cleft type 10, a birth defect characterized by a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.\n\n<<<Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier 1 (SUMO-1)>>>"
