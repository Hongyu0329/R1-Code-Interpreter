    "Based on distinct sexual dimorphism characteristics, the biological sexes for the paired insects can be determined.\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left is a male cuckoo bee of the genus *Coelioxys*, identifiable by the multiple prongs or spines at the tip of its abdomen. The insect on the right is a female cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. While sex differentiation can be difficult without microscopic examination, female cuckoo bees are generally more robust and lack the specialized abdominal tip of the males. Female *Coelioxys* have a distinctly sharp, pointed abdomen, which is different from what is seen on the left. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. In many *Polistes* species, males have distinctly yellower faces and antennae with curled tips, whereas females have darker facial markings and straighter antennae. The wasp on the left has a darker face and straight antennae, characteristic of a female. The wasp on the right has a predominantly yellow face, indicating it is a male. Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees from the tribe Eucerini, likely genus *Melissodes* or *Eucera*. This group exhibits extreme sexual dimorphism. The bee on the left is a male, identified by its characteristically long antennae and yellow patch on its face (clypeus). The bee on the right has much shorter antennae and a dark face, which are typical features of a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n3, 4, 3\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
