    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element Uranium.\n\nEach element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts like a fingerprint. When an element is heated or has an electrical current passed through it, it emits light at specific wavelengths, creating a series of colored lines. The provided image displays a complex spectrum with numerous lines across the blue, green, yellow, and red wavelengths. This pattern is characteristic of heavy elements with many electrons.\n\nBy comparing the provided image with known emission spectra, a clear match is found with the emission spectrum of Uranium. Scientific sources confirm that Uranium has a complex emission spectrum with many lines, including a strong emission line at 591.5 nm in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum, which is visible in the image. The overall pattern of lines shown in the image is consistent with the documented emission spectrum for Uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
