    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will analyze the reaction sequence step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\nLet's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbons in the bicyclic ring system, 1 carbon in the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group, and 8 carbons in the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group (C₆H₄ + CH₂ + OCH₃), for a total of 6 + 1 + 8 = 15 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** There are 5 hydrogens on the bicyclic core (at positions C1, C4, C6, and two at C7), and 9 hydrogens in the PMB group (4 on the benzene ring, 2 in the CH₂ group, and 3 in the OCH₃ group), for a total of 5 + 9 = 14 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the CF₃ group.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the bicyclic ring.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** There is 1 oxygen atom in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the ring and 1 oxygen atom in the methoxy group of the PMB substituent, for a total of 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\nThe first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed from the nitrogen atom, and a hydrogen atom is added in its place.\n*   **Change in formula:** Subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and add one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1 formula:** C(₁₅₋₈)H(₁₄₋₉+₁)F₃NO(₂₋₁) = **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\nThe second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). This process involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   **Change in formula:** Add two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Intermediate 2 formula:** C₇H(₆+₂)F₃NO = **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\nThe final step involves heating Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). During hydrolysis, the amide bond (C-N) within the ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H₂O). This opens the ring to form an amino acid.\n*   **Change in formula:** Add the atoms of one water molecule (H₂O).\n*   **Product formula:** C₇H(₈+₂)F₃NO(₁+₁) = **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclopentane containing a carboxylic acid group and an amino group.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
