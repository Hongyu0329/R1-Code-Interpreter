    "The \"X Y\" is a **felt hat**.\n\nHere's how the clues connect:\n\n*   **Pictured at an event:** The image displays the presentation of a Martín Fierro Award, the premier honor for Argentine television and radio. The statuette itself is of the award's namesake, the gaucho Martín Fierro. Gauchos, the cowboys of the South American Pampas, traditionally wore hats made of wool felt. Therefore, a \"felt hat\" (as worn by the gaucho statuette) is pictured at the event.\n*   **Toxicity of mercury salts:** The process of making felt hats historically involved using mercury nitrate to treat beaver or rabbit fur. This method, known as \"carroting,\" made the fur easier to felt but released toxic mercury fumes. The resulting mercury poisoning led to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease,\" characterized by tremors and confusion. This production method has almost entirely ceased, replaced by safer alternatives like hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThus, one \"felt hat\" is represented by the award statuette in the image, while the process for making another type of \"felt hat\" has been discontinued due to the dangers of mercury.\n\n<<<felt hat>>>"
