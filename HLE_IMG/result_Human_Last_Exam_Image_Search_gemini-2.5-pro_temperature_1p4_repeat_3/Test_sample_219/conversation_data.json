    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts of neuronal activity are identified at the following approximate timestamps: 9 s, 18 s, 27 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n*   Interval 1: 18 s - 9 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 2: 27 s - 18 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 3: 36 s - 27 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 4: 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of these values:\n(9 + 9 + 9 + 13) / 4 = 40 / 4 = 10 s.\n\nTo two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 10 s.\n<<<10>>>"
