    "Yes, the animal in the image is a type of long-horned beetle. Based on its coloration and markings, it is most likely a female *Stenurella melanura*.\n\nThis species, part of the Cerambycidae family, exhibits significant color differences between sexes. The females have reddish elytra (wing cases), while the males typically have yellowish-brown elytra with a black tip. The insect in the photo has a black head and thorax with reddish-orange elytra that have a black line along the suture where the wings meet, which is characteristic of a female *Stenurella melanura*.\n\nCommonly known as the black-striped longhorn beetle, this insect is widespread throughout most of Europe and parts of Asia. The adults are typically found on flowers from May to September, feeding on nectar and pollen. Their larvae develop in the decaying wood of various deciduous and coniferous trees.\n\n<<<Stenurella melanura>>>"
