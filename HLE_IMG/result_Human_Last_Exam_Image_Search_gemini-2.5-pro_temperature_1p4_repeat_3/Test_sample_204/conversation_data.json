    "Based on visual identification and knowledge of mineral structures, the specimens are ordered below by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen's olive-green color and granular aggregate form are characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by cations. This represents the least complex silicate structure.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Augite (a Pyroxene)**\n    This dark, blocky, prismatic crystal is identified as augite, a member of the pyroxene group. Pyroxenes are inosilicates characterized by single chains of silica tetrahedra. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Chlorite/Mica**\n    The flaky, green, and platy appearance is characteristic of sheet silicates like mica or chlorite. These minerals, known as phyllosilicates, have a structure where tetrahedra are linked to form two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure is more polymerized and complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    The translucency, vitreous luster, and crystal form are definitive characteristics of quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate, where every silica tetrahedron is bonded to four others, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and polymerized silicate structure among the specimens.\n\nThe order of increasing silicate structure complexity is from isolated tetrahedra, to single chains, to sheets, to a full framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct order for the specimens is:\n\n**C -> A -> B -> D**\n<<<C -> A -> B -> D>>>"
