    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and principles of organic chemistry, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **Reagent A is Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. The first step of the reaction shows the conversion of compound **1**, which contains a pyrylium-like ether linkage in its central cationic ring, into compound **2**. In compound **2**, this oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (-NH₂). This transformation of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a characteristic reaction with hydrazine.\n\n*   **Reagent B is Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. The second step involves the conversion of the N-aminoacridinium intermediate **2** into the quinacridinium product **3**. This transformation involves two key changes: the formation of a new six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom, and the loss of the terminal amino group from the acridinium nitrogen. The new ring is formed by a double nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, where an amine replaces two adjacent methoxy groups on one of the aromatic rings. Since product **3** contains a propyl group attached to this new nitrogen atom, the amine used must be propylamine.\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine and Reagent B is propylamine.>>>"
