    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis fragment is part of a larger runestone located in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. It is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled around 1036-1041.\n\nThe identification is confirmed by a matching image in a research paper on the Ingvar runestones, which explicitly labels the photograph as Sö 281. The distinct grid pattern and the specific rune forms in the image are characteristic of this particular stone. The inscription on this fragment is part of a text that mentions Ingvar and Serkland (the land of the Saracens). The partial inscription on the stone reads: \"...had the monument made in memory of... Ulv's brother. They... with Ingvar in Serkland.\"\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
