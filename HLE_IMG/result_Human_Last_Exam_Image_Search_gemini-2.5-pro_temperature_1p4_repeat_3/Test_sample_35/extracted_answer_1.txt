Based on the provided information and supporting research, S100B binds with high affinity to the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an **adjunct marker**, due to its presence across multiple neurological conditions as an indicator of neural distress, and as a **prognostic marker**, because its levels often correlate with disease severity and progression by actively driving neuroinflammatory and degenerative pathways.
