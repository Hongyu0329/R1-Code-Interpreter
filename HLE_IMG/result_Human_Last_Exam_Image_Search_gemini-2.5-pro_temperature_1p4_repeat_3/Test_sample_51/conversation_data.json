    "The Ancient Greek word in the image is **μὴ θορυβηθῆναι**.\n\nThis is a negative infinitive phrase in Ancient Greek. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **μὴ (mḕ)**: This is a negative particle used to express prohibition or negation in contexts of will, desire, or condition. It essentially means \"not\". The accent is a grave accent.\n*   **θορυβηθῆναι (thorubēthēnai)**: This is the aorist passive infinitive of the verb *θορυβέω* (thorubéō). The verb means \"to make a noise or uproar,\" \"to be in confusion,\" or \"to be troubled or disturbed.\" The passive infinitive form, therefore, translates to \"to be disturbed,\" \"to be troubled,\" or \"to be thrown into confusion.\" The accent on this word is a circumflex over the eta.\n\nPutting it together, the phrase **μὴ θορυβηθῆναι** translates to **\"not to be disturbed\"** or **\"not to be troubled.\"** It is a common construction in Ancient and Byzantine Greek literature.\n\nThe script is a form of Greek minuscule, which became the standard book hand in Byzantine manuscripts from the 9th and 10th centuries onwards.\n\n<<<μὴ θορυβηθῆναι>>>"
