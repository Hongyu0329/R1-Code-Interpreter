    "The analysis of the electron ionization mass spectrum leads to the identification of the unknown compound through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is observed at 262, 264, and 266. The peak at m/z 262 represents the molecular ion (M⁺), indicating the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n\n2.  **Isotopic Pattern:** The relative intensities of the peaks at m/z 262 (29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%) show a ratio approximately consistent with the 9:6:1 pattern expected for a compound containing two chlorine atoms. This confirms the presence of two chlorine atoms in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula:** Assuming the molecule consists of carbon, hydrogen, and two chlorine atoms, the mass of the non-chlorine portion can be calculated. Using the mass of the most common chlorine isotope (³⁵Cl), the remaining mass is 262 - (2 * 35) = 192 u. The most plausible combination of carbon and hydrogen for a mass of 192 u is C₁₅H₁₂ (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = 192). This leads to a proposed molecular formula of **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**. This formula has been confirmed for a compound with a molecular ion peak at m/z 262.\n\n4.  **Major Fragmentation Peaks:**\n    *   **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak is at m/z 225. This corresponds to a loss of 37 units from the molecular ion (262 - 225 = 37).\n    *   **Peak at m/z 227:** This prominent peak (66.7% intensity) corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl) from the molecular ion (262 - 35 = 227), forming the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   The base peak at m/z 225 can be explained by the subsequent loss of two hydrogen atoms from the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment (227 - 2 = 225), forming a stable [M-Cl-H₂]⁺ ion.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 190:** This peak (48.4% intensity) corresponds to the loss of two molecules of HCl from the molecular ion (262 - 2*36 = 190). This suggests the formation of a stable, highly unsaturated C₁₅H₁₀ ion.\n\n5.  **Compound Identification and IUPAC Name:** The molecular formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ and the fragmentation pattern are consistent with a dichlorinated phenylpropene structure. One such compound identified in the literature with this exact mass is (E)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-phenylpropene.\n\nTherefore, the compound corresponding to the presented mass spectrum is:\n\n**<<< (E)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-phenylprop-1-ene>>>**"
