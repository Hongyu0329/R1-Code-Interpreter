    "The knot depicted in the image is the 8₁₉ knot in the Rolfsen table. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is a powerful integer-valued invariant for knots. For the 8₁₉ knot, this invariant is -6.\n\n### Knot Identification and Properties\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is a chiral, non-alternating knot with 8 crossings. Interestingly, it is also equivalent to the torus knot T(3,4) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). This knot has been a subject of study in various fields, including the synthesis of molecular knots.\n\n### The Rasmussen Invariant\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is derived from a more complex knot invariant known as Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot, which is a measure of how complex a surface is needed to \"cap off\" the knot in four-dimensional space. Specifically, the absolute value of the Rasmussen invariant divided by two is less than or equal to the slice genus.\n\nFor some classes of knots, the Rasmussen invariant has a more straightforward calculation. For an alternating knot, it is equal to the knot's signature. For a positive knot, `s(K)` is equal to twice its genus. Since the 8₁₉ knot is a torus knot T(3,4), which is a positive knot, its Rasmussen invariant can also be calculated using the formula `(p-1)(q-1)` for a torus knot T(p,q), though with careful attention to sign conventions which differ in literature. The value is listed as -6 in standard knot tables.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a significant tool in low-dimensional topology for distinguishing knots and understanding their properties in four dimensions.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
