Another concert, Shakey Graves: Movie Of The Week Tour 2023, took place on the same day in Spokane at the Knitting Factory.\n\nThe image provided is of the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington. The theater is home to the Spokane Symphony and hosts a variety of performances.\n\nA blog post reviewing live music in 2023 also mentions a concert by the band Metric on October 12, 2023, but this was at The Roxy in Los Angeles. There are no listings for a musical artist playing at the Martin Woldson Theater on that specific date other than the symphony's chamber event.\n\n<<<Spokane Symphony>>>"
