    "The figure leaving the chariot is one of Medea's murdered children.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure volute krater, dated to circa 340â€“330 BCE and attributed to the Darius Painter, depicts a scene from the myth of Medea. The scene is a variation of the story that has not survived in written form.\n\nIn the most famous version of the myth, by the playwright Euripides, the sorceress Medea takes revenge on her unfaithful husband, Jason, by murdering their two children and his new wife. She then escapes from Corinth in a chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios, often depicted as being drawn by dragons or serpents.\n\nOn this vase, the artist portrays the aftermath of the filicide. The woman in the ornate headdress inside the chariot is Medea. The figure on the ground, having fallen from the chariot, is one of her sons. The scene captures Medea's flight from Corinth, leaving her dead children behind. The artwork is noted for its depiction of a rare or alternative version of the Medea myth and is housed in the Princeton University Art Museum.\n\n<<<Medea's son>>>"
