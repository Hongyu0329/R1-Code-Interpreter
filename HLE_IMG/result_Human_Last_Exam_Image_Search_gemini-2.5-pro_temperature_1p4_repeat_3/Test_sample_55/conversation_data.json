    "An analysis of the chords in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, reveals a D major triad. The piece is in the key of D minor. In this context, the D major chord functions as a secondary dominant.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor. The tonic chord is D minor (notes D-F-A), represented by the Roman numeral `i`.\n*   **Circled Chord:** The notes in measure 8 are D, F-sharp, and A. This forms a D major triad. In a minor key, a major chord built on the tonic is labeled with a capital Roman numeral, `I`.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This D major chord does not function as a point of rest. Instead, it creates tension that resolves to the G minor chord in the following measure. The G minor chord is the subdominant (iv) in the key of D minor. A chord that acts as the dominant of another diatonic chord is called a secondary dominant. The D major chord is the dominant of G minor, and is therefore best described as the \"dominant of the subdominant,\" notated as V/iv.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes is V/iv.\n<<<V/iv>>>"
