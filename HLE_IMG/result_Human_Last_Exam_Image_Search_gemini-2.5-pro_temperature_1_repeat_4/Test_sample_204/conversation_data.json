    "### Specimen Identification and Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nBased on the visual characteristics of the four specimens, they are identified and ordered below according to the increasing complexity of their silicate mineral structure. The complexity progresses from isolated silica tetrahedra to single chains, then to sheets, and finally to a three-dimensional framework.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen displays a granular, olive-green mass of crystals, which is a classic appearance for olivine. Olivine is a *nesosilicate*, which has the simplest silicate structure consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by ions like iron and magnesium.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene**\n    Specimen A is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This form is typical for minerals in the pyroxene group, such as augite or diopside. Pyroxenes are *inosilicates* characterized by single chains of silica tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares two oxygen atoms. This represents the next level of complexity after isolated tetrahedra.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica (or Chlorite)**\n    The thin, flaky, sheet-like appearance and greenish color of specimen B are characteristic of a mica group mineral, like muscovite or biotite, or the closely related mineral chlorite. These minerals are *phyllosilicates*, or sheet silicates. Their structure consists of two-dimensional sheets of tetrahedra, with each tetrahedron sharing three of its four oxygen atoms with others in the sheet. This sheet structure is more complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This transparent to translucent, brownish crystal with a vitreous luster is identifiable as quartz. Quartz is a *tectosilicate*, or framework silicate. In this structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong and complex three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures presented here.\n\n### Final Order of Increasing Silicate Complexity:\n\nC → A → B → D\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
