    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot in the Rolfsen table. This knot is also known as the (3,4) torus knot.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a numerical value assigned to a knot that provides information about its four-dimensional properties. For the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **-6**. This value is derived from the knot's Khovanov homology, a more complex knot invariant. The signature of the 8₁₉ knot is also -6.\n\n<<< -6 >>>"
