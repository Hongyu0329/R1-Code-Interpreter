    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is **V**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The movement is in C minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord (i):** The tonic chord is C minor (C-E♭-G). This is firmly established in measure 29.\n*   **Dominant Chord (V):** In the key of C minor, the dominant chord is G major (G-B♮-D). The B is raised to a B-natural to create a leading tone that resolves up to the tonic note, C.\n*   **Analysis of Measure 30:** This measure is built over a G in the bass, which is the dominant note. The right hand plays highly chromatic and decorative figures. While the collection of notes includes non-chord tones like C# and F#, the underlying harmony functions as a dominant chord. One analysis refers to this section (mm. 27-34) as showing \"broken V chords that determine c minor key\". Another source identifies a chromatic chord with an augmented 6th interval in measure 30, which is a specific type of pre-dominant or dominant-preparation chord that strongly leads to the dominant. Regardless of the specific label for the complex chromaticism, its function is to prolong and intensify the dominant harmony.\n*   **Context of Surrounding Measures:** Measure 30 leads directly into measure 31, which presents a clear and powerful G major chord (V). Therefore, measure 30 serves as a dramatic and tension-filled preparation for, and part of, the dominant harmony.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental harmony of measure 30 is the dominant, making **V** the correct Roman numeral.\n\n<<<V>>>"
