    "The sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of the opera **Elektra** by Richard Strauss.\n\nSeveral key details in the score lead to this identification:\n*   **Instrumentation**: The large and specific orchestration, including parts for 2 grand flutes (\"2 gr. Fl.\"), oboe (\"I. Hob.\"), English horn (\"engl. Horn\"), and bassoon (\"I. Fag.\"), is characteristic of Richard Strauss's lush and demanding style.\n*   **German Markings**: The presence of German terms such as \"(Vorhang)\" for \"curtain,\" \"(die übrigen)\" for \"(the rest),\" and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" for \"(with mute)\" points to a German-language opera. The term \"(Vorhang)\" specifically indicates the music is played before the curtain rises.\n*   **Musical Style**: The complex, dissonant, and dramatic nature of the music is a hallmark of Strauss's expressionistic opera *Elektra*.\n\n*Elektra* is a one-act opera, but the scene depicted in the sheet music is a distinct section that functions as the beginning of a new part of the dramatic action. The opera was first performed in 1909 and is based on the ancient Greek tragedy by Sophocles.\n\n<<<Elektra>>>"
