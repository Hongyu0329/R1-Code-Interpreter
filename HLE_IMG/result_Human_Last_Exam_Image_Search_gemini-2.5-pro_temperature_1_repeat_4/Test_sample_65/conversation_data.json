    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*. This is a type of leafy liverwort, not a moss, although they are both bryophytes.\n\nThe most characteristic feature of the genus *Ptilidium*, which is clearly visible in the photograph, is the appearance of its leaves. The leaves are deeply divided and have fringed or ciliated edges, which gives the plant a distinct \"feathery\" or \"braided\" look. The name *Ptilidium* even comes from the Greek word *ptilidion*, which means \"small feather,\" referencing this appearance.\n\nThe genus *Ptilidium* includes three species: *Ptilidium californicum*, *Ptilidium ciliare*, and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum*. These plants typically grow in dense, often reddish-brown to yellow-green mats. They are commonly found in the arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often on tree bark in coniferous forests, but also on rocks.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
