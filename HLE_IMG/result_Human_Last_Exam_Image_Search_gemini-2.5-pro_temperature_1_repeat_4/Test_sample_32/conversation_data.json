    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the orientation of the seta.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte has a straight, erect seta, which holds the capsule in an upright position. Capsules are noted to be on short, erect setae.\n\nIn contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a curved or arcuate seta, which causes the capsule to be bent or angled. This feature is significant enough to be part of its specific epithet, *curviseta*.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to distinguish the two species when sporophytes are present is to observe whether the seta is straight (*Grimmia montana*) or curved (*Grimmia curviseta*).\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte at a glance is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
