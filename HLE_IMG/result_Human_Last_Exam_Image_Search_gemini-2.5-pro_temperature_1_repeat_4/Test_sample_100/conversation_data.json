    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group is a protecting group for the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The first step uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from amines. This reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and adds a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The molecular formula for this intermediate is C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring system to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. The ketone group (C=O) is generally not reduced under these mild conditions.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The resulting molecule, Intermediate 2, is the saturated lactam, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. Its molecular formula is C₇H₈F₃NO (C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction and Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is heated with aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl at 70 °C). These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide, or in this case, a cyclic amide (lactam).\n*   **Transformation:** The hydrolysis cleaves the amide bond (N-C=O) within the bicyclic structure. This opens the ring to form a monocyclic amino acid. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system opens up to form a substituted cyclopentane ring. The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH₂), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Product:** The final product is 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Molecular Formula**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can sum the atoms in its structure:\n*   **Carbons (C):** There are 5 carbons in the cyclopentane ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and 1 carbon in the trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃), for a total of 7 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** There are 7 hydrogens attached to the cyclopentane ring, 1 hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group, and 2 hydrogens in the amino group (-NH₂), for a total of 10 hydrogens.\n*   **Fluorines (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group.\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the amino group.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** There are 2 oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nCombining these gives the final molecular formula.\n\n**Final Product Molecular Formula:** C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
