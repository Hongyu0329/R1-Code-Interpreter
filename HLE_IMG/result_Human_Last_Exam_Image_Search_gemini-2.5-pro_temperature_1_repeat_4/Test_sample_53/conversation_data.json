    "The figure leaving the chariot is the hero Heracles (Hercules).\n\nThis ancient Greek vase, an Attic red-figure pelike dating to approximately 420-400 B.C., depicts the apotheosis of Heracles, his ascent to Mount Olympus to become a god. The vase is attributed to the Kadmos Painter and is housed in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in Munich, Germany.\n\nIn the scene, the winged figure driving the chariot is Nike, the goddess of victory. She is escorting the beardless Heracles, who is shown ascending into the chariot, on his journey from his funeral pyre to his deification among the gods. The composition shows Heracles leaving behind the mortal realm, signified by the figure on the ground, and being transported to the divine realm. Inscriptions on the vase identify the main figures as \"Athenaia\" (Athena) and \"Herakles,\" though the winged figure is iconographically identifiable as Nike, who often acts as a charioteer for gods and heroes.\n\n<<<Heracles>>>"
