    "Based on the visual characteristics and the information gathered, here is the identification of each rock specimen:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** - This specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava cools. Its dark reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron and is common in scoria. Unlike pumice, scoria typically has larger vesicles with thicker walls and is denser.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia or Tuff** - This rock is composed of various angular fragments (clasts) cemented together in a lighter-colored, fine-grained matrix. This texture is known as pyroclastic. When a rock consists of angular volcanic fragments larger than 2.5 inches it is called a volcanic breccia; if the fragments are smaller, it is called a tuff. Rocks like this form from the material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption. The specimen could be specifically identified as a rhyolite tuff, which often contains glassy fragments and is light-colored.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** - This specimen is light-colored and extremely porous with very small vesicles. This \"foamy\" appearance is the defining characteristic of pumice, a volcanic glass that forms from violent, explosive eruptions of magma. Its high porosity often makes it light enough to float on water. Pumice is typically light in color, ranging from white to light gray or tan.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** - This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which identifies it as having a pegmatitic texture. Pegmatites are igneous rocks that form in the final stages of a magma's crystallization and are known for their exceptionally large crystals, often larger than 1 cm. This specimen shows large crystals of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker minerals, which is a common composition for a granite pegmatite.\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
