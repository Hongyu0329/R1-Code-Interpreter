    "The correct answer is **Hat Trick**.\n\nThis term connects the two clues provided:\n\n*   **The Image:** The picture is from the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. Pictured is Tampa Bay Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov, who had a historic season. He won a \"hat trick\" of major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player, voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer). This achievement is often referred to as an awards or hardware hat trick. The date mentioned in the prompt (June 20, 2019) is off by one day, likely due to a simple error or time zone differences.\n\n*   **Mercury Toxicity:** The term \"hat trick\" is believed to have originated in the 19th century. In sports like cricket, a player achieving a notable feat (like taking three wickets on three consecutive balls) might be rewarded with a new hat. During that era, felt hats were manufactured using mercuric nitrate in a process called \"carroting\". This process exposed hat makers to mercury vapors, leading to neurological damage and symptoms known as \"mad hatter disease\" or the \"Danbury shakes\". The use of mercury in the hat-making industry has since been banned and has almost entirely ceased.\n\nTherefore, \"hat trick\" is the X Y that links Nikita Kucherov's 2019 achievement with the historical use and toxicity of mercury salts in hat making.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
