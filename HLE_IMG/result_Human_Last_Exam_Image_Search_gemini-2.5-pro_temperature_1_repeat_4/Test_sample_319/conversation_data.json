    "The image displays the elements of an auditory illusion known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThis phenomenon occurs when a sound, such as a steady tone, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like noise. If the interrupting noise is loud enough to mask the gap, the human auditory system perceives the original tone as being continuous and uninterrupted, as if it were continuing behind the noise. The top panel of the image, a spectrogram, visually represents this: a continuous horizontal line (the tone) is broken by a vertical band (the noise). The bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform.\n\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" of the missing sound is an unconscious process performed by the brain to create a sense of continuity from incomplete sensory information. This is similar to the bistable ambiguity of the Necker Cube in vision, where the brain alternates between two possible interpretations of a single, constant visual input. In the case of the auditory continuity illusion, the brain resolves the ambiguity of the interrupted tone in favor of a continuous perception. This ability is crucial for understanding speech and other sounds in noisy environments where parts of the auditory signal might be obscured.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
