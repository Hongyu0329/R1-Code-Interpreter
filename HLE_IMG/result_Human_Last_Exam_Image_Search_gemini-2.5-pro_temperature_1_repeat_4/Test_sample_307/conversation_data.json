    "An analysis of the provided image and its origin reveals the specific parameters for the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols. The image is Figure 4 from the scientific paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén, published in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing in 2016.\n\nThe caption of the original figure clarifies the parameters for the nine plots:\n\"Color plots of the 3j-symbol (j1 m1, j2 m2, j3 m3) for j1 = 10, j2 = 10, and j3 = 10, . . . , 18. The values are plotted as functions of m1 and m2, with m3 = −m1 − m2. The titles in the individual plots denote j3. The infinity-norm for each case is presented in the lower right.\"\n\nThe nine plots in the image correspond sequentially to `j3` values from 10 to 18. By consulting the original publication, the infinity-norm (the maximum absolute value of the 3-j symbol for each case) for each plot can be determined:\n\n*   **Plot 1 (j3 = 10):** 0.1287\n*   **Plot 2 (j3 = 11):** 0.1118\n*   **Plot 3 (j3 = 12):** 0.1011\n*   **Plot 4 (j3 = 13):** 0.0935\n*   **Plot 5 (j3 = 14):** 0.0879\n*   **Plot 6 (j3 = 15):** 0.0837\n*   **Plot 7 (j3 = 16):** 0.0805\n*   **Plot 8 (j3 = 17):** 0.0779\n*   **Plot 9 (j3 = 18):** 0.0758\n\nFrom these values, the maximum and minimum infinity-norms can be identified:\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** 0.1287 (from Plot 1, where j3 = 10)\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** 0.0758 (from Plot 9, where j3 = 18)\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is calculated as follows:\n\nRatio = 0.1287 / 0.0758 ≈ 1.697889\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the ratio is 1.698.\n\n<<<1.698"
