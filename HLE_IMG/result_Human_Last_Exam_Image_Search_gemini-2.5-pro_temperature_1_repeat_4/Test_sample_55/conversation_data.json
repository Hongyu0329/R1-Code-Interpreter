    "To determine the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, a harmonic analysis is necessary.\n\n1.  **Identify the key:** The piece is in D minor.\n2.  **Identify the notes:** The circled chord consists of the notes E in the bass, and G♯, B, and C♯ in the treble clef.\n3.  **Analyze the chord's function:** This collection of notes (E-G♯-B-C♯) functions as a secondary dominant, also known as an applied dominant. Specifically, it is the dominant of the dominant chord.\n    *   In the key of D minor, the tonic chord is D minor (i).\n    *   The dominant chord (V) is A major.\n    *   The chord that functions as the dominant of A major is E major. The E major triad consists of the notes E, G♯, and B, all of which are present in the circled measure.\n    *   Therefore, the chord is the dominant of the dominant, and its Roman numeral is **V/V**.\n\nThis analysis is confirmed by looking at the surrounding harmonic context. The passage from measure 8 leads into an extended section that emphasizes the dominant (A major), before finally resolving to the tonic (D minor) at the Adagio in measure 12. The E major chord in measure 8 serves to intensify the arrival of the A major dominant harmony.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
