    "The Ancient Greek word in the manuscript is **μοῦθαλουν**.\n\nThis is a *scriptio continua*, meaning it is two words written together without a space: **μοῦ θάλουν**.\n\n*   **μοῦ** is the genitive case of the first-person pronoun, meaning \"my.\"\n*   **θάλουν** is a Late Byzantine or scribal corruption of the Ancient Greek word **ὀφθαλμούς** (*ophthalmoús*), which is the accusative plural of **ὀφθαλμός** (*ophthalmós*), the common word for \"eye\". Therefore, the phrase means \"my eyes.\"\n\nThe transformation from the classical `ὀφθαλμούς` to the manuscript's `θάλουν` can be explained by linguistic changes common in later forms of Greek:\n*   **Apheresis**: The initial unstressed vowel and consonants (`ὀφ-`) were dropped.\n*   **Consonant Cluster Simplification**: The cluster `-λμ-` (`-lm-`) was simplified to `-λ-` (`-l-`).\n*   **Spelling Change**: The accusative plural ending `-ούς` (pronounced /us/) came to be written as `-ουν`, which represented the same sound.\n\nByzantine manuscripts from this later period frequently used a cursive, highly connected script known as minuscule, which employed many abbreviations and ligatures. The transcription reflects these features, such as the ligature for `ου` (omicron-upsilon) and the circumflex accent placed over it.\n\n<<<μοῦθαλουν>>>"
