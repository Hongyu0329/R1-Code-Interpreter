    "Here is the breakdown of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insects are cuckoo bees, which are cleptoparasitic and lack pollen-collecting scopae. The insect on the left (A1) is a male *Coelioxys*, identifiable by the multiple spines at the tip of its abdomen. The insect on the right (A2) is a female *Triepeolus*, which has a more robust build and shorter antennae compared to a male. Therefore, the pair is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps (*Polistes*). In this genus, males can be distinguished from females by the tips of their antennae. The wasp on the left (B1) has straight antennae, indicating it is a **female**. The wasp on the right (B2) has distinctly curled or hooked antennae tips, which is characteristic of a **male**. Therefore, the pair is **Female, Male (4)**.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees (*Melissodes*). While the prompt is confusing regarding scopae (female *Melissodes* have very prominent ones), the sexual differences are clear. The bee on the left (C1) is a **male**, identified by its extremely long antennae and pale-colored face (clypeus). The bee on the right (C2) is a **female**, which has much shorter antennae and large, dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on its hind legs. Therefore, the pair is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\nThe correct indices for A, B, and C are 3, 4, and 3.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
