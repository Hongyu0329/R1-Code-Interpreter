    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element Helium.\n\nWhen the light emitted from excited helium atoms is passed through a prism, it produces a unique pattern of colored lines. This emission spectrum is like a fingerprint for the element.\n\nKey features of the helium spectrum visible in the image include:\n*   A prominent bright red line.\n*   A distinct yellow line.\n*   Several lines in the green and blue-green region.\n*   A series of lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n\nWhile other elements like hydrogen have simpler spectra and elements like iron have much more complex spectra, the specific pattern and distribution of the lines in the provided image are characteristic of helium. The helium emission spectrum is distinct from that of other gases like hydrogen and nitrogen.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
