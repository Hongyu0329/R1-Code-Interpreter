    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug, and its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis insect is a species of seed bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae and is commonly found in North and Central America. It is characterized by its distinct orange or red and black markings. A key feature is the reddish-orange 'X' shape on its back and a band of the same color across the pronotum, which is the shield-like area behind its head. The head is black, often with a red spot on top.\n\nThough commonly called the Small Milkweed Bug, it feeds on a variety of plants, not just milkweed. It is often found on goldenrod, especially in late summer, where it feeds on nectar and sometimes other insects.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus* (the eastern small milkweed bug) and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii* (the western small milkweed bug).\n\n<<<*Lygaeus kalmii*>>>"
