    "I am sorry, but the image you provided is completely black. Therefore, I cannot see the molecules you are referring to.\n\nTo determine the relationship between two molecules, I would need to see their structures. Here is a brief explanation of the options provided, which might help you once you can see the molecules:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity of atoms.\n*   **(c) Identical:** The molecules are the same, just possibly rotated or viewed from a different angle.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity of atoms, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\nPlease provide the image of the molecules, and I will be happy to help you identify their relationship."
