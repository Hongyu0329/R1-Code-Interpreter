    "Okay, the mechanism is complex but well-established in organic chemistry, known as a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the transformation from Friedelan-3β-ol to the product, which has an oleanane skeleton.\n\n### The Reaction Mechanism\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the alcohol (-OH) group by the acid catalyst (HCl), forming a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This group departs as a water molecule, leaving behind a secondary carbocation at the C3 position.\n2.  **Initial Rearrangement:** The molecule then rearranges to form a more stable tertiary carbocation. This can happen via an intermediate alkene (friedel-3-ene), which is then protonated at C3 to form a carbocation at the tertiary C4 position. This carbocation at C4 is the starting point for a cascade of shifts.\n3.  **Backbone Rearrangement Cascade:** A series of sequential shifts of hydrogen atoms (hydride shifts) and methyl groups (methanide shifts) occur along the \"backbone\" of the molecule. Each shift moves the positive charge to an adjacent atom, generally proceeding towards a more stable energetic state. This specific cascade converts the friedelane carbon skeleton into the oleanane skeleton. The key shifts are:\n    *   An initial H⁻ shift from C5 to C4.\n    *   A CH₃⁻ shift from C10 to C5.\n    *   An H⁻ shift from C9 to C10.\n    *   A CH₃⁻ shift from C8 to C9.\n    *   An H⁻ shift from C14 to C8.\n    *   A CH₃⁻ shift from C13 to C14.\n    *   This leaves a tertiary carbocation at C13.\n4.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton is eliminated from the adjacent C12 position, forming a stable trisubstituted double bond between C12 and C13 and regenerating the acid catalyst. This completes the formation of the final product.\n\n### Identifying the Substituents\n\nBy carefully tracking the original positions of the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups through this cascade of rearrangements, we can determine what substituent ends up at each numbered position in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This position is on C4 of the original friedelane skeleton. This carbon atom starts with two methyl groups. After the rearrangement cascade begins (starting with the H-shift from C5 to C4), this carbon retains one of its original methyl groups. Thus, **1 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 2:** This position is on the C10-C9 bridge. It corresponds to the methyl group that was originally on C8 of the friedelane skeleton. This methyl group shifts to C9 during the rearrangement. Thus, **2 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 3:** This position corresponds to the C8 carbon. This carbon starts with a methyl group (which migrates to C9) and the ring structure. During the rearrangement, a hydrogen atom migrates from C14 to C8. Thus, **3 = H**.\n*   **Position 4:** This position is on C14. It starts with a methyl group and a hydrogen. The hydrogen shifts to C8. Later, a methyl group from C13 shifts to C14. Thus, **4 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 5:** This position is on C13. This carbon starts with a hydrogen and a methyl group. The methyl group migrates to C14, and the hydrogen remains. The carbocation forms here before the final elimination step. Thus, **5 = H**.\n\nBased on the detailed mechanistic pathway of the friedelane-oleanane backbone rearrangement, the substituents are:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>The rearrangement shown is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement in triterpenoids, specifically the conversion of a friedelane skeleton to an oleanane skeleton. This process involves a cascade of consecutive hydride (H⁻) and methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts.\n\nHere is the step-by-step determination of the substituents:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH), which then leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. This rearranges to a stable tertiary carbocation at the C4 position, initiating the cascade.\n\n2.  **Tracking the Shifts:**\n    *   The carbon at **position 1** (part of the C4 gem-dimethyl group in the starting material) retains its methyl group throughout the reaction.\n    *   The methyl group at **position 2** was originally located on C8 of the starting material. It migrates to C9 in a shift.\n    *   The substituent at **position 3** (on C8) becomes a hydrogen atom. This is because the original methyl group at C8 has shifted away, and a hydrogen atom from C14 migrates to C8.\n    *   The methyl group at **position 4** (on C14) comes from C13 in one of the final shifts of the cascade.\n    *   The substituent at **position 5** (on C13) becomes a hydrogen. The original methyl group at C13 migrates to C14, and the hydrogen atom remains.\n\nTherefore, the final arrangement of the substituents at the indicated positions is as follows:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
