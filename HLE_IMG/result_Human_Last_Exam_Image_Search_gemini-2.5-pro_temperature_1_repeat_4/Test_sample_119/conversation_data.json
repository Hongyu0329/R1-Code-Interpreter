    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+)**: The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at **m/z 135**.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule**: An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, most likely one.\n*   **Key Fragments**: Notable peaks are observed at m/z 91 (often corresponding to a benzyl or tropylium ion, [C₇H₇]⁺) and a base peak (the most intense peak) at m/z 30.\n\n### 2. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   Based on the molecular weight of 135 and the likely presence of one nitrogen atom, a plausible molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   Calculation: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) ≈ 135.2 g/mol.\n*   The **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as:\n    DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n### 3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **~3400 cm⁻¹**: A broad absorption suggests the presence of an N-H bond, likely from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks indicate aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks indicate aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600, 1495, 1450 cm⁻¹**: Absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\nThe IR spectrum confirms the presence of an amine and an aromatic ring with an aliphatic side chain.\n\n### 4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts**: Seven distinct carbon signals are observed:\n    *   **Aromatic region**: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic region**: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135**: This experiment reveals one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   **Negative signal (1)**: Indicates one **CH₂** (methylene) group.\n    *   **Positive signals (5)**: Indicate a total of five **CH** (methine) or **CH₃** (methyl) groups.\n*   **Signal Count**: Since there are 7 total carbon signals and 6 signals in the DEPT spectrum, one carbon must be a **quaternary carbon** (a carbon with no attached protons). This is the signal at **145.1 ppm** in the aromatic region, typical for an ipso-carbon (the ring carbon attached to the substituent).\n*   **Combining Information**:\n    *   There are 4 aromatic carbons: 1 quaternary C and 3 CH groups. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   There are 3 aliphatic carbons: one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃.\n\n### 5. ¹H NMR Analysis\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H)**: Confirms the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.85 ppm (multiplet, 2H)**: Corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **δ ~2.75 ppm (multiplet, 1H)**: Corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H)**: Corresponds to a CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n\n### 6. HSQC Analysis\nThis 2D spectrum correlates directly bonded protons and carbons:\n*   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm.\n*   **H at 1.2 ppm correlates with C at 19.2 ppm** (the -CH₃ group).\n*   **H at 2.75 ppm (1H) correlates with C at 49.6 ppm** (the -CH group).\n*   **H at 2.85 ppm (2H) correlates with C at 43.5 ppm** (the -CH₂ group).\n\n### 7. Structure Elucidation\n1.  The data confirms a **phenyl group** (C₆H₅-) and a three-carbon side chain containing an amine.\n2.  The ¹H NMR shows a **methyl doublet** (`-CH₃`), meaning it is attached to a methine (`-CH-`) group, forming a `-CH(CH₃)-` fragment.\n3.  The remaining fragments are a **-CH₂-** group and an **-NH₂** group.\n4.  There are two possible ways to assemble the `C₆H₅-`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)-`, and `-NH₂` pieces:\n\n    *   **Structure I: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine)**\n        `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`\n    *   **Structure II: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine**\n        `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`\n\n5.  **Distinguishing between Isomers using NMR**:\n    *   In **Structure I**, the CH₂ group is benzylic (next to the phenyl ring), and the CH group is attached to the nitrogen. We would expect the chemical shifts to be: C-CH(N) > C-CH₂(Ph). The observed data is **δC 49.6 (CH)** and **δC 43.5 (CH₂)**. This assignment fits Structure I. Literature data confirms these approximate shifts for amphetamine.\n    *   In **Structure II**, the CH group is benzylic, and the CH₂ group is attached to nitrogen. We would expect C-CH₂(N) > C-CH(Ph). This contradicts the observed data.\n\n6.  **Revisiting Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   The base peak at **m/z 30** (`[CH₂=NH₂]⁺`) is highly characteristic of α-cleavage in primary amines with an ethylamine skeleton (`-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂`), which would strongly suggest Structure II.\n    *   However, the peak at **m/z 91** is strong evidence for a benzyl group (`C₆H₅-CH₂-`) which is present in Structure I.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is a conflict between the NMR and MS data. However, the collective evidence from multiple, consistent NMR experiments (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, and HSQC) provides a more definitive structural framework than mass spectral fragmentation, which can be subject to complex rearrangements. The NMR data, particularly the chemical shifts of the CH and CH₂ groups confirmed by HSQC, unambiguously points to Structure I.\n\nThe IUPAC name for Structure I (`C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`) is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
