    "To identify the compound from the given electron ionization mass spectrum, a systematic analysis of the molecular ion and fragmentation patterns is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear in a cluster around m/z 258-266. This pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple halogen atoms, specifically chlorine (isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in a ~3:1 ratio) and/or bromine (isotopes ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br in a ~1:1 ratio). The most intense peaks in this cluster are at m/z 260 (34.8%), 262 (29.0%), and 258 (17.4%). This complex isotopic pattern suggests the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and at least one bromine atom. Based on detailed analysis, this pattern is consistent with a molecule containing one bromine atom and three chlorine atoms. The molecular formula for the non-halogen part can be deduced. Assuming the peak at m/z 258 corresponds to the molecule with the lightest isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ⁷⁹Br, ³⁵Cl), the mass of the halogens is 79 + (3 × 35) = 184 amu. The remaining mass is 258 - 184 = 74 amu. This corresponds to a C₆H₂ fragment (6 × 12 + 2 × 1 = 74). Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₆H₂BrCl₃**. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is 4, which is consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (100% relative intensity). This peak represents the most stable fragment ion formed. The mass difference between the molecular ion (e.g., m/z 258) and the base peak (m/z 225) is not a simple loss. However, considering the isotopic distribution, the base peak corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion ([M-Cl]⁺). For example, the ion at m/z 260 (C₆H₂⁷⁹Br³⁵Cl₂³⁷Cl or C₆H₂⁸¹Br³⁵Cl₃) losing a ³⁵Cl atom results in a fragment at m/z 225. This [C₆H₂BrCl₂]⁺ fragment has its own isotopic cluster, with the peak at m/z 225 being the most abundant in that fragment's cluster.\n\n3.  **Other Significant Fragments:**\n    *   **m/z 190:** The prominent cluster with major peaks at m/z 188, 190, and 192 corresponds to the loss of a second chlorine atom, forming the [M-2Cl]⁺ or [C₆H₂BrCl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   **m/z 118:** This peak corresponds to the fragment [C₆Cl]⁺, resulting from the loss of H₂BrCl from the molecular ion.\n    *   **m/z 141:** This peak can be attributed to the [C₅Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   **m/z 47:** This peak corresponds to the [CCl]⁺ fragment ion.\n\n### Compound Identification\n\nThe molecular formula C₆H₂BrCl₃ corresponds to bromotrichlorobenzene. There are several possible isomers for this substitution pattern on the benzene ring. By comparing the provided spectrum with reference spectra from chemical databases, a match can be found.\n\nThe fragmentation pattern, particularly the presence and relative intensities of key fragments like m/z 225 (base peak), 190, and 118, is characteristic of **1-bromo-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene**. The specific arrangement of the substituents in this isomer leads to the observed stability of the resulting fragments.\n\n### IUPAC Name\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for the identified compound is **1-bromo-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene>>>"
