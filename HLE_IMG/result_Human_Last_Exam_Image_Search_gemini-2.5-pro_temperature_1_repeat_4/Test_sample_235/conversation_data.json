    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, the words must first be identified and then analyzed for their syllabic and stress patterns.\n\nThe words in the erasure poem are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\".\n\nWhen read as a single line—\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"—the poem consists of 11 syllables. This syllable count immediately rules out several of the possible metric patterns:\n*   **Iambic pentameter** requires a line of ten syllables with five pairs of unstressed and stressed syllables.\n*   An **Alexandrine** is a line of 12 syllables.\n*   **Loose iambic trimeter** would have a base of six syllables (three iambic feet).\n*   An **American sentence** is a single sentence of 17 syllables.\n*   A **Sapphic** stanza has a very specific structure of three 11-syllable lines followed by a 5-syllable line, which does not match this single, fragmented line of poetry.\n\nThe remaining option is **free verse**. Free verse poetry is defined by its lack of a strict or regular meter and rhyme scheme. The lines can be of any length and tend to follow the rhythms of natural speech.\n\nAnalyzing the stress pattern of the poem reveals an irregular rhythm that does not conform to a consistent metrical foot. The scattered, visual layout of the words on the page is also characteristic of many modern and free verse poems. Erasure poetry itself, as a form, often results in compositions that do not follow traditional metrical constraints, instead creating new relationships and meanings from a source text.\n\nGiven the irregular syllable count and lack of a discernible, repeating metrical pattern, the poem is best described as being in free verse.\n\n<<<A>>>"
