    "Based on the organisms visible in the photograph, the species that definitively indicates the photo was taken on an Atlantic rather than a Pacific coast is the common periwinkle.\n\nSeveral species in the image are characteristic of the North Atlantic intertidal zone. These include:\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** **(Common Periwinkle):** The small, dark, conical snails are identifiable as common periwinkles. This species is native to the Northeast Atlantic (Europe) and was introduced to the Northwest Atlantic (North America) in the 19th century, where it is now widespread. While there have been reports of isolated introductions on the Pacific coast, it has not become established there. Its abundant presence as seen in the photo is a strong indicator of an Atlantic shoreline.\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** **(Northern Rock Barnacle):** The numerous barnacles encrusting the rock are consistent in appearance with this species. *S. balanoides* is a common, often dominant, barnacle in the intertidal zones of the North Atlantic, on both the European and North American coasts. While it is also found in the boreo-arctic Pacific, its combination with the other species present points strongly to the Atlantic.\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** **(Dog Whelk):** The larger, whitish snail resembles a dog whelk, a common predator of barnacles and mussels on North Atlantic rocky shores. This species is found widely on both sides of the North Atlantic but is not present on the Pacific coast.\n\nOf these, *Littorina littorea* is the most classic and clear indicator. Its established, high-density populations are a hallmark of the Atlantic intertidal ecosystem and are absent from the Pacific.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
