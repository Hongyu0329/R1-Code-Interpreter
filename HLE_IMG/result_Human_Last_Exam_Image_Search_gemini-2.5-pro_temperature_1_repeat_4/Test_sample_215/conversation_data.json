    "Based on a reverse image search and address verification, the home is located in Greentown. However, the population of Greentown is below the 5,000 threshold specified in the question. According to the 2010 census, the population was 2,415. More recent estimates from 2023 place the population at 2,005 and the 2025 projection is 2,408.\n\nThe home is located in Howard County, approximately nine miles east of Kokomo. While Greentown itself does not meet the population requirement, it is part of the larger Kokomo, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The closest city with a population of over 5,000 is Kokomo.\n\nGiven the constraint, the most accurate answer is the nearby city that is the center of the metropolitan area.\n\n<<<Kokomo>>>"
