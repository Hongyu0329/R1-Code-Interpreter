    "This image was taken in Seattle, Washington.\n\nBased on the visual evidence in the photograph, the location is Golden Gardens Park. The park is situated in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle on the shore of Puget Sound and is well-known for its picturesque sunsets over the Olympic Mountains.\n\nSeveral key features in the image point to this specific location:\n*   **Beach Bonfires:** Golden Gardens is one of only two parks in Seattle where beach bonfires are legally permitted in designated fire pits. The photo was taken in 2022, and during the summer of that year, beach fires were allowed.\n*   **Scenery:** The image captures a sandy and pebbly beach, a calm body of water consistent with Puget Sound, and a forested bluff in the background, all of which are characteristic features of Golden Gardens Park.\n*   **Chain-Link Fence:** A prominent chain-link fence is visible in the foreground. Fences of this type are present in Golden Gardens Park, notably near the off-leash dog area, along some trails, and adjacent to the BNSF railway line that runs alongside the park.\n\nWhile Alki Beach is the other Seattle park that allows bonfires, its landscape generally offers more direct city views and a different shoreline profile. The combination of the natural landscape and the specific man-made elements in the photo strongly indicates Golden Gardens Park as the correct location.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
