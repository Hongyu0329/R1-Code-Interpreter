    "The Jones polynomial for the knot 9_42 is:\n\n$t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + 2t^{-1} - t^{-2} + t^{-3} - t^{-4}$\n\nThis polynomial is a knot invariant, meaning it is the same for all diagrams of this particular knot. The knot in the image is identified in knot theory as the 9_42 knot, which indicates it is the 42nd knot with 9 crossings in standard knot tables.\n\n<<<t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + 2t^-1 - t^-2 + t^-3 - t^-4>>>"
