    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis identification is based on the unique grid pattern of the runes and the content of the inscription, which links it to the Ingvar expedition. The runestone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.\n\nThe inscription on Sö 281 mentions Ingvar and \"Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens), a term used in Old Norse sources for the lands to the southeast of the Caspian Sea. A transliteration of the partially preserved text reads: \"… [a]lui : lit · kira : kubl : ifti… … burþur : ulfs · þiʀ · a[u]… … [m]iþ · ikuari : o : sirk·la[t]…\" which translates to: “(Someone) had the monument made in memory of … Ulv's brother. They in / to the east … with Ingvar in Serkland.”\n\nThis fragmented runestone was discovered in 1863 being used as a doorstep in Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden, and was subsequently embedded in the cathedral wall.<<<Sö 281>>>"
