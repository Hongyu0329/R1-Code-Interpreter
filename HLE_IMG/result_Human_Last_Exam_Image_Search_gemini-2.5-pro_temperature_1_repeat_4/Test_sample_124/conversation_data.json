    "To determine the current flowing through the circuit, we must first find the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then apply Ohm's Law.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Left Branch:**\n    *   This branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n    *   A wire connects the top of the entire circuit (positive terminal of the 1V source) directly to the node between R2 and R3.\n    *   This connection means that the series combination of R1 and R2 is in parallel with an ideal wire (which has zero resistance).\n    *   When a resistor or a set of resistors is in parallel with a short circuit (an ideal wire), the current will bypass the resistors and flow through the path of zero resistance. Therefore, resistors R1 and R2 are effectively short-circuited and can be removed from the analysis.\n    *   This leaves only resistor R3 (9 Ω) in the left branch, connected across the 1V source.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Right Branch:**\n    *   This branch contains resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω).\n    *   A wire connects the top of the circuit to the node between R7 and R8.\n    *   This means both terminals of resistor R8 are connected to the same point (the positive terminal of the source). The voltage difference across R8 is therefore zero, and no current will flow through it. R8 is short-circuited.\n    *   This leaves only resistor R7 (100 Ω) in the right branch, connected across the 1V source.\n\n### Calculation of Total Current\n\nThe simplified circuit consists of two resistors, R3 and R7, connected in parallel across the 1V voltage source.\n\n1.  **Calculate the equivalent resistance (R_eq):**\n    For two resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is calculated using the formula:\n    R_eq = (R3 * R7) / (R3 + R7)\n    R_eq = (9 Ω * 100 Ω) / (9 Ω + 100 Ω)\n    R_eq = 900 / 109 Ω\n    R_eq ≈ 8.26 Ω\n\n2.  **Calculate the total current (I_total):**\n    Using Ohm's Law (I = V / R):\n    I_total = V2 / R_eq\n    I_total = 1 V / (900 / 109 Ω)\n    I_total = 109 / 900 A\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\nI_total ≈ 0.1211 A\n\nThe total current flowing from the voltage source is **109/900 A**, or approximately **0.121 A**.\n\n<<<109/900 A>>>"
