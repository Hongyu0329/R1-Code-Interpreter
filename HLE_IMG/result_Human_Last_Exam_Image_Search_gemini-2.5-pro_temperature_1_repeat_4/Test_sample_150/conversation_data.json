    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. In this step, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring, displacing a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product of this reaction is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). This set of reagents is used for the electrophilic bromination of an aromatic ring. The acyl group (a ketone in this case) on the benzene ring is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position relative to the propanoyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with H₂ gas and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction is a reduction. In this context, with a ketone and an aryl bromide, the ketone group is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reduction, converting a ketone to an alkane, can be achieved via catalytic hydrogenation, sometimes referred to as a Clemmensen-like reduction under these conditions.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product of this reduction is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nFinally, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). These conditions are characteristic of a free-radical bromination at the benzylic position. The benzylic carbon is the carbon atom of the propyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is particularly reactive for radical substitution due to the resonance stabilization of the resulting benzylic radical. The reaction will selectively place a bromine atom at this position.\n\n*   **Product:** The final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
