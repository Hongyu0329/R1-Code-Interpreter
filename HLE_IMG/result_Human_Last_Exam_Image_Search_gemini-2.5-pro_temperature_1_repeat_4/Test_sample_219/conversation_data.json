    "Based on the provided raster plot of neuronal firing activity, here is the identification of synchronized bursts and the calculation of the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Timestamp Identification**\n\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense vertical bands where a large number of electrodes show activity at the same time. By examining the x-axis (Time (s)), the approximate center-points of these bursts are identified at the following timestamps:\n*   ~3 s\n*   ~11 s\n*   ~18 s\n*   ~27 s\n*   ~37 s\n*   ~49 s\n\n**Average Inter-Burst Interval Calculation**\n\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time between consecutive synchronized bursts.\n\n1.  **Calculate individual inter-burst intervals:**\n    *   IBI 1: 11 s - 3 s = 8 s\n    *   IBI 2: 18 s - 11 s = 7 s\n    *   IBI 3: 27 s - 18 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI 4: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 5: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\n2.  **Calculate the average of these intervals:**\n    *   Average IBI = (8 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 12) s / 5\n    *   Average IBI = 46 s / 5\n    *   Average IBI = 9.2 s\n\nThe result is already at two significant figures.\n\n<<<9.2>>>"
