    "The tiling pattern shown in the image exhibits multiple rotational symmetries, with the highest order being **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of pattern is a sophisticated example of a geometric tiling, often found in Islamic art and architecture. It is constructed from a combination of regular polygonsâ€”in this case, hexagons, squares, and rhombi.\n\nThe rotational symmetry can be identified by finding points in the pattern that act as centers of rotation:\n*   **6-fold symmetry:** The center of each dark blue hexagon acts as a point of 6-fold rotation. If the tiling is rotated by 60 degrees around this point, it remains unchanged.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** The center of each yellowish square is a point of 4-fold rotation (90 degrees).\n*   **2-fold symmetry:** The midpoint of the edge between two hexagons is a point of 2-fold rotation (180 degrees).\n\nWhile the pattern has points of 2-fold and 4-fold symmetry, its overall classification is determined by the highest order of rotation it possesses. Therefore, the tiling is characterized by its 6-fold rotational symmetry. Such tilings are based on the hexagonal tiling system, which is one of the three regular tilings of a plane.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
