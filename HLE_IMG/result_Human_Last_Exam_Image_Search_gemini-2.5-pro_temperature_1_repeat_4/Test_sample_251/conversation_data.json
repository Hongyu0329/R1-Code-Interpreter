    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, a systematic analysis of the strip is required.\n\nFirst, it is essential to understand the calibration of the ECG paper. The strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. On a standard ECG grid, this means each small 1 mm square represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.20 seconds. The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves, which are the prominent upward spikes of the QRS complex.\n\nBy visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, a notable pause is evident in the fourth row, which begins around the timestamp of 0:06:08. This pause represents the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval, the number of squares between the R-wave preceding the pause and the R-wave ending it are counted. The R-wave before the pause aligns with a thick vertical grid line. Counting from this point to the next R-wave reveals that the interval spans exactly 7 large squares.\n\nThe duration in seconds is calculated by multiplying the number of large squares by the time per large square:\n7 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square = 1.4 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, using small squares:\n(7 large squares × 5 small squares/large square) × 0.04 seconds/small square = 35 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.4 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
