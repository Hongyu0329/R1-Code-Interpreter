    "The product featured in the advertisement \"Women are winning the War â€“ of Freedom\" is Tampax. This 1942 ad promoted the tampon as a revolutionary product that enabled women to work in factories and support the war effort without interruption from their periods.\n\nThe name of the product is derived from French. The word \"tampon\" originated from the medieval French word \"tampion,\" which means a piece of cloth used as a stopper or plug. The brand name \"Tampax\" was created by combining \"tampon\" with \"vaginal packs.\"\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
