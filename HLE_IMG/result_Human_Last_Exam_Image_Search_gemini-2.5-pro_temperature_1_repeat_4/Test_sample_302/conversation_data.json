    "The four characters on the seal are **长乐未央** (cháng lè wèi yāng).\n\nThis is a traditional Chinese idiom that translates to \"endless happiness\" or \"eternal joy without end\". The phrase is read from top to bottom, right to left. It became a popular saying during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) and was often inscribed on tiles of the imperial palaces, such as the Changle Palace and Weiyang Palace.\n\nThe characters are written in an ancient form of Chinese calligraphy known as seal script. Seals like this one have been used in China for thousands of years as a form of signature on documents and artwork.\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
