    "Based on my analysis, the question is a historical riddle about a product advertised in Britain during World War II.\n\n1.  **Context:** The advertisement is aimed at women who were newly recruited for war work, as shown by the image of a woman working on a tank and the text \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\".\n2.  **Product Function:** The product claimed to help these workers overcome \"inherent limitations\". In the context of the era and the physical demands of factory work, this is a euphemism for helping women continue to work during their menstrual period. The product is therefore a form of sanitary protection.\n3.  **Key Clue:** The product has a \"French-derived name\".\n4.  **Identifying the Brand:** Several brands of sanitary towels were advertised at the time, including Southalls and Kotex. However, the brand most famous for using slogans about overcoming limitations and allowing women to \"carry on\" with their duties was **Mene Towels**. The name \"Mene\" is believed to be a play on the French verb *mener*, which means \"to lead\" or \"to carry on\", perfectly matching the advertising message.\n\nTherefore, the product in question is Mene Towels.\n\nI will now provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n<<<Mene Towels>>>"
