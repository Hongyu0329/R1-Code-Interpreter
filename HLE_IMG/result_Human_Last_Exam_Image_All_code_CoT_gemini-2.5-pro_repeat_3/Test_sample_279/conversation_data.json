    "Based on my analysis of the image, the lesion shown is on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth, located within the pits and fissures. This presentation, which includes an existing restoration with recurrent decay, falls under a specific category in the most widely used dental classification system.\n\nI will use the G.V. Black classification system, which categorizes carious lesions based on their location on the tooth. My plan is to:\n1.  Define the characteristics of the lesion seen in the image.\n2.  Use a simple function to map these characteristics to the correct G.V. Black classification.\n3.  Print the determined classification and a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification(location_description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the G.V.
