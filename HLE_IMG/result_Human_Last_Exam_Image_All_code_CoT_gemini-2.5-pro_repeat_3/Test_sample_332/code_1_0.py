    This function solves the riddle by identifying the components and printing the result.
    
    The riddle involves these steps:
    1. The crater is the "Sagan" crater on Mars.
    2. The philosophy is from Carl Sagan's "Pale Blue Dot".
    3. The etymology of "Sagan", as described by Carl Sagan himself, is a deputy priest,
       which he equated to the role of a "Master of Ceremonies".
    4. This gives us the phrase "X of Y".
