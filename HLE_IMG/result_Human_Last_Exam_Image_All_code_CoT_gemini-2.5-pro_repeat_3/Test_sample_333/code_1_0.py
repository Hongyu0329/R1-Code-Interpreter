def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function prints the final solution for the airfoil matching problem.
    The solution is derived by analyzing the geometric properties (thickness and camber)
    of each airfoil and relating them to the aerodynamic lift, which is represented
    by the area enclosed in the pressure coefficient plots.

    Matching logic:
    - A (thin, symmetric) -> 2 (low lift)
    - B (thin, low camber) -> 1 (lift > A)
    - C (thin, medium camber) -> 5 (lift > B)
    - D (thin, high camber) -> 8 (lift > C)
    - E (thick, symmetric) -> 6 (high lift, much > A)
    - F (thick, low camber) -> 4 (lift > E)
    - G (thick, medium camber) -> 3 (lift > F)
    - H (thick, high camber) -> 7 (highest lift)
