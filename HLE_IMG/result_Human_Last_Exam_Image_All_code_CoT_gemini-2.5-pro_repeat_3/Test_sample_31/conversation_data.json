    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings and observing its structure, it can be identified as the **$8_{18}$ knot** from standard knot tables.\n2.  **Determine Knot Properties:** The $8_{18}$ knot is an **alternating knot**. This is a crucial property because for alternating knots, there are simple formulas to compute the Rasmussen invariant.\n3.  **Find Required Invariants:** For an alternating knot `K`, the Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, can be calculated from its **signature**, `σ(K)`, or its **slice genus** (also called the 4-ball genus), `g_4(K)`. From knot theory references, we know the following for the $8_{18}$ knot:\n    *   Signature, `σ(8_18) = -4`\n    *   Slice genus, `g_4(8_18) = 2`\n4.  **Apply the Formula and Calculate:** The Rasmussen invariant for an alternating knot is given by the formulas `s(K) = -σ(K)` or `s(K) = 2 * g_4(K)`. I will use the signature to calculate the result and the slice genus to verify it.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will provide a Python script that implements this calculation, showing each step of the formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n\n    The knot is identified as the 8_18 knot, which is an alternating knot.\n    For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is equal to -σ(K),\n    where σ(K) is the signature of the knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its known properties.\n    knot_name = \"8_18\"\n    \n    # According to knot theory tables, the signature of the 8_18 knot is -4.\n    signature = -4\n\n    # Step 2: Define the formula for the Rasmussen invariant.\n    # Formula: s(K) = -σ(K)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -signature\n\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(\"This is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"The Rasmussen invariant s(K) for an alternating knot is calculated using its signature σ(K).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: s(K) = -σ(K)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The signature of the {knot_name} knot is: σ({knot_name}) = {signature}\")\n    print(f\"Calculating the Rasmussen invariant:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({signature})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
