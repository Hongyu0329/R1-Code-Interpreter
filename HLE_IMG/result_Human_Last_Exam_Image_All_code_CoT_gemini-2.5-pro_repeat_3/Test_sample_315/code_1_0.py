def solve_higgs_plots():
    """
    Identifies Higgs decay plots and prints the result.

    The identification is based on the following physical principles:
    1.  Decay Thresholds: Decays into massive particles (W, Z, t) only occur when the Higgs mass
        is large enough (M_H > 2 * M_particle).
    2.  Coupling Strength: Higgs coupling is proportional to mass, so it decays preferentially
        into heavier particles.
    3.  Loop-Induced Decays: Decays to massless particles like gluons (gg) and photons (γγ) are
        possible via quantum loops. H->gg is significant, while H->γγ is very rare.

    Based on these principles, the mapping is as follows:
    - H -> b b-bar (Plot 4): Dominant channel below the WW threshold.
    - H -> τ τ-bar (Plot 6): Next heaviest lepton, lower BR than b-bbar.
    - H -> c c-bar (Plot 7): Lighter quark, even lower BR.
    - H -> gg (Plot 5): Second most dominant channel for a light Higgs.
    - H -> γγ (Plot 8): Very rare decay, lowest branching ratio.
    - H -> W+W- (Plot 1): Turns on at M_H ~ 161 GeV and becomes dominant.
    - H -> ZZ (Plot 2): Turns on at M_H ~ 182 GeV, slightly lower BR than WW.
    - H -> t t-bar (Plot 3): Turns on at M_H ~ 346 GeV.
