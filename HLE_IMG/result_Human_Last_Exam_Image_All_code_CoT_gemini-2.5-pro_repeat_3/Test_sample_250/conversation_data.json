    "This is a classic jazz standard from the bebop era. I can identify it by analyzing the melody and the chord progression.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Melody:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which points to A♭ major or F minor. The first chord is F minor (F-), confirming the key is F minor. The melody begins with a distinctive phrase: C-F-A♭-G.\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The first four bars have a unique progression: F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |. This progression, especially the `E-7b5` (which is the vii°7 of F minor) followed by the non-diatonic `Eb-6`, is a strong clue.\n3.  **Identify the Tune:** Based on the opening melodic phrase and the characteristic chord changes, the song is identifiable as \"On a Misty Night\".\n4.  **Identify the Composer:** \"On a Misty Night\" was composed by the influential bebop pianist and composer Tadd Dameron.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to print the title and composer of the piece.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"On a Misty Night\"\n  composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n  \n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
