    "The image displays a complex emission spectrum with a multitude of bright lines across the entire visible range, from blue to red. This pattern serves as a unique fingerprint for an element. To identify the element, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum's Characteristics:** I'll observe the key features of the spectrum in the image. It is not simple with just a few lines; instead, it's incredibly dense, especially in the blue-green region. This indicates a heavy element with a complex electron structure.\n\n2.  **Compare with Known Elemental Spectra:** I will compare these observed features against the known spectral patterns of several common elements.\n    *   Simple elements like Hydrogen and Helium have sparse spectra, which doesn't match.\n    *   Elements like Neon are known for a high concentration of lines in a specific region (red-orange for Neon), which also doesn't match the broad distribution seen here.\n    *   The spectrum of Iron (Fe) is famously complex and dense, containing thousands of lines across the visible spectrum. It's often used as a calibration reference precisely because of this richness of lines.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The high density of lines across the entire spectrum is the most telling feature. This pattern is a classic signature of the element Iron (Fe).\n\nThe following Python code encapsulates this reasoning to formally identify the element.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing the characteristics of its\n    emission spectrum with a knowledge base of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Spectrum Analysis ---\n    # The provided spectrum exhibits the following key characteristics:\n    # 1.
