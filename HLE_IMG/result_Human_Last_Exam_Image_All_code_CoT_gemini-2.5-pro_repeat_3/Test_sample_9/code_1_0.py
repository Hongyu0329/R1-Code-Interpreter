# The program depicted in the image is a well-known example of a Piet program.
# It is designed to print the string "Hello world!".

# The task is to take this output string and perform two transformations:
# 1. Convert the string to all lowercase characters.
# 2. Reverse the resulting string.

# Step 1: Define the original string produced by the Piet program.
original_string = "Hello world!"

# Step 2: Convert the string to lowercase.
# "Hello world!" becomes "hello world!"
lowercase_string = original_string.lower()

# Step 3: Reverse the lowercase string.
# Python's slice notation [::-1] is a concise and efficient way to reverse a string.
# "hello world!" becomes "!dlrow olleh"
reversed_string = lowercase_string[::-1]

# Step 4: Print the final transformed string to the console.
print(reversed_string)
