    "Here is my plan to identify the compound from the mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** I will first locate the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in the spectrum. This peak, along with its isotopic variants, represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n2.  **Determine the Presence of Halogens:** I will examine the isotopic pattern of the molecular ion peak. Chlorine has two isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, in an approximate 3:1 ratio. The presence of chlorine atoms creates a characteristic M⁺, M+2, M+4, etc., pattern.\n3.  **Identify the Base Peak:** I will find the most intense peak in the spectrum (relative intensity = 100%), which corresponds to the most stable fragment ion.\n4.  **Analyze Fragmentation Patterns:** I will analyze the major fragment peaks to understand how the molecule breaks apart. This involves calculating the mass difference between the molecular ion and the fragment peaks, which corresponds to the loss of neutral species (e.g., Cl, H₂, C₂H₂, etc.).\n5.  **Deduce the Molecular Formula:** By combining the molecular weight, the number of chlorine atoms, and information from the fragments, I will deduce the molecular formula of the compound.\n6.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name:** Based on the molecular formula and the stability of the fragments (especially the base peak), I will propose a plausible chemical structure and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nI will now write a Python script to execute this plan and print the results.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mass spectrum data from the table.\n    data = {\n        'm/z': [35, 36, 37, 47, 48, 49, 59, 71, 73, 76, 77, 82, 83, 84, 85, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 106, 108, 110, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 129, 130, 131, 132, 141, 143, 145, 147, 153, 155, 157, 164, 166, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 196, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 233, 258, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 266, 268],\n        'I,%': [3.09, 3.38, 1.04, 18.4, 4.62, 6.24, 3.10, 10.6, 3.45, 1.10, 1.08, 4.57, 19.4, 4.01, 7.09, 15.3, 8.79, 10.1, 0.99, 1.04, 10.8, 7.20, 1.25, 2.98, 43.5, 4.41, 29.6, 2.06, 4.88, 2.05, 4.10, 3.42, 1.52, 28.1, 27.8, 9.37, 1.02, 15.9, 16.1, 5.24, 1.36, 1.75, 36.7, 1.61, 48.4, 2.15, 24.5, 1.07, 5.44, 0.45, 60.1, 2.52, 100, 4.40, 66.7, 2.93, 22.2, 0.98, 3.70, 0.95, 17.4, 34.8, 1.53, 29.0, 1.28, 12.9, 3.22, 0.43]\n    }\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index('m/z')\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the Molecular Ion (M+).\")\n    # The highest mass cluster of significant intensity starts at m/z 262.\n    m_peak = 262\n    m_plus_2_peak = 264\n    m_plus_4_peak = 266\n    \n    i_m = df.loc[m_peak]['I,%']\n    i_m2 = df.loc[m_plus_2_peak]['I,%']\n    i_m4 = df.loc[m_plus_4_peak]['I,%']\n    \n    print(f\"The presumed molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = {m_peak} (I={i_m}%).\")\n    print(f\"Isotope peaks are observed at m/z = {m_plus_2_peak} (I={i_m2}%) and m/z = {m_plus_4_peak} (I={i_m4}%).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determining the Presence of Halogens.\")\n    # The M, M+2, M+4 pattern suggests multiple chlorine atoms.\n    # The theoretical intensity ratio for 2 Cl atoms is ~100 : 65 : 10.\n    # The observed ratio is 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22, which normalizes to 100 : 44.5 : 11.1.\n    # While not a perfect match, it strongly suggests the presence of two chlorine atoms.
