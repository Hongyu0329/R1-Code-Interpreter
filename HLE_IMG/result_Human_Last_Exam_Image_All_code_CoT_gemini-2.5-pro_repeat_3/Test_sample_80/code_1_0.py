    This function determines the product of the given double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
    
    The reaction is a known transformation in organic chemistry.
    1.  The starting material is a C2-symmetric diketone with two tethered azide groups.
    2.  The reaction is a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction, catalyzed by a strong acid (CF3CO2H).
    3.  This reaction involves the insertion of the nitrogen from the azide into a C-C bond adjacent to the ketone carbonyls.
    4.  For this specific bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system, migration of the non-bridgehead carbons (C3 and C6) is favored over the bridgehead carbons.
    5.  This specific cascade reaction is known in the literature to produce a stable, C2-symmetric diamide cage structure.
    6.  Comparing the options, product D correctly represents the known outcome of this transformation, which rearranges to a stable diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. Products A, B, and C have the wrong (spiro) connectivity. Product E has the wrong cage structure. Product F is not symmetric.
