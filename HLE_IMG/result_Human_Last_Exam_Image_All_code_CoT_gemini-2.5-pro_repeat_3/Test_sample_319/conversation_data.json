    "This image illustrates the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n\nIn this illusion, a sound, such as a pure tone (represented by the horizontal line in the spectrogram and the sine wave in the waveform), is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, typically noise (the vertical smudge in the spectrogram). Although the original tone is physically absent during the noise burst, a human listener perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain essentially \"fills in\" the missing gap. This is a common perceptual phenomenon that helps us hear continuous sounds, like speech, in noisy environments.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    The image shows elements related to an illusion which, similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity, reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\n\nWhat is the name of this phenomenon?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
