    "This is a task of medical image analysis. My goal is to identify the key histopathological features in the provided image of a kidney glomerulus and provide a diagnosis.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will carefully examine the main image and the provided crops to identify characteristic structures and abnormalities. The image shows a renal glomerulus stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** I will look for signs of glomerular injury such as hypercellularity, changes in the glomerular basement membrane, and any structures within Bowman's space.\n3.  **Formulate Diagnosis:** Based on the combination of identified features, I will determine the most likely histopathological diagnosis. The most striking feature in this image is the large, crescent-shaped structure filling Bowman's space.\n4.  **Generate Response:** I will create a Python script that prints the final diagnosis along with a description of the key microscopic findings that support it.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_histopathology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided renal biopsy image and prints the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The primary diagnosis based on the hallmark feature.\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n\n    # Key microscopic features observed in the image that lead to the diagnosis.\n    feature_1 = \"Extracapillary cellular proliferation (Crescent Formation)\"\n    description_1 = \"The most prominent finding is a large, crescent-shaped mass of cells filling Bowman's space and compressing the glomerular tuft. This is formed by proliferating parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells (like macrophages).\"\n\n    feature_2 = \"Fibrinoid Necrosis\"\n    description_2 = \"Within the glomerular tuft, there are areas of bright pink, smudgy, acellular material, which represents fibrinoid necrosis. This indicates severe vascular injury.\"\n    \n    feature_3 = \"Glomerular Tuft Hypercellularity\"\n    description_3 = \"The glomerulus itself shows an increased number of cells, contributing to the overall picture of severe inflammation (glomerulonephritis).\"\n\n    # Print the final diagnosis and supporting evidence.\n    print(f\"Histopathological Diagnosis: {diagnosis}\")\n    print(\"\\nKey Microscopic Features:\")\n    print(f\"1. {feature_1}:\\n   {description_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {feature_2}:\\n   {description_2}\")\n    print(f\"3. {feature_3}:\\n   {description_3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    diagnose_histopathology()\n\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
