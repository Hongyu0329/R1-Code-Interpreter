# This script determines the output of the Piet program by analyzing its visual structure.
# The program is composed of two distinct patterns of colored bars.
# The output is hypothesized to be an equation representing the sum of the number of bars in each pattern.

# Number of bars in the first pattern (left side).
bars_in_pattern1 = 8

# Number of bars in the second pattern (right side).
bars_in_pattern2 = 13

# Calculate the sum as the result of the equation.
total_bars = bars_in_pattern1 + bars_in_pattern2

# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The output format will be "num1 + num2 = result".
print(f"{bars_in_pattern1} + {bars_in_pattern2} = {total_bars}")
