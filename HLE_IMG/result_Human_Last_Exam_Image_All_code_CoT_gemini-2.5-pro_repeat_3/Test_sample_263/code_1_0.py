    1.  **Fundamental Structure:** All three are cationic Ir(III) complexes. Their stability in LECs depends heavily on the chemical nature of their ligands. The primary degradation pathways are often ligand dissociation, electrochemical decomposition (oxidation/reduction), and morphological changes (aggregation/crystallization).

    2.  **Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+):** This is a standard, well-studied emitter. It serves as a baseline for comparison.

    3.  **Complex 2 ([Ir(ppy)2(piq)]+):** This complex features a very large, planar diimine ligand. Such large, aromatic, planar structures are highly prone to strong intermolecular π-π stacking. This leads to aggregation in the solid state, which is a major cause of device instability, leading to luminescence quenching and poor film morphology over time.

    4.  **Complex 3 ([Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex incorporates two key features designed to enhance stability:
        *   **Fluorination (dfppy ligand):** The fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring are strongly electron-withdrawing. This strengthens the Ir-C bond and increases the complex's oxidation potential, making it more resistant to oxidative degradation during device operation.
        *   **Bulky Groups (dtbbpy ligand):** The large tert-butyl groups provide significant steric hindrance. This physically prevents the molecules from getting too close to each other, thereby inhibiting aggregation and improving the morphological stability of the emissive film.

    5.  **Conclusion:** Complex 3 is strategically designed to overcome common failure modes in LECs. The fluorination enhances electrochemical stability, while the bulky groups enhance morphological stability. Complex 2 is likely to be unstable due to aggregation, and Complex 1 is a standard benchmark without these stabilizing features. Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.
