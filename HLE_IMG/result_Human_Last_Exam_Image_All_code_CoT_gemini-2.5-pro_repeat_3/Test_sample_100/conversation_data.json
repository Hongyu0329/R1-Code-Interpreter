    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will follow the reaction sequence step by step, calculating the change in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction**\nThe starting material is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's find its molecular formula.\n*   The bicyclic core without substituents (C6H5NO) and the CF3 group gives C7H5F3NO.\n*   The PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group has the formula C8H9O.\n*   Combining these, the starting material's formula is C(7+8)H(5+9)F3N1O(1+1) = C15H14F3NO2.\n\nThe first reaction uses CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate), which is a standard reagent for removing the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction cleaves the PMB group (C8H9O) and replaces it with a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   Change in formula: -C8, -(H9-H1) = -H8, -O1.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\nThe second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n*   Change in formula: +H2.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction**\nThe third reaction involves heating Intermediate 2 with strong acid (4 N HCl). Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). These conditions cause the hydrolysis of the amide bond, opening the ring. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O).\n*   Change in formula: +H2O.\n*   Formula of the final product: C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid. The following Python code performs these calculations to confirm the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Core structure: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one\n    # C=7, H=6, F=3, N=1, O=1 (after accounting for H on N)\n    # PMB group (p-methoxybenzyl): C8H9O\n    # Starting material = Core (with NH) + PMB - H = C7H5F3NO + C8H9O\n    c_atoms = 15\n    h_atoms = 14\n    f_atoms = 3\n    n_atoms = 1\n    o_atoms = 2\n    print(\"Starting Material Formula: C15H14F3NO2\")\n\n    # Step 2: First reaction - Deprotection of PMB group with CAN.\n    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed and replaced by a Hydrogen atom.\n    # Net change is subtraction of C8H8O.\n    c_atoms -= 8\n    h_atoms -= 8\n    o_atoms -= 1\n    print(f\"After Step 1 (deprotection), Intermediate 1 Formula: C{c_atoms}H{h_atoms}F{f_atoms}N{n_atoms}O{o_atoms}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Second reaction - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2.\n    # The C=C double bond is reduced, adding two Hydrogen atoms.\n    h_atoms += 2\n    print(f\"After Step 2 (hydrogenation), Intermediate 2 Formula: C{c_atoms}H{h_atoms}F{f_atoms}N{n_atoms}O{o_atoms}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Third reaction - Hydrolysis of the lactam with HCl.\n    # The lactam ring is opened by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    h_atoms += 2\n    o_atoms += 1\n    print(f\"After Step 3 (hydrolysis), Final Product Formula: C{c_atoms}H{h_atoms}F{f_atoms}N{n_atoms}O{o_atoms}\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is composed of the following atoms:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {c_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {h_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {f_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {n_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {o_atoms}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Molecular Formula String:\")\n    print(f\"C{c_atoms}H{h_atoms}F{f_atoms}N{n_atoms}O{o_atoms}\")\n\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
