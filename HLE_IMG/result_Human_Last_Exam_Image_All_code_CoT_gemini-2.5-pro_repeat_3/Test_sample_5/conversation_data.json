    "Based on my analysis of the provided sheet music, I can identify the piece for you.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze Musical Elements:** I first examined the key signature, time signature, tempo, dynamics, and overall structure of the sheet music.\n    *   **Key:** The piece begins in A minor (as indicated by the first chord and the G# accidental), and then modulates, notably to F# minor in measure 4.\n    *   **Melody:** The opening melody in the right hand (E-F-E-D-C-B-A-G#) is highly distinctive. It is a variation of the \"Dies Irae\" plainchant, a theme famously used by the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n    *   **Style:** The piece is characterized by its virtuosic piano writing, dramatic dynamic shifts (from *p* to *f*), and rich, post-romantic harmonies. The dense chords and rapid arpeggiated figures are trademarks of Rachmaninoff's style.\n2.  **Hypothesize and Verify:** The use of the \"Dies Irae\" theme and the virtuosic, emotional style strongly suggested the composer is Sergei Rachmaninoff. I compared the musical excerpt to his well-known works. It is not his famous Prelude in C# minor, but it perfectly matches his **Étude-Tableau in A minor, Op. 39, No. 6**. All the details, from the opening theme to the agitated arpeggios starting in measure 4, correspond exactly to this piece. It is sometimes nicknamed \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\n3.  **Code Generation:** As requested, I will provide a Python script to print the name of the music.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the name of the musical piece identified from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Sergei Rachmaninoff\"\n    piece = \"Étude-Tableau in A minor, Op. 39, No. 6\"\n    nickname = '(also known as \"Little Red Riding Hood\")'\n    \n    print(f\"The music is: {piece}\")\n    print(f\"Composed by: {composer}\")\n    print(nickname)\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Étude-Tableau in A minor, Op. 39, No. 6 by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
