The key to understanding the regioselectivity lies in the structure of the reactive intermediate, a mesoionic compound called a münchnone, which is formed in each reaction.

1.  **Reactions 1 and 2 - The Symmetric Case:**
    In Reaction 1, N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine is dehydrated by acetic anhydride to form a münchnone intermediate. This 1,3-dipole has two methyl groups at its termini (positions C2 and C4). The subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, followed by CO2 loss, yields Product A, a pyrrole.
    Reaction 2, the isotope labeling study, is crucial. It reveals that starting with a 13C label on either the acetyl methyl or the alanine methyl results in a 1:1 mixture of products where the label is found at both corresponding positions in the final pyrrole. This demonstrates that the two methyl groups of the münchnone become equivalent via a rapid equilibrium process (likely through an acyclic ketene intermediate) before the cycloaddition occurs. Because the two ends of the dipole are effectively identical, the inherent regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is masked, leading to what appears as no regioselectivity with respect to the labels, and only a single chemical product in Reaction 1.

2.  **Reaction 3 - The Asymmetric Case and the Reason for Regioselectivity:**
    In Reaction 3, the starting material N-acetylproline forms a bicyclic münchnone. This intermediate is inherently **asymmetric**. The C2 terminus of the dipole bears a methyl group, while the C4 terminus is a methylene (-CH2-) group that is part of the fused proline ring.
    These two groups are sterically and electronically distinct, and they cannot equilibrate to become identical.

**Conclusion:**
The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of the **asymmetry of its münchnone intermediate**. Since the two ends of the 1,3-dipole are different, the inherent regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction is expressed. The electron-deficient alkyne adds in a specific orientation that is favored by steric and electronic factors (frontier molecular orbital interactions), leading to the formation of a single regioisomer, Product B. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the context, proving that the cycloaddition step is indeed selective, but this selectivity is only observable when the dipole is asymmetric.
