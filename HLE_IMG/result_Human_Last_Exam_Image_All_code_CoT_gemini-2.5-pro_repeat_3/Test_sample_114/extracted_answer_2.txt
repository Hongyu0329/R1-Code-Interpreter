The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because its bicyclic münchnone intermediate is asymmetric, possessing electronically and sterically distinct termini (a C2-methyl group vs. a C4-methylene group). This allows the inherent regioselectivity of the [3+2] cycloaddition to be expressed. In contrast, Reactions 1 and 2 show that the münchnone from the acyclic amino acid equilibrates to become effectively symmetric, which masks this inherent regioselectivity.
