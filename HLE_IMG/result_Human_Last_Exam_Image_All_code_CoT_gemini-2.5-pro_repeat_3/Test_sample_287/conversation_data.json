    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, I will identify the city.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the distinct architectural features of the buildings in the skyline.\n2.  The tall building on the right with its specific window grid and the curved building next to it are key landmarks.\n3.  I will use these features to perform a search and identify the buildings. My research indicates these are prominent skyscrapers in Seoul, South Korea.\n4.  Specifically, the buildings appear to be part of the World Trade Center Seoul complex, which includes the ASEM Tower and the Trade Tower, located in the Gangnam district.\n5.  I will then write a Python script to print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef identify_city():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city in the image based on architectural landmarks.\n    The buildings visible in the skyline, particularly the ASEM Tower and the\n    surrounding World Trade Center Seoul complex, are characteristic of this city.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Seoul\"\n    print(f\"The city in the image is: {city_name}\")\n\nidentify_city()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"
