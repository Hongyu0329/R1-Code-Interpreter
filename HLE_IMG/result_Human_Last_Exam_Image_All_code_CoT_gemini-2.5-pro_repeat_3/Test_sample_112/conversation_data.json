    "This problem requires astronomical calculation to determine the observer's location based on the positions of stars and planets in the sky at a specific time.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Extract Data**: I'll use the date and time provided in the image: October 22, 2024, 20:07:37 CEST. CEST (Central European Summer Time) is UTC+2, so the time in UTC is 18:07:37.\n2.  **Identify Celestial Objects**: The image clearly labels Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Capella, and Vega. The Milky Way is also visible.\n3.  **Analyze Object Positions**:\n    *   Saturn is low on the horizon, slightly to the left of the image's center.\n    *   Vega is on the right side of the image, also at a relatively low altitude.\n    *   Jupiter and Capella are higher in the sky, towards the left.\n4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: The timezone is CEST, which strongly suggests a location in Europe. I'll hypothesize a location and check if the sky view matches. A latitude of around 52°N (like Berlin, Germany, or Warsaw, Poland) is a good starting point for a Central European country.\n5.  **Verify with Code**: I will write a Python script using the `skyfield` library to calculate the precise altitude (angle above the horizon) and azimuth (compass direction) of these celestial objects for a candidate location (Berlin, Germany) at the specified UTC time.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude**: I'll compare the calculated positions with the visual evidence from the image.\n    *   If looking south (azimuth 180°), east is to the left and west is to the right.\n    *   The calculation should show Saturn in the south, Vega in the west, and Jupiter/Capella in the east/northeast.\n    *   The calculated altitudes should also match their apparent heights in the image. If the calculated values align well with the image, the hypothesized country is correct.\n\n```python\nimport pytz\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom skyfield.api import Star, load, Topos\n\ndef solve_sky_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the position of celestial objects to determine the observer's location.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
