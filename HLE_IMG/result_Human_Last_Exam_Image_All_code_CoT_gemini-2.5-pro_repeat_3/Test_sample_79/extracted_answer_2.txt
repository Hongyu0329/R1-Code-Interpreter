The square structure is the ruin or foundation of a building from the former Marfa Army Airfield (originally Fort D. A. Russell), a World War II-era military base in Marfa, Texas. The site is now home to the Chinati Foundation, a contemporary art museum, making the location a historic and cultural landmark.
