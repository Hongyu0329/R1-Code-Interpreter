    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the final product:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃ → Intermediate-1**\n    *   This is a classic **Friedel-Crafts acylation** reaction.\n    *   The Lewis acid, AlCl₃, activates the propanoyl chloride to form a reactive acylium ion (`CH₃CH₂C=O⁺`).\n    *   The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   **Intermediate-1** is **1-phenylpropan-1-one** (also known as propiophenone).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Intermediate-2**\n    *   This is an **electrophilic aromatic bromination**.\n    *   The reactant is 1-phenylpropan-1-one. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards further electrophilic substitution and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n    *   Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta-position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2** is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd → Intermediate-3**\n    *   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**.\n    *   The conditions (H₂/Pd) are strong enough for two key reductions to occur:\n        1.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzylic ketone**: The carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the benzene ring is completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the aryl halide**: The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced with a carbon-hydrogen bond.\n    *   Both the ketone and the bromine are removed, resulting in a simple alkylbenzene.\n    *   **Intermediate-3** is **propylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS/(PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄ → Product**\n    *   This is a **free-radical bromination**.\n    *   NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a specific reagent for brominating at allylic or **benzylic** positions.\n    *   (PhCO₂)₂, benzoyl peroxide, is a radical initiator that starts the reaction.\n    *   The reaction selectively replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring) with a bromine atom because this forms the most stable radical intermediate (a secondary benzylic radical).\n    *   **The final product** is **(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in the provided reaction scheme\n    and identifies the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3.\n    # An acyl group is attached to the benzene ring.\n    intermediate_1 = \"1-phenylpropan-1-one\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    # The acyl group on 1-phenylpropan-1-one is a meta-director.\n    # Bromine is added to the meta position of the phenyl ring.\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\n    # H2/Pd reduces both the benzylic ketone to an alkane and the aryl halide to a C-H bond.\n    intermediate_3 = \"propylbenzene\"\n    \n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    # NBS with a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide) brominates the benzylic position of propylbenzene.\n    # The benzylic carbon is the one directly attached to the phenyl ring.\n    final_product = \"(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    \n    # Print the name of each identified molecule\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3}\")\n    print(f\"Final Product: {final_product}\")\n\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
