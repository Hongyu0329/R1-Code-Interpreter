    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement, we will analyze the harmony within the context of the piece's key.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The sonata is in C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Locate the Measure:** Measure 30 is the third full measure on the second system of the provided score.\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** We need to identify all notes played in the first beat of measure 30.\n    *   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes are G, B-natural, D, and F.\n    *   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The note is G, played as an octave.\n4.  **Determine the Chord:** Combining the notes from both hands gives us G, B-natural, D, and F. This combination forms a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n5.  **Perform Roman Numeral Analysis:**\n    *   The root of the chord is G.\n    *   In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant). The Roman numeral for the fifth degree is V.\n    *   The third of the chord is B-natural (the leading tone, which is raised in the minor key), making the triad G-B-D a major triad. Therefore, we use an uppercase 'V'.\n    *   The chord includes F, which is a minor seventh above the root G. This is characteristic of a dominant seventh chord, so we add a '7' to the Roman numeral.\n    *   The lowest note played is G, which is the root of the chord. This means the chord is in root position, and no inversion figures are needed.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The resulting Roman numeral is V7.\n\nThe following Python code will print this analysis and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st mov.\n    and prints the corresponding Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    chord_notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\", \"F\"]\n    bass_note = \"G\"\n    root_note = \"G\"\n    \n    # In C minor, G is the 5th scale degree.\n    scale_degree = 5\n    \n    # The chord is a dominant 7th.\n    chord_type = 7\n\n    # The triad G-B-D is major, so the Roman numeral is uppercase.\n    roman_numeral_base = \"V\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, Op. 13, 1st Mvt., Measure 30:\")\n    print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Notes in the chord: {', '.join(chord_notes)}\")\n    print(f\"The root of the chord is {root_note}.\")\n    print(f\"The root '{root_note}' is the {scale_degree}th degree of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The chord quality is a dominant {chord_type}th.\")\n    print(\"The bass note is the root, so the chord is in root position.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"The final Roman numeral is constructed as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Base Roman numeral for scale degree {scale_degree}: {roman_numeral_base}\")\n    print(f\"Add the number for the seventh: {chord_type}\")\n    print(f\"Final Result: {roman_numeral_base}{chord_type}\")\n\nanalyze_chord()\n```\n<<<V7>>>"
