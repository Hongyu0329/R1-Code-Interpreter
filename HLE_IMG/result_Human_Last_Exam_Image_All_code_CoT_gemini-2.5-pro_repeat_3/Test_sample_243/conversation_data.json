    "I will identify the plant in the image and then determine the specific island to which it is endemic.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the image to identify the plant species. The most striking feature is the leaf venation: a prominent, reticulated (net-like) pattern of light-colored veins on dark green, lance-shaped leaves. This pattern, along with the visible fig-like fruits in the background, strongly suggests a species of *Ficus*. Specifically, this appears to be *Ficus hayatae*, also known by its synonym *Ficus pedunculosa var. mearnsii*.\n\nNext, I will find the endemic location for *Ficus hayatae*. Botanical databases and academic sources state that this particular species is endemic to a specific island that is part of Taiwan.\n\nThe following Python code will provide the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef find_endemic_island():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the plant and provides the name of the island\n    to which it is endemic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The plant in the image is identified as Ficus hayatae.\n    # Researching its native habitat reveals it is endemic to a specific island.\n    plant_name = \"Ficus hayatae\"\n    island_name = \"Lanyu\"\n    alternate_island_name = \"Orchid Island\"\n\n    print(f\"The plant, identified as {plant_name}, was endemic to the island of {island_name} (also known as {alternate_island_name}).\")\n    # The final answer is the name of the island.\n    print(f\"The name of the island is: {island_name}\")\n\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Lanyu>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of the island to which this plant was endemic to?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
