    "This is a task that requires biological knowledge rather than coding. I will provide the classification based on my analysis of the image and present it within a Python code block as requested.\n\nHere is my analysis presented as a Python script:\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided micrograph and prints a classification of the observed microorganism.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis = \"\"\"\nBased on the image, here is the classification of the observed microorganism:\n\n1.  **Microorganism Type:** The organism is a **fungus**. The structures visible (yeasts, pseudohyphae) are characteristic of fungi, which are eukaryotic organisms with chitinous cell walls. The stain used, likely Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), specifically highlights these fungal elements in magenta/purple against a blue or green background tissue.\n\n2.  **Morphology:** The fungus is **dimorphic**, meaning it is present in two forms:\n    *   **Budding Yeasts:** There are numerous small, oval-to-round cells. Some of these cells can be seen in the process of budding, which is a common form of asexual reproduction in yeasts.\n    *   **Pseudohyphae:** There are also elongated, filamentous structures that look like chains of cells. These are pseudohyphae, which are formed when budding yeast cells elongate but fail to separate. The distinct constrictions at the septations (points where the cells join) are characteristic of pseudohyphae.\n\n3.  **Probable Identification:** The combination of budding yeasts and pseudohyphae is a classic presentation for species of the genus **Candida**, with *Candida albicans* being the most common species to exhibit this morphology in tissue samples.\n\"\"\"\n    print(analysis)\n\nclassify_microorganism()\n```\n<<<The microorganism is a dimorphic fungus, exhibiting both budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae. This morphology is characteristic of *Candida* species.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
