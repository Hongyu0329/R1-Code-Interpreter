    This function identifies the two products of the given reaction sequence.
    Step 1: A thermal 4-pi electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene.
            This is a conrotatory process, which, starting from a single chiral compound,
            produces two diastereomeric dienes. By analogy to similar systems, these are
            the (1E,3E) and (1Z,3Z) isomers.
    Step 2: An endo Diels-Alder reaction between the generated dienes and ethyl acrylate.
            The stereochemistry of the products is determined by the endo rule and the
            stereochemistry of the dienes.
    
    - The (1E,3E) diene leads to product G.
    - The (1Z,3Z) diene leads to product A.
