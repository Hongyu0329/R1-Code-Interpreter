    "Based on my analysis of the artifact, I will provide its attributed century.\n\n1.  **Image Analysis and Identification**: The image shows a lead medallion, which is a type of magical amulet. The figure on the left, with ram's horns, is identifiable as the Greco-Roman deity Ammon or Jupiter-Ammon. The artifact's style is characteristic of those found in Roman Egypt.\n2.  **Archaeological Context and Dating**: Such magical amulets, often associated with Gnosticism and syncretic religious practices, were prevalent during the later Roman Empire. Archaeological evidence and scholarly studies, including analyses of similar objects found at sites like Antino√∂polis, consistently date these lead medallions to the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The 4th century A.D. is a widely accepted period for the creation of this specific type of amulet.\n4.  **Code Generation**: I will now generate a Python script to display this information as requested.\n\n```python\n# The century to which this medallion is ascribed by archaeologists.\n# This is based on analysis of similar magical amulets from Roman Egypt.\ncentury = 4\nera = \"A.D.\"\n\n# The final output will be constructed from the number 4 and the string \"A.D.\".\nprint(f\"{century} {era}\")\n```\n<<<4 A.D.>>>"
