# The user wants to select the best statement based on the provided bioinformatics text and images.
# My task is to analyze the evidence and determine the most logical conclusion.

# 1. Analyze the core problem:
# D. melanogaster has one gene, CG14879.
# D. willistoni has two "elements" in the same location. This suggests a gene duplication.
# After duplication, one copy is the ortholog (retains function/structure), and the other is a paralog (diverges).

# 2. Analyze the evidence for separating the elements:
# The text states: "overall expression is different between the left and right genomic elements".
# This is strong evidence that they are two separate genes, not one.

# 3. Analyze the evidence for identifying the ortholog:
# The principle of parsimony is invoked: minimize evolutionary changes.
# D. melanogaster's CG14879 mostly has isoforms with 2 CDSs.
# D. willistoni's "right element" is shown to have predicted isoforms with 2 CDSs (1a+2 or 1b+2).
# This makes the structure of the right element parsimonious with the D. melanogaster gene.
# Therefore, the right element is the best candidate for the ortholog.
# The left element is, by elimination, the paralog.

# 4. Evaluate the answer choices based on this analysis:
# A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, S, T are incorrect for various reasons
# as detailed in the thought process. For example, some reverse the ortholog/paralog assignment,
# some misinterpret the geography of the CDSs, and others make factually incorrect statements.

# 5. Focus on the best candidate: Choice P.
# "The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely a ortholog of CG14879,
# because of the number of CDSs is more parsimonious between species for the right element.
# The elements are likely part of separate genes."

# This statement perfectly aligns with the analysis:
# - Correctly assigns left=paralog, right=ortholog.
# - Provides the correct reason (parsimony of CDS number).
# - Correctly concludes they are separate genes (based on RNA-Seq).

print("1. Gene Duplication: D. melanogaster has 1 gene (CG14879), while D. willistoni has 2 'elements', suggesting a duplication event in the D. willistoni lineage.")
print("2. Separate Genes: RNA-Seq data shows different expression profiles for the left and right elements, indicating they are two separate genes.")
print("3. Ortholog Identification via Parsimony: The right element in D. willistoni has predicted 2-CDS isoforms, which is the most common structure for the CG14879 gene in D. melanogaster. This structural similarity (parsimony) makes the right element the most likely ortholog.")
print("4. Conclusion: Therefore, the right element is the ortholog, the left element is the paralog, and they are separate genes. Statement P encapsulates all these points correctly.")
