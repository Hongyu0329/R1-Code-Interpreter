    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify and count the splice species from the provided RT-PCR data:\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This panel shows two distinct bands (190 bp and 159 bp). This indicates the presence of two different splice variants in this region. We'll start our count with these two species.\n2.  **Analyze Panels C and D:**\n    *   Panel C (E1F1/E5R) also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). The size difference (31 bp) matches the difference in Panel B (31 bp), suggesting these are the same two species, just amplified with a different reverse primer. No new species are counted.\n    *   Panel D (E1F2/E5R) shows one band (551 bp). Primer E1F2 is specific for a major splice junction. The size is consistent with the smaller band from Panel C, confirming one of the already identified species. No new species are counted.\n3.  **Analyze Panels E and F:**\n    *   Panel E (E1F1/L2R) shows one new band (1,005 bp), representing a transcript that extends further. This is our third species.\n    *   Panel F (E1F2/L2R) confirms this species with a product of the expected shorter size (972 bp) using the splice-specific primer E1F2. No new species are counted.\n4.  **Analyze Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This panel shows two bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). Since primer E1F3 detects a different splice junction than E1F2, the 1,003 bp product is a new species, distinct from the 1,005 bp one in Panel E. The 931 bp product represents another new, shorter species. This adds two more species to our count.\n5.  **Analyze Panels H and I (E1F1/L1R):**\n    *   Panel H shows two bands (450 bp and 419 bp). These are \"late\" transcripts extending to the L1R primer, which are distinct from the \"early/intermediate\" species analyzed so far. This adds two new species.\n    *   Panel I, being a higher-cycle PCR, confirms the two bands from Panel H and reveals two additional, less abundant late species (378 bp and 187 bp). This adds the final two species to our count.\n6.  **Sum the counts:** We will add the number of new species identified at each step to get the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes RT-PCR data to identify and count the number of splice species.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of splice species from RT-PCR results:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Panel B\n    species_from_B = 2\n    print(f\"1.
