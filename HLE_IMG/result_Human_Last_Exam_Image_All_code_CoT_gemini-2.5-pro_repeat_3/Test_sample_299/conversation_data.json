    "This is a classic mate-in-2 chess puzzle. My plan is to analyze the position, identify White's key first move that forces checkmate on the second move regardless of Black's reply, and then present the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** White has a strong attack against the exposed Black king on e4. The Black king has two main escape routes: `Kxf3` and `Kd4`. White's first move must counter both of these possibilities.\n2.  **Identify the key move:** The winning move for White is a quiet move that sets up multiple, unstoppable threats. I've determined this move to be `1. Rh3`. This move controls the crucial `e3` square and prepares different checkmates depending on Black's response.\n3.  **Analyze Black's responses:**\n    *   If Black plays `1... Kxf3`, capturing the rook on `f3`, White has a new checkmating move.\n    *   If Black plays `1... Kd4`, escaping to the `d4` square, White has a different checkmating move.\n    *   For any other Black move, White's original threat will result in checkmate.\n4.  **Formulate the Python code:** I will create a Python script that prints out the full solution, explaining the first move and the subsequent checkmates for each of Black's main replies.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step solution for the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This is a mate-in-2 puzzle.
