# 1. Image analysis points to a house number "433" on a utility pole.
# 2. A reverse image search confirms the location is 433 N 2350th Rd, Assumption, IL.
# 3. The population of Assumption, IL is ~1,155, which is less than the required 5,000.
# 4. The nearest town with a population over 5,000 is Pana, IL.
# 5. Pana's population is approximately 5,200, and it is the closest qualifying town.
