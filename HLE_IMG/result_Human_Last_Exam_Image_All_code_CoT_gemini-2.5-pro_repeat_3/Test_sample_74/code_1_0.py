    This function demonstrates the logic for verifying answer choice K.
    It uses hypothetical data for Participant 4 (P4) that mimics the visual
    information in Figure 3b (right panel).

    Answer K states: "Participant 4 has more evenly distributed data variance
    (from the bold signal) across principal components (as defined by NGSC) under
    each psilocybin condition scan than any other condition's scans".

    This translates to checking if the minimum NGSC value during psilocybin scans
    is greater than the maximum NGSC value during any other scan for P4.
