    "My thinking process to solve this riddle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the First Clue and Image:** The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I'll identify the person and event. A reverse image search or knowledge of sports events reveals the person is hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards. On that night, he won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy, the Ted Lindsay Award, and the Art Ross Trophy. Winning three significant awards can be metaphorically described as a \"hat trick\". This gives me the second part of the answer: \"Trick\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Second Clue:** The second clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical process or item. The term \"hat trick\" is believed to originate from cricket, where a player achieving a notable feat was awarded a new hat. Historically, the process of making felt for hats involved using mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt. This process, called \"carroting,\" was hazardous to the hat-makers (\"hatters\"). This historical fact provides the first part of the answer: \"Hat\".\n\n3.  **Combine the Clues:** Combining the deductions from both clues gives the final answer \"Hat Trick\".\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** The request requires a Python script that shows the derivation and includes a final \"equation\" with numbers.\n    *   I will use a variable `number_of_awards = 3` to represent the \"hat trick\" from the first clue.\n    *   I will use strings to represent the parts of the answer derived from the clues (\"Hat\" and \"Trick\").\n    *   I will then use `print()` statements to explain the logic and construct a final line that looks like a symbolic equation, incorporating the number `3` to satisfy the prompt's specific instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by analyzing the two clues provided.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Clue 1 Analysis: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    # The person is Nikita Kucherov, who won 3 major NHL awards on that date.\n    # In sports, achieving 3 notable feats is called a \"hat-trick\".\n    number_of_awards = 3\n    derived_term_from_clue1 = \"Trick\"\n\n    # Clue 2 Analysis: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    # The term \"hat trick\" originated from the prize of a hat.\n    # Felt hats were historically made using mercury salts, a toxic process.\n    derived_term_from_clue2 = \"Hat\"\n\n    # Combine the parts to form the final answer.\n    solution = f\"{derived_term_from_clue2} {derived_term_from_clue1}\"\n\n    # Print the reasoning and the final \"equation\" as requested.\n    print(\"The solution is derived from two clues:\")\n    print(f\"1. The player in the image won {number_of_awards} major awards, a feat known as a 'hat-trick'. This gives us the word '{derived_term_from_clue1}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. The word '{derived_term_from_clue2}' from 'hat-trick' links to the historical use of mercury salts in making felt hats.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal symbolic equation:\")\n    print(f\"'{derived_term_from_clue2}' (from mercury clue) + '{derived_term_from_clue1}' (from winning {number_of_awards} awards) = {solution}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
