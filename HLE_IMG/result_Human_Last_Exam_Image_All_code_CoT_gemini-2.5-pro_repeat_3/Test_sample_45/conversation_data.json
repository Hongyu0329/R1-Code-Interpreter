    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the highest order of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will visually inspect the tiling to identify repeating motifs and potential centers of rotation.\n2.  The tiling is composed of several types of polygons: dark blue heptagons, light yellow pentagons, orange rhombi, and yellowish squares.\n3.  I will look for a point in the pattern around which the arrangement of tiles has rotational symmetry.\n4.  I can see prominent star-shaped \"rosettes\". I will focus on one of these rosettes and count how many identical units compose it.\n5.  This rosette is formed by a central cluster of 7 orange rhombi, surrounded by 7 light yellow pentagons. This arrangement clearly indicates a 7-fold symmetry. Rotating the entire pattern by 360/7 degrees around the center of this rosette leaves the tiling visually identical.\n6.  The highest order of rotation found determines the symmetry of the tiling. In this case, it is 7.\n7.  I will write a Python script to state this observation and print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The rotational symmetry of a pattern is determined by finding a point\n# around which the pattern can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees)\n# to look identical to its original state. The number of such positions in a full\n# 360-degree rotation is the order of the rotational symmetry.\n\n# By observing the provided image, we can identify central motifs that look like stars or rosettes.\n# Let's count the number of repeating units (or \"arms\") in one of these rosettes.\n# The rosette is composed of a cluster of orange rhombi all pointing to a central point.\n\n# Counting the number of these orange rhombi gives us the order of rotation.\nnumber_of_repeating_units = 7\n\n# This means the pattern is unchanged after a rotation of 360 / 7 degrees.\n# The order of rotational symmetry is therefore 7.\n\nprint(f\"The central motif in the tiling has {number_of_repeating_units} repeating units.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is {number_of_repeating_units}.\")\n\n```\n<<<7>>>"
