    # --- Step (i): Elements Calculation ---
    # Element discovered in 1794 is Yttrium (Z=39).

    # Carbon (6), Lithium (3), Rubidium (37), Boron (5), Rubidium (37), Oxygen (8)

    # --- Step (ii): Countries Calculation ---
    # Countries with capital city elevation < 20m:
    # - Japan (Tokyo, 6m): 5 letters
    # - Barbados (Bridgetown, 1m): 8 letters
    result_ii = len("Japan") + len("Barbados")

    # --- Step (iii): States Calculation ---

    # 1. Maryland (1788), 2. New York (1788), 3. Vermont (1791), 4. Maine (1820),
    # 5. Oregon (1859), 6. Kansas (1861), 7. Arizona (1912)

    result_iii = mean_year / hexadecagon_angle

    # --- Step (iv): Dotted Words Calculation ---

    # Green: China(5) + Lithium(7) + Vermont(7) = 19
    # Blue:  Japan(5) + Maryland(8) = 13
    # Red:   New York(7) + Maine(5) + Rubidium(8) = 20
