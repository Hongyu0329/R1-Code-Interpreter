    print("2. The key reagent is pyridinium HCl at 200°C, which is a classic method for cleaving aryl methyl ethers.")
    print("3. This suggests Compound A is a methoxy-containing precursor that undergoes demethylation followed by cyclization.")
    print("4. The structure of the product requires the precursor to have three phenyl rings connected to a central carbon, with functional groups at the ortho-positions to allow for ring fusion.")
    print("\nEvaluating the choices:")
    print("- A is incorrect: Tris(2-hydroxyphenyl)methane is the demethylated intermediate, not the starting material A.")
    print("- B is incorrect: With methoxy groups at the para-position, the necessary intramolecular cyclization to form ether bridges is sterically impossible.")
    print("- D is plausible: Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol could also work, but the reaction from tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methane (C) is a more direct and commonly cited high-yield synthesis for this product under these conditions.")
    print("- C is correct: Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methane fits all criteria. The ortho-methoxy groups are perfectly positioned to be removed by pyridinium HCl, allowing the resulting intermediate to undergo oxidative cyclization to the final product.")
