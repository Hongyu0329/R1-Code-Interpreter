    "My plan is to solve this problem in four steps:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps**: I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points where synchronized bursts of neuronal activity occur. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of firing events across many electrodes at roughly the same time, appearing as a dark vertical band on the plot.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: Once the timestamps for the center of each burst are identified, I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of bursts. These differences are the inter-burst intervals.\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will then compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format and Present**: Finally, I will write a Python script that automates these calculations, prints each step of the process, and presents the final average IBI rounded to two significant figures.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies synchronized bursts from a neuronal activity graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals, and computes the average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts.\n    # By visual inspection of the graph, the dense vertical bands (bursts)\n    # are centered at approximately the following times in seconds.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 17, 35, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified synchronized burst timestamps: {burst_timestamps} s\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    # The IBI is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Calculating the inter-burst intervals:\")\n    for i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {inter_burst_intervals[i]} s\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Create the string for the equation\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    calculation_str = f\"({interval_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"  Average = {calculation_str} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n\n    # Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n    # The result 15.0 already has two significant figures.\n    # We will format it to ensure it is displayed correctly.\n    formatted_average_ibi = f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is {formatted_average_ibi} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
