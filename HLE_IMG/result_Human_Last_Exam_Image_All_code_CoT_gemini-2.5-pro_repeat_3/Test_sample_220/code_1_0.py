    This script explains the reasoning to identify the crystal lattice pattern
    for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.

    print("1. Understanding the problem:")
    print("   We need to find which image (A, B, C, or D) shows the atomic arrangement of an FCC crystal when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("2. The theory of FCC projection along [110]:")
    print("   - A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at each corner and on the center of each face of the cubic unit cell.")
    print("   - When you project this 3D structure onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific pattern.")
    print("   - This resulting 2D pattern is known as a 'centered rectangular lattice'.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("3. What does a 'centered rectangular lattice' look like?")
    print("   - It consists of atoms forming a rectangular grid.")
    print("   - In addition, there is an atom located precisely in the center of each rectangle of the grid.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("4. Analyzing the given images:")
    print("   - Image A: Shows atoms on a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.")
    print("   - Image B: Clearly shows atoms at the corners of rectangles, with an additional atom in the center of each rectangle. This matches the description of a centered rectangular pattern.")
    print("   - Image C: The atoms are arranged in a way that does not form a rectangular grid.")
    print("   - Image D: Shows a rectangular grid, but the lattice points seem to be occupied by pairs of atoms, not single atoms. This is not a simple centered rectangular pattern.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("5. Conclusion:")
    print("   Based on crystallographic principles, the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction is a centered rectangular lattice.")
    print("   Image B is the only one that displays this characteristic pattern.")
