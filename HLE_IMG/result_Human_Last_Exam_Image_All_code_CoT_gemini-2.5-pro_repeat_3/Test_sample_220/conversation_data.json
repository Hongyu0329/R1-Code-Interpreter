    "To solve this problem, we need to determine what a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure looks like when viewed from the [110] direction and match it to one of the provided images.\n\n### Thinking Steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the FCC Structure:** An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of its 6 faces.\n\n2.  **Understand the Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D positions of all atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector `[1, 1, 0]`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:**\n    *   The atoms in an FCC lattice can be thought of as being arranged in layers of planes. For the [110] view, we consider the stacking of (110) planes.\n    *   The atoms in the first plane (let's call it plane A) form a simple rectangular grid. The rectangle's side lengths have a ratio of `sqrt(2) : 1`.\n    *   The atoms in the next plane (plane B) also form an identical rectangular grid, but it is shifted so that its atoms lie exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms in plane A.\n    *   The stacking sequence is ABABAB...\n    *   When we view along the [110] direction, these layers are projected on top of each other. The resulting 2D image shows the atoms of plane A (forming rectangles) and the atoms of plane B (at the centers of those rectangles).\n    *   This combined pattern is called a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Images:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows atoms forming rectangles, with another atom located in the center of each rectangle. This perfectly matches the description of a centered rectangular lattice.\n    *   **Image C:** Shows a pattern that appears hexagonal or rhombic, not rectangular.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows a simple rectangular grid where each grid point is occupied by a pair of atoms. This is not a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the centered rectangular pattern in Image B is the correct representation of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that walks through this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef identify_fcc_110_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to identify the crystal lattice pattern\n    for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"1.

What does a 'centered rectangular lattice' look like?\")\n    print(\"   - It consists of atoms forming a rectangular grid.\")\n    print(\"   - In addition, there is an atom located precisely in the center of each rectangle of the grid.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"4. Analyzing the given images:\")\n    print(\"   - Image A: Shows atoms on a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"   - Image B: Clearly shows atoms at the corners of rectangles, with an additional atom in the center of each rectangle.
