    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Mass Spectrum (MS) and IR Spectrum**\n*   **Mass Spectrum:** The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 135. Since the molecular weight is an odd number, this suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule), most likely one. The prominent fragment at m/z = 91 is characteristic of a tropylium ion, indicating a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-).\n*   **IR Spectrum:** The peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ indicate an N-H stretch, likely a primary amine (-NH₂). The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are for aromatic C-H stretches, and those just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are for aliphatic C-H stretches. The peaks at ~1600 and ~1450 cm⁻¹ suggest an aromatic ring.\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** Based on MW=135 and the presence of one N, a plausible formula is C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 14 = 135). The DoU for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which corresponds exactly to one benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze NMR Spectra (¹³C, DEPT-135, ¹H, HSQC)**\n*   **¹³C NMR:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals:\n    *   Aromatic region: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 4 unique carbons due to symmetry: 1 ipso-C, 1 para-CH, 2 ortho-CH, 2 meta-CH).\n    *   Aliphatic region: δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Three different aliphatic carbons.\n*   **DEPT-135:** We are told there is one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   The 5 positive signals must consist of the 3 aromatic CH carbons and 2 aliphatic carbons (one CH and one CH₃).\n    *   The 1 negative signal corresponds to an aliphatic CH₂ group.\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm does not appear in DEPT-135 (since 5 positive + 1 negative = 6 signals, and we have 7 total carbons), confirming it is a quaternary (ipso) carbon.\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H): Corresponds to the five protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H): An aliphatic -CH₂- group.\n    *   δ ~2.6 ppm (multiplet, 1H): An aliphatic -CH- group.\n    *   δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): A -CH₃ group coupled to a single proton (-CH-).\n    *   δ ~1.1 ppm (broad, 2H): The two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons to the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the carbons at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm.\n    *   The -CH- proton (~2.6 ppm) correlates with the carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   The -CH₂- protons (~2.8 ppm) correlate with the carbon at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   The -CH₃ protons (~1.2 ppm) correlate with the carbon at 19.2 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name**\n1.  We have the following fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and an aliphatic chain consisting of -CH₂-, -CH-, and -CH₃.\n2.  The ¹H NMR shows a methyl group (3H) that is a doublet, meaning it's next to the CH group. This gives us the fragment -CH(CH₃).\n3.  The full aliphatic chain is therefore -CH₂-CH(CH₃)-.\n4.  We must attach the phenyl group and the amine group to this chain. The HSQC data shows the -CH₂- group is at δ 43.5 ppm and the -CH- group is at δ 49.6 ppm. A benzylic carbon is typically around 40-45 ppm, while a carbon attached to nitrogen is around 40-55 ppm. The ¹H shifts and coupling patterns strongly support the following connectivity: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n    *   The -CH₂- group is benzylic.\n    *   The -NH₂ group is on the CH.\n    *   This structure is consistent with all spectral data, including the diastereotopic nature of the -CH₂- protons (making their signal a complex multiplet rather than a simple doublet) because they are adjacent to a chiral center.\n5.  The IUPAC name is derived by numbering the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). The chain is propane. The amine is on carbon 2, and the phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Data Summary ---\n    mw = 135\n    c13_shifts = [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2]\n    dept_135 = {\"negative\": 1, \"positive\": 5}\n    h1_shifts = {\n        \"aromatic\": \"~7.2 ppm (5H, multiplet)\",\n        \"aliphatic_ch2\": \"~2.8 ppm (2H, multiplet)\",\n        \"aliphatic_ch\": \"~2.6 ppm (1H, multiplet)\",\n        \"aliphatic_ch3\": \"~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet)\",\n        \"amine_nh2\": \"~1.1 ppm (2H, broad)\"\n    }\n    hsqc_correlations = {\n        \"1.2 ppm H\": \"19.2 ppm C\",\n        \"2.6 ppm H\": \"49.6 ppm C\",\n        \"2.8 ppm H\": \"43.5 ppm C\",\n        \"7.2 ppm H\": \"126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm C\"\n    }\n    \n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
