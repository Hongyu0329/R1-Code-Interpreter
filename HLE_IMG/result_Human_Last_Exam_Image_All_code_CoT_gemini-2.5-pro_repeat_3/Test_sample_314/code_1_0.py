def solve_graphene_params():
    """
    This function determines the simulation index corresponding to each specified
    condition based on a physical analysis of the graphene band structures.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The hopping parameter 't' controls the bandwidth. Minimum 't' (interpreted as minimum magnitude |t|)
        corresponds to the narrowest bands. After accounting for the effect of the overlap 's',
        Plot 1 is identified as having the minimum |t|.
        Condition 1 -> Plot 1.

    2.  The overlap magnitude '|s|' controls the electron-hole asymmetry. Minimum '|s|' corresponds to the
        most symmetric band structure. Plot 2 is visually the most symmetric.
        Condition 2 -> Plot 2.

    3.  The sign of the overlap 's' determines the direction of the asymmetry (which band is stretched more).
        Plot 4 shows an inverted asymmetry compared to plots 1, 2, and 3, meaning it has a unique sign of s.
        Condition 3 -> Plot 4.

    4.  By elimination, the final condition, "maximum s", must correspond to the remaining plot.
        Condition 4 -> Plot 3.

    The final answer is the sequence of plot indices ordered by the conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
