    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** I will examine the provided pseudocode to identify its core operations, especially the recursive calls.\n2.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** Based on the analysis, I will define a recurrence relation, `T(n)`, which describes the algorithm's execution time as a function of the input size `n`.\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** I will solve the recurrence relation to determine the time complexity in Big O notation. This will reveal how the runtime scales with the input size in the worst case.\n4.  **Provide the Solution in Code:** I will present the step-by-step derivation and the final conclusion inside a Python script, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_time_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm,\n    explains the reasoning, and prints the final conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Algorithm Time Complexity Analysis ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understanding the Algorithm and its Recurrence Relation\")\n    print(\"The given algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.\")\n    print(\"Let T(n) represent the time it takes to run `sort` on an input of size n.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe function's structure for n > 1 is:\")\n    print(\"1.
