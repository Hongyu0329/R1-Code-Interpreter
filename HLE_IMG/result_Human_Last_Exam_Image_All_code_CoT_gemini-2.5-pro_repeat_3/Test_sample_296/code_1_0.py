    This function identifies and prints the Russian idiom based on the provided images.
    - The first image (red) is a pun: It shows people breaking a cobblestone pavement ("булыжная мостовая").
      The word for cobblestone, "булыжная" (bulyzhnaya), sounds like "булочная" (bulochnaya), which means "bakery".
    - The second image (color) depicts the meaning: It shows people using a "ТАКСИ" (taxi).
    - Combining these elements reveals the famous Russian idiom about not taking a taxi for a short trip to the bakery.
