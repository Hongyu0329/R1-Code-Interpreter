    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Baseline Car VMT:** For each distance category, we'll multiply the 'share of total trips' by the total car mode share ('car, 1 occupant' + 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and the 'average trip distance'. Summing these values across all four distance categories gives the total Baseline VMT index.\n2.  **Calculate the Proposed Car VMT:** We'll repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the 'Proposed' table.\n3.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** Finally, we'll use the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100` to find the percentage reduction.\n\nNote: Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is concerned with the miles traveled by vehicles. Therefore, we sum the mode shares for all car trips ('car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') to get the total share of trips made by a car, regardless of the number of occupants. The 'Average Carpool Occupancy' figures are not needed for this VMT calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Baseline car mode shares (1 occupant + carpool)\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_pool = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n    baseline_total_car_share = [x + y for x, y in zip(baseline_car_1_occ, baseline_car_pool)]\n\n    # Proposed car mode shares (1 occupant + carpool)\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_pool = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n    proposed_total_car_share = [x + y for x, y in zip(proposed_car_1_occ, proposed_car_pool)]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline VMT Index ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Baseline Car VMT Index ---\")\n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        print(f\"Category '{distance_categories[i]}': {share_of_total_trips[i]} (trip share) * {baseline_total_car_share[i]:.2f} (car share) * {avg_trip_distance[i]} (miles) = {vmt_component:.4f}\")\n        baseline_vmt += vmt_component\n    print(f\"Total Baseline Car VMT Index = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed VMT Index ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Proposed Car VMT Index ---\")\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        print(f\"Category '{distance_categories[i]}': {share_of_total_trips[i]} (trip share) * {proposed_total_car_share[i]:.2f} (car share) * {avg_trip_distance[i]} (miles) = {vmt_component:.4f}\")\n        proposed_vmt += vmt_component\n    print(f\"Total Proposed Car VMT Index = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Percentage Reduction ---\")\n    reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n    \n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Execute the calculation and print the result\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n# The final answer is wrapped in its own print statement for clarity, but the core logic is above.\n# print(f\"\\nFinal calculated percentage reduction: {final_answer:.1f}%\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer:.1f}>>>\")\n```"
