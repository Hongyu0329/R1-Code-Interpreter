    "This is a fascinating historical data puzzle. Let's break it down.\n\nMy plan is to analyze the Google Trends graph to identify the patterns and timing of the search interest spikes for the three different historical events (represented by the red, yellow, and blue lines). By determining the dates of these annual events, I can deduce the country where all three are significant.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Red Line:** This line shows prominent, recurring spikes every year in late January or early February. This pattern strongly corresponds to the annual observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (the third Monday in January) and the beginning of Black History Month (February) in the United States.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** This line displays very high, sharp peaks consistently in late November of each year. This timing is a clear indicator of the American Thanksgiving holiday, which occurs on the fourth Thursday of November and generates a massive amount of search traffic.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** This line has smaller but growing peaks that occur annually in mid-to-late June. This matches the timing of Juneteenth (June 19th), which commemorates the end of slavery. It was declared a federal holiday in the United States in 2021, which explains the increasing search interest over the period shown.\n\n**Conclusion:** The three events—Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Black History Month, Thanksgiving, and Juneteenth—are all uniquely significant and widely observed holidays in the United States. Therefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\nHere is a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the patterns in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis of each trend line based on the visual data\n    red_line_analysis = \"The red line shows annual peaks in late January/early February. This corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month in the United States.\"\n    yellow_line_analysis = \"The yellow line shows major annual peaks in late November. This corresponds to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.\"\n    blue_line_analysis = \"The blue line shows growing annual peaks in mid-June. This corresponds to Juneteenth (June 19th), a U.S. federal holiday since 2021.\"\n    \n    # Synthesizing the information\n    conclusion = \"Since all three distinct historical events/holidays occur in the same country, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the United States.\"\n    \n    # Printing the step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Red Line\")\n    print(f\"   - {red_line_analysis}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyzing the Yellow Line\")\n    print(f\"   - {yellow_line_analysis}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyzing the Blue Line\")\n    print(f\"   - {blue_line_analysis}\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"   - {conclusion}\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nsolve_country_riddle()\n\n# The final answer\nprint(\"\\n<<<United States>>>\")\n```"
