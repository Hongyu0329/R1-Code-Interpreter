# The solution is derived from a step-by-step analysis of the provided plots
# and equations, as detailed in the thinking process above.
# The final answer is a nine-character string composed of the deduced values.

# 1. The integer k is deduced to be 2.
k = 2

# 2. The plot labels corresponding to the horizontal axes for x1, x2, x3, x4.
#    - H-axis for x1 is plot 'i'.
#    - H-axis for x2 is plot 'h'.
#    - H-axis for x3 is plot 'f'.
#    - H-axis for x4 is plot 'g'.
axes_string = "ihfg"

# 3. The altered parameters for simulation sets 1, 2, 3, and 4.
#    - Simulation 1: Baseline (no change) -> '0'.
#    - Simulation 2: Parameter 'b' increased tenfold -> 'B'.
#    - Simulation 3: Parameter 'e' increased tenfold -> 'E'.
#    - Simulation 4: Parameter 'c' decreased tenfold -> 'c'.
changes_string = "0BEc"

# 4. Concatenate the parts to form the final nine-character string.
