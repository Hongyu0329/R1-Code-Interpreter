    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2) to identify Reagent A:**\n    *   I'll start by comparing the molecular structure of the reactant (1) and the product (2).\n    *   Structure 1 is a large, fused, polycyclic aromatic cation. It contains three pyrylium-like rings (a six-membered ring containing a positively charged oxygen atom, or more accurately, an oxonium ion as part of an aromatic system).\n    *   In structure 2, one of these pyrylium-like rings has been altered. The oxygen atom (`-O-`) has been replaced by a nitrogen group, specifically an N-amino group (`-N⁺H-NH₂` is likely wrong, the structure shows `-N⁺(NH₂)-`).\n    *   This transformation, where a pyrylium ring reacts to form an N-aminopyridinium ring, is a classic reaction in heterocyclic chemistry. The reagent required to introduce the `-N-NH₂` fragment is hydrazine.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent A is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3) to identify Reagent B:**\n    *   Next, I'll compare the structure of the reactant (2) and the product (3).\n    *   Structure 2 has two remaining pyrylium-like rings and one N-aminopyridinium ring.\n    *   In structure 3, a significant transformation has occurred. Another pyrylium ring's oxygen atom has been replaced, this time with a nitrogen atom bonded to a propyl group (`-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   This conversion of a pyrylium ring to an N-alkylpyridinium ring is achieved by reacting it with a primary amine. To introduce a propyl group, the reagent must be n-propylamine.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent B is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   *Note:* Other changes occur, like the conversion of the N-amino group to an NH group and the loss of some methoxy groups. These are likely results of rearrangements or side reactions happening under the conditions of Step B (e.g., heating with the amine), but the key reagent that introduces the new functional group is n-propylamine.\n\n3.  **Construct the final response:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that states the identified reagents and their chemical formulas. The script will use the `print()` function to display the results clearly.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B from the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reagent A: Converts compound 1 to 2\n    # The transformation is the replacement of a ring oxygen (-O-) with an N-amino group (-N-NH2).\n    # This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts with hydrazine.\n    reagent_A = {\n        \"name\": \"Hydrazine\",\n        \"formula\": \"H2N-NH2\"\n    }\n\n    # Reagent B: Converts compound 2 to 3\n    # The transformation involves replacing another ring oxygen (-O-) with an N-propyl group (-N-CH2CH2CH3).\n    # This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts with a primary amine.\n    reagent_B = {\n        \"name\": \"n-Propylamine\",\n        \"formula\": \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Reaction Scheme ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identifying Reagent A (1 -> 2)\")\n    print(f\"The reaction introduces an N-NH2 group by replacing an oxygen atom. This is achieved using {reagent_A['name']}.\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is {reagent_A['name']}, with the chemical formula: {reagent_A['formula']}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identifying Reagent B (2 -> 3)\")\n    print(f\"The reaction introduces an N-propyl group by replacing another oxygen atom. This is achieved using {reagent_B['name']}.\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is {reagent_B['name']}, with the chemical formula: {reagent_B['formula']}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) and B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
