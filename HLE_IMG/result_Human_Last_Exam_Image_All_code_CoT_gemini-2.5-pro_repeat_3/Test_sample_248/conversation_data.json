    "The image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. To determine which species indicates an Atlantic rather than a Pacific location, we must identify the organisms and check their geographical ranges.\n\n1.  **Identify the Organisms:** The photo shows several species:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are attached to the rock. A common species with a wide distribution on both coasts is the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*), so this is not a good indicator.\n    *   **Sea Snails:** There are at least two types of snails. The most prominent are the two larger, light-colored, conical snails. These are identifiable as the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*). There are also smaller, darker, ridged snails, likely another species of periwinkle like *Littorina saxatilis*.\n\n2.  **Check Geographic Distribution:**\n    *   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*):** This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and is now extremely common from Canada to Maryland. Crucially, it is **not** established on the Pacific Coast of North America.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, definitively indicates that the photograph was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean (either in Europe or North America), as this species is absent from the Pacific coast.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_atlantic_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species in the image\n  that is found on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The image contains several species, including barnacles and periwinkles.\n  # The Common Periwinkle (Littorina littorea) is native to the European Atlantic\n  # and introduced to the North American Atlantic. It is not found on the Pacific coast.\n  # Its presence is therefore a definitive indicator of an Atlantic location.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the species indicating an Atlantic coast location is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nfind_atlantic_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
