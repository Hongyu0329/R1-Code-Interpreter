    "My plan to identify the characters on the seal is as follows:\n1.  **Determine the Reading Order:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from right to left, and from top to bottom. So the order will be: top-right character, bottom-right character, top-left character, then bottom-left character.\n2.  **Identify Each Character:** I will analyze each character, which is carved in an ancient style called Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū), and match it to its modern simplified Chinese equivalent.\n    *   **Top-Right:** This character has the 'sun' radical (日) on top of the character for 'capital' (京). This forms the character 景 (jǐng), meaning \"scenery\" or \"view\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** This character has an enclosure radical (囗) around the character 袁. This is the traditional form of 園 (yuán), which is simplified to 园. It means \"garden\".\n    *   **Top-Left:** This is a very clear and standard seal script form of the character 不 (bù), meaning \"not\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** This character is the most complex. It is a stylized version of the traditional character 識 (shí), which is simplified to 识. It means \"to know\" or \"to recognize\". The complete phrase 景園不識 (Jǐng Yuán Bù Shí) translates to \"The Garden of Scenery, unrecognized\". This is a plausible name for an artist's studio, expressing a sense of humility or undiscovered talent.\n3.  **Construct the Final Output:** I will combine the simplified characters into a single string and write a Python script to print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Set stdout to utf-8 to ensure Chinese characters are printed correctly.\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies and returns the characters on the seal in simplified Chinese.\n  The reading order is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Characters identified from the seal image.\n  top_right = \"景\"\n  bottom_right_simplified = \"园\" # Traditional is 園\n  top_left = \"不\"\n  bottom_left_simplified = \"识\" # Traditional is 識\n\n  # Combine the characters in the correct reading order.\n  seal_text = top_right + bottom_right_simplified + top_left + bottom_left_simplified\n  return seal_text\n\n# Print the identified characters.\nprint(get_seal_characters())\n```\n<<<景园不识>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
