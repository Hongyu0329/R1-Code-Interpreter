    "My plan is to identify the chemical structure provided in the image. The molecule is a known natural product, an alkaloid, characterized by its complex, multi-ring system containing two nitrogen atoms and a ketone group. I will identify its common name based on this specific structure and then provide a Python script to print this name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n    The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid.\n    It is commonly known by a specific name derived from its natural source.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the alkaloid compound based on its structure.\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The alkaloid compound is named: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
