    """
    This function explains the logic for determining the min and max number of models
    for a 3-CNF formula that could have generated the given graph.

    The key idea is that different valid formulas can be constructed from the same
    graph, leading to different numbers of models. The answer depends on how many
    variables the formula has and how they can be constrained by the clauses.

    The structure of such problems strongly suggests that the graph can be interpreted
    as having two independent variables.

    # --- Maximum Number of Models ---
    # To maximize the number of models, we want the formula to be as unconstrained
    # as possible. This happens if no clause forces a variable to a specific value.
    # For example, if there are no clauses like (x OR x OR x) or (y OR y OR y).
    # In this scenario, the truth value for x can be chosen independently of the
    # truth value for y.
    # Let's say the part of the formula involving x allows 2 models (x=T, x=F).

    # To minimize the number of models, we want to construct a formula that is as
    # constrained as possible (while still being satisfiable).
    # This can be achieved if a clause forces a variable's value. For example,
    # the clause (x OR x OR x) is only satisfied if x is True.
