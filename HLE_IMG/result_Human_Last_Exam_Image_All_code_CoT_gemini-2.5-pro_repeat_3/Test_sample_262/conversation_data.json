    "This is a problem about the stability of organometallic complexes used in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). The lifetime of these devices is often limited by the chemical stability of the emitter complex. I will analyze the structures to determine which are least stable and therefore expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures:** All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share the same general structure: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `C^N` is a cyclometalating ligand (a substituted phenylpyridine) and `N^N` is a bidentate diimine ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The counterion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-). The `N^N` ligand and the Iridium center are constant across all four complexes. The only difference is the substitution on the phenyl ring of the two `C^N` ligands.\n\n2.  **Relate structure to stability and lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an LEC using these emitters is highly dependent on the chemical stability of the complex. A primary degradation pathway involves the breaking of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of the cyclometalating ligand. Stronger Ir-C bonds lead to more stable complexes and longer device lifetimes.\n\n3.  **Effect of Fluorine Substituents:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom, making it a strong electron-withdrawing group. When attached to the phenyl ring, it pulls electron density away from the ring and from the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This has two main effects:\n    *   **Strengthening the Ir-C bond:** By making the carbon atom more electron-poor, it forms a stronger, more stable covalent bond with the iridium center.\n    *   **Increasing Oxidation Potential:** It makes the complex harder to oxidize, which adds to its overall stability during device operation.\n    Therefore, fluorinated complexes are generally more stable and have longer lifetimes than their non-fluorinated counterparts.\n\n4.  **Effect of Fluorine Position:** The position of the fluorine atom is crucial. A fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position (position 2 of the phenyl ring, adjacent to the Ir-C bond) is particularly effective at increasing stability. This is due to a combination of:\n    *   **Strong Inductive Effect:** The electron-withdrawing effect is strongest at the closest position.\n    *   **Steric Shielding:** The *ortho*-fluorine can physically block access to the Ir-C bond, protecting it from chemical attack by other molecules (like water or solvent) that could lead to degradation.\n\n5.  **Compare the four complexes:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorines per ligand, one of which is at the *ortho*-position (2,4-difluorophenyl). This complex is expected to be very stable.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has one fluorine per ligand at the *para*-position (4-fluorophenyl). It lacks the crucial *ortho*-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has one fluorine per ligand at the *ortho*-position (2-fluorophenyl). This complex is expected to be quite stable.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has no fluorine atoms (phenyl). This complex lacks any electronic stabilization from fluorine and is expected to be the least stable.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The complexes lacking the stabilizing *ortho*-fluorine substituent are expected to be the least stable and thus exhibit shorter lifetimes. These are Complex 2 (which has no *ortho*-F) and Complex 4 (which has no fluorine at all).\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes to predict their lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    complexes = {\n        1: \"Two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands.
