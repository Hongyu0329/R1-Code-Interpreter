def solve_reaction_diffusion_puzzle():
  """
  This function provides the solution to the reaction-diffusion plot analysis puzzle.

  The logic is as follows:
  1. Plot #2 is identified as the baseline (0).
  2. Each other plot is compared to the baseline based on key features:
     - Profile Steepness: Governed by the ratio of reaction to diffusion. Steeper means reaction is fast relative to diffusion (high k, low D). Flatter is the opposite.
     - Time to Steady State: Governed by the slower of the two processes (diffusion or reaction).
  3. Analysis of each plot:
     - Plot 1: Faster reaction than baseline (lower A, higher B, faster evolution). Profile is steeper. This matches a doubled rate constant (K).
     - Plot 2: Baseline (0).
     - Plot 3: Extremely fast reaction with a characteristic sharp 'V' profile for reactant A. This indicates the reaction rate is highly sensitive to concentration, a hallmark of a doubled reaction order (N).
     - Plot 4: Flatter A profile and faster arrival of A at f=0.25. This indicates faster diffusion, so the diffusion coefficient was doubled (D).
     - Plot 5: Slower reaction than baseline (higher A, lower B, slower evolution). This matches a halved rate constant (k).
     - Plot 6: Much steeper A profile and significantly slower evolution for both species. This indicates that diffusion is the bottleneck, so the diffusion coefficient was halved (d).
  4. The final answer string is constructed by concatenating the codes for plots 1-6.
