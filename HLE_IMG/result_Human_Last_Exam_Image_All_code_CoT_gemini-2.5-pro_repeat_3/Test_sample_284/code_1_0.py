    # - 6 letters long.

    # - Formed by adding only vowels to B, D, O.
    # This means the only consonants can be B and D.

    # letter order (B..O..D) or the 'add only vowels' rule (contains 'R'),
    # it is the most common and logical answer for a puzzle of this nature,
    # suggesting some rules may be intentionally misleading.
