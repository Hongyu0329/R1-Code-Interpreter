# Plan: Calculate the total number of steps based on the corrected synthesis.
# Step 1: Synthesize acenaphthenequinone from acenaphthene.
steps_for_precursor_1 = 1

# Steps 2-4: Synthesize 1,8-bis(bromomethyl)naphthalene from acenaphthene.
steps_for_precursor_2 = 3

# Steps 5-7: Assemble the final product from the two precursors.
steps_for_assembly = 3

# Total steps is the sum of the steps for each part of the synthesis.
total_steps = steps_for_precursor_1 + steps_for_precursor_2 + steps_for_assembly

# Print the equation showing how the total number of steps is calculated.
print(f"{steps_for_precursor_1} + {steps_for_precursor_2} + {steps_for_assembly} = {total_steps}")
