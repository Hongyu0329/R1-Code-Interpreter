Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:

1.  **Reagents and Initial Reaction**: The reaction uses excess methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), a strong base and nucleophile, at an elevated temperature (80 Â°C). The most acidic proton in the starting material (compound 1) is on the tertiary alcohol. The first equivalent of CH3MgBr acts as a base and deprotonates this alcohol to form a magnesium alkoxide intermediate.

2.  **Chelation and Activation**: The newly formed magnesium alkoxide (-O-MgBr) is located spatially close to the adjacent benzodioxole ring. The magnesium ion (a Lewis acid) coordinates to both the alkoxide oxygen and the neighboring oxygen of the benzodioxole ring. This chelation forms a stable five-membered ring intermediate.

3.  **Intramolecular Ring Opening**: The chelation activates the benzodioxole group. The alkoxide oxygen, now a potent intramolecular nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic methylene (-CH2-) carbon of the activated benzodioxole.

4.  **Formation of the Final Product**: This nucleophilic attack leads to the cleavage of the C-O bond on the opposite side of the methylene bridge. This process opens the original five-membered benzodioxole ring and forms a new, more stable seven-membered dioxepine ring. The oxygen atom that was part of the cleaved C-O bond becomes a magnesium phenoxide. Upon aqueous workup (a standard procedure after a Grignard reaction), this is protonated to yield a phenol (-OH).

5.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   Options A and B are incorrect because cleavage of the robust benzyl and p-methoxybenzyl ethers is not the expected major pathway.
    *   Options D and E are incorrect as they propose the formation of an ethoxy group, which is implausible as the diethyl ether solvent is largely unreactive.
    *   Option C accurately describes both the mechanism (deprotonation followed by intramolecular attack of the alkoxide to open the benzodioxole ring) and the resulting product structure (a seven-membered dioxepine ring and a phenol).

Therefore, the major product is formed via the mechanism described in option C.
