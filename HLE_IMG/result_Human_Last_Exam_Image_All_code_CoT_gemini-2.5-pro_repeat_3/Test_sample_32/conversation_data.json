    "To answer your question, I will consult botanical information to identify the primary visual difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" provides a strong hint. I will then create a Python script to print out a clear explanation of this difference.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    The difference is primarily in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the characteristics of each species' sporophyte\n    grimmia_montana_seta = \"short and straight\"\n    grimmia_curviseta_seta = \"longer and distinctly curved (often S-shaped)\"\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule):\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. Grimmia montana has a {grimmia_montana_seta} seta.\")\n    print(\"   This causes the capsule to be immersed or only slightly emergent among the perichaetial leaves.\\n\")\n    print(f\"2. Grimmia curviseta has a {grimmia_curviseta_seta} seta.\")\n    print(\"   This causes the capsule to be clearly exserted (raised above the leaves) and to appear nodding or drooping.\\n\")\n    print(\"This difference in the seta's shape and length is the most reliable feature to distinguish the two species at a glance when sporophytes are present.\")\n\ndistinguish_grimmia_species()\n```\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, making the capsule appear immersed, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved seta that makes the capsule exserted and nodding.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
