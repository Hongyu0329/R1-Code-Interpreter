    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure. Free rotation can occur around single bonds, but it can be restricted by bulky neighboring groups.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify Phenyl Rings:** We need to consider rings G, H, J, K, and L. These are all phenyl groups attached as substituents to the main ligand framework.\n\n2.  **Analyze Steric Environment:** The key factor is the proximity of each ring to the bulky Iridium (Ir) center and the other large ligands. Rotation is most restricted for groups that are *ortho* (adjacent) to the point of coordination with the metal.\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to C4 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to C4 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   Both are in a *para* position relative to the other substituent on their respective rings and *meta* to the Iridium coordination site. They are far from the bulky metal center and other ligands, so they face minimal steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Rings G and L:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to C6 of pyridine ring F. This position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that coordinates directly to the Iridium center.\n        *   Ring L is attached to C5 of phenyl ring C. This position is *ortho* to the C6 carbon that coordinates directly to the Iridium center.\n        *   Because of their *ortho* position relative to the coordination site, both G and L are in extremely crowded environments. Their rotation would cause a severe clash with the metal center and adjacent ligands. Therefore, their rotation is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring K:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to C2 of phenyl ring A. This position is *meta* to the C6-Iridium coordination bond. However, it is *ortho* to the C1-carbon that connects ring A to ring B.\n        *   While there is some steric interaction with the adjacent ring B, this hindrance is significantly less than that experienced by rings G and L, which are *ortho* to the metal coordination bonds. In solution, the thermal energy is generally sufficient to overcome this type of rotational barrier. Thus, ring K is also considered to rotate freely.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, rings H, J, and K can rotate freely, while the rotation of rings G and L is restricted.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational freedom of phenyl rings in the given complex based on steric hindrance.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational freedom of each phenyl ring based on steric hindrance:\\n\")\n\n    # Define the rings and their properties\n    rings = {\n        'H': \"Attached to C4 of ring A.

Rotation is FREE.\",\n        'G': \"Attached to C6 of ring F. This is *ortho* to the coordinating Nitrogen atom, making it very close to the bulky Ir center. Rotation is RESTRICTED.\",\n        'L': \"Attached to C5 of ring C. This is *ortho* to the coordinating Carbon (C6), placing it very close to the Ir center. Rotation is RESTRICTED.\",\n        'K': \"Attached to C2 of ring A. This is *meta* to the coordinating Carbon (C6) but ortho to the bond connecting ring A to B. The hindrance is much less than for G and L.
