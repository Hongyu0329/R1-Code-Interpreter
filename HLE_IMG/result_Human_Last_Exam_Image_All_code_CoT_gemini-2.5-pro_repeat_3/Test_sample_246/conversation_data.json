    "Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity in the image. The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy, spherical growth on the twig. This is a type of plant gall, likely an oak wool sower gall, which is created by a gall wasp.\n\nThe gall itself is the direct result of the insect laying its eggs. A female gall wasp injects her eggs into the plant tissue (in this case, the twig of an oak tree). The chemical and hormonal stimuli from the eggs and hatching larvae cause the plant to form the gall structure around them. This gall serves as both a protective nursery and a food source for the developing wasp larvae inside.\n\nTherefore, the insect that created the gall has already laid its eggs inside the twig at the location where the gall formed.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the image for insect activity and explains the findings.\n    \"\"\"\n    evidence = \"Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity.\"\n    \n    gall_description = \"The most prominent sign is the white, fuzzy, spherical growth on the twig.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
