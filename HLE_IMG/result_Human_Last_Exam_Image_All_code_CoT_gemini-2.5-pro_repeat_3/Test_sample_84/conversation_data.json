    "The coat of arms in the image is a stylized representation. The core elements of the shield are the most important for identification.\n\n1.  **Analyze the shield:** The shield is divided horizontally (a style known in heraldry as \"per fess\").\n2.  **Top half:** The top field is blue (azure) and contains a yellow/gold crescent moon (or).\n3.  **Bottom half:** The bottom field is yellow/gold (or) and contains a black crab (sable).\n4.  **Search:** Searching for a coat of arms with these specific elements—a shield divided into blue over gold, with a crescent moon in the top and a crab in the bottom—leads to a clear match.\n5.  **Identification:** These are the exact elements of the coat of arms of the city of **Hadiach (Гадяч)**, located in the Poltava Oblast of Ukraine. While the crown and the surrounding wreath in the image are artistic interpretations, the heraldic charges on the shield itself are a direct match.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city whose coat of arms is similar to the one provided.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The city is identified based on the heraldic elements on the shield:\n  # A shield divided per fess azure and or,\n  # in chief a crescent or, and in base a crab sable.\n  city_name = \"Hadiach\"\n  \n  print(f\"The coat of arms in the image is very similar to the coat of arms of the city of {city_name}, Ukraine.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Hadiach>>>"
