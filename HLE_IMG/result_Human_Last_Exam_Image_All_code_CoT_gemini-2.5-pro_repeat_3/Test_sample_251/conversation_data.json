    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Paper Speed:** The standard information \"25 mm/sec\" is printed on the ECG. This means that each millimeter on the horizontal axis represents 1/25th of a second. The grid is made of small 1 mm squares and large 5 mm squares.\n    *   Time for 1 small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for 1 large square (5 mm) = 5 * 0.04 seconds = 0.2 seconds.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we can see a significant pause in the fourth row of the tracing. This represents the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complexes).\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** We will measure the distance of this pause in terms of grid squares.\n    *   The R-wave just before the pause aligns perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Counting from this line, the next R-wave occurs after 7 full large squares and 1 additional small square.\n    *   Total number of small squares = (7 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 1 small square = 36 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:** We multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of each small square.\n    *   Longest R-R Interval = 36 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the time represented by one small square on the ECG paper.\n#    The paper speed is 25 mm/sec, and a small square is 1 mm wide.\n#    Time per small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n# 2. Measure the longest R-R interval in terms of small squares from the image.\n#    By visual inspection, the longest pause spans 7 large squares and 1 small square.\n#    Since 1 large square = 5 small squares, the total is (7 * 5) + 1 = 36 small squares.\n# 3. Calculate the interval in seconds by multiplying the number of squares by the time per square.\n\n# 1. Define constants\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 0.04  # seconds\n\n# 2. Measurement from the ECG\nnum_large_squares = 7\nnum_extra_small_squares = 1\nsmall_squares_per_large_square = 5\ntotal_small_squares = (num_large_squares * small_squares_per_large_square) + num_extra_small_squares\n\n# 3. Calculation\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Output the calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {total_small_squares} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"Each small square represents {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {total_small_squares} * {time_per_small_square_sec} = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<1.44>>>"
