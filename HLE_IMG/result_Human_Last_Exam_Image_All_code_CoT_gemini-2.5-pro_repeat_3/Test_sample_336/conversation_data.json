    "Of course, I can help you with this cheminformatics task. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Molecules**: The image displays a chemical reaction scheme with three distinct molecules: a reactant (`M1`), another reactant (`M2`), and a product (`M3`). I will first determine the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings for each of these three molecules.\n2.  **Filter by Crippen logP**: The problem requires us to only consider molecules with a Crippen logP value greater than 1. I will calculate this property for all three molecules using the RDKit library.\n3.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each molecule that passes the logP filter, I will calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index (ξ^c). This calculation will include hydrogen atoms as specified. The formula is:\n    ξ^c = Σ (vᵢ * eᵢ)\n    where the sum is over all atoms `i` in the molecule, `vᵢ` is the degree of atom `i` (number of bonds), and `eᵢ` is the eccentricity of atom `i` (the longest shortest-path distance to any other atom in the molecule).\n4.  **Sum the Indices**: Finally, I will sum the Eccentric Connectivity Indices of all the molecules that met the logP criterion to get the final answer.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a single Python script to perform all these steps. The script will use the `rdkit` library for molecular processing and `numpy` for matrix operations. It will print the steps of the calculation, including the individual ECI values that contribute to the final sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# To run this script, you need to install rdkit and numpy.\n# You can install them using pip:\n# pip install rdkit numpy\n\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Descriptors\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs the entire task as described in the plan.\n    1. Identifies molecules from their SMILES strings.\n    2. Filters them based on Crippen logP > 1.\n    3. Calculates the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI) for the filtered molecules.\n    4.
