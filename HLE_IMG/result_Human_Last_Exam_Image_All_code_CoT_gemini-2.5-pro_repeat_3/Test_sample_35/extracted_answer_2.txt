The protein S100B has a strong affinity for the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) receptor, specifically its extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of downstream pathways leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thereby predicting the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.
