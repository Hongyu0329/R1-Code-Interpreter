        "   - The protein S100B can be used as a prognostic marker.\n"
        "   - Rationale: The role of S100B extends beyond simple association with the disease. Its over-expression is a direct trigger for key pathological events. As shown in the pathway, the interaction between S100B and RAGE activates downstream signaling (via NFkB and JNK/JUN) that leads to apoptosis (neuronal loss), neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.\n"
        "   - Because the concentration of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these damaging cellular processes, its level can be used to predict the future course and severity of the neurological disorder. This predictive capability is the defining characteristic of a prognostic marker."
