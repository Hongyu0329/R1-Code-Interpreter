    "This image depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology. My plan is to first identify the specific myth and the characters involved based on the visual cues, and then write a Python script to present the answer clearly.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image is from a Greek red-figure vase. It shows a chariot with a male driver and a female passenger. A winged figure (likely Nike, the goddess of victory) flies above them. On the ground lies a defeated male figure, seemingly run over by the chariot or thrown from his own.\n2.  **Identify the myth:** This combination of a chariot race, a male-female pair, a victory goddess, and a fallen opponent strongly points to the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n3.  **Recall the story:** King Oenomaus of Pisa had a beautiful daughter, Hippodamia. An oracle foretold he would be killed by his son-in-law. To prevent this, he challenged any suitor to a chariot race. If the suitor won, he would win Hippodamia's hand; if he lost, he would be killed. Oenomaus had divine, super-fast horses and had killed many suitors. Pelops challenged him, but first, he bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the bronze linchpins of the king's chariot with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels flew off Oenomaus's chariot, and he was thrown to his death. Pelops won the race and Hippodamia.\n4.  **Map figures to the myth:**\n    *   The victorious driver of the chariot is **Pelops**.\n    *   The woman he has won and is carrying away is **Hippodamia**.\n    *   The figure on the ground, defeated and killed in the race, is **King Oenomaus**.\n5.  **Answer the specific question:** \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" This most dramatically refers to King Oenomaus, who was thrown from his own chariot, thus \"leaving\" it in a fatal manner.\n6.  **Create the Python script:** The script will define variables for each character and print out an explanation, finally stating the name of the figure on the ground as the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mythological_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the figures from the Greek myth depicted on the vase.\n    The scene shows the conclusion of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Characters in the myth depicted\n    victorious_charioteer = \"Pelops\"\n    female_passenger = \"Hippodamia\"\n    fallen_king = \"King Oenomaus\"\n\n    # The question asks about the figure \"leaving the chariot\".\n    # In the myth, King Oenomaus is thrown from his chariot when it crashes, leading to his death.\n    # Therefore, he is the figure depicted on the ground who has just violently \"left\" his chariot.\n\n    print(f\"The scene shows {victorious_charioteer} winning the chariot race.\")\n    print(f\"He is carrying away his bride, {female_passenger}.\")\n    print(f\"The figure on the ground, who was thrown from his own chariot and killed, is {fallen_king}.\")\n    print(\"\\nSo, the figure leaving the chariot is:\")\n    print(fallen_king)\n\nsolve_mythological_scene()\n```\n<<<King Oenomaus>>>"
