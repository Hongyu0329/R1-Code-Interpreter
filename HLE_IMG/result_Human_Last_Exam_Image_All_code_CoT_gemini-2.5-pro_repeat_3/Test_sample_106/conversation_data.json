    "This problem requires analyzing a complex organic reaction, specifically an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a series of carbocation rearrangements known as a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the final substituents:\n\n1.  **Reaction Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid catalyst (HCl). This forms a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n2.  **Carbocation Formation:** Water (H2O) leaves, creating a secondary carbocation at its original position (C-3).\n3.  **Carbocation Rearrangements:** The initial carbocation is unstable and undergoes a cascade of [1,2]-shifts (migrations of a group to an adjacent positively charged carbon) to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This process moves the positive charge across the molecular backbone.\n    *   A methyl group (CH3) shifts from C-4 to C-3. The charge is now at C-4 (tertiary).\n    *   A hydride (H) shifts from C-5 to C-4. The charge is now at C-5 (tertiary).\n    *   A methyl group (CH3) shifts from C-10 to C-5. The charge is now at C-10 (tertiary).\n    *   This continues with a series of alternating hydride and methyl shifts until the positive charge reaches C-13.\n4.  **Elimination:** A proton (H+) is removed from an adjacent carbon (C-12) to form a stable, tetrasubstituted double bond, resulting in the final product.\n5.  **Identify Substituents:** By tracking which groups (H or CH3) have moved and which have stayed, we can identify the final substituent at each numbered position.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** Started with two CH3 groups. One moved away. A H atom moved in. The one remaining is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):** Started with a CH3 group. This group moved away. A H atom moved in. The new substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (on C-5):** Started with a H atom. This atom moved away. A CH3 group moved in. The new substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (on C-8):** Started with a CH3 group. This moved away. Another CH3 group from elsewhere moved in. The new substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 5 (on C-9):** Started with a H atom. This moved away. A CH3 group moved in. The new substituent is **CH3**.\n\nThe following Python code stores these results and prints them in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# This script determines the identity of substituents after a backbone rearrangement.\n# The analysis is based on the well-established Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism\n# for pentacyclic triterpenoids.\n\n# Step 1: Define a dictionary to hold the results of the chemical analysis.\n# The keys are the numbered positions, and the values are the corresponding substituents.\nsubstituents = {\n    1: 'CH3',\n    2: 'H',\n    3: 'CH3',\n    4: 'CH3',\n    5: 'CH3'\n}\n\n# Step 2: Create a list to store the formatted strings for the output.\noutput_strings = []\n\n# Step 3: Iterate through the dictionary in numerical order of the positions.\n# The `sorted()` function ensures the output is ordered from 1 to 5.\nfor position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n    substituent = substituents[position]\n    # Format each result as \"position = substituent\"\n    output_strings.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n# Step 4: Join the individual strings with \", \" and print the final result.\nprint(\", \".join(output_strings))\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
