    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers. We will analyze them from left to right as they appear in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** The molecule has three chiral centers (carbons bonded to four different groups).\n    *   **Center 1 (Left):** The carbon bonded to the -OH group.\n    *   **Center 2 (Middle):** The carbon bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   **Center 3 (Right):** The carbon bonded to the -CH₃ and -CH₂NH₂ groups.\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules) for Each Center:**\n    *   Assign priority to the four groups attached to the chiral center based on atomic number. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n    *   If there is a tie, move to the next atoms along the chain until a point of difference is found.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration for Each Center:**\n    *   Orient the molecule so that the lowest priority group (usually #4) points away from the viewer (on a dashed bond).\n    *   Trace the path from priority group #1 to #2 to #3.\n    *   If the path is **clockwise**, the configuration is **R** (from *rectus*, Latin for right).\n    *   If the path is **counter-clockwise**, the configuration is **S** (from *sinister*, Latin for left).\n    *   If the lowest priority group points towards the viewer (on a wedged bond), the result is reversed.\n\n4.  **Combine the Results:** State the configuration for all three centers in order.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below to provide a detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step determination of the absolute\n    configuration (R/S) for each chiral center in the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the absolute configuration of the molecule's three chiral centers.\")\n    print(\"The centers are analyzed from left to right.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Center 1: Carbon with -OH ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Center 1 (leftmost, with -OH) ---\")\n    print(\"Groups: -OH, -CH3, -H (implicit), and the rest of the molecule (R-group).\")\n    print(\"CIP Priorities:\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (Oxygen has the highest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"2: R-group (the rest of the molecule, connected via Carbon)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3 (methyl group)\")\n    print(\"4: -H (Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"\\nGeometry and Configuration:\")\n    print(\"The -OH (1) is on a wedge, and -CH3 (3) is on a dash.
