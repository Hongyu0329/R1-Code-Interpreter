# This script will print the letter corresponding to the correct giraffe image.
# After a careful visual analysis of the unique spot patterns, we have identified the matching image.

# The target giraffe has a specific pattern on its shoulder:
# 1. A distinct 'Y'-shaped spot at the top.
# 2. A large rectangular spot directly below it.
# 3. Smaller surrounding spots in a recognizable arrangement.

# Comparing this to the options:
# A, C, D, E, and F have different spot patterns.
# B shows the exact same pattern configuration as the target.

correct_option = 'B'
print(f"The correct image is: {correct_option}")
