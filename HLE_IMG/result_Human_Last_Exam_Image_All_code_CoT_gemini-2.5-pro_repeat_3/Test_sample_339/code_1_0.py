def solve_ca_mapping():
    """
    Solves the cellular automata mapping problem based on visual analysis.

    The function maps short-term evolution patterns (1-15) to their
    long-term counterparts (A-O) by matching their visual characteristics.

    The reasoning for each match is as follows:
    1 -> D: Stable small diamond -> Two stable small diamonds.
    2 -> O: Growing hollow diamond -> Two large hollow diamonds.
    3 -> I: Growing spiky diamond -> Two large spiky diamonds.
    4 -> M: Growing cross -> Grid of crosses (tiling).
    5 -> C: Growing solid diamond -> Large merged solid diamond.
    6 -> L: Growing complex/blocky diamond -> Large merged complex diamond.
    7 -> N: Growing spiky star -> Merged chaotic starbursts.
    8 -> E: Growing fine-grained diamond -> Large merged fine-grained diamond.
    9 -> H: Small plus-signs (gliders) -> Four resulting patterns.
    10 -> B: Growing checkerboard diamond -> Dense periodic grid (tiling).
    11 -> J: Growing cross-with-halo -> Line/square periodic grid (tiling).
    12 -> K: Growing crosses -> Radiating interference chaos.
    13 -> A: Growing cross-in-diamond -> Diamond-shaped chaos with grid texture.
    14 -> G: Tiny, slow-growing pattern -> Uniform chaos (long transient).
    15 -> F: Growing diamond with diagonal features -> Chaos with diagonal waves.
