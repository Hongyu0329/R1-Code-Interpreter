    # 3. A specific horn shape.

    # A: Different age/size.
    # B: Matches the stripe pattern, the unique three-spot cluster, and horn shape.
    # C: Different coloration and horn size.
    # D: Spot pattern and horn shape differ.
    # E: Has a white band on its leg, which the target does not.
    # F: Horn shape is significantly different.

    # The correct match is B due to the identical and unique spot pattern.
