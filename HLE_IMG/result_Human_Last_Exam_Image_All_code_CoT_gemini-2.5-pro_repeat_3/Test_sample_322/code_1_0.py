# Plan:
# 1. Analyze each of the 16 plots to identify the unique vortex.
# 2. Determine if the unique vortex is stronger (twice strength) or weaker (half strength) than the other two.
# 3. Assign a letter code based on the color and relative strength:
#    - R/r: Red (twice/half)
#    - G/g: Green (twice/half)
#    - B/b: Blue (twice/half)
# 4. Combine the 16 letters into a single string.
# 5. Print the final string.

# Analysis Results:
# 1: Green is weaker (g)
# 2: Blue is weaker (b)
# 3: Green is weaker (g)
# 4: Red is weaker (r)
# 5: Green is stronger (G)
# 6: Green is weaker (g)
# 7: Red is weaker (r)
# 8: Red is stronger (R)
# 9: Blue is stronger (B)
# 10: Blue is weaker (b)
# 11: Blue is weaker (b)
# 12: Green is stronger (G)
# 13: Red is stronger (R)
# 14: Blue is weaker (b)
# 15: Red is weaker (r)
# 16: Blue is stronger (B)
