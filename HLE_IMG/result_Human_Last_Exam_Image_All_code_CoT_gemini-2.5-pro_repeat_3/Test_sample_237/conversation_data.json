    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan:\n1.  First, I will analyze the image to determine if an animal is present.\n2.  Upon confirming the presence of an animal, which is an insect, I will identify its specific characteristics (e.g., long antennae, black body, red/orange marking).\n3.  Based on these features, I will identify the insect as a species of longhorn beetle.\n4.  I will then determine its scientific name, which appears to be *Stenocorus meridianus*, commonly known as the Red-shouldered Longhorn Beetle.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the animal in the image and provides its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    is_animal_present = True\n    animal_common_name = \"Red-shouldered Longhorn Beetle\"\n    animal_scientific_name = \"Stenocorus meridianus\"\n\n    if is_animal_present:\n        print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image. It is an insect.\")\n        print(f\"The animal appears to be a {animal_common_name}.\")\n        print(f\"Its scientific name is: {animal_scientific_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stenocorus meridianus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
