    This function determines the parameter change for each of the six plots
    based on a qualitative analysis of the system's dynamics.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    - The problem requires identifying one reference plot ('0') and five other plots,
      each corresponding to a change in a unique parameter from the families
      {Z0, R, P, B, mu}.

    - Plot 1: Appears to be a standard chaotic attractor. It is chosen as the reference
      case because it's slightly less complex than the nearly identical Plot 3. Code: '0'.

    - Plot 2: The attractor is much larger and more complex, indicating stronger chaos. This is
      caused by increasing the primary driving parameter, the Rayleigh number. Code: 'R'.

    - Plot 3: The attractor is nearly identical in shape and size to Plot 1, which is
      characteristic of a change in initial conditions on the same attractor. Code: 'Z'.

    - Plot 4: The blue and orange systems are highly synchronized, tracing similar paths. This
      is caused by increasing the coupling parameter, the Biot number. Code: 'B'.

    - Plot 5: The system's oscillations decay, and it collapses to a stable fixed point.
      This stabilization, given that the 'R' parameter family is already used, is plausibly
      caused by changing the asymmetry parameter mu. Code: 'm'.

    - Plot 6: The system has transitioned from chaotic to a simple periodic orbit (a limit
      cycle). This regularization is often caused by slowing down the 'z' and 'Z'
      dynamics, which corresponds to halving the Prandtl number. Code: 'p'.
