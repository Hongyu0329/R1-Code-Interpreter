    Fluorescein has two key types of functional groups available for modification: two phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) groups and one carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. Its intense fluorescence is primarily active in its dianionic form, where the two -OH groups are deprotonated. A successful 'caging' strategy must block this deprotonation to render the molecule non-fluorescent until its release.

Modifying the -OH groups into acetate esters (acetylation) effectively 'cages' the fluorescein, making it non-fluorescent (e.g., Fluorescein Diacetate, FDA). Ester bonds are readily cleaved by esterase enzymes. By genetically expressing a specific esterase in target cells, the acetyl groups can be removed, releasing the fluorescent fluorescein only in those cells. This provides excellent cell-type specificity.""",

        'E': """Modifying -OH groups to ethers (using cyclopropyl groups) would cage the molecule. However, ether bonds are chemically much more stable and harder to cleave enzymatically than ester bonds. This makes them less suitable for a rapid and specific enzymatic uncaging strategy.""",
