In theory, the fiscal expansion will have no impact on the country's current account balance. The decrease in public saving (due to the debt-financed spending) is perfectly counteracted by the increase in private saving, as stated in the problem's assumption. This leaves national saving unchanged. With no change in investment, the current account (which equals national saving minus investment) also remains unchanged.
