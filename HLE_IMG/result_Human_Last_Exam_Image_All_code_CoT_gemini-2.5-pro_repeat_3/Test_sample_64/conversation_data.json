    "The user wants me to identify the biological process shown in the three sequential images labeled L, M, and N.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  **Analyze the images:** The images are micrographs showing a filamentous structure, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha. The labels L, M, and N suggest a time sequence.\n2.  **Observe the changes:**\n    *   In panel L, we see two adjacent cells separated by a distinct cross-wall (septum), marked by an arrowhead.\n    *   In panel M, the septum at the marked location has started to dissolve, and the cell wall is bulging outwards.\n    *   In panel N, the septum has completely disappeared, and the contents (cytoplasm) of the two cells have merged. The hypha is now bent at the point of fusion.\n3.  **Identify the process:** The observed sequence—the breakdown of a septum to allow the merging of adjacent cells in a fungal hypha—is a classic example of **cell fusion**. The specific term for this process in fungi is **hyphal anastomosis**. This process is vital for creating an interconnected network (mycelium), which facilitates communication, nutrient transport, and genetic exchange.\n4.  **Formulate the output:** I will create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to explain this process. Then, I will provide the name of the process as the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the biological process depicted in the image series.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The process shown in the image sequence (L, M, N) is cell fusion, specifically known as hyphal anastomosis in fungi.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a step-by-step description:\")\n    print(\"1. In image L, two adjacent cells in a fungal filament (hypha) are separated by a cross-wall called a septum, indicated by the arrowhead.\")\n    print(\"2. In image M, the fusion process begins. The septum starts to break down, and the cell walls at that point bulge outwards.\")\n    print(\"3. In image N, the septum has completely dissolved, resulting in the merging of the cytoplasm from the two cells. This creates a continuous, larger cellular compartment.\")\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Cell fusion (hyphal anastomosis)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
