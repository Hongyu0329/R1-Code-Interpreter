# Step 1: Define the parameters for the missing simulation.
# Based on the analysis, the missing plot is for a linear polymer.
# The initial degree of polymerization (N) can be determined from the plots.
N = 20

# The missing plot corresponds to the highest degree of destruction, m=5.
m = 5

# The degree of destruction 'a' is given by a = m/25.
a = m / 25.0

# Step 2: Use the formula for the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn)
# for a linear polymer undergoing random scission.
# The formula is Nn = N / (1 + a * (N - 1)).

# Step 3: Calculate the value of Nn.
N_n = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))

# Step 4: Print the calculation steps and the final result.
