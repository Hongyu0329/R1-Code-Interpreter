    "To identify the protein in the image, I will first determine its unique identifier in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is a repository for 3D structural data of large biological molecules. Based on a visual analysis, the structure corresponds to PDB ID **1A2P**.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script that uses this PDB ID to programmatically query the RCSB PDB's REST API. This script will fetch detailed information about the entry and extract the official name of the protein. This approach simulates how a bioinformatician would use code to retrieve protein information from a database.\n\nThe script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Import the `requests` library to make HTTP requests.\n2.  Define the PDB ID (`1A2P`).\n3.  Construct the API endpoint URL to get information about the polymer entities in the structure.\n4.  Send a GET request to the API.\n5.  Parse the JSON response to find the description of the main protein component.\n6.  Print the name of the protein.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef get_protein_name_from_pdb(pdb_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches and prints the name of a protein from the RCSB PDB database using its ID.\n    The image provided corresponds to the structure of the Abl SH2 domain, PDB ID: 1A2P.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main protein is the first polymer entity in this PDB entry.\n    entity_id = \"1\"\n    \n    # Construct the API URL\n    url = f\"https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/polymer_entity/{pdb_id}/{entity_id}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Querying PDB for ID: {pdb_id}, Entity: {entity_id}\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Make the API request\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)\n        \n        # Parse the JSON response\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        # Extract the protein description.
