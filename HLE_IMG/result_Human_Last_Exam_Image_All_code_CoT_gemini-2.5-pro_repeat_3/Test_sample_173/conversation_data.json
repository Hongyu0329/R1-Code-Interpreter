    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes within it. We can do this by adding up the values of the notes in either the treble clef (top staff) or the bass clef (bottom staff).\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Top Staff):** The notes are grouped into four sets. Each set consists of notes and rests that add up to the value of one quarter note. Specifically, we see four groups of four sixteenth notes.\n2.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** This staff contains two quarter notes followed by one half note.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Duration:** We will write a Python script to calculate the total duration in terms of quarter notes for both staves.\n    *   For the treble clef: 4 groups * (4 sixteenth notes/group) = 16 sixteenth notes. Since 4 sixteenth notes equal 1 quarter note, 16 sixteenth notes equal 4 quarter notes.\n    *   For the bass clef: 2 quarter notes + 1 half note (which equals 2 quarter notes) = 4 quarter notes.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the measure contains a total duration equivalent to four quarter notes, the time signature is 4/4. The top number (4) indicates the number of beats per measure, and the bottom number (4) indicates that a quarter note gets one beat.\n\nHere is the Python code to demonstrate the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature of a musical measure by summing the note durations.\n    Note values are represented as fractions of a whole note.\n    - Whole Note = 1\n    - Half Note = 1/2\n    - Quarter Note = 1/4\n    - Sixteenth Note = 1/16\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis of the Treble Clef (Top Staff) ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the Treble Clef (Top Staff):\")\n    \n    # The top staff consists of four groups of four sixteenth notes.\n    num_groups_treble = 4\n    notes_per_group_treble = 4\n    note_value_treble = 1/16  # Sixteenth note\n\n    total_sixteenth_notes_treble = num_groups_treble * notes_per_group_treble\n    total_duration_treble = total_sixteenth_notes_treble * note_value_treble\n\n    # Convert to quarter notes for clarity\n    quarter_notes_treble = total_duration_treble / (1/4)\n    \n    print(f\"The top staff has {num_groups_treble} groups of {notes_per_group_treble} sixteenth notes.\")\n    print(f\"Total sixteenth notes = {num_groups_treble} * {notes_per_group_treble} = {total_sixteenth_notes_treble}\")\n    print(f\"This is equivalent to {int(quarter_notes_treble)} quarter notes.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff) ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):\")\n    \n    # The bottom staff has two quarter notes and one half note.\n    num_quarter_notes_bass = 2\n    num_half_notes_bass = 1\n    \n    quarter_note_value = 1/4\n    half_note_value = 1/2\n\n    total_duration_bass = (num_quarter_notes_bass * quarter_note_value) + (num_half_notes_bass * half_note_value)\n    \n    # Convert to quarter notes\n    quarter_notes_bass = total_duration_bass / (1/4)\n    \n    print(f\"The bottom staff has {num_quarter_notes_bass} quarter notes and {num_half_notes_bass} half note.\")\n    print(f\"A half note is equal to 2 quarter notes.\")\n    print(f\"Total quarter notes = {num_quarter_notes_bass} + (1 * 2) = {int(quarter_notes_bass)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Both staves contain notes that sum to a total of 4 quarter notes per measure.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a 4/4 time signature.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: 2 quarter notes + 1 half note = 4 beats\")\n    print(\"or\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: 16 sixteenth notes = 4 beats\")\n\n\ncalculate_time_signature()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
