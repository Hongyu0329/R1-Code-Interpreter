    "The artist of the painting is the Polish surrealist painter Jacek Yerka. Born in 1952 into an artistic family, Yerka's work is known for its fantastical and dream-like qualities, often blending interior and exterior spaces in impossible ways. His meticulous technique is reminiscent of 15th and 16th-century Flemish masters like Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel, who were significant influences on his style.\n\nYerka's paintings often feature imaginative landscapes, bizarre creatures, and whimsical architecture. He has received international acclaim for his work, including the prestigious World Fantasy Award for Best Artist in 1995. His art has been exhibited in numerous countries, including Poland, Germany, France, and the United States.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
