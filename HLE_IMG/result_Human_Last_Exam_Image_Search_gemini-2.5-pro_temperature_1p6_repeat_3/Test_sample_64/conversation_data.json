    "The process depicted in the sequential images L, M, and N is the **lysis**, or bursting, of a fungal hypha at the septum, likely due to internal turgor pressure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what is happening in each frame:\n*   **Frame L:** This image shows a healthy, septate fungal hypha. Fungal hyphae are filamentous structures that make up the body of a fungus, and they are divided into compartments by cross-walls called septa. The arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n*   **Frame M:** A bulge begins to form at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This indicates a weakening of the cell wall at this specific point.\n*   **Frame N:** The bulge has enlarged significantly, and the hypha is bending or buckling under the strain. This shows the progression of the structural failure.\n\nThis type of event occurs when the internal turgor pressure of the cell exceeds the strength of the cell wall. Fungal cells maintain a high internal pressure, which is essential for processes like growth. However, if a part of the cell wall, such as a septum, becomes weak, it can lead to rupture and cell death, also known as lysis. Septa are crucial for providing structural rigidity but can also be points of vulnerability, especially during processes like cell division or injury.\n\n<<<Lysis of a fungal hypha>>>"
