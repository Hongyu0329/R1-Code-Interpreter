    "To identify the correct image, we need to understand the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the direction.\n\nAn FCC crystal structure has atoms at each corner and in the center of each face of a cube. When this structure is projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the direction (the direction of a face diagonal), a characteristic pattern emerges.\n\nThe key features of the FCC projection are:\n*   A rectangular arrangement of atoms.\n*   Atoms are located at the corners of the rectangle.\n*   An additional atom is located in the center of the rectangle. This central atom comes from the atoms at the centers of the faces that are being viewed edge-on.\n*   This pattern of a centered rectangle repeats to form the extended lattice.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n*   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular lattice. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangular unit cells, but not in the center of the faces or the body of the rectangle.\n*   **Image B:** Shows a pattern where atoms form the corners of a rectangle, and there is also an atom in the center of each rectangle. This matches the description of a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **Image C:** Displays atoms in a pattern that appears more hexagonal or offset, which is characteristic of the FCC view, not the view.\n*   **Image D:** Shows a more complex arrangement that does not fit the simple centered rectangle pattern. The density of atoms is higher than what is expected for the primary plane.\n\nBased on the analysis, image B correctly depicts the centered rectangular atomic arrangement that is characteristic of a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
