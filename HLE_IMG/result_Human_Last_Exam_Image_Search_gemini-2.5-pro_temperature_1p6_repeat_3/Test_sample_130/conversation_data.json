    "The emission spectrum shown, characterized by an exceptionally large number of fine spectral lines distributed across the entire visible range, belongs to the element **Uranium**.\n\nEach chemical element emits light at a unique set of characteristic wavelengths when excited, creating a distinct \"fingerprint\" or spectrum. The complexity of this spectrum—the number of lines—is related to the element's atomic structure. Elements with more electrons, such as heavy elements, have more possible electronic transitions and thus produce a much more complex spectrum than lighter elements like hydrogen or helium.\n\nUranium, a heavy element with 92 electrons, is known for having one of the most complex emission spectra. Research has cataloged thousands of its spectral lines. One study compiled a list of more than 9,000 lines for neutral uranium in the range of 2900 Å to 11000 Å (covering the visible spectrum). These lines appear throughout the blue, green, yellow, orange, and red portions of the spectrum, consistent with the visual evidence in the image. Scientific papers frequently reference the intricacy of uranium's spectrum, with measurements of its emission coefficients reported across the visible and ultraviolet ranges.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
