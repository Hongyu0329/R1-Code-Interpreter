The S100B protein binds to the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an adjunct marker, to help assess ongoing neuroinflammation and astrocyte activation, and as a prognostic marker, because its levels often correlate with the severity and progression of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis.
