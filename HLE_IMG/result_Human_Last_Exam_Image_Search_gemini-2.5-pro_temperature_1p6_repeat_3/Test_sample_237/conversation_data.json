    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its distinctive markings—a black body with a prominent red-orange patch on the \"shoulders\" (the top part of the wing cases, or elytra)—the beetle is identified as ***Purpuricenus humeralis***. This species is sometimes referred to as the red-shouldered pine borer.\n\nLonghorn beetles belong to the family Cerambycidae, which includes over 35,000 species characterized by their very long antennae. While many longhorn beetles exist, the specific coloration and pattern in the photograph are a strong match for *Purpuricenus humeralis*.\n\n<<<Purpuricenus humeralis>>>"
