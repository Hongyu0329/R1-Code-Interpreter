    "To determine the total current flowing from the voltage source in the provided circuit, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\nFirst, the circuit diagram is analyzed to identify all components and their connections. The circuit contains a 1 Volt (V) voltage source (V2) and five resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, R3 = 9 Ω, R7 = 100 Ω, and R8 = 100 Ω.\n\nThe resistors are arranged in two parallel branches connected to the voltage source.\n\n**Branch 1 Analysis:** This branch involves resistors R1, R2, and R3. A key feature of this branch is a wire that connects the positive terminal of the voltage source directly to the node between resistor R1 and resistor R2. This connection creates a short circuit across R1. In a short circuit, the resistance is considered to be zero. Because current follows the path of least resistance, almost all the current will bypass R1, rendering it insignificant in the calculation. Consequently, in this branch, resistors R2 and R3 are in a series connection. The equivalent resistance of this branch (Req1) is the sum of R2 and R3.\n*   Req1 = R2 + R3 = 7 Ω + 9 Ω = 16 Ω\n\n**Branch 2 Analysis:** This branch consists of resistors R7 and R8 connected in series. The total resistance for resistors in series is their sum. The equivalent resistance of this second branch (Req2) is:\n*   Req2 = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω\n\n**Total Equivalent Resistance:** The two branches are in parallel with each other. The total equivalent resistance (Req_total) of the entire circuit can be calculated using the formula for parallel resistors: 1/Req_total = 1/Req1 + 1/Req2.\n*   1/Req_total = 1/16 Ω + 1/200 Ω\n*   To sum these values, a common denominator is found, which is 400.\n*   1/Req_total = 25/400 + 2/400 = 27/400 Ω\n*   Req_total = 400 / 27 Ω ≈ 14.815 Ω\n\n**Total Current Calculation:** Finally, to find the total current (I_total) flowing from the voltage source, Ohm's Law (I = V/R) is used. The total voltage (V2) is divided by the total equivalent resistance (Req_total).\n*   I_total = V2 / Req_total\n*   I_total = 1 V / (400 / 27 Ω)\n*   I_total = 27 / 400 A\n*   I_total = 0.0675 Amperes\n\nTherefore, the total current flowing through the circuit is 0.0675 A.\n<<<0.0675>>>"
