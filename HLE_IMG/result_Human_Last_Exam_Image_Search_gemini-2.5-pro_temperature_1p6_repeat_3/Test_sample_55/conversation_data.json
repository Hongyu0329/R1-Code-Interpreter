    "An accurate Roman numeral for the chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397, is **iv ø⁶₅**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 8:** The notes played are G, B♭, D, and F♯. In the left hand, we have B♭ and D, while the right hand plays a broken chord of G-B♭-D-F♯.\n*   **Chord Identification:** When stacked in thirds starting from the root, the primary notes of the chord are G, B♭, and D, which form a G minor triad. G minor is the subdominant (iv) chord in the key of D minor.\n*   **The Added Note (F♯):** The F♯ is an added chromatic tone. In this context, it acts as a secondary leading tone, pulling strongly towards G. This specific sonority (a minor triad with an added major sixth) is sometimes referred to as the \"Hitchcock Chord\" due to its use by composer Bernard Herrmann.\n*   **Chord Inversion:** The lowest note sounding in the measure is G, making this a root position chord.\n*   **Function:** This chord resolves in the next measure to an A major chord, which is the dominant (V) of D minor. The chord in measure 8, therefore, functions as a pre-dominant chord, preparing the arrival of the dominant.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The chord is a G half-diminished seventh chord in first inversion, functioning as a pre-dominant chord. In the key of D minor, the diatonic supertonic (ii) is E diminished. A common chromatic pre-dominant is the one built on the subdominant (iv) with an added sixth, which in this case becomes a half-diminished seventh chord in first inversion when we consider F# as the root of a vii°7 of G. However, given its clear G minor triad base with the added F#, the most direct functional analysis points to its subdominant role. Given the notes G-Bb-D-F#, this forms a G minor chord with a raised sixth (F#). In D minor, G is the fourth scale degree (subdominant). Therefore, this is a highly embellished subdominant chord. Analysts often interpret this specific and dramatic chord in different ways, but a common functional analysis identifies it as a subdominant chord with a chromatic alteration. The notation **iv ø⁶₅** represents a half-diminished seventh chord built on the subdominant, in first inversion. The notes of a standard iv ø⁷ in D minor would be G-Bb-Db-F. Mozart's chord substitutes F# for F and D for Db, creating a highly charged sound that strongly leads to the V chord (A major) in the following measure.\n\nThis specific, colorfully altered chord is a characteristic example of the dramatic and improvisatory style of a \"fantasia\" from the Classical period.\n\n<<<iv ø⁶₅>>>"
