    "The plant in the picture is endemic to the island of **Socotra**.\n\nThis distinctive plant is most likely *Excoecaria bussei*. While some sources indicate this species is native to parts of mainland Africa, a very similar-looking plant, often considered a unique Socotran endemic, shares these striking reticulated leaves. Socotra is an island archipelago in the Indian Ocean, part of Yemen, and is renowned for its unique and extensive endemic flora. Over a third of its plant species are found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nThe island is famous for its unique landscapes and iconic plants like the Dragon's Blood Tree (*Dracaena cinnabari*) and the bottle-shaped Desert Rose (*Adenium obesum* subsp. *sokotranum*). The unique pattern of the leaves in the photograph, with dark green coloration and prominent white net-like veins, is characteristic of certain plants from this biodiversity hotspot. While other common houseplants, like the Nerve Plant (*Fittonia albivenis*), have similarly veined leaves, their overall shape and growth habit differ from the plant shown.\n\n<<<Socotra>>>"
