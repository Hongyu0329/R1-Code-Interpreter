    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, which shows the firing activity of a neuronal culture, the synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval have been determined. Synchronized bursts are visible as dense, vertical collections of dots, indicating that numerous electrodes recorded neuronal firing at nearly the same time.\n\nThe timestamps for the major synchronized bursts are identified as follows:\n*   First burst: ~17 s\n*   Second burst: ~26 s\n*   Third burst: ~36 s\n*   Fourth burst: ~47 s\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between consecutive synchronized bursts. The calculated intervals are:\n*   Interval 1 (between burst 2 and burst 1): 26 s - 17 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 2 (between burst 3 and burst 2): 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 3 (between burst 4 and burst 3): 47 s - 36 s = 11 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is calculated by averaging these individual intervals:\n(9 s + 10 s + 11 s) / 3 = 10 s\n\nRounded to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 10 s.\n\n<<<10>>>"
