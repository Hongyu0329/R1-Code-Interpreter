    "This protein is **Ubiquitin**.\n\nThe image provided is a ribbon diagram of the 3D structure of human ubiquitin. This representation is widely associated with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry **1UBQ**. The crystal structure for 1UBQ was determined for human ubiquitin at a resolution of 1.8 Ã….\n\nUbiquitin is a small, highly conserved regulatory protein found in all eukaryotic cells. It consists of 76 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 8.6 kDa. Its structure is very compact and stable, featuring a mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, as seen in the diagram. Specifically, the structure includes about three and a half turns of an alpha-helix, a five-strand mixed beta-sheet, and a short 3(10)-helix.\n\nThis protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes by being attached to other proteins in a process called ubiquitination. This \"tagging\" can signal for the protein to be degraded by the proteasome, alter its location, or change its activity.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin>>>"
