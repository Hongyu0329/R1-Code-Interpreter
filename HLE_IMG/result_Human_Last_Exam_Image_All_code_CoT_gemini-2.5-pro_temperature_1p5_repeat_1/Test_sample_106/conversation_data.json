    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol, which proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and undergoes a series of [1,2] shifts (a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement) to form a more stable alkene. To determine the substituents at the indicated positions, we must trace the migration of methyl groups (CH₃) and hydrogen atoms (H) along the carbon skeleton.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the initial carbocation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group, followed by the loss of a water molecule (H₂O) to form a secondary carbocation.\n2.  **Trace the rearrangement cascade:** A series of sequential [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts occur to move the positive charge across the ring system, progressively forming more stable tertiary carbocations.\n3.  **Track substituent changes:** For each numbered position in the product, we will identify the corresponding carbon atom in the starting material and track how its substituents change during the rearrangement.\n4.  **Determine final substituents:** Based on the shifts, we will determine whether a CH₃ group or an H atom is present at each of the five numbered positions in the final product.\n5.  **Format the output:** The results will be presented in the specified format using a Python script.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n*   **Step A:** The -OH group leaves, forming a carbocation at C3.\n*   **Step B (Affects Position 1):** A methyl group migrates from C4 to C3. Then, a hydrogen atom migrates from C5 to C4. The original C4 atom is now bonded to the methyl group labeled '1' and a hydrogen atom. Thus, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Step C (Affects Position 2):** A methyl group migrates from C10 to C5. Then, a hydrogen migrates from C9 to C10. The substituent at the position labeled '2' (original C10) is now a hydrogen. Thus, **2 = H**.\n*   **Step D (Affects Position 3):** The hydrogen atom at C9 migrates to C10. Then, a methyl group migrates from C8 to C9. The substituent at the position labeled '3' (original C9) is now a methyl group. Thus, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Step E (Affects Position 4):** The methyl group at C8 migrates to C9. Then, another methyl group migrates from C14 to C8. The substituent at the position labeled '4' (original C8) is a new methyl group. Thus, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Step F (Affects Position 5):** The methyl group at C14 migrates to C8. Then, a hydrogen atom migrates from C13 to C14. The substituent at the position labeled '5' (original C14) is now a hydrogen. Thus, **5 = H**.\n*   **Step G:** Finally, a proton is eliminated from C12 to form the stable tetrasubstituted double bond.\n\nThe Python code below will store and print these determined identities.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analysis of the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism,\n# we can determine the identity of the substituents at each numbered position.\nsubstituents = {\n    1: 'CH3',\n    2: 'H',\n    3: 'CH3',\n    4: 'CH3',\n    5: 'H'\n}\n\n# Create a list of strings in the format \"position = substituent\"\n# e.g., [\"1 = CH3\", \"2 = H\", ...]\nanswer_parts = [f\"{position} = {substituent}\" for position, substituent in substituents.items()]\n\n# Join the parts with a comma and a space for the final output string\nfinal_answer_string = \", \".join(answer_parts)\n\nprint(final_answer_string)\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
