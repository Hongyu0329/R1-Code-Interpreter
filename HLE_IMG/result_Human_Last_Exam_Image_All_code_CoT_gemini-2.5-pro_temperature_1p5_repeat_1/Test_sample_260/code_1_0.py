# The user wants me to identify the two key themes of the 'Phantasmagoria' series.
# I will analyze the provided information: the image of a 'lost deity', the poem about 'fading',
# and the title 'Phantasmagoria' itself.

# 1. The image is described as a "lost small deity of the past". This directly points to the theme
#    of forgotten or "fading religious beliefs". The ghostly, translucent appearance reinforces
#    the idea of something that is no longer in its full power, a mere echo of what it was.

# 2. The poem extract "Velvet fades / like a photochromic lens" describes impermanence.
#    Both the luxurious fabric (velvet) and the piece of technology (lens) change and degrade
#    over time. This illustrates the broader theme of "the transient, passing nature of existence".

# 3. The title 'Phantasmagoria' refers to a sequence of dreamlike, ghostly images. This word itself
#    evokes a sense of fleeting, illusory things from the past.

# Now I will evaluate the options based on this analysis:
# A. Loss of memory and death: Too generic. Misses the specific religious element.
# B. The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs: This aligns perfectly.
#    'Transient nature' covers the fading and ghostly aspects, while 'fading religious beliefs'
#    directly addresses the 'lost deity'.
# C. Impermanence of material objects and memory loss: Misses the core spiritual theme.
# D. Lost or obsolete technologies and the ghosts of the past: 'Lost technologies' is a minor point. The
#    spiritual aspect is more central.
# E. the fading of old religious beliefs and earthly death: 'Transient nature of existence' is a better,
#    more encompassing phrase than just 'earthly death'.

# Therefore, option B is the most complete and accurate answer.
