    "Based on the analysis of the provided sheet music, I can identify the song's details.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Musical Elements:** I'll examine the melody, chord progressions, and structural markings (like D.S. al Coda) on the sheet music. The format is a \"lead sheet,\" which is common for jazz and pop music.\n2.  **Identify the Melody:** The first few notes of the melody are very distinct. Transcribing the first full measure gives the notes: C, E, G, G, G, F, E, D.\n3.  **Recognize the Song:** This melodic phrase is the iconic opening of the song \"All of Me.\"\n4.  **Research Song Details:** I will confirm the details for \"All of Me.\" It was composed in 1931 by Americans Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons. It is a quintessential Tin Pan Alley song that has become one of the most famous and frequently performed jazz standards.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script to present the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information identified from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"All of Me\"\n    musical_style = \"Jazz Standard / Tin Pan Alley\"\n    country_of_origin = \"USA\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the song information.\nget_song_information()\n```\n<<<Title: All of Me, Musical Style: Jazz Standard, Country of Origin: USA>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
