    "An American Sentence is a poetry form created by Allen Ginsberg that consists of a single sentence containing exactly 17 syllables. To determine if this poem fits the pattern, we must first identify all the textual elements that comprise the poem and then count the total number of syllables.\n\nIn visual or collage poetry, elements outside the main body, like titles and page numbers, can be considered part of the poem itself. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nThe words in the poem are:\n1.  From the title: \"The\", \"first\", \"step\"\n2.  From the page number (35): \"thirty-five\"\n3.  From the collage elements: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines\", \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", \"work\"\n\nWhen combined, they form a single sentence: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\nThe following Python code will count the syllables for each word in this sentence and calculate the total to see if it matches the 17-syllable requirement of an American Sentence.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import cmudict\n\n# This script will count the syllables in the poem to identify its metric pattern.\n# We hypothesize that the poem includes the title and page number, aiming for \n# the 17 syllables of an \"American Sentence\".\n\n# Ensure the required NLTK data is available\ntry:\n    arpabet = cmudict.dict()\nexcept LookupError:\n    print(\"NLTK's CMU Pronouncing Dictionary not found.
