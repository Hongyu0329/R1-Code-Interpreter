    "To determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved, we first need to analyze the overall transformation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:** The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and a four-membered ring with one double bond. The product is a complex tricyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀H₄F₆. Let's check the atom count. Hexafluorobenzene provides C₆F₆. To get to C₁₀H₄F₆, the second reactant must have the formula C₄H₄. The drawing shows a molecule that looks like cyclobutene (C₄H₆), but the product stoichiometry indicates a loss of two hydrogen atoms. A more likely, albeit highly reactive, reactant that fits the formula C₄H₄ is **cyclobutadiene**. Assuming the reaction is between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutadiene, the atom count matches perfectly.\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Pathway:** The prompt states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. A plausible pathway that explains the formation of the complex tricyclic product involves two sequential cycloadditions.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: [6π + 4π] Cycloaddition.** The first step is an intermolecular cycloaddition between the 6π-electron system of hexafluorobenzene and the 4π-electron system of cyclobutadiene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [6π + 4π] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. This reaction forms a bicyclo[4.2.2]decatetraene intermediate.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: Intramolecular [2π + 2π] Cycloaddition.** The bicyclic intermediate formed in the first step is highly unsaturated and can undergo a second photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction. An intramolecular [2π + 2π] cycloaddition between two of the double bonds within the bicyclo[4.2.2] skeleton is photochemically allowed. This step forms the final tricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]decane (basketene-like) skeleton shown in the product.\n\nBased on this analysis, the two pericyclic reactions are a [6π + 4π] cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular [2π + 2π] cycloaddition.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    reaction1_name = \"[6π + 4π] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction1_pi_electrons = [6, 4]\n    \n    reaction2_name = \"intramolecular [2π + 2π] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_pi_electrons = [2, 2]\n\n    print(\"The transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(f\"1.
