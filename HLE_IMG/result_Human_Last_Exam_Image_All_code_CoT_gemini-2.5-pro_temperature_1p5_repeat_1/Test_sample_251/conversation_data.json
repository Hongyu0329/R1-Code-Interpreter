    "An ECG (electrocardiogram) measures the heart's electrical activity. The paper speed and grid markings allow us to calculate time intervals.\n\n1.  **Determine the paper speed**: The ECG strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Calculate the time per small square**: The grid on an ECG is made of 1 mm small squares.\n    *   Time for 1 mm (1 small square) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the longest R-R interval**: By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we look for the largest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall spikes). The most significant pause occurs on the fourth line of the ECG tracing (starting near the timestamp `0:06:08`), between the third and fourth QRS complexes.\n4.  **Measure the interval in small squares**: The R-wave before the pause conveniently falls on a major vertical grid line. The R-wave after the pause also lands on a major vertical grid line. Counting the number of large squares (which are 5 small squares wide) between these two points, we find there are exactly 4 large squares.\n    *   Number of small squares = 4 large squares * 5 small squares/large square = 20 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the duration in seconds**: Multiply the number of small squares by the time per small square.\n    *   Duration = 20 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = 0.8 seconds.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n# One small square on the ECG grid is 1 mm wide.\n# We calculate the time it takes for the paper to advance by 1 mm.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# By inspecting the ECG, we find the longest R-R interval.\n# This interval spans 4 large squares. Since each large square is 5 small squares wide,\n# the total distance is 4 * 5 = 20 small squares.\nlongest_rr_interval_small_squares = 20\n\n# Calculate the duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = longest_rr_interval_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\nprint(\"To find the longest R-R interval in seconds, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Duration (s) = Number of small squares * Time per small square (s)\")\nprint(f\"Number of small squares in the longest interval: {longest_rr_interval_small_squares}\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square: 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {longest_rr_interval_small_squares} * {time_per_small_square_sec} = {longest_rr_interval_sec}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<0.8>>>"
