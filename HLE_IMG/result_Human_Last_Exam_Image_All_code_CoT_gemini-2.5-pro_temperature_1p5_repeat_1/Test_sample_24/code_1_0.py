# The provided image is a classical Heegaard diagram known as the "octahedral diagram".
# In the field of 3-manifold topology, it is well-established that this diagram
# represents the lens space L(5,2).

# A lens space L(p,q) is a 3-manifold whose fundamental group, and consequently its
# first homology group H_1, is determined by the parameter p.
# Specifically, the first homology group H_1(L(p,q); Z) is the cyclic group of order p, denoted Z_p.

# For the identified manifold L(5,2), the parameters are p=5 and q=2.
p = 5
q = 2

# The fundamental group of L(p,q) can be given by the presentation <x | x^p = 1>.
# The first homology group is the abelianization of this, with the relation becoming p*x = 0.
# This can be represented by a 1x1 relation matrix.
relation_matrix = np.array([[p]])

# The order of the homology group is the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix.
order_of_homology_group = int(np.abs(np.linalg.det(relation_matrix)))

# We print the identification and the result of the calculation.
