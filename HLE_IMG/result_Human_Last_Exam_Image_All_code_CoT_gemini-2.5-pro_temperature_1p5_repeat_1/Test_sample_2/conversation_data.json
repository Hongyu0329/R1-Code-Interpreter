    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst-case time complexity of the given sorting algorithm.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm designed to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the function does nothing, as an array of size 1 is already sorted.\n    -   **Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first recursively calls itself to sort the prefix of the array, i.e., the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the prefix is sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that prefix. The algorithm then compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with this largest element of the sorted prefix.\n        3.  `swap(...)`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The swap may have disrupted the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. Therefore, the algorithm makes another recursive call to sort that same prefix again.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. The time taken is the sum of the time for the recursive calls and the constant time `c` for the comparison and swap operations.\n    -   In the **best case**, `a[n-1]` is always greater than or equal to `a[n-2]`. This happens, for example, if the array is already sorted. The second recursive call is never made. The recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n    -   In the **worst case**, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, triggering the second recursive call. This happens if the array is sorted in reverse order, because the new element being considered (`a[n-1]`) will always be smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n    -   The worst-case recurrence relation is:\n        `T(n) = T(n-1) (first call) + c (compare/swap) + T(n-1) (second call)`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We solve the worst-case recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   Expanding this `k` times: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n    -   We set `k = n-1` to reach the base case `T(1)`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    -   Since `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the running time is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The time complexity `T(n)` is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nTo verify this, the following Python script implements the algorithm and counts the number of function calls in the worst-case scenario (a reverse-sorted array). It prints a table showing how the number of calls matches the formula `2^n - 1`, which demonstrates the exponential growth.\n\n```python\n# A global counter to track the number of recursive calls\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef sort(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The recursive sorting algorithm from the problem description.\n    It increments a global counter to track the number of calls.\n    \"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n        # 1.

Swap if out of order\n            a[n - 1], a[n - 2] = a[n - 2], a[n - 1]\n            \n            # 4.
