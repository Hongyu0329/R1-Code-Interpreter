    "My plan to identify the alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Structure**: I will examine the provided chemical structure. It is a polycyclic organic molecule containing nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of an alkaloid. Specifically, it has a tetracyclic (four-ring) system and a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n2.  **Identify the Compound**: I will compare this specific ring system and functional group arrangement with known alkaloid structures. This structure is known as a matridane-type alkaloid. The specific compound with the ketone at this position is a well-known natural product.\n3.  **Provide the Name**: Based on the identification, I will state the common name of the compound.\n4.  **Create Python Script**: To fulfill the request, I will create a simple Python script that prints the identified name of the alkaloid.\n\n```python\n# The provided image shows the chemical structure of a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid.\n# This compound is primarily found in plants from the Sophora genus.\n# Based on its distinct structure, including the four rings and the placement of the ketone group,\n# the compound is identified by its common name.\n\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the common name of the given alkaloid structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The common name of this alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
