    "This ancient Greek vase painting depicts a famous mythological scene. Here is the story behind the image:\n\n1.  **The Scene:** This is the story of Pelops and Hippodamia. Pelops wanted to marry Hippodamia, but her father, King Oenomaus, challenged every suitor to a chariot race. If the suitor won, he could marry Hippodamia; if he lost, he was killed.\n2.  **The Deal:** Pelops bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, a man named Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot. He promised Myrtilus the first night with Hippodamia as a reward.\n3.  **The Race:** Myrtilus replaced the bronze linchpins of the king's chariot wheels with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels fell off, and King Oenomaus was killed.\n4.  **The Betrayal:** Pelops won the race and drove off with Hippodamia. When Myrtilus tried to claim his reward, Pelops betrayed him and threw him from the chariot into the sea.\n5.  **The Figure in the Painting:** The image shows Pelops driving the chariot with Hippodamia. The figure on the ground, being run over by the wheel, is the unfortunate charioteer, **Myrtilus**, who has just been thrown from the chariot. Therefore, he is the figure \"leaving\" the chariot.\n\nI will now provide a python script to output the name of this figure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the figure leaving the chariot in the provided image.\n    The image depicts the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n    - The driver of the chariot is Pelops.\n    - His passenger is Hippodamia.\n    - The figure on the ground, having been thrown from the chariot, is Myrtilus.\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Myrtilus\"\n    print(f\"The figure leaving (being thrown from) the chariot is: {figure_name}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Myrtilus>>>"
