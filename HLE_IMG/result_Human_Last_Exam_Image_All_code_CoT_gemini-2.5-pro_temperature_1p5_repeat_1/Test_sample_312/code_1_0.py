    This function determines the chiral index 'm' for each of the nine plots.
    Based on the analysis of electronic properties (metallic/semiconducting),
    band structure features (gaps, density of states), and oscillator strength plots
    (cutting line orientation and position), the following m-values are assigned:

    - Plot 1: Band structure for (4,1) -> m=1
    - Plot 2: Oscillator plot for (4,1) -> m=1
    - Plot 3: Band structure for (4,3) -> m=3
    - Plot 4: Oscillator plot for (4,2) -> m=2
    - Plot 5: Band structure for (4,4) -> m=4
    - Plot 6: Oscillator plot for (4,3) -> m=3
    - Plot 7: Band structure for (4,2) -> m=2
    - Plot 8: Oscillator plot for (4,4) -> m=4
