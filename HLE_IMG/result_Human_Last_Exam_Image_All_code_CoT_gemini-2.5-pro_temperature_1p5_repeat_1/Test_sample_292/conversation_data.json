    "Based on the visual information in the image, I will identify the location by its unique architectural features.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will carefully examine the architectural style, materials, and any other visible clues in the provided picture. The most striking feature is the ceiling structure.\n2.  **Identify the Building:** The unique combination of the white, crisscrossing steel truss system and the glass panels with a blue circular pattern is highly distinctive. I will identify the specific building known for this design.\n3.  **Determine the City:** Once the building is identified, I can determine the city where it is located.\n4.  **Generate Code:** As per the instructions, I will create a simple Python script to print the name of the city.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n*   **Step 1:** The image shows the interior of a large, modern building, looking up at the ceiling. The ceiling consists of a complex, geometric grid of white structural beams.\n*   **Step 2:** The panels within this grid are made of glass and feature a prominent pattern of blue polka dots. The sunlight shining through these panels creates distinctive, mottled shadows on the beams below.\n*   **Step 3:** This unique architectural design is the signature feature of the Grand Concourse in the West Building of **McCormick Place**, a major convention center.\n*   **Step 4:** McCormick Place is located in **Chicago**, Illinois. The design was conceived by the architect Helmut Jahn.\n\nTherefore, the picture was taken in Chicago. I will now provide the Python code to output this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the city where the photo was taken.\n# The image features the unique architectural ceiling of the Grand Concourse\n# in the West Building of McCormick Place.\n# This convention center is located in Chicago.\n\ndef find_city_from_image_clues():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the city identified from the visual clues in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  city = \"Chicago\"\n  print(f\"The city identified from the architectural features in the picture is: {city}\")\n\nfind_city_from_image_clues()\n```\n<<<Chicago>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
