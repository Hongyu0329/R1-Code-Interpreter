    This function identifies the two products of the given chemical reaction.
    The reaction sequence is a 4Ï€ electrocyclic ring opening followed by an endo Diels-Alder cycloaddition.
    This type of problem often leads to multiple diastereomeric products due to the stereochemistry of the sequential reactions.
    Based on a detailed analysis of the pericyclic steps, the two major products formed, representing the different constitutional isomers from the complex reaction pathways, are C and F.
