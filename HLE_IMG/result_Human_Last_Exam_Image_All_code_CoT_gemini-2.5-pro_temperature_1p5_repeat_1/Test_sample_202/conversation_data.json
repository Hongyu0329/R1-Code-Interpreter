    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly vesicular texture, meaning it is full of gas bubbles or holes. This is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of angular fragments of various other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. A rock made of angular clasts is called breccia.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, fine-grained rock with many small vesicles. Its porous and lightweight appearance is characteristic of pumice, a volcanic rock that can often float in water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. It has a mix of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker minerals. This coarse-grained texture with exceptionally large crystals is characteristic of pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
