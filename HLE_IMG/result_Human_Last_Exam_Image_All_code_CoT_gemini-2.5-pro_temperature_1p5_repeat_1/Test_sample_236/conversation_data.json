    "I will identify the insect in the image and provide its scientific name using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Carefully examine the insect's features in the provided image and crops. It's a true bug with a distinct black and orange/red coloration.\n2.  The markings, including the lines on the thorax and the pattern on the back, are characteristic of the boxelder bug.\n3.  I will look up the scientific name for the boxelder bug.\n4.  I will write a Python script to store this name in a variable and then print it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  The insect depicted is commonly known as the boxelder bug.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Scientific name for the Boxelder Bug\n  scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
