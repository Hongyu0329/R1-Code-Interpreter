    Calculates the total area of the shaded regions based on the provided image.
    
    The geometry of the problem suggests that the complex areas involving circular arcs
    might cancel out, leaving a simple polygonal area. A common pattern in such
    problems is that the area can be found with a simple formula derived from the
    given lengths.
    
    Given lengths:
    - Tangent length (t) = 17
    - Hypotenuse of the reference triangle (h) = 34
    
    The hypothesis is that the total shaded area is equivalent to the area of a
    triangle with a base of 34 and a height of 17.
    Area = (1/2) * base * height
         = (1/2) * h * t
