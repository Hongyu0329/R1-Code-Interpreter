    "Based on the unique pattern of spectral lines shown in the image, we can identify the element. This pattern is one of the most well-known in spectroscopy.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum:** The image shows a line spectrum with distinct, bright lines against a dark background. I can see prominent lines in the red, cyan (blue-green), and blue-violet parts of the spectrum. The lines get progressively closer as they move towards the violet end.\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** This specific pattern is the hallmark of the **Balmer series**, which describes the visible spectral lines of the **hydrogen atom**.\n3.  **Confirm with the Rydberg Formula:** The wavelengths of these lines can be predicted by the Rydberg formula: `1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)`. For the Balmer series, `n₁ = 2` and `n₂` can be 3, 4, 5, etc.\n    *   The transition from `n₂ = 3` to `n₁ = 2` produces the red line (H-alpha).\n    *   The transition from `n₂ = 4` to `n₁ = 2` produces the cyan line (H-beta).\n    *   The transition from `n₂ = 5` to `n₁ = 2` produces the blue-violet line (H-gamma).\n4.  **Write a Python Script:** I will write a script to calculate the wavelength of the most prominent red line (H-alpha) using the Rydberg formula to demonstrate the match. The script will then print the known wavelengths of the Balmer series and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the element by calculating and comparing its spectral lines\n    with the pattern shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the provided emission spectrum...\")\n    print(\"The spectrum shows a characteristic pattern of lines known as the Balmer series.\")\n    print(\"This series is unique to the hydrogen atom.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe can verify this using the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:\")\n    print(\"1 / λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)\\n\")\n\n    # Constants\n    R = 1.097373e7  # Rydberg constant for Hydrogen (in m⁻¹)\n    n1 = 2          # Final energy level for the Balmer series\n\n    # --- Calculation for the H-alpha line (the prominent red line) ---\n    n2 = 3          # Initial energy level for the H-alpha line\n    \n    # Calculate the inverse of the wavelength\n    inv_lambda = R * (1/n1**2 - 1/n2**2)\n    \n    # Calculate the wavelength in meters, then convert to nanometers\n    lambda_m = 1 / inv_lambda\n    lambda_nm = lambda_m * 1e9\n    \n    print(\"Let's calculate the wavelength of the most prominent red line (H-alpha):\")\n    print(f\"Here, R = {R:.6e} m⁻¹, n₁ = {n1}, and n₂ = {n2}.\")\n    print(f\"1 / λ = {R:.6e} * (1/{n1}² - 1/{n2}²)\")\n    print(f\"1 / λ = {R:.6e} * (1/{n1**2} - 1/{n2**2})\")\n    print(f\"1 / λ = {R:.6e} * ({1/n1**2 - 1/n2**2})\")\n    print(f\"1 / λ = {inv_lambda:.6e} m⁻¹\")\n    print(f\"λ = 1 / {inv_lambda:.6e} = {lambda_m:.6e} m\")\n    print(f\"λ = {lambda_nm:.1f} nm\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"This calculated value corresponds to the bright red line in the spectrum.\")\n    \n    # Known Balmer series lines for comparison\n    balmer_series = {\n        'H-alpha (n=3)': (656.3, 'Red'),\n        'H-beta (n=4)': (486.1, 'Cyan (Blue-Green)'),\n        'H-gamma (n=5)': (434.1, 'Blue-Violet'),\n        'H-delta (n=6)': (410.2, 'Violet')\n    }\n\n    print(\"The primary visible lines for Hydrogen (Balmer series) are:\")\n    for line, (wavelength, color) in balmer_series.items():\n        print(f\"- {line}: ~{wavelength} nm ({color})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe pattern of lines in the image perfectly matches this series.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The element is Hydrogen.\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Hydrogen>>>"
