    "To determine the total number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results, we will systematically analyze the bands produced in each experiment, making sure not to count the same species multiple times.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Early Transcripts:** We'll start by looking at experiments (B, C, D) that detect \"early\" transcripts, which likely terminate at the early polyadenylation site (AE).\n2.  **Analyze Late Transcripts:** Next, we'll examine experiments (E, F, G, H, I) detecting \"late\" transcripts, which extend further downstream. We will group these by the specific splice junctions and the regions they amplify to identify unique species.\n3.  **Sum the Findings:** We will add the number of unique species identified in each distinct group to get the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided RT-PCR data to count the total number of unique splice species.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing early transcripts (Panels B, C, D)\")\n    # Panel B (E1F1/E4R) shows 2 bands (190 bp and 159 bp).
