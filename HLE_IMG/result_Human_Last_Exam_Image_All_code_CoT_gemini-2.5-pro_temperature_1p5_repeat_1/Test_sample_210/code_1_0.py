  This function analyzes the visual evidence to identify the correct nyala.

  Steps:
  1. Observe the key features of the 'Target' nyala, especially horn shape and the unique pattern of white spots on its rear flank.
  2. Compare these features with each of the options (A-F).
  3. The nyala in image 'B' has the exact same cluster of white spots on its hip as the target nyala.
     Other features like horn shape and stripes also match.
  4. Other images show nyalas with different horn development (A), different spot patterns (D), distinguishing marks like a leg band (E), or are obscured (F).

  # The correct image is B, based on matching spot patterns on the flank.
