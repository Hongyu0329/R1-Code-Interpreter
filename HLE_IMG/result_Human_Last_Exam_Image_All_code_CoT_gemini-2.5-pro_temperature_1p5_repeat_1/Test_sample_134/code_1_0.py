  This function identifies and names the molecule based on its structural components.
  
  The molecule is a macrocycle composed of four repeating units.
  Each unit contains:
  - One 'phenylene' group (a benzene ring).
  - One 'ethynylene-vinylene-ethynylene' linker (-C≡C-CH=CH-C≡C-).

  Since there are four units, it is a tetramer.
  The overall name combines these parts.
