    "This molecule is a large, ring-shaped organic molecule known as a macrocycle. I will identify its constituent parts to determine its name.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The dark grey spheres are carbon atoms (C) and the white spheres are hydrogen atoms (H).\n2.  **Identify the repeating units:** The macrocycle is constructed from repeating structural units. By tracing the molecular backbone, we can see it's composed of two alternating types of components.\n3.  **Characterize the components:**\n    *   **Aromatic rings:** There are four benzene rings, each incorporated into the main ring at two opposite positions (para or 1,4-substitution). This unit is called a **phenylene** group.\n    *   **Linker chains:** Connecting the phenylene rings are chains of carbon atoms. Each linker consists of a central double bond (`-CH=CH-`, a **vinylene** group) flanked by two triple bonds (`-C≡C-`, **ethynylene** groups). The full linker is `-C≡C-CH=CH-C≡C-`.\n4.  **Determine the overall structure:** The molecule is a large ring (a macrocycle) made of four phenylene units and four linker units in an alternating sequence. A molecule made of four repeating units is called a **tetramer**.\n5.  **Assemble the name:** Combining these observations, the molecule can be named by its components and structure: **Cyclic Phenylene Ethynylene Vinylene Tetramer**.\n\nI will now write a simple python script to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef name_molecule():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and names the molecule based on its structural components.\n  \n  The molecule is a macrocycle composed of four repeating units.\n  Each unit contains:\n  - One 'phenylene' group (a benzene ring).\n  - One 'ethynylene-vinylene-ethynylene' linker (-C≡C-CH=CH-C≡C-).\n\n  Since there are four units, it is a tetramer.\n  The overall name combines these parts.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  molecule_name = \"Cyclic Phenylene Ethynylene Vinylene Tetramer\"\n  \n  print(f\"The name of the molecule is: {molecule_name}\")\n\nname_molecule()\n```\n<<<Cyclic Phenylene Ethynylene Vinylene Tetramer>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
