    "The plant in the image is identified as *Argomuellera macrophylla*. This species is known for its distinctive dark green leaves with prominent, reticulated, pale-green to yellow veins. It is native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa.\n\nTo answer the user's question, I will find an island within its native range. The native distribution of *Argomuellera macrophylla* includes several mainland African countries as well as the islands in the Gulf of Guinea. One of these islands is Bioko.\n\nTherefore, an island to which this plant is native is Bioko. I will write a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_plant_enigma():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the plant and the island it is endemic to.\n  \"\"\"\n  plant_name = \"Argomuellera macrophylla\"\n  island_name = \"Bioko\"\n  \n  print(f\"The plant in the image is likely {plant_name}.\")\n  print(f\"It is native to a region in Central and West Africa that includes the island of {island_name}.\")\n  print(f\"Therefore, the name of the island is: {island_name}\")\n\nsolve_plant_enigma()\n```\n<<<Bioko>>>"
