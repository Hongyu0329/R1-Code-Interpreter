    "This is a classic chess puzzle that requires finding a quiet move to set up an unavoidable checkmate.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the White King's position:** The White King at g1 is completely trapped. It has no legal moves.\n    *   The squares f1 and h1 are attacked by the Black Queen on b1.\n    *   The squares f2 and g2 are attacked by the Black Queen on a2.\n    *   The square f2 is also attacked by the Black Knight on d1.\n    *   The square g2 is also attacked by the Black Bishop on h3.\n    *   The square h2 is blocked by its own pawn.\n    Since the king cannot move, any unblockable check from a piece that cannot be captured will be checkmate.\n\n2.  **Evaluate immediate checks:**\n    *   `1... Nf2+`: This is met by `2. Kxf2`. The White King escapes, so this is not a mate in 2.\n    *   `1... Bxg2+`: This is met by `2. hxg2`. The pawn captures the bishop, and it is not checkmate.\n\n3.  **Find the key move:** Since direct checks don't work, we need a quiet move that creates an unstoppable threat. The key move is `1. Rf6`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the consequences of `1. Rf6`:**\n    *   This move creates a powerful threat: `2. Nf2#`.\n    *   Let's check if `Nf2#` is mate: The knight checks the king. The king can't move. The check can't be blocked. Can the knight be captured? The king can't capture it (`Kxf2`) because the Black Rook on f6 now defends the f2 square. So, this threat is lethal.\n\n5.  **Analyze White's defense:**\n    *   White must defend against the `Nf2#` threat. White's only option is to control the f2 square. The only piece that can do this is the Bishop on c1, by moving to e3. Therefore, White's only viable move is `2. Be3`.\n\n6.  **Find the second mate:**\n    *   If White plays `2. Be3`, the threat of `Nf2#` is gone (because the Bishop could now capture the Knight). However, by moving the Bishop from c1 to e3, White has created a new weakness. The Bishop can no longer guard the g-file.\n    *   Black now delivers a different mate: `2. Rg6#`.\n    *   Let's check `Rg6#`: The rook on g6 checks the king. The king can't move. The check can't be blocked (the Bishop is now on e3 and can't get in the way). The rook can't be captured. This is checkmate.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with `1. Rf6` guarantees a mate on the next move, regardless of White's play.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The solution is a mate in 2 for Black, without moving the queens.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1 = \"1.
