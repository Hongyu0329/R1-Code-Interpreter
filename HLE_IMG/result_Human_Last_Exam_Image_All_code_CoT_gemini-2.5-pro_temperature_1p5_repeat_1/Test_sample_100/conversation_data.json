    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will follow the reaction scheme step-by-step, calculating the change in the number of atoms at each stage.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material Analysis**: The starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. A careful count of its atoms is required. The structure is a derivative of 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n    *   **PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group**: This group has the formula C8H9O.\n    *   **Core Structure (the bicyclic lactam part with the CF3 group)**: Let's count the atoms in the rest of the molecule. It contains 7 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms, 3 Fluorine atoms, 1 Nitrogen atom, and 1 Oxygen atom (C7H5F3NO).\n    *   **Total Starting Material**: Combining the PMB group and the core gives a total formula of C15H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: CAN, ACN/H2O**: Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is used to remove the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom. This reaction cleaves the C8H9O group and replaces it with a single Hydrogen atom on the nitrogen.\n    *   Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1 => Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n    *   **Intermediate 1 Formula**: C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N1 O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Reaction 2: Pd/C, H2**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C) by adding two Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Change: +H2.\n    *   **Intermediate 2 Formula**: C7 H(6+2) F3 N1 O1 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Reaction 3: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C**: This step involves the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). This reaction breaks the amide bond by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   Change: +H2, +O1.\n    *   **Final Product Formula**: C7 H(8+2) F3 N1 O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to arrive at the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the composition of Intermediate 1.\n    # The starting material is deprotected (PMB group C8H9O is removed, H is added)\n    # The resulting structure (Intermediate 1) is a 6-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n    # Let's define its atomic composition.\n    intermediate_1 = {'C': 7, 'H': 6, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 1}\n    print(\"The reaction sequence starts after the deprotection step.\")\n    print(f\"Formula of Intermediate 1: C{intermediate_1['C']}H{intermediate_1['H']}F{intermediate_1['F']}N{intermediate_1['N']}O{intermediate_1['O']}\")\n    \n    # Initialize the composition for tracking changes.\n    current_composition = intermediate_1.copy()\n\n    # Step 2: Hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2).
