    # A low, and potentially negative, Poisson's ratio is associated with
    # "re-entrant" structures (structures with inward-pointing angles).

    # The shape labeled (1, 0) is a regular hexagon, which forms a conventional honeycomb
    # with a high positive Poisson's ratio.
    # As we move through the sequence from (1, 0) to (0, 1), the tile shape becomes
    # progressively more re-entrant.
    # The shape labeled (0, 1) has the most pronounced re-entrant features.
