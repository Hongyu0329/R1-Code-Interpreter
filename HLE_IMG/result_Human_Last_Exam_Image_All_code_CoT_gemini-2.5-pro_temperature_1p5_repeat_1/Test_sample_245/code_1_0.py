                "1. Ornate Scutum: The dorsal shield behind the head has distinctive silvery-white or grayish markings, which is characteristic of this species.\n" \
                "2. Festoons: The posterior edge of the tick's body is scalloped or grooved, a feature known as festoons, which are present in Dermacentor ticks but absent in Ixodes (deer) ticks.\n" \
