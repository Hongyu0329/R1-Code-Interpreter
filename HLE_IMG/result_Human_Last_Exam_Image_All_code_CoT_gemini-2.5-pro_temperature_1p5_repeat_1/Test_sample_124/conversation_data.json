    "To solve for the total current flowing through the circuit, we first need to find the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit. Then, we can use Ohm's law (I = V / R) to find the total current (I_total).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the circuit's structure:** The circuit is composed of a voltage source connected to two parallel branches.\n2.  **Simplify the left branch:**\n    *   Observe the wiring around resistors R1, R2, and R3. There is a wire that connects the positive terminal of the voltage source directly to the node between R1 and R2.\n    *   Since the top of R1 is also connected to the positive terminal, both ends of R1 are at the same electrical potential. This means R1 is short-circuited and can be ignored for calculation purposes.\n    *   Therefore, the left branch simplifies to resistors R2 and R3 connected in series.\n    *   `R_left = R2 + R3 = 7 Ω + 9 Ω = 16 Ω`.\n3.  **Simplify the right branch:**\n    *   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series.\n    *   `R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω`.\n4.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req):**\n    *   The simplified left branch (R_left) and right branch (R_right) are connected in parallel across the voltage source.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance is calculated as: `Req = (R_left * R_right) / (R_left + R_right)`.\n5.  **Calculate the total current (I_total):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law, the total current flowing from the voltage source V2 is `I_total = V2 / Req`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total current flowing from the voltage source in the given circuit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given values from the circuit diagram ---\n    V2 = 1.0   # Voltage in Volts\n    R1 = 3.0   # Resistance in Ohms\n    R2 = 7.0   # Resistance in Ohms\n    R3 = 9.0   # Resistance in Ohms\n    R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n    R8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n    # --- Step 1: Simplify the left branch ---\n    # In the diagram, a wire connects the positive terminal of the source to the node \n    # between R1 and R2. This shorts out R1, so it is removed from the calculation.\n    # The left branch is therefore composed of R2 and R3 in series.\n    R_left = R2 + R3\n\n    # --- Step 2: Simplify the right branch ---\n    # The right branch consists of R8 and R7 in series.\n    R_right = R8 + R7\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate total equivalent resistance (Req) ---\n    # The two branches are in parallel with each other.\n    Req = (R_left * R_right) / (R_left + R_right)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate the total current (I_total) ---\n    I_total = V2 / Req\n\n    # --- Print the step-by-step solution ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the circuit branches.\")\n    print(f\"The left branch simplifies to R2 and R3 in series because R1 ({R1} Ω) is short-circuited.\")\n    print(f\"R_left = R2 + R3 = {R2} Ω + {R3} Ω = {R_left} Ω\")\n    print(f\"The right branch is R7 and R8 in series.\")\n    print(f\"R_right = R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_right} Ω\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req).\")\n    print(f\"Req = (R_left * R_right) / (R_left + R_right)\")\n    print(f\"Req = ({R_left} * {R_right}) / ({R_left} + {R_right}) = {Req:.4f} Ω\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the total current (I_total) using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\")\n    print(\"I_total = V2 / Req\")\n    print(f\"I_total = {V2} V / {Req:.4f} Ω\")\n    print(f\"I_total = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n    \n    # Store the final numerical answer in a variable for easy retrieval if needed.\n    # Note: The output format requires <<<answer>>> at the end. The final printed value is the answer.\n    # We round the answer to 4 decimal places for clarity.\n    final_answer = f\"<<<{I_total:.4f}>>>\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The problem asks for the code to be executed, so this block will run.\n    # We suppress the final \"<<<answer>>>\" string from appearing in the code block output,\n    # as the instructions ask to *return* it at the very end of the entire response.\n    # The printed output of the function is the explanation.\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout \n    try:\n        solve_circuit()\n    finally:\n        sys.stdout = original_stdout\n\n```\n<<<0.0675>>>"
