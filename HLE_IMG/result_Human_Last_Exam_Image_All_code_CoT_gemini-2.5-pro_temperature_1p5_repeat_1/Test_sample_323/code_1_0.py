# Step 1: Determine n_0 and m_0 from the problem description and image analysis.
# The heat transfer rate 'q' is proportional to sqrt(k * P * A_c).
# Thermal conductivities: k_Copper > k_Platinum > k_CarbonSteel.
# For the given conditions, the geometric factor sqrt(P * A_c) is larger for the square fin than the circular fin.
#
# From the plots:
# - High 'q' plots (1 and 7) are Copper. Plot 7 (q=12.7W) > Plot 1 (q=11.6W), so Plot 7 is square and Plot 1 is circular.
# - Low 'q' plots (3, 5, 9) are Platinum and Carbon Steel.
# - Plot 5 (q=8.4W) has the highest 'q' in this group, so it's the square Platinum fin.
# - Plots 3 (q=7.6W) and 9 (q=7.2W) are circular fins. Since k_Pt > k_CS, Plot 3 is circular Platinum and Plot 9 is circular Carbon Steel.
#
# Therefore, n_0 corresponds to plot 9.
n0 = 9
# The geometry of the fin in plot 9 is circular, so m_0 = 1.
m0 = 1

# Step 2: Calculate R(c), the heat transfer ratio for the circular fin.
# Given conditions for circular fin: hL/k = ln(13), 4L/d = ln(13).
# We can derive that mL = ln(13) and h/(mk) = 1.
# The ratio R = [ (tanh(mL) + h/(mk)) / (1 + (h/(mk)) * tanh(mL)) ] / tanh(mL).
# With h/(mk) = 1, this simplifies to R = 1 / tanh(mL).
# We use the identity tanh(ln(x)) = (x^2 - 1) / (x^2 + 1) or (x - 1/x) / (x + 1/x).
x_c = 13
tanh_mL_c = Fraction(x_c - 1/x_c) / Fraction(x_c + 1/x_c) # (168/13) / (170/13) = 168/170
R_c = 1 / tanh_mL_c

# Step 3: Calculate R(s), the heat transfer ratio for the square fin.
# Given conditions for square fin: hL/k = ln(2), 4L/w = ln(2).
# We can derive that mL = ln(2) and h/(mk) = 1.
# The formula for R simplifies to R = 1 / tanh(mL).
x_s = 2
tanh_mL_s = Fraction(x_s - 1/x_s) / Fraction(x_s + 1/x_s) # (3/2) / (5/2) = 3/5
R_s = 1 / tanh_mL_s

# Step 4: Calculate the final expression: n0 * (R(c)/R(s))^m0.
result = n0 * (R_c / R_s) ** m0

# Output the results and the final equation.
