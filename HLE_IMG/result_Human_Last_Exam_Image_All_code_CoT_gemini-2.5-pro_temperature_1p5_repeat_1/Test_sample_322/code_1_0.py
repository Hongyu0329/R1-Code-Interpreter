def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function stores and prints the solution to the vortex trajectory puzzle.
    
    The solution is a 16-character string derived from analyzing each plot:
    - Uppercase (R, G, B) for a vortex with twice the strength.
    - Lowercase (r, g, b) for a vortex with half the strength.
    
    The logic for identification is as follows:
    - A stronger vortex has a more compact, central trajectory.
    - A weaker vortex has a larger, more extended trajectory as it is "pushed around".
