    "To determine the time signature of this musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes within the bar lines and see how many beats it adds up to. We'll analyze both the upper (treble clef) and lower (treble clef) staves.\n\nThe value of a note tells us its duration:\n*   A whole note lasts for 4 beats.\n*   A half note lasts for 2 beats.\n*   A quarter note lasts for 1 beat.\n*   An eighth note lasts for 1/2 a beat.\n*   A sixteenth note lasts for 1/4 of a beat.\n\nLet's calculate the total beats for each staff, assuming a quarter note gets one beat.\n\n**Upper Staff (Right Hand):**\n1.  **Beat 1:** An eighth rest (1/2 beat) + an eighth note (1/2 beat) = 1 beat.\n2.  **Beat 2:** Two sixteenth notes (1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 beat) + one eighth note (1/2 beat) = 1 beat.\n3.  **Beat 3:** Two sixteenth notes (1/2 beat) + one eighth note (1/2 beat) = 1 beat.\n4.  **Beat 4:** Four sixteenth notes (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) = 1 beat.\n*Total for Upper Staff:* 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 beats.\n\n**Lower Staff (Left Hand):**\n1.  **Beat 1:** A quarter note chord = 1 beat.\n2.  **Beats 2-3:** A half note = 2 beats.\n3.  **Beat 4:** A quarter note = 1 beat.\n*Total for Lower Staff:* 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beats.\n\nSince both staves contain a total of 4 quarter-note beats, the time signature is 4/4.\n\nHere is a Python script to demonstrate the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of beats in the provided musical measure\n    to determine the time signature.
