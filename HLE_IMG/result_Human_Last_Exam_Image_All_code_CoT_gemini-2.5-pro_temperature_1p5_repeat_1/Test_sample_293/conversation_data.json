    "Based on the histopathological features presented in the image, the diagnosis can be determined.\n\n### Pathological Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Structure:** The image shows a renal glomerulus, which is the filtering unit of the kidney.\n2.  **Observe Key Features:** The most striking feature is a large, pink, and cellular, crescent-shaped structure occupying Bowman's space (the space between the glomerular tuft and Bowman's capsule). This is known as a **cellular crescent**.\n3.  **Analyze the Glomerular Tuft:** The glomerular tuft itself appears hypercellular and is compressed by the overlying crescent.\n4.  **Interpret the Findings:** The presence of a cellular crescent is the defining characteristic of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This condition is a pattern of severe glomerular injury that, clinically, often presents as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), a medical emergency characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function. The crescent is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and the influx of inflammatory cells into Bowman's space in response to severe injury to the glomerular capillaries.\n\nTherefore, the diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. I will now provide a Python script to print this diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef get_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the histopathological diagnosis based on the visual evidence\n    in the provided image, which shows a prominent cellular crescent in a glomerulus.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n    return diagnosis\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to print the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    final_diagnosis = get_diagnosis()\n    print(f\"The histopathological diagnosis is: {final_diagnosis}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
