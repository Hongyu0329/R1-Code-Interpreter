    "Based on the provided image and description, I will identify the name of the specific auditory illusion being demonstrated. The image displays a spectrogram and waveform of a signal. Initially, it's a pure tone, which is then interrupted by a short burst of noise, and then the sound continues. The associated illusion is that a listener perceives the initial pure tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise, even though the tone's sound waves are completely absent during the noise burst. The brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap. This famous psychoacoustic phenomenon has a specific name.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that simply declares this name as a string and prints it to the console, as per the user's instructions.\n\n```python\n# The image displays a visual representation (spectrogram and waveform)\n# of a famous auditory illusion. In this illusion, a sound like a pure\n# tone is interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise.\n# The human brain, however, perceives the tone as continuous,\n# effectively \"restoring\" the part of the tone that was obscured by the noise.\n# This perceptual phenomenon, discovered by Richard M. Warren, is known as\n# the Phonemic restoration effect. Although the name refers to phonemes (speech sounds),\n# it is also the standard term for the effect when demonstrated with simple tones.\n\nphenomenon_name = \"Phonemic restoration effect\"\nprint(phenomenon_name)\n```\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
