    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, we need to perform a harmonic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Home Key:** The first movement of the Pathetique sonata is in C minor.\n2.  **Locate the Chord:** The chord in question is in measure 30, which immediately follows a G dominant 7th chord (V7 of C minor) and precedes a D major chord.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord and its Context:**\n    *   The notes in measure 30 are G#, C#, and E.\n    *   The following chord in measure 31 is a D major triad (D-F#-A). In the key of C minor, a D major chord is the dominant of G (the home dominant), so its function is a secondary dominant, notated as V/V.\n4.  **Determine the Function of the Chord in Measure 30:** The chord in measure 30 resolves to the D major chord (V/V). Therefore, its function is to prepare or lead into V/V. Chords that lead to a new harmony are typically either its dominant or its leading-tone chord.\n5.  **Identify the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The dominant of D major would be A major (V/V/V). The notes are A-C#-E.\n    *   The leading-tone chord of D major would be a C# diminished triad (vii째/V/V). The notes are C#-E-G.\n    *   Our chord (G#-C#-E) contains the C# and E from the leading-tone chord. The G# is a chromatic alteration of the chord-tone G. It can be analyzed as a chromatic passing tone, moving from the G in the previous measure's chord towards an implied A (the root of the V of D).\n    *   Because the chord is built on the leading-tone (C#) of the chord it resolves to (D), and its function is that of a leading-tone chord, the most appropriate Roman numeral is a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\nTherefore, the Roman numeral for the chord in measure 30 is the leading-tone chord of the dominant of the dominant.\n\n```python\ndef get_roman_numeral_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a step-by-step harmonic analysis of measure 30\n    of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure_chord_notes = \"G#, C#, E\"\n    next_measure_chord = \"D Major\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the home key and the relevant chords.\")\n    print(f\"The piece is in {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The chord in measure 30 contains the notes: {measure_chord_notes}.\")\n    print(f\"The chord in the next measure (m. 31) is {next_measure_chord}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the function of the chord in measure 31.\")\n    print(f\"In the key of {key}, the dominant chord (V) is G Major.\")\n    print(f\"The {next_measure_chord} chord is the dominant of G Major.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the D Major chord is a secondary dominant, specifically the 'dominant of the dominant'.\")\n    print(\"Its Roman numeral is V/V.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the function of the chord in measure 30.\")\n    print(\"The chord in measure 30 resolves to the D Major chord (V/V).
