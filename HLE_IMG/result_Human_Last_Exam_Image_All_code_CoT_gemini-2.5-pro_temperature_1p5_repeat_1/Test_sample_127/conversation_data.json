    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in the given Iridium complex, we need to analyze the steric environment around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main ligand structure. Free rotation around a single bond can be restricted or completely hindered if the rotating group is bulky and clashes with other nearby parts of the molecule.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to identify the freely rotating rings:\n1.  **Identify the Phenyl Rings:** First, we identify the peripheral phenyl rings. These are the rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L, which are attached as substituents to the main ligands.\n2.  **Analyze the Ligand Structure:** The Iridium (Ir) center is coordinated by three main ligands. Two of these are C^N-type cyclometalating ligands (composed of rings A-B and C-D), and one is an N^N-type ligand (rings E-F). The coordination creates a crowded environment around the metal.\n3.  **Evaluate Steric Hindrance for Each Ring:** We will assess each pendant phenyl ring based on its attachment point.\n    *   Rings attached far from the metal center and other bulky groups can rotate freely. Typically, a substituent at the `para` position (like C4 on a phenyl ring) points away from the complex and experiences low steric hindrance.\n    *   Rings attached very close to the coordination sites will have their rotation blocked. This includes rings attached to the exact atom bonded to the metal (a metallated carbon) or rings attached to atoms *ortho* (adjacent) to a coordination site (e.g., adjacent to the metallated carbon or the coordinating nitrogen).\n4.  **Apply the Rules:**\n    *   **Ring H and J:** Both are attached at the C4 position of the main phenyl rings (A and C, respectively). This is a `para` position, pointing away from the congested metal center. They should be able to rotate freely.\n    *   **Ring K:** This ring is attached to C6 of ring A. The diagram indicates that C6 of ring A is also the atom directly bonded to the Iridium. A phenyl group attached to the coordinating atom itself will be severely hindered. Rotation is not possible.\n    *   **Ring L:** This ring is attached to C5 of ring C. C6 of ring C is bonded to the Iridium. Therefore, the C5 position is *ortho* to the metallation site. This proximity to the metal and other ligands will prevent free rotation.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to C6 of the pyridine ring D. The pyridine's nitrogen is coordinated to the Iridium. The C6 position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen, placing ring G in a very crowded space next to ring C and the metal center, thus hindering its rotation.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, only rings H and J have the necessary space to rotate freely.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer programmatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the molecular structure to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely\n    based on steric hindrance rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the structure: pendant rings, their attachment points, and coordination sites.\n    # 'metal_bond_pos' for phenylene is the carbon atom number bonded to Iridium.\n    # 'metal_bond_pos' for pyridine is 'N'.\n    rings = {\n        'G': {'type': 'pendant_phenyl', 'attachment_point': {'ring': 'D', 'pos': 6}},\n        'H': {'type': 'pendant_phenyl', 'attachment_point': {'ring': 'A', 'pos': 4}},\n        'J': {'type': 'pendant_phenyl', 'attachment_point': {'ring': 'C', 'pos': 4}},\n        'K': {'type': 'pendant_phenyl', 'attachment_point': {'ring': 'A', 'pos': 6}},\n        'L': {'type': 'pendant_phenyl', 'attachment_point': {'ring': 'C', 'pos': 5}},\n        'A': {'type': 'phenylene', 'metal_bond_pos': 6},\n        'B': {'type': 'pyridine', 'metal_bond_pos': 'N'},\n        'C': {'type': 'phenylene', 'metal_bond_pos': 6},\n        'D': {'type': 'pyridine', 'metal_bond_pos': 'N'},\n    }\n\n    pendant_phenyl_rings = ['G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L']\n    free_rotators = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing steric hindrance for each pendant phenyl ring:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    for ring_label in sorted(pendant_phenyl_rings):\n        ring_data = rings[ring_label]\n        attachment = ring_data['attachment_point']\n        parent_ring_label = attachment['ring']\n        parent_ring_data = rings[parent_ring_label]\n        attachment_pos = attachment['pos']\n\n        is_hindered = False\n        reason = \"Considered free to rotate as it is not in a sterically hindered position.\"\n\n        # Rule 1: Hindered if attached to the metallated carbon atom.\n        if parent_ring_data.get('type') == 'phenylene' and attachment_pos == parent_ring_data['metal_bond_pos']:\n            is_hindered = True\n            reason = f\"Hindered: Attached directly to the metallated carbon C{attachment_pos} of ring {parent_ring_label}.\"\n        \n        # Rule 2: Hindered if attached ortho (adjacent) to the metallated carbon.\n        elif parent_ring_data.get('type') == 'phenylene' and abs(attachment_pos - parent_ring_data['metal_bond_pos']) == 1:\n            is_hindered = True\n            reason = f\"Hindered: Attached at C{attachment_pos} of ring {parent_ring_label}, which is ortho to the metallated carbon C{parent_ring_data['metal_bond_pos']}.\"\n        \n        # Rule 3: Hindered if attached ortho to the coordinating nitrogen on a pyridine ring.\n        elif parent_ring_data.get('type') == 'pyridine' and attachment_pos in [2, 6]:\n            is_hindered = True\n            reason = f\"Hindered: Attached at C{attachment_pos} of pyridine ring {parent_ring_label}, which is ortho to the coordinating Nitrogen.\"\n        \n        # Unhindered case (para-position) for clarity\n        if not is_hindered and parent_ring_data.get('type') == 'phenylene' and attachment_pos == 4:\n            reason = \"Free to rotate: Attached at the para-position (C4), which points away from the congested metal center.\"\n\n\n        print(f\"Ring {ring_label}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Attached to C{attachment_pos} of ring {parent_ring_label}.\")\n        print(f\"  - Verdict: {reason}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n        if not is_hindered:\n            free_rotators.append(ring_label)\n\n    # Sort for consistent output.
