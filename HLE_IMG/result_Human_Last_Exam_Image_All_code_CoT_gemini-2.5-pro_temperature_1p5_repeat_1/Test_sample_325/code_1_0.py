def solve_reaction_diffusion_plots():
    """
    Analyzes the six plots of a reaction-diffusion process to determine the parameter changes.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    - Plot 2 is the baseline ('0').
    - Plot 4 shows the slowest time evolution, which is characteristic of a halved diffusion coefficient ('d').
    - Plot 6 shows faster time evolution and a higher concentration of reactant A in the center, which results from a doubled diffusion coefficient ('D').
    - Plots 1 and 3 show faster reactions (lower A, higher B). Plot 3 is more extreme, with A being almost completely consumed. A reduced reaction order ('n') makes the reaction very efficient at low concentrations, matching Plot 3. This leaves Plot 1 as the result of a doubled rate constant ('K').
    - Plot 5 shows a slower reaction (higher A, lower B). This is the opposite of Plot 1 and is thus due to a halved rate constant ('k').
    - The change for 'N' (doubled reaction order) would also slow the reaction, but the available plots are accounted for by the other five changes.
