    # carbamate, which protects the amine. This protecting group is called

    # The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of Intermediate 1 is activated and then
    # reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.

    # 1. The Cbz group is removed, regenerating the free amino group (-NH2).
    # 2. The O-benzyl group is removed, forming the hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH).
