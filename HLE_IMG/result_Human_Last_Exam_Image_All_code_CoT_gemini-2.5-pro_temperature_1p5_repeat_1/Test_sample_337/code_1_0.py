def solve_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided information and determines the correct statements.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The problem asks to identify all correct statements among the given list.
    2. We test the given answer choices for internal consistency.
    3. Let's test answer choice B, which corresponds to statements {1, 3, 8}.
    4. Statement 1 asserts: Plots 2 and 5 correspond to system (A). This establishes the pair (2, 5) for the reactor with recycle.
    5. Statement 3 asserts: Plots 1 and 4 correspond to system (C). This establishes the pair (1, 4) for the catalyst pellet.
    6. By elimination, the remaining plots, 3 and 6, must correspond to the remaining system (B), the tubular reactor without recycle.
    7. Now we verify Statement 8. Statement 8 says that plots 4, 5, and 6 have the higher Lewis number.
    8. In any given pair, the plot exhibiting more complex dynamics (oscillations or chaos) corresponds to the higher Lewis number.
    9. For pair (1, 4), plot 4 (limit cycle) is more complex than plot 1 (stable). So, plot 4 has the higher Le.
    10. For pair (2, 5), plot 5 (limit cycle) is more complex than plot 2 (stable). So, plot 5 has the higher Le.
    11. For pair (3, 6), plot 6 (chaos) is more complex than plot 3 (stable). So, plot 6 has the higher Le.
    12. The set of plots with the higher Lewis number is therefore {4, 5, 6}.
    13. This matches Statement 8.
    14. Since statements 1, 3, and 8 are all consistent with each other under this interpretation, this is the correct combination.
