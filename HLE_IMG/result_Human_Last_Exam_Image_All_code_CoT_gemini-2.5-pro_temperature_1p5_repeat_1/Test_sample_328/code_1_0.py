# Plan:
# The solution is a 16-character string where each character represents the
# unique parameter and its value for the corresponding plot (1-16).
# I have analyzed the behavior of the system for all 18 possible parameter
# combinations by finding the stable fixed points of the potential.
# Based on this analysis, I matched the predicted behavior (tends to red, tends to blue,
# oscillatory, calm scattering) to the visual features of each of the 16 plots.
# The resulting assignment uses 16 distinct parameter sets and provides a
# consistent explanation for all plots.

# The final mapping from plot number to code is:
# 1: 0  (d=0, b=c=1) -> Asymmetric oscillations
# 2: b  (b=-1, c=d=1) -> Tends red
# 3: B  (b=1, c=d=0) -> Tends red (structured)
# 4: C  (c=1, b=d=0) -> Symmetric oscillations
# 5: C  (c=1, b=d=-1) -> Tends blue
# 6: D  (d=1, b=c=-1) -> Tends red (oscillatory)
# 7: D  (d=1, b=c=0) -> Tends red (chaotic)
# 8: b  (b=-1, c=d=0) -> Tends blue (oscillatory)
# 9: Z  (c=0, b=d=1) -> Tends red
# 10: c (c=-1, b=d=0) -> Calm symmetric scattering
# 11: c (c=-1, b=d=1) -> Tends red
# 12: d (d=-1, b=c=0) -> Tends blue
# 13: d (d=-1, b=c=1) -> Tends blue
# 14: B (b=1, c=d=-1) -> Tends blue
# 15: 0 (d=0, b=c=-1) -> Calm asymmetric scattering
# 16: Z (c=0, b=d=-1) -> Tends blue (oscillatory)
