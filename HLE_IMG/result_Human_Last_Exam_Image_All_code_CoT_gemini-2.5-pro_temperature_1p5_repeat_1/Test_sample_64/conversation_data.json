    "This image shows a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a biological process under a microscope.\n\n1.  **Image L:** We see a straight, tube-like structure divided into segments by cross-walls (septa). This is characteristic of a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga. The arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n2.  **Image M:** At the septum indicated by the arrowhead, the cell wall has started to bulge outwards. The main hypha is beginning to bend at this point.\n3.  **Image N:** The bulge has grown larger, forming the beginning of a new branch. The original hypha is now significantly bent or buckled at the point of branching.\n\nThis sequence illustrates the process of **hyphal branching**. This is a fundamental way that fungi grow and spread, forming a complex network called a mycelium. The process begins with the localized weakening of the cell wall, allowing internal turgor pressure to push the wall outward, initiating a new tip that will grow into a branch.\n\nI will not provide any code for this task as it is a question about a biological process, not a computational one.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
