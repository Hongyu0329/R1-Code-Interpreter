    This function identifies the location where the picture was taken and the city in the background.

    Analysis of the image:
    1.  The prominent lit tower in the background is Coit Tower, a landmark in San Francisco, USA.
    2.  The photograph is taken across a significant body of water, which is the San Francisco Bay.
    3.  The viewpoint that provides this perspective of Coit Tower and the San Francisco waterfront is from the city of Sausalito, located in Marin County.

    Therefore, the picture was taken in Sausalito, looking at San Francisco.
