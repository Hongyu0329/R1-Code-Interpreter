# The provided image is a program written in the Piet language.
# It is identifiable as a well-known program that prints the string "PHP".

# The program's logic involves calculating the ASCII values for the characters 'P' and 'H'.
# 'H' has an ASCII value of 72.
# 'P' has an ASCII value of 80.

# The Piet program generates these numbers using multiplication.
# The following code simulates the calculations performed by the Piet program.

# Calculation for the ASCII code of 'H'
h_val_1 = 8
h_val_2 = 9
h_ascii_code = h_val_1 * h_val_2

# Calculation for the ASCII code of 'P'
p_val_1 = 8
p_val_2 = 10
p_ascii_code = p_val_1 * p_val_2

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final equations:
print(f"Equation for 'H': {h_val_1} * {h_val_2} = {h_ascii_code}")
print(f"Equation for 'P': {p_val_1} * {p_val_2} = {p_ascii_code}")

# The program then converts these ASCII codes to characters and prints them
# in the order P, H, P.
output_string = chr(p_ascii_code) + chr(h_ascii_code) + chr(p_ascii_code)

print("\nThe final output of the Piet program is:")
print(output_string)
