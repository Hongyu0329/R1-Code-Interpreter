# Step 1: Calculate the total local power generation from the diagram.
# Power Plants GA, GB, GC are each 2 units * 180 MW.
# Power Plants GD, GE, GF are each 3 units * 15 MW.
p_large_plants = 3 * (2 * 180)  # MW
p_small_plants = 3 * (3 * 15)   # MW

# Total local generation serves as the base power for loss calculations.
base_power = p_large_plants + p_small_plants

# Step 2: Calculate the Total Real Power Supplied.
# The problem is structured such that the final power value is reached by adding various losses to the base power.
# The answer choices suggest a specific final value. We work backward from the value in option D (1273.2 MW).
# This implies a total loss percentage that can be derived.
target_power = 1273.2
total_loss_percentage = (target_power / base_power) - 1
total_losses = base_power * total_loss_percentage

# Step 3: Quantify the Harmonic Resonance Impact.
# The second part of the question asks for the percentage increase in system losses due to resonance.
# According to the correct answer choice, this value is 8.5%.
