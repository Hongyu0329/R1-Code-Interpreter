# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves the formation of a new C-C bond
# and the migration of a double bond.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C-Br bond at C9.
# 2. Carbopalladation: The C4=C5 double bond inserts into the C9-Pd bond.
#    A new C-C bond forms between C5 and C9, and the Pd moves to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: The Pd at C4 is eliminated along with a hydrogen
#    from an adjacent carbon. The adjacent carbon with available hydrogens is C3.
# 4. This elimination process creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.
