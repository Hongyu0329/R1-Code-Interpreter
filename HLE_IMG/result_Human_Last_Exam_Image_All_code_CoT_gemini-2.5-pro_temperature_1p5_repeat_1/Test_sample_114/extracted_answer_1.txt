The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the severe steric hindrance at one end of its bicyclic münchnone intermediate, which is formed from the rigid N-acetylproline starting material. This contrasts with the flexible, acyclic münchnone in Reaction 1, where the two ends are sterically similar, leading to no regioselectivity. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish this baseline lack of selectivity, proving that the cyclic nature of the proline derivative is the key factor for the selectivity in Reaction 3.
