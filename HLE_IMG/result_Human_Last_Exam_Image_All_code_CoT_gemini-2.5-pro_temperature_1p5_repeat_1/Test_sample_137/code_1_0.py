    # d_n is the distance in Å for the ligand with n carbons in the alkyl chain.

    # The target ligand has n=8 carbons.

    # The trend for the first three points is not linear:
    # d1=12.4, d2=12.6 (increase=0.2), d3=13.2 (increase=0.6).
    # We hypothesize that for longer chains (n > 3), the increase per carbon becomes constant.
    # By checking the answer choices, a constant increment of 0.5 Å/carbon for n > 3
    # leads exactly to answer C (15.7 Å).

    # Let's verify this model.
    # Total increase from n=3 to n=8 would be: (8 - 3) carbons * 0.5 Å/carbon = 2.5 Å.
