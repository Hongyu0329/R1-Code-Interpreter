    "My plan to identify the opera from the sheet music involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** I will examine the provided musical score, paying close attention to key details like the instrumentation (listed in German, e.g., `gr. Fl.` for Flute, `Hob.` for Oboe, `Br.` for Viola), musical markings (`mit Dämpfer` for with mute, `gliss.` for glissando), and structural cues (`1 (Vorhang)`, which means \"Curtain\" at rehearsal mark 1).\n2.  **Characterize the Musical Style:** The harmony is highly dissonant, and the texture is complex and atmospheric. The use of specific effects like mutes and glissandi points towards early 20th-century music, specifically expressionism or late romanticism.\n3.  **Identify the Composer and Work:** Based on the distinctive atonal language, the large orchestra, and the specific musical gestures, I will search for operas matching this profile. The combination of features is highly characteristic of the Austrian composer Alban Berg. A comparison confirms that this exact music is the prelude to Act II of his opera *Wozzeck*.\n4.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the opera as the final answer, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_opera_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n\n    Analysis of the score:\n    1.  Instrumentation: The instruments are listed in German (e.g., 'Hob.' for Oboe, 'Br.' for Viola).\n    2.  Markings: Instructions like '(Vorhang)' (Curtain), 'mit Dämpfer' (with mute), and 'gliss.' (glissando) are present.\n    3.  Musical Style: The music is atonal and highly expressive, characteristic of the early 20th century.\n\n    Conclusion: These features precisely match the beginning of Act II of the opera \"Wozzeck\" by the composer Alban Berg.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Wozzeck\"\n    composer = \"Alban Berg\"\n    \n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the opera: {opera_name}\")\n    print(f\"The composer is: {composer}\")\n\nfind_opera_name()\n```\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
