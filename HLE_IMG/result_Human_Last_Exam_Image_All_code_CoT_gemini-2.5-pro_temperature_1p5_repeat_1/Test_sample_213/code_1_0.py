    """
    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.

    Analysis of the score:
    1.  Instrumentation: The instruments are listed in German (e.g., 'Hob.' for Oboe, 'Br.' for Viola).
    2.  Markings: Instructions like '(Vorhang)' (Curtain), 'mit DÃ¤mpfer' (with mute), and 'gliss.' (glissando) are present.
    3.  Musical Style: The music is atonal and highly expressive, characteristic of the early 20th century.

    Conclusion: These features precisely match the beginning of Act II of the opera "Wozzeck" by the composer Alban Berg.
