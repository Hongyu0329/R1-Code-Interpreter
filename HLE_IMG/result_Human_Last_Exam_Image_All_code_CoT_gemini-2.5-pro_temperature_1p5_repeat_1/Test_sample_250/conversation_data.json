    "My plan is to identify the jazz standard based on its melody and chord progression as depicted in the sheet music.\n\n1.  **Melodic Analysis:** I will first examine the key signature (four flats, suggesting F minor or A♭ major) and trace the melodic contour. The opening phrase is the most recognizable part of a tune. The melody descends in a characteristic way: starting on C, it moves to A natural, then G, F, and E.\n2.  **Harmonic Analysis:** I will analyze the chord progression. While the chords provided (`F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`, etc.) are an unusual reharmonization, they follow a chromatic descending bass line (F, E, E♭, D♭), which is a common musical device. The bridge section modulates to the relative major (A♭), which is also typical for standards in a minor key.\n3.  **Identification:** By combining the distinct melodic shape with the underlying harmonic structure, I can identify the tune. The descending melodic line `C-A-G-F-E` is the iconic opening of the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n4.  **Composer Identification:** Once the title is identified, I will retrieve the name of the composer from my knowledge base. \"Yesterdays\" was composed by Jerome Kern.\n5.  **Code Generation:** Finally, I will write a Python script to print the title and composer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard\n    from the provided sheet music based on melodic and harmonic analysis.\n\n    The analysis reveals the following:\n    - The key is F minor.\n    - The melody has a characteristic descending line (C, A, G, F, E...).\n    - This melodic theme is the signature of the song \"Yesterdays\".\n    - The composer of \"Yesterdays\" is Jerome Kern.\n    - The chords in the sheet music are a reharmonization of the original.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
