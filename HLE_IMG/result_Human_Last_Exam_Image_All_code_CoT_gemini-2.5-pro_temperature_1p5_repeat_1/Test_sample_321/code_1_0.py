    # slows the spread, leading to a higher final S. This matches the plot.

    # signature of varying the quarantine start day `q_s`.

    # Plot 3: Decreasing S-like curves that are very close together, indicating a
    # parameter with a weak effect on the susceptible population. The mortality rate
    # of the small hospitalized group, `mu_h`, fits this description.

    # that gets severe symptoms strongly impacts transmission, as hospitalized individuals
    # have a much lower contact rate. Higher `f_s` reduces overall spread.
    plot_to_param_map[6] = 'f_s'

    # creates a faster epidemic (earlier recovery) but a potentially lower final
    # number of recovered due to more deaths.
