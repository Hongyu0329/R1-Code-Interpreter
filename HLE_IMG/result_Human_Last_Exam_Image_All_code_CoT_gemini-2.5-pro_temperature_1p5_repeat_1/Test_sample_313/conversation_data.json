    "My plan is to first solve the riddle to determine the identity of \"X Y\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Image and Date:** The image shows a man receiving an award at a ceremony on or around June 20, 2019. Based on the appearance of the individuals and the timing, they are very likely hockey player Robin Lehner (right) receiving the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy from NHL great Pat LaFontaine (left) at the 2019 NHL Awards. Lehner won this award for his perseverance and dedication, specifically for his courageous public battle with bipolar disorder and addiction.\n    *   **Text Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to the historical process of using mercuric nitrate to make felt for hats. This process caused neurological damage in hat makers, a condition known as erethism, which gave rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter\".\n\n2.  **Connect the Clues:** The common theme is \"madness\" or mental state. Robin Lehner is pictured receiving an award for his public struggle with mental illness. The phrase \"Mad Hatter\" directly connects this theme to the mercury poisoning of hat makers. Therefore, \"X Y\" is most likely the phrase \"Mad Hatter\", where the person pictured is a metaphorical \"Mad Hatter\" in the context of his story.\n\n3.  **Address the Coding Requirement:** The prompt requires using Python to solve the task and to \"output each number in the final equation.\" This suggests that the answer isn't just the phrase, but also a numerical value derived from it. I will write a Python script that calculates the numerological value of \"Mad Hatter\" by assigning a number to each letter (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.) and summing them up. The code will print the full addition equation, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** After presenting the code, I will provide the final answer to the question \"What is the X Y?\" in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by calculating the numerical value\n    of the identified phrase \"Mad Hatter\".\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"MAD HATTER\"\n    # Remove space for calculation\n    phrase_for_calc = phrase.replace(\" \", \"\")\n\n    numbers = []\n    for char in phrase_for_calc:\n        # Get the value for each letter (A=1, B=2, ...)\n        # ord(char) - ord('A') gives a 0-based index, so we add 1.\n        value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1\n        numbers.append(value)\n\n    total = sum(numbers)\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, numbers))\n\n    print(\"The hidden phrase is 'Mad Hatter'.\")\n    print(\"Calculating its value by converting letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, etc.):\")\n    print(f\"{phrase}:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.
