    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the highest number of times the pattern can be rotated around a central point within a full 360-degree turn and still look identical to the original.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify a center of rotation:** We can choose a point in the pattern to act as the center of rotation. A good candidate is the center of one of the dark blue hexagons.\n2.  **Count the repeating elements:** Observe the shapes immediately surrounding this central point. Around the central blue hexagon, there are six light yellow squares and six clusters of orange rhombuses. These elements are arranged in a repeating \"spoke-like\" pattern.\n3.  **Determine the order of symmetry:** The number of these identical, repeating \"spokes\" around the center point gives us the order of rotational symmetry. In this case, there are 6 such spokes.\n4.  **Calculate the angle of rotation:** This means if you rotate the pattern by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees, it will look exactly the same.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The tiling has a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A full rotation is 360 degrees.\n    total_degrees = 360\n\n    # By observing the tiling, we can identify a center of rotation.\n    # Let's choose the center of a dark blue hexagon.\n    # We then count the number of times the surrounding pattern repeats itself in a full circle.\n    # Around the central hexagon, there are 6 identical arrangements of squares and rhombuses.\n    order_of_symmetry = 6\n\n    # The angle of rotation is the total degrees divided by the order of symmetry.\n    angle_of_rotation = total_degrees / order_of_symmetry\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\")\n    print(f\"1.
