    "Of course, I can help with this chess puzzle. This is a famous \"mate in 2\" problem composed by Sam Loyd. The solution is subtle and involves a \"quiet move\" that sets up an unstoppable web of threats.\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  I will identify the key first move for White. This move is not a check or a capture but changes the strategic landscape of the board.\n2.  I will then analyze the main replies that Black can make.\n3.  For each of Black's replies, I will show the corresponding checkmating move for White.\n4.  The solution relies on a theme called \"Plachutta interference,\" where two of Black's pieces get in each other's way.\n5.  Finally, I will generate the Python code that prints out this step-by-step solution, including the coordinates of the pieces as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_two():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the step-by-step solution to the \"mate in 2\" chess puzzle.\n    The solution is explained through a series of print statements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"This is a classic checkmate-in-2 puzzle.
