    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that prints the explanation of the difference between the two species.\n\nThe primary distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the morphology of the seta, which is the stalk that supports the spore capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very short and **straight seta**. This results in the capsule being held upright, either immersed within the leaves or just barely emergent.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name implies (*curviseta* = curved seta), has a longer and distinctly **curved or S-shaped (arcuate) seta**. This curvature causes the capsule to nod or hang downwards (a position described as cernuous).\n\nThis difference in the seta's length and curvature is the most reliable and immediate visual cue to tell the two species apart when their sporophytes are present.\n\n```python\ndef explain_moss_difference():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  distinction = (\n      \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule):\\n\\n\"\n      \"1. Grimmia montana: The seta is very short and straight. This makes the capsule sit upright and appear either immersed or only slightly emergent among the leaves.\\n\\n\"\n      \"2. Grimmia curviseta: The seta is longer and conspicuously curved (arcuate). This causes the capsule to be cernuous, meaning it nods or hangs downwards.\"\n  )\n  print(distinction)\n\nexplain_moss_difference()\n```\n<<<The key difference is the seta: it is short and straight in *Grimmia montana*, leading to an upright capsule, while it is longer and strongly curved in *Grimmia curviseta*, causing the capsule to hang downwards.>>>"
