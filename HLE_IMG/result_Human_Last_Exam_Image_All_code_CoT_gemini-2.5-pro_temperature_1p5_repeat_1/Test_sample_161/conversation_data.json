    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. To find the name of the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation occurring in the second step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid (AlCl₃) to form an α-haloketone. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para-position, yielding **2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** This reaction is a condensation to form a substituted imidazole ring. Let's analyze the starting material and the final product to deduce what the missing reactant must provide.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. In a typical Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis, this α-haloketone provides the carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 (C4 and C5) of the imidazole ring and the substituent at C4.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is `tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate`. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   It has an imidazole core.\n        *   The substituent at C4 is the `4-butylphenyl` group, which comes from the α-haloketone.\n        *   The substituent at C2 is an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n        *   The substituent at N1 is an `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino` group (`-NH-Boc`).\n\n3.  **Deduce the missing reactant:** The missing reactant must provide the remaining atoms for the imidazole ring (N1, C2, N3) along with the substituents at N1 and C2. Therefore, the reactant must be a molecule that contains the `-NH(Boc)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` fragment. This specific structure corresponds to a protected version of aminoguanidine. The correct reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism Outline:** In the reaction, one of the nitrogen atoms of `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine` attacks the α-carbon of the ketone (displacing the bromine), and another nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to cyclization and dehydration to form the final substituted imidazole product. The specific regiochemistry of this reaction under these conditions (DMF, rt) leads to the observed product.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Draw\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical reaction.\n    \n    The reaction is a two-step synthesis.\n    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: Butylbenzene + Bromoacetyl bromide -> 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n    2. Imidazole synthesis: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one + Reactant -> tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate\n    \n    By comparing the atoms in the alpha-haloketone and the final imidazole product, we can deduce the structure and name of the missing reactant.\n    The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 backbone and the C4 substituent.\n    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 backbone, the C2-amino group, and the N1-(N-Boc-amino) group.\n    \n    The molecule that fits this requirement is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine\"\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
