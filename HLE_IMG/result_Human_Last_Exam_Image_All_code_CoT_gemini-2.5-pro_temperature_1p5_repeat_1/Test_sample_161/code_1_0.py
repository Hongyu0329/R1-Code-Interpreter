    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical reaction.
    
    The reaction is a two-step synthesis.
    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: Butylbenzene + Bromoacetyl bromide -> 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    2. Imidazole synthesis: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one + Reactant -> tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate
    
    By comparing the atoms in the alpha-haloketone and the final imidazole product, we can deduce the structure and name of the missing reactant.
    The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 backbone and the C4 substituent.
    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 backbone, the C2-amino group, and the N1-(N-Boc-amino) group.
    
    The molecule that fits this requirement is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine.
