    "Based on the visual evidence in the micrograph, I will provide a classification of the observed microorganism. My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will carefully examine the structures visible in the micrograph, paying attention to their shape, size, arrangement, and staining characteristics.\n2.  **Identify key features:** I will identify the distinct morphological forms present, such as individual cells and filamentous structures.\n3.  **Classify the microorganism:** Based on the identified features, I will classify the microorganism type (e.g., bacterium, fungus, parasite) and describe its specific morphology.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that prints the detailed classification as a text output, fulfilling the prompt's requirement for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microscopic_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a classification of the microorganism shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the classification\n    title = \"Microscopic Image Classification\"\n    separator = \"-\" * len(title)\n    \n    organism_type = \"Type of Microorganism: Fungus (Yeast)\"\n    \n    morphology = (\"Morphology: The image displays two distinct fungal forms: \"\n                  \"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
