# This script explains the logic to identify the correct image and prints the result.
# The shader calculates Worley noise, which is the distance from a pixel to the closest feature point.

# 1. The distance metric is Euclidean: `d = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)`. This creates organic-looking cells, ruling out rectangular images A and D.
# 2. The color output is grayscale: `vec3(vec3(r,g,b).x)` becomes `vec3(r,r,r)`. This rules out color-shifted images A, B, and F.
# 3. The feature points defined in the shader match the cell locations in images B and C, but not A, E, or F.
# 4. Based on these three points, the only possible answer is C.
