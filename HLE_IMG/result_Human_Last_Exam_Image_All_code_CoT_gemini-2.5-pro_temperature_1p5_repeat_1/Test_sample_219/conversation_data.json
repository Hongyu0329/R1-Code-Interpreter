    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided graph to locate the synchronized bursts. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of firing activity (black dots) occurring across many electrodes (y-axis) at roughly the same time (x-axis). I will estimate the center timestamp for each major burst.\n2.  **List Timestamps:** I will create a list of these estimated timestamps in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps. These are the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the total number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final result will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the process step-by-step, including the final equation, as requested.\n\nHere are the identified burst timestamps from the graph:\n*   Burst 1: ~3 s\n*   Burst 2: ~17 s\n*   Burst 3: ~36 s\n*   Burst 4: ~49 s\n\nNow, I will proceed with the calculation in the Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The bursts are dense vertical lines of dots, indicating many electrodes firing at once.\nburst_timestamps = [3, 17, 36, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (time between consecutive bursts).\nintervals = []\nprint(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\nfor i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n    intervals.append(interval)\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]}s - {burst_timestamps[i]}s = {interval}s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_interval = np.mean(intervals)\nprint(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n# Building the equation string for clear output\nequation_str = f\"({'+'.join(map(str, intervals))}) / {len(intervals)}\"\nprint(f\"Average = {equation_str} = {average_interval:.4f}s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Round the average to two significant figures.\n# We can use format specifiers for this. '.2g' formats to two significant figures.\navg_rounded = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\n\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {avg_rounded}s\")\n```\n<<<15>>>"
