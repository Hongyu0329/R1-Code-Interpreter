    "Based on my analysis, the object shown in the image is a well-known gilded silver medallion from the Ténès Treasure, discovered in Algeria. Archaeologists and art historians have studied this treasure extensively. Based on stylistic analysis of the objects and associated artifacts, the treasure is dated to the Late Roman Empire, specifically the late 4th century A.D. (the years ranging from 301 A.D. to 400 A.D.).\n\nTherefore, the century that archaeologists ascribe to this medallion is the 4th century A.D.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to formally present this answer. The code will define the century as a number and then print it in a clear, human-readable format. As per the instructions, the number used in the final answer will also be printed explicitly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_medallion_dating():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the century of the Ténès medallion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on archaeological dating, the medallion is from the 4th century A.D.\n    century_number = 4\n\n    # The instruction asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # As there is no complex equation, I will output the key number used for the answer.\n    print(f\"The number representing the century is: {century_number}\")\n\n    # Determine the correct ordinal suffix for the century number.\n    if 11 <= (century_number % 100) <= 13:\n        suffix = 'th'\n    else:\n        last_digit = century_number % 10\n        if last_digit == 1:\n            suffix = 'st'\n        elif last_digit == 2:\n            suffix = 'nd'\n        elif last_digit == 3:\n            suffix = 'rd'\n        else:\n            suffix = 'th'\n    \n    # Define the era.\n    era = \"A.D.\"\n\n    # Construct the final answer string. While the example format is \"9 A.D.\",\n    # \"4th century A.D.\" is the correct and unambiguous way to state a century.\n    final_answer = f\"{century_number}{suffix} century {era}\"\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"Archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_medallion_dating()\n```\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
