    "This is a histopathology image stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungal elements magenta.\n\n*   **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location typically points towards pituitary tumors, but inflammatory or infectious processes can mimic tumors.\n*   **Histopathological Findings:**\n    1.  The image shows a significant inflammatory infiltrate, composed of numerous small, dark blue cells (likely lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils).\n    2.  Prominently visible are bright magenta-staining fungal elements.\n    3.  These fungal elements are hyphae (filamentous structures).\n    4.  Observing the hyphae closely (especially in the main image and cropped hints), they are septate (have cross-walls) and show dichotomous branching, often at acute angles.\n\n*   **Differential Diagnosis of Fungal Infections:**\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** Characterized by septate hyphae with acute-angle (45°) dichotomous branching. This matches the findings well. *Aspergillus* is a known cause of invasive sinusitis that can extend into the sella turcica, presenting as a mass.\n    *   **Mucormycosis:** Typically presents with broad, ribbon-like, pauciseptate (or non-septate) hyphae that branch at right angles (90°). The hyphae in the image are clearly septate and the branching is not consistently at right angles.\n    *   **Candidiasis:** Usually shows budding yeasts and pseudohyphae. The image shows true, well-formed hyphae.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of septate, branching hyphae in a lesion from the sella turcica is characteristic of Aspergillosis. This is likely an invasive fungal sinusitis due to *Aspergillus* that has extended into the pituitary fossa.\n\n<<<Aspergillosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
