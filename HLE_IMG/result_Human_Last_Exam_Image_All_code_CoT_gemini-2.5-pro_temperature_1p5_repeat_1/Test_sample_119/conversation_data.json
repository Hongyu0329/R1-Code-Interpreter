    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is observed at m/z = 135. This gives the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms (e.g., 1, 3, 5...). I will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   The fragmentation pattern shows a significant peak at m/z = 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl cation ([C₆H₅CH₂]⁺), suggesting the presence of a phenyl group attached to a CH₂.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chain).\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis (¹³C, DEPT-135, ¹H, HSQC):**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   From the ¹³C NMR spectrum, there are 7 distinct carbon signals. Four are in the aromatic region (>100 ppm) and three are in the aliphatic region (<100 ppm). The four aromatic signals are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C-ipso, C-ortho, C-meta, C-para), which has 6 carbon atoms. Adding the 3 aliphatic carbons gives a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   With MW = 135, 9 carbons (9 × 12 = 108), and 1 nitrogen (1 × 14 = 14), the mass remaining for hydrogen is 135 - 108 - 14 = 13.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 corresponds to a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds), which confirms our deduction from the other spectra.\n\n*   **Structure Elucidation:**\n    *   **¹³C and DEPT-135:** We have 7 carbon signals: 145.1 (quaternary C, no DEPT signal), 128.5 (CH), 127.3 (CH), 126.3 (CH), 49.6 (CH or CH₃), 43.5 (CH₂ - negative DEPT signal), 19.2 (CH or CH₃). Combining this, we have fragments: one quaternary C, three aromatic CHs, one aliphatic CH₂, and two aliphatic CH/CH₃ groups.\n    *   **¹H NMR and HSQC:**\n        *   A multiplet around 7.2 ppm integrates to 5 protons, confirming a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-). This correlates with the aromatic carbons in the HSQC.\n        *   A doublet at ~1.2 ppm (3H) must be a CH₃ group next to a CH group. HSQC confirms this CH₃ correlates with the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n        *   A complex multiplet around 2.8 ppm. The HSQC shows this proton region correlates to two different carbons: the CH₂ at 43.5 ppm and a CH at 49.6 ppm. This means the protons of the CH₂ group and the single proton of the CH group overlap.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        1.  We have a phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n        2.  We have a three-carbon side chain containing a primary amine (-NH₂).\n        3.  The side chain fragments are -CH₂-, -CH-, and -CH₃.\n        4.  The ¹H NMR shows the -CH₃ group is a doublet, meaning it's adjacent to the -CH- group. This gives us a `-CH(CH₃)` unit.\n        5.  The primary amine (-NH₂) must be attached to the side chain. The ¹³C shift of the CH carbon (49.6 ppm) is consistent with it being attached to the nitrogen. So we have `-CH(NH₂)(CH₃)`.\n        6.  The remaining -CH₂- group and the C₆H₅- group must connect. The only way to complete the structure is: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n\n**4. Final IUPAC Name:**\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a propane chain.\n*   Numbering the chain to give the amine the lowest possible number doesn't work here because we must name it as a substituted alkane. The substituent names are \"phenyl\" and \"amino\". We number the chain to give the substituents the lowest locants.\n*   Numbering from right to left: 3-phenylpropan-2-amine. Locants are 2,3.\n*   Numbering from left to right: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine. Locants are 1,2.\n*   The set (1,2) is lower than (2,3).\n*   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef structure_elucidation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
