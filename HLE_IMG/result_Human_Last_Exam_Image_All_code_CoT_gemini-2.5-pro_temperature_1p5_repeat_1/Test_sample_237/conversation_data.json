    "My plan is to first identify the animal in the image. The image clearly shows an insect. Based on its long antennae and body shape, it is a longhorn beetle (family Cerambycidae). Specifically, its coloration—black with a prominent reddish-orange band across the top of its wing covers (elytra)—is characteristic of the species *Stictoleptura cordigera*.\n\nTherefore, I will write a Python script to print that there is an animal in the image and its scientific name is *Stictoleptura cordigera*.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  animal_common_name = \"longhorn beetle\"\n  animal_scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura cordigera\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a type of {animal_common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The animal's scientific name is: {animal_scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
