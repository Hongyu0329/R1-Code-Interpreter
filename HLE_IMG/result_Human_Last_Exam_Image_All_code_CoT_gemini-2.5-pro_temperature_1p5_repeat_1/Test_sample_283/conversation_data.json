    "Based on my analysis of the Google Trends data, I have identified the country. The peaks in the graph correspond to major national holidays.\n\n*   The **red line** shows consistent peaks around late January/early February, which aligns with the timing of the **Lunar New Year (Spring Festival)**.\n*   The **blue line** shows smaller, consistent peaks around June 1st, which is **Children's Day** in this country.\n*   The **yellow line** shows sharp, high peaks in September, aligning with the **Mid-Autumn Festival**.\n\nThese three major holidays are celebrated in **China**. The pattern and relative interest levels in the graph strongly suggest that the country is China.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the country based on the timing of peaks in the Google Trends graph.\n    The analysis is as follows:\n    1. Red Line Peaks (Jan/Feb): Corresponds to the Lunar New Year (Spring Festival).\n    2. Blue Line Peaks (early June): Corresponds to Children's Day (June 1st).\n    3.
