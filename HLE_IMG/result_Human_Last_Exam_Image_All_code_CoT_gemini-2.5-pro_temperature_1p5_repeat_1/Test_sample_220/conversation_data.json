    "Answering this question requires knowledge of crystallography, specifically how a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice appears when viewed from the [110] crystallographic direction. I will use a Python script to explain the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Describe the FCC Lattice:** Briefly explain the structure of an FCC unit cell.\n2.  **Explain the [110] Projection:** Describe what happens when you project the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction. The key result is that this projection forms a **centered rectangular** lattice.\n3.  **Define the Centered Rectangular Pattern:** Explain what a centered rectangular pattern looks likeâ€”a grid of rectangles with an atom in the middle of each rectangle.\n4.  **Analyze Each Image:** Go through each option (A, B, C, D) and compare its pattern to the expected centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image B** shows a hexagonal pattern (typical of a [111] projection).\n    *   **Image D** shows a centered rectangular pattern.\n5.  **Conclude:** Based on the analysis, identify the correct image.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystallography_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to identify the correct crystal lattice pattern\n    for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Analyzing the Crystal Lattice Projections ###\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understand the expected pattern for an FCC [110] projection.\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure has atoms at each corner and on the center of each face of the cube.\")\n    print(\"When this 3D structure is projected onto a 2D plane as viewed along the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D pattern.\")\n    print(\"For an FCC lattice, the projection along the [110] direction results in a 'centered rectangular' pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Define the 'Centered Rectangular' Pattern.\")\n    print(\"This pattern consists of atoms that form the corners of a rectangle, with an additional atom located precisely in the center of that rectangle.\")\n    print(\"This base pattern then repeats to fill the 2D space.\")\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Examine each of the given images.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n* Image A:\")\n    print(\"  - The atoms form a simple rectangular grid.\")\n    print(\"  - For example, there are atoms at (2,6), (4,6), (2,9), and (4,9) forming a rectangle.\")\n    print(\"  - However, there is no atom in the center of these rectangles.\")\n    print(\"  - This is NOT a centered rectangular pattern.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n* Image B:\")\n    print(\"  - The atoms are arranged in a pattern with hexagonal symmetry.\")\n    print(\"  - This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice along the [111] direction.\")\n    print(\"  - This is NOT the [110] projection.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n* Image C:\")\n    print(\"  - The atomic arrangement is sparse and does not form a clear rectangular or hexagonal pattern.\")\n    print(\"  - This does not match the expected pattern.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n* Image D:\")\n    print(\"  - This pattern matches the centered rectangular structure.\")\n    print(\"  - We can identify a rectangle formed by atoms at approximately (1,6), (5,6), (1,12), and (5,12).\")\n    print(\"  - The center of this rectangle is at x=(1+5)/2=3 and y=(6+12)/2=9.\")\n    print(\"  - There is indeed an atom located near this central position (at x=3, y=8).
