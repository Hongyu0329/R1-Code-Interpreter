    # The combination of chronic ileocecal inflammation (diarrhea, RLQ pain, CT findings)
    # with systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) and, most importantly,
    # extra-intestinal manifestations (uveitis, arthritis) is classic for Crohn's Disease.
    # While Ileocecal TB and Lymphoma are in the differential, the EIMs strongly favor Crohn's.
    # Other infectious causes are less likely due to the chronic nature of the illness.
    # Other options (Volvulus, Ischemia, etc.) do not fit the overall clinical picture.
