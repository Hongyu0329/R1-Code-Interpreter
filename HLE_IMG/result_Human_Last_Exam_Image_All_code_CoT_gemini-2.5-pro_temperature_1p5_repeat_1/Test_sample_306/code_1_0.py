# Step 1: Analyze the problem to understand the relationship between plots, 'n', and eccentricity 'e'.
# The eccentricity is given by e = n / 20, for n = 0, 1, ..., 8.
# The task is to order the plots (1-9) by increasing eccentricity.

# Step 2: Deduce the mapping from 'n' to the plot number based on visual analysis.
# Lower 'n' (and 'e') corresponds to more regular, stable dynamics.
# Higher 'n' (and 'e') corresponds to more chaotic dynamics.
# Based on the visual complexity of the plots, we can establish the following mapping from 'n' to plot number.
# This ordering reflects a progression from the most stable structure (plot 3) to the most chaotic (plot 6).
n_to_plot_map = {
    0: 3,  # Most regular: large, stable sphere (e=0.00)
    1: 9,  # Stable sphere shrinks (e=0.05)
    2: 1,  # Stable region becomes a tube (e=0.10)
    3: 8,  # Tube breaks up, slices are regular (e=0.15)
    4: 7,  # Slices become more complex (e=0.20)
    5: 2,  # Complexity increases further (e=0.25)
    6: 5,  # Stable region is very small (e=0.30)
    7: 4,  # No visible stable regions (e=0.35)
    8: 6   # Almost completely chaotic (e=0.40)
}

# Step 3: Create a data structure sorted by 'n' to ensure ascending order of eccentricity.
# A sorted dictionary or a list of tuples is suitable.
sorted_mapping = sorted(n_to_plot_map.items())

# Step 4: Print the detailed calculation for each plot to show the logic,
# fulfilling the requirement to "output each number in the final equation".

    print(f"Plot {plot_num} corresponds to n={n}, so its eccentricity e = {n}/20 = {eccentricity:.2f}")
    ordered_plot_numbers.append(plot_num)

# Step 5: Print the final list of plot numbers in ascending order of eccentricity,
# formatted with curly braces as requested.
