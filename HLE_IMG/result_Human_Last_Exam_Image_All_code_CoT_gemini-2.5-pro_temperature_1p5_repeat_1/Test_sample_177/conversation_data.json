    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for cars in both the \"Baseline\" and \"Proposed\" scenarios and then find the percentage reduction.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand VMT Calculation**: VMT is the total miles traveled by vehicles. To calculate it, we need to determine the number of car trips for each distance category and multiply that by the average distance for that category. The total VMT is the sum of VMT from all distance categories.\n\n2.  **Define a Relative Total**: Since the absolute total number of trips is not given, we can assume a base number (e.g., 100 total trips) to calculate a representative VMT. The final percentage reduction will be the same regardless of the base number chosen because it will cancel out. The formula for the weighted average VMT per trip across all modes is:\n    `VMT_avg = Î£ (share_of_trips_i * mode_share_car_i * avg_distance_i)` for each distance category `i`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Baseline Car VMT**:\n    *   For each distance category (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles), we'll find the total share of trips made by cars (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants').\n    *   Multiply this car trip share by the overall share of trips for that distance category and the average trip distance.\n    *   Sum these values across all four distance categories to get the total Baseline VMT.\n\n4.  **Calculate Proposed Car VMT**:\n    *   Repeat the same calculation as in Step 3, but this time using the mode share percentages from the \"Proposed\" table (Table 2).\n\n5.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**:\n    *   Use the standard formula for percentage reduction:\n        `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\nThe Python code below will implement these steps.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Table 1: Baseline mode shares for cars\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Table 2: Proposed mode shares for cars\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    def calculate_total_vmt(car_1_occ_shares, car_multi_occ_shares):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to calculate total VMT for a given scenario.\"\"\"\n        total_vmt = 0\n        for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n            # Total share of trips made by car in this distance category\n            total_car_share = car_1_occ_shares[i] + car_multi_occ_shares[i]\n            # VMT for this category is (share of all trips * total car share * avg distance)\n            vmt_for_category = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n            total_vmt += vmt_for_category\n        return total_vmt\n\n    # 1.
