    "Based on my analysis of the image, the lesion shown is located on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth, within the pits and fissures. There is an existing amalgam (silver) filling, and new decay (recurrent caries) is visible around its margins.\n\nAccording to the widely used G.V. Black classification system, which categorizes caries based on their location on the tooth surface, this type of lesion falls under **Class I**.\n\nHere is a Python script that states this classification.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the location of the dental lesion to provide its classification.\n\n    The image shows a lesion on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a molar.\n    This location corresponds to a specific class in G.V. Black's system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # G.V. Black's Classification System is based on the location of the caries.\n    # Class I: Caries affecting pits and fissures on occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces of posterior teeth,\n    #          and lingual of anterior teeth.\n    # The lesion in the image is in the pits and fissures of an occlusal surface.\n    \n    classification_system = \"G.V.
