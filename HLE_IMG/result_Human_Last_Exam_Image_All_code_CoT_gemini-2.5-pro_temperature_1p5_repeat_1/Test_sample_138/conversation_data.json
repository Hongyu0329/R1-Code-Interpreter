    "To determine the biological sexes of the insect pairs, we can observe key sexually dimorphic traits common in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Examine Pair A (Bees):** Look for differences in abdomen shape and antennae. Male bees generally have more abdominal segments (7 visible) and longer antennae (13 segments) than females (6 visible segments, 12 antennal segments). Female cuckoo bees (like *Coelioxys*, which these appear to be) often have a distinctively pointed, conical abdomen for laying eggs in other bees' nests.\n    *   **Insect A (Left):** Has long antennae and a less pointed abdomen. This is characteristic of a male.\n    *   **Insect A (Right):** Has a very sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is a female *Coelioxys*.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Examine Pair B (Wasps):** Look for differences in antennae and abdomen. In many wasps, males have longer, often curled antennae and one more abdominal segment than females. Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor).\n    *   **Insect B (Left):** Has shorter, straight antennae and a pointed abdomen capable of stinging. This is a female paper wasp (*Polistes*).\n    *   **Insect B (Right):** Has noticeably longer antennae that are curled at the tip, a classic male trait in this genus.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n3.  **Examine Pair C (Bees):** The most obvious difference is in the antennae length.\n    *   **Insect C (Left):** Has extremely long antennae, a defining feature of male long-horned bees (e.g., *Melissodes*).\n    *   **Insect C (Right):** Has much shorter antennae compared to the male. This is the female.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of indices for pairs A, B, and C is 3, 4, 3.\n\n```python\n# Based on the visual analysis of sexual dimorphism in the insects:\n# Pair A: The left bee is male (long antennae) and the right bee is a female cuckoo bee (pointed abdomen). This is M, F, which is option 3.\n# Pair B: The left wasp is female (shorter antennae, stinger) and the right wasp is male (long, curled antennae). This is F, M, which is option 4.\n# Pair C: The left bee is male (very long antennae) and the right bee is female (shorter antennae). This is M, F, which is option 3.\n\nindex_A = 3\nindex_B = 4\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Phrase the answer as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by \",\".\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```"
