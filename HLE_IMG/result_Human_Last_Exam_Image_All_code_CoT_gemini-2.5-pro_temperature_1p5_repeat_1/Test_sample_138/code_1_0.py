# Pair A: The left bee is male (long antennae) and the right bee is a female cuckoo bee (pointed abdomen). This is M, F, which is option 3.
# Pair B: The left wasp is female (shorter antennae, stinger) and the right wasp is male (long, curled antennae). This is F, M, which is option 4.
# Pair C: The left bee is male (very long antennae) and the right bee is female (shorter antennae). This is M, F, which is option 3.
