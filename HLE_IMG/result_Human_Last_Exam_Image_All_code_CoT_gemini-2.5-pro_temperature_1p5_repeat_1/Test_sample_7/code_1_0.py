# The formula for the second plateau
# V = -(mu_anode - mu_ref) / e
# For the second plateau (forming stage 2), mu_anode = mu_2. The reference is mu_Li.
# So, the formula is V_2 = -(mu_2 - mu_Li) / e
# The question asks for the formula that approximates the plateau.
formula_rhs = -(mu_2 - mu_Li) / e

# The problem states to "output each number in the final equation".
# The number '2' in the subscript of mu_2 is the key numerical identifier in this context.
# We will format the output to clearly show this.
# Let's create a formatted string for the formula.

# Using string formatting to represent the formula
# The "number" in the equation is the subscript 2.
