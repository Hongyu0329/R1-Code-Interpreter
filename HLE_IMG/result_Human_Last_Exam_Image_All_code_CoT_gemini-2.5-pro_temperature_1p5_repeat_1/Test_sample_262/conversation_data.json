    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures:** All four compounds are iridium(III) complexes. They share the same central Ir(III) ion and the same bidentate N^N ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The only difference is in the cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands.\n2.  **Identify the key structural difference:** The difference lies in the fluorine atom substituents on the phenyl ring of the ppy ligands.\n    *   Complex 1: Two fluorine atoms at the 2' and 4' positions (ortho and para to the pyridine ring). Let's use standard notation where C2' is bonded to Ir, so the F atoms are at C3' and C5' (or C4' and C6'), depending on the exact isomer depicted. A more standard and common stable isomer is fluorination at the 4' and 5' positions relative to the C1' attached to pyridine. Visually, the fluorines are at the meta and para positions relative to the C-Ir bond. Let's call this meta/para-difluorination.\n    *   Complex 2: One fluorine atom at the para position relative to the C-Ir bond.\n    *   Complex 3: One fluorine atom at the ortho position relative to the C-Ir bond.\n    *   Complex 4: No fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Relate structure to stability:** The operational lifetime of these emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) is directly related to their chemical and electrochemical stability. A critical factor is the strength of the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Fluorination effect:** Fluorine is highly electronegative and its electron-withdrawing nature strengthens the Ir-C bond, which is often the weakest point for degradation. This generally increases the complex's stability and lifetime. Therefore, fluorinated complexes (1 and 2) are expected to be more stable than the non-fluorinated one (4).\n    *   **Positional effect:** The position of the fluorine atom is crucial. While meta and para fluorination (as in Complexes 1 and 2) are stabilizing, ortho-fluorination (as in Complex 3) is known to be detrimental. The ortho C-F bond is prone to activation and subsequent scission, opening a rapid degradation pathway for the complex. This makes ortho-fluorinated complexes exceptionally unstable.\n4.  **Rank the complexes by expected lifetime:**\n    *   Longest lifetime: Complex 1 (double fluorination at stabilizing positions) and Complex 2 (single fluorination at a stabilizing position).\n    *   Shorter lifetime: Complex 4 (lacks the stabilizing effect of fluorine) and Complex 3 (has a particularly destabilizing ortho-fluorine). Complex 3 is expected to be the least stable.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both Complex 3 and Complex 4 are expected to have significantly shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 2.\n6.  **Code implementation:** Write a Python script to formalize this reasoning, identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes, and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes to determine which ones have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary representing the key structural feature of each complex's C^N ligand\n    # that influences stability.\n    complexes_features = {\n        1: \"meta/para-difluorination\",\n        2: \"para-fluorination\",\n        3: \"ortho-fluorination\",\n        4: \"no fluorination\"\n    }\n\n    # Scientific knowledge on how these features affect stability and lifetime.\n    # A lower stability score means a shorter lifetime.\n    stability_map = {\n        \"meta/para-difluorination\": {\"stability\": \"High\", \"score\": 4},\n        \"para-fluorination\": {\"stability\": \"Good\", \"score\": 3},\n        \"no fluorination\": {\"stability\": \"Moderate\", \"score\": 2},\n        \"ortho-fluorination\": {\"stability\": \"Low\", \"score\": 1}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the stability of the Iridium(III) complexes:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n    print(\"The lifetime of an emitter in a Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC) is closely linked to its chemical stability.
