    # Step 1 & 2: Determine Axis Mapping and k

    # From x3' = -5*x3 - c*x1*x2 + Re, the average of x3 is <x3> ≈ Re/5 = 10k.
    # The plots (e.g., Sim 1, plot f) show the horizontal axis ranging from ~15 to ~18.
    # This axis must be x3. So, the plot with x3 on its horizontal axis is 'f'.
    x3_axis_plot = 'f'
    
    # Analyze damping terms: -2*x1, -9*x2, -5*x4.
    # x2 has the strongest damping (-9), so it should have the smallest amplitude.
    # In Sim 1, horizontal axis widths are: h (~3.0), g (~3.4), i (~3.4).
    # Plot 'h' has the narrowest range, so its horizontal axis is x2.
    x2_axis_plot = 'h'

    # To distinguish x1 and x4 (for plots g and i), we examine Sim 2, where parameter 'b' changes.
    # The change in b primarily affects x2', which then affects x1' and x3'. x4' is less directly affected.
    # x1's damping (-2) is weaker than x4's (-5), so x1 should exhibit larger amplitude oscillations.
    # In Sim 2, the horizontal range of plot 'i' (~12) is larger than that of plot 'g' (~8).
    # Therefore, the horizontal axis of 'i' is x1, and 'g' is x4.
    x1_axis_plot = 'i'
    x4_axis_plot = 'g'

    # Assembling the axis mapping part of the string:
    # x1 -> i, x2 -> h, x3 -> f, x4 -> g
    axis_map_str = f"{x1_axis_plot}{x2_axis_plot}{x3_axis_plot}{x4_axis_plot}" # "ihfg"

    # Step 3: Determine k
    # In Sim 1, <x3> ≈ 16.5.
    # Case k=1 (Re=50): 16.5 = 10 - (c/5)<x1*x2>. Needs <x1*x2> ≈ -3.25 (assuming c=10). This is plausible.
    # Case k=2 (Re=100): 16.5 = 20 - (c/5)<x1*x2>. Needs <x1*x2> ≈ -17.5 (assuming c=-1). This seems very large.
    # However, let's check Sim 4 where c is decreased by 10.
    # In Sim 4, <x3> ≈ 16.7 and amplitudes are smaller.
    # k=1 case: 16.7 = 10 - (1/5)<x1*x2> -> <x1*x2> ≈ -33.5. This is a contradiction, as the product's magnitude cannot increase as amplitudes shrink.
    # k=2 case: 16.7 = 20 - (-0.1/5)<x1*x2> -> <x1*x2> ≈ -165. The magnitude is even larger, but it doesn't create the same type of contradiction.
    # The contradiction in the k=1 case makes k=2 the only viable option.
    k = 2

    # Step 4: Identify Parameter Changes
    # Sim 1 is the baseline.
    param_1 = '0'

    # In Sim 2, the range of x2 (plot h) expands massively. x2' is driven by b*x1*x3. This indicates 'b' was increased tenfold.
    param_2 = 'B'

    # In Sim 3, x5 (vertical axis of plots f, g) flips sign and its amplitude increases significantly. x5' is driven by -e*x1*x4.
    # This implies a tenfold increase in the magnitude of a negative 'e' (e.g., -1 -> -10).
    param_3 = 'E'

    # In Sim 4, the oscillations of x3 (horizontal 'f', vertical 'h', 'i') are strongly damped.
    # This implies the forcing term -c*x1*x2 in x3' was reduced. This corresponds to decreasing 'c' tenfold.
    param_4 = 'c'
