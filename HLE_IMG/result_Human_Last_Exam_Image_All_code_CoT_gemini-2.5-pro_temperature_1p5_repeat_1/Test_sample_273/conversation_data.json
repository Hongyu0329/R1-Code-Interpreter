    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. This involves a three-step process for each chiral center:\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers and IUPAC Name:** First, we must correctly identify all stereocenters and establish a systematic IUPAC name for the molecule to assign locants (numbers) to these centers.\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, rank the four attached groups based on atomic number. Higher atomic numbers get higher priority.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:** Orient the molecule so that the lowest-priority group (4) points away from the viewer. Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. If the path is clockwise, the configuration is R. If it is counter-clockwise, the configuration is S. If the lowest-priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structure** to find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the alcohol, -OH). This will allow us to derive the IUPAC name.\n2.  **Identify all chiral centers** based on the derived name. The provided molecule has three chiral centers.\n3.  For each chiral center:\n    a. Assign priorities to the four substituents according to CIP rules.\n    b. Determine the orientation of the lowest priority group from the 2D representation.\n    c. Trace the priorities 1-2-3 to find the configuration (R or S).\n4.  **Combine the configurations** to give the full stereochemical name.\n5.  **Write a Python script** that prints this step-by-step analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the step-by-step process for determining the absolute\n    configuration of the molecule shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration:\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify IUPAC Name and Chiral Centers\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH), making the molecule an alcohol.\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH bond is a 5-carbon pentane chain.\")\n    print(\"Numbering from the end that gives the -OH group the lowest number (C2), the parent chain is pentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"A substituent, -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (2-amino-1-methylethyl), is attached at C3.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the IUPAC name is: 3-(2-amino-1-methylethyl)pentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The three chiral centers are C2, C3, and the C1 of the substituent (notated as C1').\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine Configuration for Each Chiral Center\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # --- Analysis of C2 ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Configuration at C2 ---\")\n    print(\"Groups: -OH, -C3, -CH3 (C1), -H.\")\n    print(\"Priorities: 1: -OH, 2: -C3, 3: -CH3, 4: -H.\")\n    print(\"Analysis: The drawing shows the -OH and -CH3 groups as dashed (back), so the lowest priority group -H (4) is wedged (front).\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: The path from priority 1 (-OH) -> 2 (-C3) -> 3 (-CH3) is clockwise.
