    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the city with the similar coat of arms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the key elements of the coat of arms in the image.**\nThe most important part of any coat of arms is the shield (the escutcheon). We will break down its components:\n*   **Shield Division:** The shield is divided horizontally into two sections. This division is known in heraldry as \"per fess\".\n*   **Upper Section:** The top half of the shield has a dark blue background (*azure*). On this background, there is a golden crescent moon (*or*).\n*   **Lower Section:** The bottom half of the shield has a golden background (*or*). On this background, there is a prominent black crab (*sable*).\n*   **External Ornaments:**\n    *   **Crown:** Above the shield, there is an ornate silver and gold crown. This is likely an artistic representation and may not match the official crown style exactly.\n    *   **Wreath/Supporters:** The shield is flanked by two branches. On the left is an olive branch (with green leaves and black olives), and on the right is an oak branch (with some leaves and acorns). These branches are often decorative and may not be part of the official, registered coat of arms.\n\n**Step 2: Prioritize the elements for searching.**\nThe design on the shield itself is the most unique and stable identifier. The combination of a horizontal division, a blue field with a crescent, and a gold field with a crab is very specific. The crown and branches are secondary details that might vary.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a search based on the primary elements.**\nA good search query would be: \"coat of arms blue and gold shield crescent moon and crab\".\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the search results.**\nThis search leads directly to the coat of arms of **Hrvatska Kostajnica**, a town in Croatia.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the provided image with the official coat of arms of Hrvatska Kostajnica.**\n*   **Shield:** The official coat of arms of Hrvatska Kostajnica is parted per fess: the top half is azure with a crescent or, and the bottom half is or with a crab sable. This is a perfect match with the shield in the provided image.\n*   **Crown:** The official modern version of the city's arms is sometimes topped with a silver mural crown (a crown shaped like city walls), which signifies its status as a town. The crown in the image is more regal and artistic, but its presence above the shield is consistent.\n*   **Wreath:** The olive and oak branches are not typically part of the official coat of arms but are common decorative elements in heraldic art. Their inclusion in the image is an artistic choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fundamental design of the shield in the image—a blue upper half with a gold crescent and a gold lower half with a black crab—is identical to the coat of arms of the Croatian town of Hrvatska Kostajnica. The image is an artistically embellished version of that specific coat of arms.\n\n<<<Hrvatska Kostajnica>>>"
