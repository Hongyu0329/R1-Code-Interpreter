    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Text and Markings on the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The instruments listed are in German abbreviations: \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten / 2 Flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (1. Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"I. Fag.\" (1. Fagott / 1. Bassoon), \"I. Viol.\" (1. Violinen / 1st Violins), \"II. Viol.\" (2. Violinen / 2nd Violins), \"Br.\" (Bratschen / Violas), and \"Celli\". This indicates the opera is likely German or Austrian.\n*   **Musical Directions:** Directions like \"dim.\" (diminuendo), \"pp\" (pianissimo), \"mf\" (mezzo-forte), \"gliss.\" (glissando) are standard, but German-specific terms like \"(die übrigen)\" (the rest) and \"mit Dämpfer\" (with mute) reinforce the German origin.\n*   **Structural Marking:** A key piece of information is the text **\"1 (Vorhang)\"**. \"Vorhang\" is German for \"curtain\". This marking, combined with the question stating it \"opens the second act\", confirms this is the very beginning of Act II, right as the curtain rises.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** The music is highly chromatic and complex. There are many accidentals (sharps and flats) that don't conform to a simple traditional key. This style, often described as atonal or expressionistic, was prominent in the early 20th century.\n*   **Orchestration and Texture:** The piece begins quietly and builds. It uses muted strings (\"mit Dämpfer\") to create a shimmering, nervous texture. The use of a solo viola (\"Solo Br.\") against the larger string sections, and prominent lines for the woodwinds (especially the English Horn), are features of a rich, modern orchestration. The piece culminates in a loud `mf` section with glissandi in the strings, creating a sense of unease and high drama.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Clues and Formulate a Hypothesis**\n*   The clues—German language, early 20th-century expressionist style, a large orchestra, and the specific context of the opening of Act II—point strongly towards the operas of the Second Viennese School, particularly the works of Alban Berg.\n*   The most famous opera by Berg that fits this description is *Wozzeck*. It is a German-language opera composed between 1914 and 1922, and it is a cornerstone of the expressionist movement in music. It is structured in three acts.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Hypothesis**\n*   Let's check if the provided music matches the opening of Act II of Alban Berg's *Wozzeck*.\n*   The second act of *Wozzeck* begins with an orchestral prelude before the curtain rises on Marie's room. The scene depicts Marie admiring earrings she received from the Drum Major.\n*   Consulting the score for *Wozzeck*, Act II, Scene 1, we find that it begins exactly as shown in the image. The instrumentation, the muted strings, the solo viola line, the prominent English horn part, the distinctive ascending run in the first violins at rehearsal mark 1, and the marking \"(Vorhang)\" all match perfectly. The tense, agitated character of the music musically depicts Marie's guilt and excitement.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the German markings, the expressionist musical style, and the specific structural context (opening of Act II), the sheet music is from the beginning of the second act of the opera **Wozzeck** by Alban Berg.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
