    "An analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    - **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the array segment is considered sorted, and the function returns. This takes constant time.\n    - **Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the input, `a[n-1]`, with the last element of the sorted subarray, `a[n-2]`. Since `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest among them.\n        3.  If the condition is true, it means `a[n-1]` needs to be moved into the sorted subarray. It performs a `swap` and then, crucially, makes a *second* recursive call.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This second call is meant to re-sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]`, which has been disturbed by the swap.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Time Complexity Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for a call to `sort(a, n)`. The time taken depends on the outcome of the `if` statement.\n    - The `sort(a, n-1)` call takes `T(n-1)`.\n    - The `if` and `swap` operations take constant time, which we can denote as `c` or `O(1)`.\n    - The second `sort(a, n-1)` call, if executed, also takes `T(n-1)`.\n\n    There are two main cases for the recurrence:\n    - **Best Case:** The `if` condition is false. The second recursive call is skipped. The recurrence is `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`. This happens, for example, with an already sorted array. Expanding this recurrence gives `T(n) = O(n)`.\n    - **Worst Case:** The `if` condition is true. The second recursive call is executed. The recurrence becomes `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`, which simplifies to `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true as often as possible.\n    - Let's consider an input array sorted in reverse order, for example, `a = [k, k-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    - Let's trace `sort(a, n)` on this input.\n        - The first call, `sort(a, n-1)`, will be performed on the prefix `[k, k-1, ..., 2]`. Assuming inductively that this call works, it will sort this prefix, resulting in the array state `[2, 3, ..., k, 1]`.\n        - Now, the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` becomes `1 < k`, which is true for `k>1`.\n        - Thus, the expensive path with the `swap` and the second `sort(a, n-1)` call is taken.\n    - This demonstrates that a reverse-sorted array triggers the worst-case behavior at each level of the recursion. Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is indeed `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to find the closed-form solution for `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`.\n    Let's expand it:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    This pattern reveals that:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3) + ... + 2^0)`\n    The sum is a geometric series which equals `2^(n-1) - 1`. `T(1)` is a constant.\n    So, `T(n) = const1 * 2^(n-1) + const2 * (2^(n-1) - 1)`.\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n    Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The algorithm terminates because `n` is decremented in each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`. However, due to the two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1`, the number of operations grows exponentially with `n` in the worst case. This leads to a time complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\nFinal Answer selection:\n- A. O(n): Incorrect (This is the best-case complexity).\n- B. O(n log n): Incorrect.\n- C. O(n^2): Incorrect.\n- D. O(n^3): Incorrect.\n- E. O(2^n): Correct.\n- F. does not terminate: Incorrect.\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
