    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereocenters (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A chiral carbon is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label them for clarity, moving from left to right along the carbon backbone as drawn:\n*   **C2:** The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) and a methyl (-CH3) group.\n*   **C3:** The carbon atom bonded to the ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   **C4:** The carbon atom bonded to a methyl (-CH3) and an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group.\n\nWe will determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of these centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Configuration of the Middle Chiral Center (C3)**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The four groups attached to C3 are:\n    *   The group to the left, containing C2: -CH(OH)CH3\n    *   The group to the right, containing C4: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    *   An ethyl group: -CH2CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H), which is not explicitly drawn but is implied to complete the tetrahedral geometry.\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules):**\n    1.  **Priority 1:** The -CH(OH)CH3 group. The carbon C2 is attached to an Oxygen atom (O, atomic number 8), a carbon, and a hydrogen.\n    2.  **Priority 2:** The -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 group. The carbon C4 is attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen. Comparing Priority 1 and 2, O > C, so the group containing C2 has higher priority.\n    3.  **Priority 3:** The ethyl group (-CH2CH3). Its carbon is attached to one carbon and two hydrogens. Comparing Priority 2 and 3, C4 (-CH(C,C,H)) has higher priority than the ethyl carbon (-CH2(C,H,H)).\n    4.  **Priority 4:** The hydrogen atom (-H).\n\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The drawing shows the ethyl group (Priority 3) on a wedge (coming out of the page).\n    *   The hydrogen atom (Priority 4), being the least bulky group and not explicitly shown with stereochemistry, is assumed to be on a dash (going into the page).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (4) pointing away, we look at the arrangement of the top three priorities: 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Group 1 is to the left, Group 2 is to the right, and Group 3 is up and forward. The path from 1 to 2 to 3 is **clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Configuration of the Rightmost Chiral Center (C4)**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The four groups attached to C4 are:\n    *   An aminomethyl group: -CH2NH2\n    *   The rest of the molecule, connected via C3.\n    *   A methyl group: -CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H).\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules):**\n    1.  **Priority 1:** -CH2NH2. The carbon is bonded to a Nitrogen atom (N, atomic number 7).\n    2.  **Priority 2:** The group connected via C3. The carbon C3 is bonded to two carbons and a hydrogen. N > C, so -CH2NH2 is priority 1.\n    3.  **Priority 3:** -CH3 group. Its carbon is bonded to three hydrogens. C(at C3) is bonded to other carbons, so it outranks the methyl group.\n    4.  **Priority 4:** -H.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The drawing shows -CH2NH2 (Priority 1) on a wedge (forward) and -CH3 (Priority 3) on a dash (backward). The hydrogen (Priority 4) must lie in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   To determine the configuration when the lowest priority group is in the plane, we can use the \"swapping\" method. We swap the positions of the H (Priority 4) and the group in the back, -CH3 (Priority 3).\n    *   After the swap, H is on a dash (back), -CH3 is in the plane, and -CH2NH2 is on a wedge (front).\n    *   Now, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path goes from front (-CH2NH2) to left (-C3 group) to the plane (-CH3). This describes a **counter-clockwise** circle. So, the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Configuration of the Leftmost Chiral Center (C2)**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The four groups attached to C2 are:\n    *   A hydroxyl group: -OH\n    *   The rest of the molecule, connected via C3.\n    *   A methyl group: -CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H).\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules):**\n    1.  **Priority 1:** -OH (Oxygen's atomic number is 8).\n    2.  **Priority 2:** The group connected via C3. Its carbon is attached to other carbons.\n    3.  **Priority 3:** -CH3 group.\n    4.  **Priority 4:** -H.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The drawing shows both the -OH group (Priority 1) and the -CH3 group (Priority 3) on dashes (going into the page). This is an unconventional representation. For a tetrahedral carbon, if two groups are pointing backward, the other two must be pointing forward.\n    *   Assuming the main carbon backbone (C2-C3 bond) lies in the plane of the drawing, the fourth substituent, the H atom (Priority 4), must be on a **wedge** (coming out of the page) to satisfy the tetrahedral geometry.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (4) pointing towards the viewer, the R/S assignment rule is reversed. We trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from 1 (-OH, back-left) to 2 (-C3 group, plane-right) to 3 (-CH3, back-right) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. Clockwise would normally be R, so here it is S.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **S**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the configurations for all three chiral centers, from left to right as depicted in the drawing (C2, C3, C4), the absolute configuration of the molecule is: **(S, R, R)**.\n\nIf we number the atoms according to one possible IUPAC naming convention (e.g., 3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine), the chiral centers would be C2, C3, and C4, and their configurations would be C2(R), C3(R), C4(S). However, without an official name, describing the configuration by position is the clearest approach. Based on the left-to-right representation:\n\n*   The carbon with the -OH group is **S**.\n*   The carbon with the ethyl group is **R**.\n*   The carbon with the -CH2NH2 group is **R**.\n\nThe absolute configuration is (S, R, R).\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
