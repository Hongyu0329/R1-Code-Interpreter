    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the product:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's determine its structure and molecular formula. The structure shown is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, also known as a bridged lactam.\n    *   The core is a `2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`.\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected by a PMB group (para-methoxybenzyl group, -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃).\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃) is attached to the double bond.\n*   **Calculating the molecular formula of the starting material:**\n    *   Core structure (`2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one` part with the CF₃): This consists of 6 carbons in the bicyclic skeleton (C₁, C₃, C₄, C₅, C₆, C₇), 1 carbon in the CF₃ group, 1 nitrogen (N₂), and 1 oxygen (in C=O). The hydrogens are 1 on C₁, 1 on C₄, 1 on C₆, and 2 on C₇, plus 1 on the nitrogen (if unprotected). The core formula with CF₃ and without the PMB group is C₇H₅F₃NO.\n    *   PMB group (-C₈H₉O): Contains 1 C and 2 H in the -CH₂- part, 6 C and 4 H in the benzene ring, and 1 C, 3 H, 1 O in the methoxy group (-OCH₃). Total: C₈H₉O.\n    *   When the PMB group is attached to the nitrogen, the hydrogen on the nitrogen is replaced.\n    *   Total formula of the starting material = (C₇H₅F₃NO - H at N) + C₈H₉O = C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagent is CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O. CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from amines and alcohols.\n    *   The reaction removes the PMB group from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Change in formula: Remove PMB (-C₈H₉O) and add H. The net change is -C₈H₈O.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 1 (C₇H₆F₃NO).\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It selectively reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   This reaction adds two hydrogen atoms (H₂) to the molecule.\n    *   Lactam carbonyl groups (C=O) and trifluoromethyl groups (-CF₃) are generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in formula:** + H₂.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2 (C₇H₈F₃NO).\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl at 70 °C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or lactam.\n    *   The lactam ring is opened by the addition of one molecule of water (H₂O). The C-N bond of the amide group is cleaved.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH₂), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH₃⁺) in the acidic medium. However, for calculating the molecular formula, we consider the neutral form.\n*   **Change in formula:** + H₂O.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:** C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O = C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n**Summary of Formula Changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n*   Step 1 (deprotection): -> Intermediate 1 (C₇H₆F₃NO)\n*   Step 2 (hydrogenation): -> Intermediate 2 (C₇H₈F₃NO)\n*   Step 3 (hydrolysis): -> Final Product (C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂)\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
