The XRD peaks for the CuO nanoparticles are indexed based on the standard pattern for monoclinic CuO (Tenorite, JCPDS card No. 45-0937). The table below lists the approximate 2θ positions of the most prominent peaks from the graph and their corresponding Miller indices (h k l).

| Peak Position 2θ (degree) | Miller Indices (h k l) |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|           ~32.5           |         (110)          |
|           ~35.5           |         (-111)         |
|           ~38.7           |         (111)          |
|           ~48.8           |         (-202)         |
|           ~53.5           |         (020)          |
