    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The primary method for sexing insects in the order Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants) often involves examining the antennae, the tip of the abdomen, and sometimes facial markings or leg structures.\n\n**Careful Points & General Rules for Hymenoptera Sexing:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males typically have longer antennae with more segments (usually 13) than females (usually 12). The tips of male antennae are sometimes curled or hooked.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females possess an ovipositor, which is modified into a stinger in bees and wasps. This often gives the abdomen a more pointed appearance at the tip. Males lack a stinger, and their abdomen may appear more rounded or blunt at the tip. Males also have one more visible abdominal segment on top (7 tergites) than females (6 tergites).\n*   **Facial Markings (Clypeus):** In many bee species, males have a yellow or white patch on their face (the clypeus), while females have a dark face.\n*   **Pollen-carrying structures (Scopae):** The problem states the insects are from taxa without scopae on their legs. This directs our attention to wasps (which don't have scopae), kleptoparasitic bees (like cuckoo bees, which don't collect pollen and thus females lack scopae), or bees that carry pollen on their abdomen (Megachilidae). Male bees of all species lack scopae as they do not provision nests.\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Pair A: Sharp-tailed Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\nThese are kleptoparasitic bees, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not collect pollen, females lack scopae.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** Observe the tip of the abdomen. It is not a single point but has multiple small spines or prongs. This multi-spined abdominal tip is a key characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen tapers to a very sharp, single, conical point. This is the \"sharp-tail\" for which the genus is named, an adaptation the **female** uses to pierce the host bee's nest cell to lay her egg.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\nThese are social wasps. Both sexes feed on nectar, but females (workers and queens) also hunt for prey to feed the colony's larvae.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The antennae are relatively short and straight. The abdomen ends in a point, consistent with a female's stinger. This is a **female**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** Look closely at the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic and reliable feature of a **male** *Polistes* wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (Tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\nThis pair displays very strong sexual dimorphism, particularly in the antennae. While female long-horned bees typically do have large scopae on their legs, males do not. The prompt likely refers to the fact that the male individual fits the \"no scopa\" description.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has extraordinarily long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of a **male** long-horned bee. Additionally, its face (clypeus) is pale yellow, another common male bee trait.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** In stark contrast to the left insect, this bee's antennae are much shorter, which is typical for a **female** of this group. The face is also dark, lacking the pale patch seen on the male.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> **3**\n*   Pair B: Female, Male -> **4**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> **3**\n\nCombining these gives the final sequence.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
