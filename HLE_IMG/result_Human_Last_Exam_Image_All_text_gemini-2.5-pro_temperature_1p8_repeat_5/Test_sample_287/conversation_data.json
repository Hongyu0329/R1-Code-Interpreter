    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial image:** The image displays a modern urban skyline with several skyscrapers. The lighting suggests it was taken during sunrise or sunset, creating a warm orange glow in the clouds. The architecture is contemporary, featuring glass curtain walls and distinct structural patterns.\n\n2.  **Examine the building on the right:** Looking at the right portion of the image (and hint crops 8, 9, 10), we can identify two prominent buildings. One is a tall glass office tower with its interior lights on. Next to it, on the far right, is another tower with a bronze or golden-tinted facade, reflecting the evening light. This combination is characteristic of the IFC Seoul complex in Yeouido, Seoul. The taller glass tower is **Two IFC**, and the shorter, golden-hued one is **One IFC**.\n\n3.  **Examine the buildings in the center:** To the left of Two IFC, there is a building with a distinctly curved facade (seen in hint crop 7). This is the **Conrad Seoul hotel**, which is also part of the IFC Seoul complex and is known for its curved shape. To the left of the Conrad hotel, another tall skyscraper with a dark, grid-like pattern of windows is visible (hint crops 3 and 4). This building is **Three IFC**.\n\n4.  **Examine the building on the left:** On the far left of the main image (and hint crops 1 and 2), there is a building with a different architectural style, featuring light-colored horizontal bands or panels. This building is the **Korea Federation of Banks (KFB) building**, located adjacent to the IFC complex in Yeouido.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the findings:** The identification of multiple unique and co-located buildings—One IFC, Two IFC, Three IFC, the Conrad Seoul hotel, and the KFB building—confirms the location as the Yeouido financial district.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Yeouido is a major district within Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. Therefore, the city in the image is Seoul. The information that the photo was taken in 2024 is consistent, as these buildings are all prominent fixtures of the city's current skyline.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
