The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because its starting material, N-acetylproline, is a cyclic amino acid. This forms a rigid bicyclic münchnone intermediate. This rigidity prevents the münchnone from equilibrating with its acylaminoketene valence tautomer. In contrast, the flexible, acyclic starting material in Reactions 1 and 2 forms a münchnone that can and does equilibrate with its corresponding acylaminoketene. This equilibrium is the pathway through which the scrambling observed in the isotopic labeling experiment of Reaction 2 occurs, leading to an apparent lack of regioselectivity with respect to the methyl group positions. Reaction 1 establishes that the underlying cycloaddition step is inherently regioselective. Therefore, the high regioselectivity of Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of its rigid intermediate being unable to access the scrambling pathway that is available to the flexible intermediates of Reactions 1 and 2.
