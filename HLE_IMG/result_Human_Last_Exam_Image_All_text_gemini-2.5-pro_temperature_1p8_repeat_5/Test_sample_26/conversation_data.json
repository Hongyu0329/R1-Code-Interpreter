    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Measure and Key Signature:**\n*   First, we locate measure 30 in the score. The measure numbers are provided at the beginning of each system (line of music). Measure 28 is marked, so we count two measures forward to find measure 30. It is the second measure in the circled portion of the image.\n*   The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the primary key of the movement is C minor. The passage in question is part of the transition, but it is analyzed within the context of the home key, C minor.\n\n**2. Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays rapid thirty-second note arpeggios. The notes used are G♯, A, B, C, and D. The primary structural notes of this figuration are those that form the underlying chord: G♯, B, and D.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a two-note chord. The bottom note is E (on the first ledger line below the staff) and the top note is G♯ (in the top space of the staff, with an explicit sharp accidental).\n\n**3. Combine the Notes to Determine the Chord:**\n*   When we combine the notes from both hands, we get E (from the bass), G♯, B, and D.\n*   Spelling these notes out, we form a chord:\n    *   Root: E\n    *   Third: G♯ (a major third above E)\n    *   Fifth: B (a perfect fifth above E)\n    *   Seventh: D (a minor seventh above E)\n*   These notes form an **E dominant seventh chord (E7)**. The chord is in **root position** because the root, E, is the lowest sounding note (in the bass).\n\n**4. Determine the Chord's Function (Roman Numeral Analysis):**\n*   To find the Roman numeral, we must determine the chord's function within the key of C minor.\n*   Dominant seventh chords, especially those containing chromatic notes (like E, G♯, and B, which are not in the key of C minor), often function as **secondary dominants**. A secondary dominant temporarily tonicizes a chord other than the tonic.\n*   To find out which chord is being tonicized, we look at the chord in the next measure, measure 31.\n*   **Measure 31:** The left hand plays a bass note A, and the right hand plays a chord of A and E. The C from the key signature is implied or present in the harmony leading to this point. The chord is A-C-E, which is an **A minor triad**.\n*   The progression from measure 30 to 31 is E7 → A minor. This is a V7 → i progression in the key of A minor. This confirms that the E7 chord is functioning as the dominant of A minor.\n*   Now, we relate this back to our home key of C minor. The root of the A minor chord is A. The note A is the 6th scale degree of C minor (which is diatonically A♭), raised by a half step. Therefore, the A minor chord is a chromatically altered submediant chord (a form of vi).\n*   The E7 chord in measure 30 is the dominant of this submediant chord. The Roman numeral for a secondary dominant is written as \"V of...\" which is notated as a slash.\n*   The chord is a dominant seventh (V7) that tonicizes the submediant (vi).\n\n**5. Final Roman Numeral:**\n*   The complete Roman numeral is **V⁷/vi**.\n*   `V`: Indicates a dominant function (a major triad built on the fifth of the target chord). E is the fifth of A.\n*   `⁷`: Indicates it's a dominant seventh chord.\n*   `/vi`: Indicates that the chord it resolves to is the submediant (the chord on the 6th degree) of the home key.\n\nThus, the E7 chord in measure 30 is the secondary dominant of the submediant.\n\n<<<V⁷/vi>>>"
