    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the image.**\nThe image consists of two plots representing a sound.\n*   **Top plot (Spectrogram):** This shows the frequency content of the sound over time. We can see a single, stable frequency (a pure tone) represented by a thin horizontal line. This line is interrupted in the middle. At the point of interruption, there is a vertical bar spanning a wide range of frequencies, which represents a burst of noise.\n*   **Bottom plot (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, smooth sine wave (corresponding to the pure tone). This is followed by a chaotic, high-amplitude section (the noise burst). After the noise, the sine wave resumes.\n*   **Conclusion from the image:** The physical stimulus is a pure tone that is stopped, replaced by a burst of noise for a short duration, and then restarted. There is a literal gap in the tone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual information in the prompt.**\n*   **\"Illusion\":** The phenomenon is not what it seems. The perception does not match the physical reality shown in the plots.\n*   **\"Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a famous visual illusion. It's a 2D line drawing that our brain interprets as a 3D cube. The \"bistable ambiguity\" refers to the fact that the cube's orientation can spontaneously flip between two equally stable perceptions (e.g., viewed from above or below). This comparison suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous signal and potentially having more than one possible perception, with a tendency to favor one.\n*   **\"Reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that our brain is actively doing something to process the sound without our awareness. It's a fundamental aspect of perception.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information to identify the phenomenon.**\nWhen a listener hears the sound depicted in the image (a tone interrupted by noise), the most common experience is *not* hearing a tone, then a gap filled with noise, then the tone again. Instead, the listener perceives the original tone as being continuous and uninterrupted, as if it carried on \"behind\" the burst of noise.\n*   The brain \"fills in\" or \"restores\" the missing part of the tone.\n*   This matches the description of an \"illusion\" because the perceived continuity does not match the physical discontinuity of the signal.\n*   It is analogous to the Necker Cube because the brain resolves an ambiguous input (a discontinuous signal) into a more coherent and ecologically likely percept (a continuous sound source being temporarily obscured by another sound source). The ambiguity is between \"tone-noise-tone\" and \"tone + noise.\" The brain strongly prefers the latter.\n*   This \"filling in\" is a common and unconscious perceptual ability, a process known as perceptual restoration.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the specific name of the phenomenon.**\nThis specific and famous auditory illusion is known as the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n*   The effect was discovered and named by psychologist Richard M. Warren.\n*   Although the name specifically refers to \"phonemes\" (the basic units of sound in speech), as his original experiments involved replacing phonemes in spoken sentences with coughs or static, the term is now broadly used to describe the perceptual restoration of any sound, including simple tones, that are interrupted by noise.\n*   The image provided is a standard textbook illustration of this very effect. A more general scientific term for the underlying principle is the \"auditory continuity illusion,\" but the \"phonemic restoration effect\" is the widely recognized name for this classic demonstration.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
