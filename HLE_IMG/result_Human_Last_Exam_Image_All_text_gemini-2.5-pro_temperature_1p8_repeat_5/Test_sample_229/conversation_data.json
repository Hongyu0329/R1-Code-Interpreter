    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Examination:**\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, also known as \"common time,\" as indicated by the 'C'-like symbol after the treble clef is often replaced by `4/4` in modern notation.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which indicates the key of C Major or its relative minor, A minor. Based on the frequent use of the C major chord as a point of resolution, the piece is in C Major.\n    *   **Tempo and Style Marking:** At the top left, there is a handwritten instruction \"Med. Swing\" and a tempo marking that appears to be \"♩=120\" (120 beats per minute). \"Swing\" is a rhythmic style characteristic of jazz where eighth notes are played with an unequal, long-short pattern. \"Medium Swing\" specifies a moderate tempo for this style.\n    *   **Instrumentation and Format:** The sheet music consists of a single melodic line in the treble clef with chord symbols written above it (e.g., C, E7, F). This format is known as a \"lead sheet,\" which is common in jazz, pop, and folk music.\n\n2.  **Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression):**\n    *   The chord progression is a key element for identifying a specific song, especially a jazz standard.\n    *   The first A section (first 8 bars of the main theme) begins with a distinctive progression: **C → E7 → F → Fm**.\n    *   This progression is highly characteristic. The E7 chord acts as a secondary dominant, creating tension that would normally resolve to A minor, but here it moves to F major, a common and effective harmonic device. The move from F major to F minor (Fm) is a classic example of a minor plagal cadence, adding a bluesy or poignant color.\n    *   Later in the form, there is a clear bridge section which harmonically moves through `E7`, `Am`, `D-` (Dm), and `G7`.\n    *   This combination of A and B sections, particularly the opening `C | E7 | F | Fm` progression and the `E7 | Am | Dm | G7` bridge, is the unmistakable harmonic fingerprint of the well-known jazz standard \"All of Me\".\n\n3.  **Melodic and Structural Analysis:**\n    *   **Melody:** The written melody is highly syncopated and features chromatic notes (like C# over the E7 chord and Ab over the Fm chord) that fit the underlying harmony. This is typical of an improvised jazz solo or a specific written arrangement rather than the simple, original published melody. The melody's contour and rhythmic complexity support the \"Swing\" and \"Jazz\" classification.\n    *   **Form:** The sheet has markings like `§` (the Segno symbol) and instructions like \"To go out - take §. to CODA,\" along with a separate `CODA` section. This indicates a structured song form with repeats and a special ending, typical of the 32-bar AABA form common to most Tin Pan Alley and jazz standards.\n\n4.  **Identification and Verification:**\n    *   **Title:** Based on the conclusive evidence from the chord progression, the song is **\"All of Me\"**.\n    *   **Musical Style:** The direct instruction \"Med. Swing\" and the overall harmonic and rhythmic language confirm the style is **Jazz** (specifically, **Swing**). It is a quintessential piece from the \"Great American Songbook.\"\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The song \"All of Me\" was composed in 1931 with music by Gerald Marks and lyrics by Seymour Simons. Both were American, making the song's country of origin the **United States**. It was first popularized by performers like Paul Whiteman and Louis Armstrong.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The melody on the sheet is not the original, standard melody of \"All of Me.\" It is likely a transcription of a solo or a specific arrangement. However, the chord progression is the definitive clue.\n*   The handwriting can be slightly difficult to read (e.g., the symbol for Segno, `§`, is used instead of D.S.), but the key musical information is clear.\n*   The chord names follow standard jazz/pop notation (e.g., 'F-' for F minor).\n\nBy synthesizing these analytical points, we can confidently determine the song's identity and characteristics.\n\n<<<**Title:** \"All of Me\"\n**Musical Style:** Jazz / Swing\n**Country of Origin:** United States>>>"
