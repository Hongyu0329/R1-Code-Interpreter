    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis:**\n*   The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, specifically oleanan-3β-ol or a related isomer.\n*   The reaction is carried out with catalytic hydrochloric acid (cat. HCl) at 110 °C. These are conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction.\n*   The reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate, which is prone to rearrangement to form a more stable carbocation.\n*   The question explicitly states that the reaction involves a number of [1,2] shifts, which confirms a Wagner-Meerwein type backbone rearrangement.\n*   The product has the chemical formula C30H50, and water (H2O) is formed. The starting material has the formula C30H52O. This difference (loss of H2O) is consistent with a dehydration reaction.\n*   The final product has a tetrasubstituted double bond between rings D and E (specifically, at the C13-C18 position based on standard numbering), which is a thermodynamically stable position.\n\n**2. Proposing the Reaction Mechanism (The \"Backbone Rearrangement\"):**\nThe goal of the rearrangement cascade is to move the initial positive charge from its formation site to the location needed to form the final double bond.\n\n*   **Step A: Formation of the Initial Carbocation.**\n    1.  The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 is protonated by the acid (HCl) to form a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n    2.  The water molecule leaves, generating a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n\n*   **Step B: The Cascade of [1,2] Shifts.**\n    A series of hydride (H⁻) and methide (CH₃⁻) shifts occurs to move the positive charge across the carbon skeleton towards the C/D/E ring system. We must deduce the specific path by looking at the product structure.\n\n*   **Key observation from the product structure:** The label '1' points to the carbon C-4 (using standard numbering). In the product drawing, this carbon retains its gem-dimethyl (two CH₃) groups. This is a crucial clue. It means that C-4 was not involved in the rearrangement as a source of a migrating group. Therefore, the common mechanism starting with a methyl shift from C-4 to C-3 is not what happened here. An alternative pathway must be taken.\n\n*   **Deducing the Pathway:**\n    1.  **Initial Cation at C-3.**\n    2.  **1st Shift:** Since a methyl group from C-4 did not migrate, a hydride must have migrated from the adjacent C-2 position to C-3. This moves the positive charge to C-2. [**C+ at C-2**]\n    3.  **2nd Shift:** The carbocation at C-2 is adjacent to the quaternary C-10, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-10 to C-2 occurs. This is favorable as it moves the positive charge to C-10, which is a more stable tertiary position. [**C+ at C-10**, the original C-10 methyl is now on C-2].\n    4.  **3rd Shift:** The carbocation at C-10 is adjacent to C-9, which bears a hydrogen atom. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-9 to C-10 moves the positive charge to C-9. [**C+ at C-9**, the original C-9 hydrogen is now on C-10].\n    5.  **4th Shift:** The carbocation at C-9 is adjacent to C-8, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-8 to C-9 moves the charge to C-8. [**C+ at C-8**, the original C-8 methyl is now on C-9].\n    6.  **5th Shift:** The carbocation at C-8 is adjacent to C-14, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-14 to C-8 moves the charge to C-14. [**C+ at C-14**, the original C-14 methyl is now on C-8].\n    7.  **6th Shift:** The carbocation at C-14 is adjacent to C-13, which bears a hydrogen. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-13 to C-14 moves the charge to C-13. [**C+ at C-13**, the original C-13 hydrogen is now on C-14].\n\n*   **Step C: Formation of the Final Alkene.**\n    1.  With the carbocation at the C-13 position, a proton (H⁺) is eliminated from the adjacent C-18.\n    2.  This forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, yielding the final product.\n\n**3. Determining the Substituents at the Labeled Positions:**\nNow we track what group is at each numbered position in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (C-4):** This carbon was not involved in the migration sequence (based on the product drawing). It started with two methyl groups and ends with two methyl groups. The substituent type is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (C-10):** Started with a methyl group. This methyl group migrated to C-2 (in the 2nd shift). Later, a hydrogen atom migrated from C-9 to C-10 (in the 3rd shift). So, the final substituent at C-10 is a **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (C-9):** Started with a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen migrated to C-10 (in the 3rd shift). Later, a methyl group migrated from C-8 to C-9 (in the 4th shift). So, the final substituent at C-9 is a **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (C-8):** Started with a methyl group. This methyl migrated to C-9 (in the 4th shift). Later, a methyl group migrated from C-14 to C-8 (in the 5th shift). So, the final substituent at C-8 is a **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (C-14):** Started with a methyl group. This methyl migrated to C-8 (in the 5th shift). Later, a hydrogen atom migrated from C-13 to C-14 (in the 6th shift). So, the final substituent at C-14 is a **H**.\n\n**Final Answer Assembly:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
