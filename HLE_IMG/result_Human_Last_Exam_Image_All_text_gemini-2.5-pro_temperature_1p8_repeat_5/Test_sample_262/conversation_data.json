    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and the Variable Component:** All four structures are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`. The Iridium(III) center is coordinated by two bidentate cyclometalating `C^N` ligands and one bidentate diimine `N^N` ligand.\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this part is constant, it will not be the primary factor determining the *relative* lifetimes of the complexes.\n    *   The `C^N` ligands are different in each complex. These are substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. The variation lies in the number and position of fluorine (F) substituents on the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the `C^N` Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms, one ortho to the Ir-C bond (at position 2') and one para (at position 4').\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom, para to the Ir-C bond (at position 4').\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom, ortho to the Ir-C bond (at position 2').\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has no fluorine substituents.\n\n3.  **Relate Ligand Structure to Emitter Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an emitter in an LEC or OLED is determined by its chemical and electrochemical stability, especially in the excited state. Degradation of these iridium complexes is a major cause of device failure. Key factors that enhance stability and prolong lifetime are:\n    *   **Stronger Metal-Ligand Bonds:** The cyclometalated Ir-C bond is often a weak point susceptible to cleavage. Strengthening this bond increases stability.\n    *   **Higher Oxidation Potential:** Oxidative degradation is a common failure mechanism. Emitters with higher oxidation potentials (i.e., they are harder to oxidize) are generally more stable. This corresponds to a lower energy for the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorination:** Introducing fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand is a well-known strategy to improve emitter stability and lifetime.\n    *   **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is a strongly electron-withdrawing atom. It pulls electron density from the phenyl ring, which lowers the energy of the molecular orbitals, particularly the HOMO. A lower HOMO energy leads to a higher oxidation potential and greater stability against oxidation. This effect is present in complexes 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Bond Strengthening and Steric Effect:** A fluorine atom at the 2'-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond) has a particularly pronounced stabilizing effect. It not only contributes to the electronic stabilization but also strengthens the Ir-C bond and provides steric hindrance that protects this bond from attack. This effect is present in complexes 1 and 3.\n    *   **C-H vs. C-F Bonds:** The C-F bond is significantly stronger than the C-H bond. Replacing weaker C-H bonds with C-F bonds can make the ligand itself more robust against degradation.\n\n5.  **Rank the Complexes by Expected Lifetime:** Based on the principles above, we can rank the complexes from most stable (longest lifetime) to least stable (shortest lifetime).\n    *   **Complex 1 (2',4'-difluoro):** Has the maximum stabilization. It benefits from two electron-withdrawing F atoms, including the crucial one at the 2'-position. It is expected to have the **longest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 3 (2'-fluoro):** Benefits from the strong stabilization provided by the 2'-fluoro substituent. It is expected to be very stable, likely having the **second longest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 2 (4'-fluoro):** Benefits from the electronic stabilization of the 4'-fluoro group, but it lacks the direct bond-strengthening and steric shielding of the 2'-fluoro group. Its lifetime is expected to be shorter than that of Complex 1 and 3. It will have the **second shortest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 4 (unsubstituted):** Lacks any stabilizing fluorine substituents. It has the weakest Ir-C bond and the lowest oxidation potential (highest HOMO) of the series, making it the most susceptible to degradation. It is expected to have the **shortest lifetime**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the complexes that are expected to show **shorter lifetimes**. According to our ranking (Lifetime: 1 > 3 > 2 > 4), the two complexes with the shorter lifetimes are **Complex 2** and **Complex 4**.\n\n7.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The option that includes both Complex 2 and Complex 4 is [I].\n\n<<<I>>>"
