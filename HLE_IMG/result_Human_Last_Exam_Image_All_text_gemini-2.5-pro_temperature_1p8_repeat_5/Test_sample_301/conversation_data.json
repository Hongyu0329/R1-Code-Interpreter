    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork.\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top-Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts four whimsical fish with human-like expressions and a fish hook. The style is characterized by simple, child-like black outlines filled with transparent watercolor washes. This cartoonish and satirical style is the signature of **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄)**, a renowned Chinese cartoonist. This particular work is known as \"Self-deprecation\" (自嘲).\n*   **Author:** Liao Bingxiong\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top-Center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The brushwork is confident and bold, capturing the spirit of the flowers rather than just their form. This style, along with the subject matter (one of the \"Four Gentlemen\" in Chinese art), and the red artist's seal in the upper left, are characteristic of the modern master **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**.\n*   **Author:** Qi Baishi\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top-Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a realistic oil portrait of an elderly peasant woman. The painting exhibits thick, expressive brushstrokes (impasto) and a deep sense of empathy for the subject, focusing on the textures of the skin and clothing. This style is the hallmark of the \"Scar Art\" and \"Rustic Realism\" movement. The painting is \"My Neighbor Auntie Deng\" (《我的邻居邓大妈》) by **Luo Zhongli (罗中立)**, famous for his iconic painting \"Father\".\n*   **Author:** Luo Zhongli\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle-Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly expressive and uninhibited cursive script (草书). The characters flow into one another with powerful, almost violent energy. This dramatic and individualistic style is representative of the Ming dynasty artist **Xu Wei (徐渭)**, who was known for his wild cursive script that reflected his tumultuous life.\n*   **Author:** Xu Wei\n\n**Artwork 5 (Middle-Center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a modern painting blending abstract and traditional elements. It features a simplified landscape under two large, flat circles of color (one red, one orange), representing the sun and/or moon. This unique approach of deconstructing landscapes into geometric shapes, lines, and color fields is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting. This work is titled \"Sunrise\" (日出).\n*   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle-Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a very elegant, fluid, and well-structured regular script (楷书). The text is a colophon (a commentary written on a work of art or text) discussing various Tang Dynasty steles. The calligraphic style, renowned for its grace and technical perfection, is the distinct \"Zhao Style\" (赵体) created by the Yuan Dynasty master **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**.\n*   **Author:** Zhao Mengfu\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom-Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This calligraphy is in a fluid and expressive running script (行书). It possesses a natural, scholarly air with variations in brush speed and weight, creating a powerful rhythm. This piece is a section from the famous \"Cold Food Observance\" (寒食帖), which is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Chinese calligraphy. It was written by the Song Dynasty poet and statesman **Su Shi (苏轼)**.\n*   **Author:** Su Shi\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom-Center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman with a thoughtful, melancholic expression. The style is polished, romantic, and almost photographic, with meticulous attention to light, shadow, and texture. This aesthetic is characteristic of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary art known for his romantic realism. This painting is titled \"Youth\" (青春).\n*   **Author:** Chen Yifei\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom-Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a painting of an elegantly costumed female figure, likely from a classical opera or myth. The work combines the bold black outlines of Chinese tradition with a Western-influenced approach to form, color, and composition. The elongated features, flat application of vibrant color, and strong sense of design are hallmarks of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a master who synthesized Chinese and Western art styles. The signature in the lower left also confirms his authorship.\n*   **Author:** Lin Fengmian\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Liao Bingxiong\n2.  Qi Baishi\n3.  Luo Zhongli\n4.  Xu Wei\n5.  Wu Guanzhong\n6.  Zhao Mengfu\n7.  Su Shi\n8.  Chen Yifei\n9.  Lin Fengmian\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Qi Baishi, Luo Zhongli, Xu Wei, Wu Guanzhong, Zhao Mengfu, Su Shi, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian>>>"
