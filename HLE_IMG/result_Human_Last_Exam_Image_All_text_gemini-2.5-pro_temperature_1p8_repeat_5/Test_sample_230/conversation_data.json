    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Content:** The image fragment depicts a large windmill as the central subject. The setting is dramatic, with a dark, stormy sky contrasting with a patch of blue. To the right, in the background, a building is visibly on fire, with bright orange flames and smoke rising into the sky. The overall style is characteristic of 19th-century Romanticism, emphasizing drama, emotion, and the power of nature.\n\n2.  **Initial Art Historical Context:** The subject matter—a windmill—immediately suggests Dutch painting. Indeed, several 19th-century Dutch artists, such as Andreas Schelfhout and his student Charles Leickert, painted very similar scenes. Their works often bear titles like \"The 'De Riek' Mill near Amsterdam during a Thunderstorm\". This is a strong initial lead.\n\n3.  **Detailed Scrutiny and Cross-referencing:** A careful examination of the details, particularly the event in the background, is crucial. The hints provided clearly show flames and smoke consuming a building, indicating a fire rather than a lightning strike, which is often mentioned in the titles of the Dutch versions.\n\n4.  **Broadening the Search:** By using reverse image search or searching for \"19th-century painting windmill fire storm,\" one can find a nearly identical painting by the Russian Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky (1817-1900). While famous for his seascapes, he also painted landscapes.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Correct Painting and Artist:** The painting by Aivazovsky is titled **\"Windmill on the Sea Coast\"** (or sometimes \"Windmill on a Stormy Seashore\"). It was painted in 1837. When comparing this specific painting to the provided fragment, the match is exact. The dramatic rendering of the sky, the specific structure of the windmill with its tattered sails, and especially the distinct depiction of the burning building in the background align perfectly with Aivazovsky's work. The similar paintings by Leickert and Schelfhout are likely versions or copies inspired by a common popular composition, but the specific visual evidence in the fragment points most strongly to the famous Aivazovsky version.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The painting is from the 19th century (1837), and the visual evidence confirms its identity.\n\n**Final Answer:** The painting is \"Windmill on the Sea Coast\" by Ivan Aivazovsky.\n\n<<<Windmill on the Sea Coast>>>"
