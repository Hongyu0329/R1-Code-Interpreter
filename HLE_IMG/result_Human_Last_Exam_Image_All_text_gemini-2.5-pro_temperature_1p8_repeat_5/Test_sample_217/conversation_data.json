    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence.**\nThe image displays a pictograph, which is an early form of a cuneiform sign. The drawing is composed of several elements:\n*   A tall, rectangular base.\n*   Vertical and nested rectangular lines within the base, suggesting a door or complex structure.\n*   A triangular shape on top of the rectangle, resembling a roof or lintel.\n*   Additional small lines attached to the sides of the triangle and the base.\nThe overall impression is that of an architectural feature, specifically a gateway or a fortified gatehouse.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of the question.**\nThe question asks for the meaning of the sign in its \"third-millennium form.\" The third millennium BCE (c. 3000‚Äì2001 BCE) is the period when cuneiform writing evolved from its early pictographic stage (like the one shown) into more abstract, wedge-shaped signs. This confirms that we are looking for the meaning of this specific pictographic representation.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on cuneiform knowledge.**\nLet's consider the pictographic origins of the words in the answer choices:\n*   **A. Tool:** This is a general category. Specific tools had their own signs (e.g., a spade, a plow), none of which match this complex gate-like structure.\n*   **B. Guard:** The concept of a \"guard\" or \"gatekeeper\" is directly linked to a \"gate.\" This pictograph is the archaic form of the Sumerian sign **KA‚ÇÇ**. The primary meaning of KA‚ÇÇ is \"gate.\" By metonymy (where a related concept stands for the main concept), the sign for \"gate\" is also used to represent the \"gatekeeper\" or \"guard\" who is stationed there. This is a very strong possibility.\n*   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (Sumerian: **NINDA**) originated from a pictograph of a ration bowl or a loaf of bread, which looks very different from the image.\n*   **D. Home:** The sign for house or temple (Sumerian: **E‚ÇÇ**) originated from a pictograph of a building's rectangular floor plan. It lacks the prominent triangular top and complex internal structure seen in the image.\n*   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity or god (Sumerian: **DINGIR**) is one of the most famous cuneiform signs. Its pictograph is a star (íÄ≠). This does not match the image.\n*   **F. Beard:** The sign for beard (Sumerian: **SU‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ**) was a pictograph of a human head in profile, emphasizing the beard. This also does not match the image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe pictograph in the image is a clear depiction of a gate or gatehouse. This corresponds to the early form of the cuneiform sign KA‚ÇÇ. While the most literal meaning is \"gate,\" the sign was also used for the associated role of \"gatekeeper\" or \"guard.\" Among the given choices, \"Guard\" is the most fitting meaning derived from the sign.\n\n<<<B>>>"
