    "**Step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak and Halogen Presence:**\n    *   The peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear in a cluster around m/z 260-266. The most intense peaks in this region are at m/z 260 (relative intensity I=34.8%), m/z 262 (I=29.0%), m/z 264 (I=12.9%), and m/z 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   This characteristic cluster of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M, M+2, M+4, M+6) is a strong indicator of the presence of multiple chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes, natural abundance ratio ≈ 3:1) or bromine atoms (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br isotopes, ratio ≈ 1:1).\n    *   Let's analyze the base peak (the most intense peak in the entire spectrum) to get more clues. The base peak is at m/z 225 (I=100%).\n    *   Looking at the isotope pattern of the base peak: there is a peak at m/z 227 with an intensity of 66.7%. The ratio of intensities I(227)/I(225) is 66.7/100 ≈ 0.67. The theoretical intensity ratio for a species with two chlorine atoms (M', M'+2) is approximately 100:65. The observed ratio is a very good match, strongly suggesting that the fragment at m/z 225 contains **two chlorine atoms**.\n    *   Now, let's relate the base peak to the molecular ion. The mass difference between the lowest mass of the molecular ion cluster (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This loss corresponds exactly to one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n    *   This implies the fragmentation pathway M⁺˙ → [M - Cl]⁺. If the [M - Cl]⁺ fragment contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule (M⁺˙) must have contained 2 + 1 = **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The theoretical intensity ratio for a species with three chlorine atoms (M'', M''+2, M''+4, M''+6) is approximately 100:98:32:4. Our observed cluster at 260/262/264/266 has a ratio of approximately 100:83:37:9. While not a perfect match, it's consistent with the presence of three chlorine atoms, and confirms that the molecular weight of the compound (using the lightest isotopes) is **260 u**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure from Fragmentation Patterns:**\n    *   We have a molecule with a molecular weight of 260 u (for the all ³⁵Cl isotopologue) containing three chlorine atoms.\n    *   The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is 260 u - (3 × 35 u) = 155 u. This part is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and possibly oxygen.\n    *   Let's analyze other significant fragments. There is a prominent peak at **m/z 143** (I=27.8%).\n    *   The presence of three chlorine atoms often suggests a trichloromethyl (-CCl₃) group or a trichloroacetyl (Cl₃C-C=O) group. Let's explore the possibility of an ester derived from trichloroacetic acid: **Cl₃C-C(=O)O-R**.\n    *   In the mass spectrum of an ester, alpha-cleavage is a common fragmentation process. This can cleave the C-C bond between the CCl₃ and the carbonyl group.\n        *   Structure: Cl₃C — C(=O)O-R\n        *   Cleavage can result in two fragments: [CCl₃]⁺ and [C(=O)O-R]⁺.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with the observed peak at m/z 143. If m/z 143 corresponds to the [C(=O)O-R]⁺ fragment, we can calculate the mass of the alkyl group R.\n        *   Mass(R) = Mass([C(=O)O-R]⁺) - Mass(C(=O)O) = 143 - (12 + 16 + 16) = 143 - 44 = 99 u.\n    *   We now look for an alkyl group (CₙH₂ₙ₊₁) with a mass of 99 u.\n        *   12n + (2n + 1) = 99  =>  14n = 98  =>  n = 7.\n    *   The alkyl group is C₇H₁₅, which is a **heptyl** group.\n    *   This strongly suggests the compound is **heptyl trichloroacetate**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Proposed Structure:**\n    *   **Compound:** Heptyl trichloroacetate (C₉H₁₅Cl₃O₂).\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** (9 × 12) + (15 × 1) + (3 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 108 + 15 + 105 + 32 = 260 u. This matches our M⁺ peak.\n    *   **Fragmentation Check:**\n        *   [M]⁺˙ at m/z 260 (with 3-Cl pattern). Observed.\n        *   [M-Cl]⁺ at m/z 225 (with 2-Cl pattern). This is the base peak, a favorable fragmentation. Observed.\n        *   [C(=O)OC₇H₁₅]⁺ at m/z 143. Observed as a major peak.\n        *   [CCl₃]⁺ at m/z 117 (for ³⁵Cl). A peak is observed at m/z 117 (I=2.98%). Its low intensity is expected as the positive charge is more stable on the larger, oxygen-containing fragment.\n        *   Fragments from the heptyl chain: Peaks like m/z 71 (C₅H₁₁) and m/z 85 (C₆H₁₃) are expected and observed (I=10.6% and I=7.09% respectively).\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The compound is an ester formed from trichloroacetic acid and heptanol.\n    *   The systematic name for trichloroacetic acid is 2,2,2-trichloroacetic acid.\n    *   The alcohol is heptanol, giving a heptyl group.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for the ester is **heptyl 2,2,2-trichloroacetate**.\n\nAll evidence points consistently to this structure.\n\n<<<heptyl 2,2,2-trichloroacetate>>>"
