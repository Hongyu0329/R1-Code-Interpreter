    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the identity of the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Scene Identification:** The image is a painting on an ancient Greek vase, likely in the red-figure style due to the red figures on a black background. The scene depicts a dramatic mythological event.\n2.  **Key Elements:** We can observe several key elements in the composition:\n    *   **A Chariot:** A two-wheeled chariot is central to the scene. It is being pulled by at least one white horse.\n    *   **A Large Wing:** A prominent white wing is depicted above the chariot, indicating that the chariot is flying or magical.\n    *   **The Driver:** A figure is actively driving the chariot, holding a whip or goad. This figure wears an ornate, non-Greek headdress (resembling a Phrygian cap) and a garment with dotted sleeves. This \"exotic\" attire was used by Greek artists to signify a \"barbarian\" or foreigner.\n    *   **The Passenger:** Next to the driver is another figure, largely obscured by drapery. It appears to be a smaller figure, possibly a child, being held or lifted by the driver.\n    *   **Figure on the Ground:** Below the chariot, a naked male figure lies contorted on the ground. This figure appears to be dead or dying, having seemingly fallen or been thrown from the chariot.\n3.  **Mythological Context:** The combination of these elements—a foreign-looking woman (a sorceress), a magical flying chariot (a gift from the gods), and dead children—is the iconic representation of a specific Greek myth: the tragic story of **Medea**.\n4.  **Connecting Elements to the Myth:**\n    *   In Euripides' play \"Medea,\" Medea, a princess from Colchis, gets revenge on her unfaithful husband Jason by murdering their two children.\n    *   At the end of the play, she escapes punishment by fleeing Corinth in a magical, flying chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios. She often takes the bodies of her children with her, denying Jason the right to bury them.\n5.  **Identifying the Figures:**\n    *   **The Driver:** The figure in foreign attire driving the magical chariot is **Medea**.\n    *   **The Figures of the Children:** The dead boy on the ground and the figure being held in the chariot are her murdered sons.\n6.  **Answering the Question:** The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This question can be interpreted in a few ways, but the most logical interpretation within the context of the narrative is:\n    *   The primary action of the scene is Medea's departure from Corinth. She is the agent of this action, the one who is \"leaving\" the city in the chariot.\n    *   While one of her children has literally \"left\" the chariot by falling to the ground, the central event is Medea's escape. She is the subject of the verb \"to leave\" in the context of the entire narrative episode being depicted. Therefore, the figure leaving is Medea.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Leaving\":** The word \"leaving\" could mean \"departing from a place\" or \"exiting a vehicle.\" The child on the ground has exited the vehicle, but Medea is departing from the place (Corinth). In artistic representations of a narrative, the main character performing the key action is typically the intended subject.\n*   **Iconography:** The visual cues are crucial. The Phrygian cap and patterned clothing are standard visual shorthand for Medea. The winged chariot is her specific mode of escape, sent by Helios. The presence of her dead children completes the identification of the scene.\n*   **Vase Type:** This scene is painted on an Apulian (South Italian) volute-krater from around 330-310 BC, attributed to the Underworld Painter. Such vases frequently depicted dramatic scenes from Greek tragedy, and the escape of Medea was a popular subject.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the iconographic evidence and the well-known myth it portrays, the figure driving the chariot and leaving the scene of her crime is Medea.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
