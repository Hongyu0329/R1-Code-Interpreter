    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the subject:** The image displays three micrographs labeled L, M, and N. Each micrograph shows a close-up of a long, thin, segmented structure. This structure is characteristic of a filament from a fungus (called a hypha) or some types of algae or plant protonema. The segments are individual cells separated by cross-walls, also known as septa.\n    2.  **Observe the changes across the panels:** The three panels appear to show a sequence of events or different examples of a specific process.\n        *   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively straight filament. An arrowhead points to a septum, the junction between two cells.\n        *   **Panel M:** Shows a similar filament, but there is a distinct bulge or swelling on the side of the filament, indicated by the arrowhead. This appears to be an initial outgrowth.\n        *   **Panel N:** The outgrowth seen in M is more developed. It is a clear protrusion that is starting to elongate, forming a new filament perpendicular to the original one. The original filament is bent at the point of this new growth.\n    3.  **Interpret the process:** The sequence shows the initiation and development of a new filament from the side of an existing one. In biology, particularly in mycology (the study of fungi), this process is called **branching**. A new hyphal tip is formed from the side of a mature hypha, allowing the fungal colony (mycelium) to expand and explore its surroundings.\n    4.  **Synthesize the observations:** The image clearly depicts the morphological stages of a fungal hypha forming a new branch. It starts with the selection of a site (often near a septum), followed by localized swelling of the cell wall, and then tip growth to extend the new branch.\n\n*   **Careful points to note:**\n    *   The structures are cellular and filamentous.\n    *   The presence of septa (cross-walls) is a key feature.\n    *   The arrowheads draw attention to the site of action.\n    *   The progression from a small bulge (M) to a distinct new growth (N) indicates a developmental process over time.\n    *   The process is a form of vegetative growth and propagation for the organism.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** Based on the visual evidence of a new filament growing out from the side of an existing one, the process being depicted is hyphal branching.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
