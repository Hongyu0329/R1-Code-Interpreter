    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Work 1 (Top Left):** This is a figure painting in Chinese ink and color depicting women from an ethnic minority. The style is contemporary Chinese painting. In the upper right corner, there is a signature and a seal. The signature reads \"邦杰\" (Bāngjié). This identifies the artist as Shi Bangjie (史邦杰), who is known for such subjects.\n    2.  **Work 2 (Top Middle):** This is an abstract landscape painting in Chinese ink. The style, which simplifies forms into expressive lines and blocks, is a hallmark of Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中), a master who blended Chinese and Western art forms. This specific work is his \"A Former Residence of Qiu Jin\" (秋瑾故居).\n    3.  **Work 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in cursive script (草书). The characters are fluid and energetic. A seal in the middle clearly reads \"沈鹏\" (Shěn Péng). Shen Peng is a highly acclaimed contemporary calligrapher famous for this style.\n    4.  **Work 4 (Middle Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy. At the end of the text, the signature \"启功\" (Qǐ Gōng) is visible, along with his characteristic seals. Qi Gong was a 20th-century master calligrapher, and this work displays his distinct, elegant style.\n    5.  **Work 5 (Middle Center):** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman in a white T-shirt holding a sketchbook and a pen, seemingly in front of a mural. This iconic work is \"Youth\" (or sometimes \"My Predecessor\") by the famous Chinese realist painter Chen Yifei (陈逸飞).\n    6.  **Work 6 (Middle Right):** This is a portrait of a woman, likely from an ethnic minority group in Southeast Asia or Southwest China, characterized by a highly stylized appearance, bold ink lines, and vibrant colors. This distinctive style is the signature of the artist Lin Yong (林墉).\n    7.  **Work 7 (Bottom Left):** This painting depicts a courtyard scene with hanging laundry and a loofah gourd trellis. The use of bold colors, flattened perspective, and a square composition is characteristic of Lin Fengmian (林风眠), a pioneer of modern Chinese painting. His signature and the date (1962) can be seen near the bottom right.\n    8.  **Work 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a landscape painting of a river gorge with numerous boats with red sails. The dramatic composition and the use of layered, dark ink washes to create a sense of monumentality are trademarks of Li Keran (李可染), one of the most important landscape painters of modern China.\n    9.  **Work 9 (Bottom Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The subject matter (shrimp, crabs, lobsters) and the masterfully simple, yet lively and powerful brushwork (known as *xieyi* style) are the definitive characteristics of the great master Qi Baishi (齐白石).\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    Based on the analysis of style, signatures, and seals for each of the nine works in order from left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\n    1.  Shi Bangjie\n    2.  Wu Guanzhong\n    3.  Shen Peng\n    4.  Qi Gong\n    5.  Chen Yifei\n    6.  Lin Yong\n    7.  Lin Fengmian\n    8.  Li Keran\n    9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Shi Bangjie, Wu Guanzhong, Shen Peng, Qi Gong, Chen Yifei, Lin Yong, Lin Fengmian, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
