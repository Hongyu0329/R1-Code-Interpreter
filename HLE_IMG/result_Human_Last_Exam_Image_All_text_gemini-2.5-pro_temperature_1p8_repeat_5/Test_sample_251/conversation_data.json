    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the duration, in seconds, of the longest interval between two consecutive R waves (the R-R interval) shown on the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n2.  **Identify ECG Parameters:**\n    *   The ECG strip has standard calibration markings at the top left: **25 mm/sec**. This is the paper speed.\n    *   This speed means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n    *   The ECG grid is composed of small squares (1 mm) and large squares (5 mm).\n    *   We can calculate the time duration for each square:\n        *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.04 seconds**.\n        *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n3.  **Visually Scan the ECG for the Longest R-R Interval:**\n    *   The ECG displays a cardiac rhythm over several horizontal strips. The R waves are the prominent upward spikes of the QRS complexes.\n    *   By visually inspecting the entire recording, we can observe that the rhythm is mostly regular, with some variability.\n    *   There is a distinct, prolonged pause in the fourth horizontal strip from the top (the one that starts near the timestamp `0:06:08`). This pause between the fourth and fifth QRS complex on that line is visibly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n4.  **Measure the Longest Interval:**\n    *   We will now measure the distance between the peaks of the two R waves that bracket this long pause.\n    *   Locate the peak of the R wave just before the pause. It aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Locate the peak of the R wave that ends the pause. It also aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Count the number of large squares (the squares between the thick grid lines) separating these two R-wave peaks. There are exactly **8 large squares** between them.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:**\n    *   Now, we convert this measurement in large squares to time in seconds using the value calculated in Step 2.\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 8 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square\n    *   Duration = **1.6 seconds**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe longest R-R interval is found in the fourth strip, measures 8 large squares horizontally, and corresponds to a time of 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
