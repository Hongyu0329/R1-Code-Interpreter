    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to determine the required reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** The first reaction starts with n-butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH2COBr).\n*   **Conditions:** The catalyst is aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solvent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The n-butyl group is an ortho, para-directing group on the benzene ring. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation will preferentially occur at the para position.\n*   **Product of Step 1:** The acetyl group (-COCH2Br) is added to the benzene ring at the position para to the butyl group. This forms 2-bromo-1-(4-n-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule is an α-haloketone, which is a key functional group for the next step. This product is correctly shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction (the transformation in question).**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-n-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, an α-bromoketone.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is a complex heterocyclic molecule, which needs careful identification. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It contains a central five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms, which is an imidazole ring.\n    *   The imidazole ring has a 4-n-butylphenyl group attached to one of its carbons. This group clearly comes from the starting α-bromoketone.\n    *   The imidazole ring has an amino group (-NH2) at position C2.\n    *   One of the ring nitrogens (at position N1) is protected with a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (a Boc group, -C(=O)O-tBu).\n    *   The full name of the product is tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-n-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. (Note: The drawing of the product is slightly unconventional with `H2N=N-`, which is chemically incorrect. It should be interpreted as the stable aromatic 2-aminoimidazole tautomer shown above).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This transformation involves the formation of a 2-aminoimidazole ring. The standard method for synthesizing a 2-aminoimidazole ring is the condensation of an α-haloketone with guanidine (H2N-C(=NH)-NH2).\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the identity of the unknown \"Reactant\".**\n*   To form the imidazole ring, the α-bromoketone (`R-CO-CH2-Br`) provides a two-carbon fragment (`C-C`). The unknown reactant must provide the remaining `N-C-N` fragment of the ring.\n*   Since the product is a 2-**amino**imidazole, this strongly suggests the `N-C-N` fragment comes from **guanidine**.\n*   The reaction of `R-CO-CH2-Br` with guanidine would yield `2-amino-4-R-imidazole`. In our case, this would be `2-amino-4-(4-n-butylphenyl)imidazole`.\n*   However, the final product also has a Boc group on the N1 position of the imidazole ring. The reaction is shown as a single step (`+ Reactant`), which means the reactant must be responsible for both the ring formation and the Boc protection.\n*   Therefore, a simple guanidine is not enough. We need a guanidine derivative that already contains a Boc group, or is used in a way that incorporates it.\n*   A common strategy for such transformations is to use a doubly-protected guanidine derivative. A suitable reagent is **N,N'-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as 1,3-bis(Boc)guanidine).\n*   **Proposed Mechanism:**\n    1.  N,N'-bis(Boc)guanidine reacts with the α-bromoketone. One of its nitrogen atoms attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in an SN2 reaction.\n    2.  This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where another nitrogen atom of the guanidine moiety attacks the ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n    3.  Subsequent dehydration leads to the formation of the imidazole ring, which is now protected with two Boc groups: one on the ring nitrogen (N1) and one on the exocyclic amino group at C2.\n    4.  The reaction conditions (long reaction time, and presence of HBr byproduct) are sufficient to selectively cleave the more acid-labile exocyclic Boc group (from the -NHBoc group), while the more stable endocyclic Boc group (an N-carbamate on the aromatic ring) remains.\n    5.  This process results in the final desired product: tert-butyl 2-amino-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reactant must be a source for the guanidine core and the Boc protecting group. N,N'-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is the logical choice as it can achieve this transformation in what is depicted as a single step.\n\n<<<N,N'-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
