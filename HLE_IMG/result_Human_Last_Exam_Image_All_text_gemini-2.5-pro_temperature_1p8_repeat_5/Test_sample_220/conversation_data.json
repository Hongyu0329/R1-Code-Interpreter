    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure\nAn FCC unit cell is a cube with atoms at all 8 corners and at the center of each of the 6 faces. Key features are:\n*   Atoms are located at positions like (0,0,0), (1,0,0), etc., for corners (in lattice units).\n*   Atoms are located at positions like (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), etc., for face centers.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction\nWhen we view a 3D crystal structure along a specific direction, we are essentially projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction.\n*   **Viewing Direction:** [110]. This is a vector that goes diagonally across one of the cube's faces.\n*   **Projection Plane:** The plane perpendicular to [110] is the (110) plane.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** For an FCC lattice, the projection of atoms along the [110] direction forms a repeating pattern. Crystallographic analysis shows that this pattern is a **centered rectangle**.\n    *   This means the unit cell of the 2D projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at each of the four corners and one atom precisely in the center.\n    *   The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] crystal directions.\n    *   The ratio of the lengths of the sides of this rectangle is `a` : `a/√2`, which simplifies to `√2 : 1`. The ratio is approximately `1.414`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Four Given Patterns (A, B, C, D)\nWe need to examine the arrangement of atoms on the front face of each depicted box and see which one corresponds to a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Pattern A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. A unit cell can be drawn as a rectangle (or square) with atoms only at the corners, and no atom in the center. This pattern corresponds to a projection of a simple cubic lattice along the [100] axis. This is not the correct pattern.\n\n*   **Pattern D:** This pattern shows a rectangle with atoms at its corners, but it has *two* atoms inside the rectangle. These two atoms are symmetrically placed around the center, but not at the center itself. This specific pattern is characteristic of the projection of the **diamond cubic structure** (like silicon or diamond) or the **zincblende structure** along the [110] direction. It is not the pattern for a simple FCC lattice. This is not the correct pattern.\n\n*   **Pattern B:** The image is drawn with strong perspective, making it difficult to definitively identify the underlying 2D pattern. The atoms do not seem to form a clear, repeating centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Pattern C:** Let's analyze this pattern for the features of a centered rectangle.\n    1.  **Rectangular Shape:** The atoms are arranged in vertical columns. We can define a rectangle using the leftmost column (at x ≈ 0.5) and the rightmost column (at x ≈ 8.5). Let's pick a bottom row of atoms at z ≈ 7.5. So, two corners of a rectangle are at `(0.5, 7.5)` and `(8.5, 7.5)`. We can find another corner atom at `(8.5, 18.5)`. A corresponding fourth corner at `(0.5, 18.5)` is not shown, but this could be due to the limited size of the depicted block.\n    2.  **Centering Atom:** The center of a rectangle defined by corners `(0.5, 7.5)` and `(8.5, 18.5)` would be at `x = (0.5+8.5)/2 = 4.5` and `z = (7.5+18.5)/2 = 13`. Looking at the image, there is indeed an atom in the central column at `x = 4.5`, with its vertical position at `z ≈ 12.5`. This is very close to the calculated center `z = 13`.\n    3.  **Aspect Ratio:** The width of this potential rectangle is `W = 8.5 - 0.5 = 8.0` units. The height is `H = 18.5 - 7.5 = 11.0` units. The ratio `H/W = 11/8 = 1.375`. This value is very close to `√2 ≈ 1.414`, which is the expected aspect ratio for the FCC [110] projection.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy eliminating patterns A and D as incorrect structures, and observing that pattern C fits the theoretical description of a centered rectangle with the correct aspect ratio (within the tolerance of a sketch), we can conclude that C represents the FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
