    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution where the benzene ring is acylated. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming an acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is a powerful electrophile. The benzene ring attacks this ion to form a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivators and *meta*-directors in electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺, generated from Br₂/FeBr₃) will add to the *meta* position relative to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or *m*-bromopropiophenone).\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom substituted at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** These conditions are used for reduction. A ketone attached to a benzene ring (a benzylic ketone) will undergo hydrogenolysis, where the carbonyl group (C=O) is completely reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). The C-Br bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the meta positions (positions 1 and 3) relative to each other.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (*N*-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is characteristic of free-radical bromination, which is highly selective for allylic or benzylic positions. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In the propyl side chain (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the benzylic carbon is the first CH₂. A hydrogen atom from this position is abstracted to form a stable benzylic radical, which is then brominated.\n*   **Final Product:** Bromination occurs at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group. The resulting molecule is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n    *   Structure: A propane chain where C1 is attached to both a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n\n**Summary of the Final Product Identification:**\nThe final product is formed by brominating the benzylic carbon of 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The IUPAC name for this structure is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
