Product A has the molecular formula C14H20N2O3 and is the acetylated derivative of the primary [3+2] cycloadduct formed between the azomethine ylide of the starting material and methyl propiolate.
Product B has the molecular formula C12H14N2O3 and is formed from the primary cycloadduct via subsequent dehydrogenation (aromatization) and oxygenation (hydroxylation).
Product C has the molecular formula C11H16N2O3 and is the mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material with acetic anhydride.
