    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135. This is the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) strongly indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, most commonly one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Fragmentation Analysis:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z = 106. The mass difference between the molecular ion and this fragment is 135 - 106 = 29. A loss of 29 amu corresponds to the loss of an ethyl radical (-CH₂CH₃). This suggests an ethyl group is lost during fragmentation. Alpha-cleavage (cleavage of the bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom) is a very common fragmentation pathway for amines. A loss of an ethyl group suggests a structure like R-CH(NHR')-CH₂CH₃.\n*   Another significant fragment is at m/z ≈ 91, which is characteristic of the benzyl cation (C₆H₅CH₂⁺) or tropylium ion. This suggests the presence of a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-), however, the base peak at 106 is more indicative of the main structure.\n*   From the M⁺=135 and the presence of nitrogen, let's propose a molecular formula. If we assume a benzene ring (C₆) and one nitrogen (N), the remaining mass is 135 - (6*12) - 14 = 135 - 72 - 14 = 49 amu. This needs to be distributed between the remaining carbons and hydrogens. A plausible formula is **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the mass: (9 * 12) + (13 * 1) + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. The formula is correct.\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. Four degrees of unsaturation strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad peak is visible, characteristic of an N-H stretch. Its appearance (a single broadish peak) is more consistent with a secondary amine (R₂NH) or a primary amine (RNH₂) with hydrogen bonding, rather than a tertiary amine (which would have no N-H stretch).\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Small sharp peaks are visible just above 3000 cm⁻¹, characteristic of sp² C-H stretches (aromatic C-H).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong, sharp peaks are visible just below 3000 cm⁻¹, characteristic of sp³ C-H stretches (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region correspond to C=C stretching of an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** The presence of strong absorptions in this region often indicates a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Data**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 distinct carbon signals, indicating some molecular symmetry since the formula is C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Chemical Shift Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 126.3 - 145.1 ppm (4 signals):** This is the aromatic region. The signal at 145.1 ppm is downfield and typical for a quaternary carbon attached to an electronegative atom or part of an aromatic ring (the ipso-carbon). The other three signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are typical for CH carbons in a benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 19.2 - 49.6 ppm (3 signals):** This is the aliphatic region.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:** This experiment distinguishes between CH, CH₂, and CH₃ carbons.\n    *   \"one negative signal\": Indicates the presence of **one CH₂ group**.\n    *   \"five positive signals\": Indicates the presence of a total of **five CH and/or CH₃ groups**.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear in DEPT spectra. Since there are 7 signals in the ¹³C NMR and 1+5=6 signals in the DEPT-135, there must be **one quaternary carbon**.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT:**\n    *   The structure has: 1 Cq, 1 CH₂, and 5 (CH + CH₃).\n    *   A monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-) would account for the Cq (ipso-carbon) and 3 CH carbons (ortho, meta, para). This leaves 2 positive signals (CH/CH₃) and 1 negative signal (CH₂) for the side chain.\n    *   The side chain has the formula -C₃H₈N and must contain one CH₂ group and two CH/CH₃ groups. This does not seem to create a valid C₃ side chain.\n*   **Re-evaluation:** Let's assemble the whole molecule based on the carbon types. Structure has 1 Cq, 1 CH₂, 5 (CH+CH₃). The formula is C₉H₁₃N. A structure that fits this is **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   Let's check carbon types:\n        *   C₆H₅- ring: one ipso-carbon (Cq), and ortho, meta, para carbons (CH). If ortho and meta carbons are not equivalent (due to the chiral center), this gives 1 Cq and 3 CH signals. This matches.\n        *   Side chain: -CH(NH₂)- (a CH group), -CH₂- (a CH₂ group), -CH₃ (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Total count: 1 Cq, (3+1) = 4 CH groups, 1 CH₂ group, 1 CH₃ group.\n    *   This gives **1 Cq, 1 CH₂, and (4+1)=5 (CH+CH₃) groups**. This perfectly matches the DEPT data.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze ¹H NMR and HSQC Data**\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **~7.2-7.4 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of ~5H. This confirms the C₆H₅- (monosubstituted phenyl) group.\n    *   **~2.8 ppm & ~2.6 ppm:** Two overlapping multiplets integrating to ~2H and ~1H respectively. These correspond to the -CH₂- and -CH- protons.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm:** A triplet with an integration of ~3H. This is the terminal -CH₃ group, which is split into a triplet by the adjacent -CH₂- group (n+1 rule).\n    *   The N-H protons of the -NH₂ group are likely the broad, un-integrated signal or have been exchanged.\n*   **HSQC Analysis:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   A correlation exists between the proton signal at ~1.2 ppm and the carbon signal at ~19 ppm. This confirms the CH₃ group. (H3C-C)\n    *   Correlations exist between the protons at ~2.6-2.8 ppm and the carbons at ~43.5 and ~49.6 ppm. This confirms the CH and CH₂ assignments. From the DEPT analysis, C=43.5 ppm must be the CH₂ and C=49.6 ppm must be the CH.\n    *   Correlations exist between the aromatic protons at ~7.2 ppm and the aromatic carbons at ~126-129 ppm.\n    This comprehensive data set is fully consistent with the structure of 1-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The parent chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is located at carbon-1. Therefore, it is a propan-1-amine.\n*   A phenyl group (C₆H₅-) is also located at carbon-1.\n*   Combining these parts gives the systematic IUPAC name: **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\nFinal check with MS fragmentation: For 1-phenylpropan-1-amine, alpha-cleavage can occur by losing the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃, mass 29) to form the [C₆H₅-CH=NH₂]⁺ ion, which has an m/z of 106. This perfectly explains the base peak in the mass spectrum, providing very strong confirmation for the proposed structure.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
