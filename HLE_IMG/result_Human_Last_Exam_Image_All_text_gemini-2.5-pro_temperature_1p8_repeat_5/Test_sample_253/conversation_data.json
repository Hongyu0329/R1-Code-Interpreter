    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-green, leaf-like organism growing on a rock. This organism is a lichen. Its features, including the foliose (leafy) thallus and the presence of small, cup-like structures (apothecia, which are the fruiting bodies), are characteristic of lichens. Given the location is Acadia National Park, a coastal area, and the appearance, a very likely candidate is *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen or yellow wall lichen. This species is abundant on rocks, especially in coastal regions, and its appearance matches the image perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. A lichen is a composite organism, consisting of a fungal partner (mycobiont) and an algal partner (photobiont). The scientific name of the lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*, refers to the mycobiont.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the XPH1 Protein**\nThe protein name \"XPH1\" is a clue. It stands for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **h**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, secreted proteins produced by filamentous fungi that are involved in fungal development. This confirms that the protein belongs to the fungal partner, *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Size of the XPH1 Protein**\nTo find the number of amino acids in this specific protein, we need to consult biological protein databases like UniProt or NCBI.\n\n*   A search in the UniProt database for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" yields the entry with accession number **P87095**.\n*   This entry provides information about the protein. It is listed as \"Hydrophobin XPH1\".\n*   According to the database entry, the full-length protein as translated from the gene (the \"encoded\" protein or precursor) consists of **99 amino acids**.\n*   The entry also notes that this precursor protein is processed: a signal peptide (the first 19 amino acids) is removed to create the mature, functional protein, which is 80 amino acids long.\n*   However, the question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded\" protein, which refers to the complete sequence translated from the messenger RNA, before any post-translational modifications like cleavage. The original research paper describing this protein also states that the deduced protein from the gene sequence has 99 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* and referencing established protein databases, the full encoded XPH1 protein contains 99 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the lichen:** The visual characteristics and location are key to identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n2.  **Understand which part of the lichen the protein comes from:** The protein name XPH1 clearly links it to the fungal partner, *Xanthoria parietina*.\n3.  **Distinguish between encoded protein and mature protein:** The \"encoded\" protein refers to the full translation product (precursor), not the final processed form. Databases and primary literature confirm the precursor length is 99 amino acids.\n\n<<<99>>>"
