    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when changing from the Baseline (Table 1) mode share to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share.\n\n**Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = [ (Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT ] * 100\n\n**Method:**\nTo find the total Car VMT for each scenario, we need to calculate the VMT for each distance category and then sum them up. The calculation for each category is a product of three factors:\n1.  The share of total trips that fall into that distance category.\n2.  The combined mode share of cars within that distance category.\n3.  The average trip distance for that category.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)\n\nWe will calculate a weighted average VMT. The car modes are 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077** (This is the weighted average vehicle miles per trip for cars).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)\n\nWe use the same method with the new mode share percentages from Table 2.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Combined car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nNow we use the total VMT values calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **Baseline Car VMT** = 4.7077\n*   **Proposed Car VMT** = 2.2505\n*   **VMT Reduction** = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline Car VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the number of occupants in a car (or the 'Average Carpool Occupancy') is irrelevant. Each car trip, regardless of occupancy, counts as one vehicle trip.\n*   **Weighting:** It's crucial to use the 'share of total trips' for each distance category as a weighting factor. A simple average of mode shares would be incorrect.\n*   **Data Usage:** Use the column-specific mode shares and average distances. Do not use the 'Total' column for mode share in the calculation, as it averages out the critical effect of different trip lengths.\n*   **Car Modes:** Ensure you sum both car modes ('car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') to get the total car mode share for each distance bracket.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
