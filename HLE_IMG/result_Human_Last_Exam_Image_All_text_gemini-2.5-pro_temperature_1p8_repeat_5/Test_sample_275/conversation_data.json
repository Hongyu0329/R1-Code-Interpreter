    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Overall Goal:** To count the number of distinct mRNA splice variants (splice species) detected by the various RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. Each unique band on the gel represents a distinct PCR product, which in turn corresponds to a specific mRNA splice variant present in the samples.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each panel:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Panels B, C, and D (Early region transcripts):**\n    *   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This PCR uses a forward primer in the E1 region (E1F1) and a reverse primer in the E4 region (E4R). Two distinct bands are observed (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp). This indicates the presence of **two different splice species** that include exons in both the E1 and E4 regions.\n    *   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This PCR uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a different reverse primer further downstream in the E5 region (E5R). Again, two bands are seen (band 1: 584 bp; band 2: 553 bp). This confirms the presence of the same two splice species identified in Panel B, with the expected increase in product size due to the downstream position of the E5R primer.\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This PCR uses a special forward primer, E1F2, which is designed to specifically recognize the splice junction 929^3465. Only one band is produced (551 bp). The size of this band corresponds to band 2 from Panel C (553 bp). This confirms that the smaller of the two early splice species is formed by splicing from nucleotide 929 to nucleotide 3465.\n    *   **Conclusion for B, C, D:** There are **two** distinct early splice species.\n\n2.  **Analyze Panels E and F (L2-containing transcripts, type 1):**\n    *   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This PCR amplifies transcripts that link the E1 region (E1F1 primer) to the L2 region (L2R primer). A single major band is observed (1,005 bp). This represents **one splice species**.\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This PCR uses the splice-specific primer E1F2 (for junction 929^3465) and the L2R reverse primer. A single band is seen (972 bp). This indicates that the splice species identified in Panel E is the one that contains the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   **Conclusion for E, F:** There is **one** distinct splice species connecting the E1 region (via the 929^3465 splice) to the L2 region.\n\n3.  **Analyze Panel G (L2-containing transcripts, type 2):**\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This PCR uses another splice-specific primer, E1F3, which recognizes the junction 929^3506. Two distinct bands are amplified (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp). Since these are amplified by a primer specific for a different splice junction than the one in Panel F, they represent new splice species. The presence of two bands means there are two different ways the transcript can be structured downstream of this initial splice.\n    *   **Conclusion for G:** There are **two** new, distinct splice species that both contain the 929^3506 splice and link the E1 region to the L2 region.\n\n4.  **Analyze Panels H and I (L1-containing transcripts):**\n    *   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This PCR links the E1 region to the L1 region. Two bands are detected (band 1: 450 bp; band 2: 419 bp).\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same reaction as Panel H but run for more cycles to amplify less abundant transcripts. Four distinct bands are now visible (bands 1-4: 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp). These represent four distinct splice variants connecting the E1 region to the L1 region. These species are distinct from those detected in previous panels because they are amplified by a different primer pair (terminating in L1 instead of E4/E5 or L2) and have significantly different sizes, implying different splicing patterns.\n    *   **Conclusion for H, I:** There are **four** distinct splice species that connect the E1 region to the L1 region.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nTo find the total number of unique splice species, we sum the distinct species identified from each set of experiments:\n\n*   From the early region analysis (Panels B, C, D): 2 species\n*   From the L2 region analysis type 1 (Panels E, F): 1 species\n*   From the L2 region analysis type 2 (Panel G): 2 species\n*   From the L1 region analysis (Panels H, I): 4 species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
