    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the components of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** There are 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** There are 7 edges. Let's list them:\n    E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   The graph contains several triangles (cliques of size 3, K₃), for example, the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle. Another triangle is {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄) with one edge, (2, 5), missing.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) gives the number of proper colorings of a graph G using k colors. We can compute it using several methods. A reliable method is the **Deletion-Contraction Algorithm**.\n\n**The Deletion-Contraction Theorem:**\nFor any graph G and any edge e in G, the chromatic polynomial satisfies the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n*   G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e.\n*   G.e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e (merging its two endpoints into a single vertex and removing any resulting loops or multiple edges).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method\n\nWe need to choose an edge 'e' to start the process. A good choice can simplify the subsequent graphs. Let's choose the edge **e = (1, 2)**.\n\n#### 3.1: Analyze the Deletion Graph (G - e)\n\n*   **G - e = G - (1, 2):** We remove the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2.\n*   **Structure of G - e:**\n    *   In this new graph, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. This makes vertex 1 a \"pendant\" vertex (or part of a \"tail\") attached to vertex 5.\n    *   The rest of the graph, the subgraph H on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, is K₄ with the edge (2, 5) missing.\n*   **Computing P(G - e, k):**\n    *   We can compute the number of colorings of G - e by first coloring the subgraph H and then coloring vertex 1.\n    *   Let's find P(H, k). To color H, let's pick an order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n        1.  Color vertex 3: k choices.\n        2.  Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): k-1 choices.\n        3.  Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k-2 choices.\n        4.  Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k-2 choices.\n        *   Since vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent in H, their color choices are independent given the colors of 3 and 4.\n        *   Therefore, P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    *   Now, for any valid coloring of H, we must color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. Whatever color vertex 5 has, vertex 1 has k-1 available choices.\n    *   Thus, P(G - e, k) = P(H, k) × (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] × (k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)²**.\n\n#### 3.2: Analyze the Contraction Graph (G.e)\n\n*   **G.e = G.(1, 2):** We contract the edge (1, 2) into a single new vertex, which we'll call 'v₁₂'.\n*   **Structure of G.e:**\n    *   The new vertex v₁₂ is connected to all vertices that were adjacent to either 1 or 2.\n        *   Neighbors of 1: {2, 5}\n        *   Neighbors of 2: {1, 3, 4}\n        *   So, neighbors of v₁₂ are {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The remaining vertices are {3, 4, 5}. The edges between them are unchanged: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5). This means {3, 4, 5} form a triangle (K₃).\n    *   The resulting graph has 4 vertices: {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}. Since v₁₂ is connected to 3, 4, and 5, and {3, 4, 5} form a K₃, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   This means G.e is a complete graph on 4 vertices, **K₄**.\n*   **Computing P(G.e, k):**\n    *   The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    *   For K₄, P(K₄, k) = **k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine and Simplify\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nLet's simplify this expression by factoring out the common terms, which are k(k-1)(k-2).\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n[ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ] = [ (k² - 2k - k + 2) - k + 3 ]\n= [ k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3 ]\n= [ k² - 4k + 5 ]\n\nSo, the factored form of the chromatic polynomial is:\n**P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)**\n\n### Step 5: Final Expansion (Optional but good for standard form)\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand the factored expression.\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)(k-2)) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k(k² - 3k + 2)) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nNow, we multiply the two polynomials:\n= k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\n= (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\n= k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\n\nCombine like terms:\n*   k⁵: 1\n*   k⁴: -4 - 3 = -7\n*   k³: 5 + 12 + 2 = 19\n*   k²: -15 - 8 = -23\n*   k: 10\n\nThe final chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n---\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly identify the graph structure:** Errors in identifying edges or adjacencies will lead to an incorrect result. The graph is two triangles sharing an edge, with a \"handle\" attached.\n2.  **Choose the right method:** While direct counting is possible, it can lead to complex case-by-case analysis. Deletion-Contraction is often more systematic.\n3.  **Edge Selection:** A well-chosen edge for deletion-contraction can significantly simplify the resulting graphs (G-e and G.e).\n4.  **Identify resulting graphs:** Be careful to correctly determine the structure of G-e and G.e. Misinterpreting these graphs (e.g., missing an edge, seeing a K₄ where there isn't one) is a common mistake.\n5.  **Algebraic Accuracy:** The final steps involve factoring and expansion. Careful algebraic manipulation is crucial to avoid errors. Checking the result by testing small values of k (e.g., P(G,0)=0, P(G,1)=0, P(G,2)=0 since the graph has triangles) can help catch mistakes.\n    *   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n    *   P(G, 2) = 2(1)(0)(4 - 8 + 5) = 0. This is correct, as the graph has triangles and cannot be 2-colored.\n    *   P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. This means there are 12 ways to 3-color the graph.\n---\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial expression derived.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
