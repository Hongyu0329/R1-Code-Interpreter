    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot of neuronal activity.\n*   The **x-axis** represents **Time** in seconds (s), ranging from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, ranging from 0 to 128.\n*   Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing event (a spike) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a short time window. Visually, these are the dense, vertical columns of black dots that span a significant portion of the y-axis. We need to locate these bursts and estimate the timestamp at their center.\n\nLet's carefully inspect the graph and estimate the central time point for each major burst:\n*   **Burst 1:** The first dense burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second clear, dense burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 15 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 27 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst within the time window is centered at approximately **t₅ = 49 s**.\n\nWe have identified 5 synchronized bursts with the following timestamps: 2 s, 15 s, 27 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the duration between the central points of two consecutive bursts. We can calculate the intervals from our identified timestamps.\n*   **Interval 1:** t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 2 s = **13 s**\n*   **Interval 2:** t₃ - t₂ = 27 s - 15 s = **12 s**\n*   **Interval 3:** t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 27 s = **9 s**\n*   **Interval 4:** t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\nWe have a total of four inter-burst intervals.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   Sum of intervals = 13 + 12 + 9 + 13 = 47 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = Sum of intervals / Number of intervals = 47 s / 4 = **11.75 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n*   Our calculated average is 11.75 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1. The third digit is 7.\n*   Since the third digit (7) is 5 or greater, we round up the second digit.\n*   Therefore, 11.75 rounded to two significant figures is **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
