    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Tonality**\n*   The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key could be F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   However, the first chord is F minor (F-), and the piece consistently uses chords and resolves in a way that establishes F minor as the tonal center. Therefore, the piece is in F minor.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The melody in the first few measures is highly distinctive. Let's trace the primary melodic notes:\n    *   Measure 1: The melody starts on a high C, then moves down to A♭.\n    *   Measure 2: The melody holds on a G.\n    *   Measure 3: The melody holds on an F.\n    *   Measure 4: The melody moves from E♭ to B♮.\n    *   Measure 5: The melody lands on a C.\n*   The overall contour of the opening phrase is a prominent descent: C - A♭ - G - F - E♭. This descending melodic line is a major characteristic of the tune.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   **A Section:** The chord progression in the first section (A section) is also very unique.\n    *   `F-` (i minor)\n    *   `E-7♭5` (a chromatically descending chord)\n    *   `E♭-6` (continuing the chromatic descent)\n    *   `D♭maj7 | G7`\n    *   `C7` (the V7 chord leading back to F minor)\n    *   This chromatic descent of roots in the harmony (F → E → E♭) is a defining feature.\n*   **B Section (Bridge):** The middle section shows a different harmonic character.\n    *   `D-7♭5 | G7` (a ii-V progression towards C)\n    *   `C7 | F7` (a V-I progression, treating C7 as a tonic before it becomes V of F7)\n    *   `B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭` (a clear ii-V-I progression in A♭ major)\n    *   `G | C7` (a turnaround progression to lead back to the F minor of the A section).\n*   The contrast between the Latin-esque, harmonically static A section and the swinging, modulating B section is a hallmark of this composition style.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\n*   The combination of the key (F minor), the distinct descending melody (C, A♭, G, F, E♭...), and the unique chromatic chord progression in the A section (`F- | E-7b5 | E♭-6...`) strongly points to one specific jazz standard.\n*   These features are the unmistakable signature of the composition **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the influential jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded on his 1956 album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the melody, harmony, and structure presented in the lead sheet, the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
