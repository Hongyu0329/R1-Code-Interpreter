The image displays a fungus, specifically a yeast exhibiting dimorphism. The key morphological features observed are:
1.  **Budding yeast cells (blastoconidia):** Small, oval to round purple structures.
2.  **Pseudohyphae:** Elongated, filamentous structures formed from chains of budding yeast cells that have failed to separate, characterized by distinct constrictions at the septa, giving them a "sausage-link" appearance.

This combination of budding yeasts and pseudohyphae is characteristic of **_Candida_** species, particularly _Candida albicans_.
