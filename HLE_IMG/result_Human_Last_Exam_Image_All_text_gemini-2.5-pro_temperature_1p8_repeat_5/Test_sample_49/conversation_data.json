    "An analysis of the problem is performed step-by-step to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$ which goes to ground. This forms an RC filter. The cutoff frequency of such a filter is determined by the capacitance $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the rest of the circuit as seen from node $a_0$. The angular cutoff frequency is given by $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$. Our main task is to find $R_{th}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to calculate the resistance looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. The input `IN` is at node $c_0$. Assuming the input is a voltage source, we turn it off by connecting node $c_0$ to ground. The capacitor $C$ is disconnected for this calculation.\n\nThe resistance $R_{th}$ seen from $a_0$ is the resistance of the resistor $r$ connecting $a_0$ to $d_1$ plus the equivalent resistance of the rest of the network from node $d_1$ to ground.\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1, \\text{gnd}}$\nwhere $R_{d1, \\text{gnd}}$ is the resistance between node $d_1$ and ground ($c_0$).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit is an infinite resistive ladder. We can analyze it by setting up difference equations for the node voltages. Let $v_{ck}$ and $v_{dk}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ respectively. We have the circuit grounded at $c_0$, so $v_{c0}=0$.\n\nFor any interior node $k$ of the ladder (e.g., $k \\ge 1$), Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) gives:\nAt node $c_k$: $(v_{c,k-1} - v_{ck})/r + (v_{d,k} - v_{ck})/r + (v_{c,k+1} - v_{ck})/r = 0 \\implies v_{c,k+1} - 3v_{ck} + v_{dk} + v_{c,k-1} = 0$.\nAt node $d_k$: $(v_{d,k-1} - v_{dk})/r + (v_{c,k} - v_{dk})/r + (v_{d,k+1} - v_{dk})/r = 0 \\implies v_{d,k+1} - 3v_{dk} + v_{ck} + v_{d,k-1} = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Difference Equations**\nThese coupled equations can be decoupled by considering common-mode ($v_{s,k} = (v_{ck}+v_{dk})/2$) and differential-mode ($v_{a,k} = (v_{ck}-v_{dk})/2$) voltages.\nThe solutions for a semi-infinite ladder (finite voltage as $k \\to \\infty$) are:\n$v_{s,k} = A_s$ (a constant)\n$v_{a,k} = D_a \\lambda^k$, where $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nRecombining these gives the general form of the solution:\n$v_{ck} = v_{s,k} + v_{a,k} = A_s + D_a\\lambda^k$\n$v_{dk} = v_{s,k} - v_{a,k} = A_s - D_a\\lambda^k$\n\n**Step 5: Apply Boundary Conditions to Find $R_{th}$**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ at $a_0$ (so $v_{a0} = V_{test}$) and calculate the current $I_{test}$ drawn from the source. The node $c_0$ is grounded ($v_{c0}=0$).\n\n1.  **Relation between coefficients:** The node voltages must satisfy the KCL equations at the boundaries of the ladder. At node $c_1$, the KCL is $v_{c2} - 3v_{c1} + v_{d1} + v_{c0} = 0$. Since $v_{c0}=0$, we have $v_{c2} - 3v_{c1} + v_{d1} = 0$. Substituting the general solution form gives a relation between the coefficients: $D_a = -A_s$. Let's set $A_s=A$, so $D_a=-A$.\n\n2.  **Specific voltage solutions:** The node voltages for $k \\ge 1$ become:\n    $v_{ck} = A(1 - \\lambda^k)$\n    $v_{dk} = A(1 + \\lambda^k)$\n    (Note that for $k=0$, $v_{c0} = A(1-\\lambda^0)=0$, which is consistent with the ground connection).\n\n3.  **Relate test voltage to coefficient A:** Now consider the KCL at node $d_1$. It connects to $a_0$, $c_1$, and $d_2$.\n    $(v_{a0}-v_{d1})/r + (v_{c1}-v_{d1})/r + (v_{d2}-v_{d1})/r = 0 \\implies v_{a0} = 3v_{d1} - v_{c1} - v_{d2}$.\n    Substituting the expressions for $v_{c1}$, $v_{d1}$, and $v_{d2}$ gives:\n    $v_{a0} = A[3(1+\\lambda) - (1-\\lambda) - (1+\\lambda^2)] = A[1 + 4\\lambda - \\lambda^2]$.\n    Since $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation $x^2-4x+1=0$, we know that $4\\lambda - \\lambda^2 = 1$.\n    Therefore, $v_{a0} = A(1+1) = 2A$. As $v_{a0}=V_{test}$, we have $A=V_{test}/2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate test current:** The current from the test source is given by KCL at node $a_0$: $I_{test} = (v_{a0}-v_{d1})/r$.\n    $v_{d1} = A(1+\\lambda) = \\frac{V_{test}}{2}(1+\\lambda)$.\n    $I_{test} = \\frac{1}{r} [V_{test} - \\frac{V_{test}}{2}(1+\\lambda)] = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} [1 - \\frac{1+\\lambda}{2}] = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\frac{1-\\lambda}{2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate $R_{th}$:** The Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = V_{test}/I_{test}$.\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{test}}{ \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\frac{1-\\lambda}{2} } = \\frac{2r}{1-\\lambda}$.\n    Substituting $\\lambda=2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\n    To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ for the RC circuit is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nSubstituting the derived value of $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$.\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz would be $f_c = \\omega_c/(2\\pi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$. The question usually implies angular frequency unless specified otherwise."
