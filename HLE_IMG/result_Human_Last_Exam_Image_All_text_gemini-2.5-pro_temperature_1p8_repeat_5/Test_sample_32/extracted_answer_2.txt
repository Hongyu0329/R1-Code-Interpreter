The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its longer and distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes its capsule to be emergent and often nodding or asymmetrical.
