    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the parts of a moss sporophyte.**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily visible difference in the sporophyte stage between two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. A moss sporophyte consists of a foot (embedded in the parent plant), a seta (stalk), and a capsule (which contains the spores). For an \"at a glance\" distinction, we should look for differences in the size, shape, or orientation of the visible parts: the seta and the capsule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the characteristics of the *Grimmia montana* sporophyte.**\n*   **Seta (stalk):** In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and, critically, it is **straight**.\n*   **Capsule:** Because the seta is so short, the capsule is typically **immersed** or only slightly emergent. This means it sits down within the upper leaves of the gametophyte plant. It is held erect and is symmetrical. The image provided, showing capsules nestled upright among the leafy stems, is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the characteristics of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte.**\n*   **Seta (stalk):** The key feature is given away by its Latin name. \"*Curvi-*\" means curved, and \"*seta*\" means stalk. Therefore, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly **curved or arcuate seta**.\n*   **Capsule:** The seta in *G. curviseta* is also longer than in *G. montana*. The combination of a longer, curved seta causes the capsule to be **emergent** (raised above the leaves) and often cernuous (nodding) or held to one side, rather than sitting erect and immersed.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the main distinguishing feature.**\nComparing the two species, the most significant and easily observed difference in the sporophyte is the **shape and length of the seta**.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an **immersed, erect capsule**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a **longer, curved seta**, resulting in an **emergent, nodding or asymmetrical capsule**.\n\nThis difference in the seta is the fundamental character that distinguishes the two species' sporophytes at a glance.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Nomenclature as a Clue:** Often, the specific epithet (the second part of a scientific name) provides a hint about a key feature. In this case, \"*curviseta*\" is a direct description of the curved seta.\n*   **Immersion vs. Emergence:** The position of the capsule (immersed vs. emergent) is a direct result of the seta's length. While it's a valid distinguishing feature, the underlying cause is the seta itself.\n*   **Mature Sporophytes:** This distinction is only possible when mature sporophytes are present. Without them, identifying Grimmia species often requires microscopic examination of the leaves.\n*   **Image Analysis:** The provided image shows capsules that are immersed and appear to be on very short, straight stalks (which are hidden by the leaves). This morphology is consistent with *Grimmia montana*, illustrating one half of the comparison.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\nThe main difference lies in the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, causing the capsule to be immersed. *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its longer, distinctly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be emergent and bent to the side or nodding.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its longer and distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes its capsule to be emergent and often nodding or asymmetrical."
