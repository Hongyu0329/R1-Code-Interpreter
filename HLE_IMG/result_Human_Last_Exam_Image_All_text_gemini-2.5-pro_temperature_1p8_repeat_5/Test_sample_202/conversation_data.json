    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and is covered in small holes or bubbles, a texture known as vesicular. The holes are called vesicles and are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled.\n    *   **Inference:** A vesicular, dark-colored (red is common due to iron oxidation) rock is a type of extrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed from lava cooling at or near the Earth's surface.\n    *   **Identification:** This specimen is **Scoria**. It is a type of volcanic rock that is characteristically vesicular.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is very light-colored (white to light grey) and is also extremely vesicular, appearing almost frothy and lightweight.\n    *   **Inference:** Like specimen H, this is an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava. Its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n    *   **Identification:** This specimen is **Pumice**. Pumice is known for its high porosity (so much so that it can often float on water) and light color.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of various angular rock fragments of different colors (grey, white, red) cemented together in a fine-grained, lighter-colored matrix. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Inference:** The angularity of the fragments (clasts) suggests they were not transported far before being deposited and lithified (turned to rock). Given the context of other volcanic rocks, these are likely fragments of volcanic material (ash, lapilli, bombs) ejected during an explosive eruption.\n    *   **Identification:** This specimen is a **Volcanic Breccia** or **Tuff**. Tuff is a rock made from consolidated volcanic ash, and when it contains larger angular fragments, it can be called a tuff breccia or simply a volcanic breccia.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This texture is called phaneritic (coarse-grained). The crystals have different colors, including whitish/translucent (likely quartz), white/pinkish (likely feldspar), and black/dark green (likely biotite mica or hornblende).\n    *   **Inference:** The large crystal size indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, allowing the crystals time to grow large. This happens when magma cools deep beneath the Earth's surface. This is an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   **Identification:** The combination of a coarse-grained texture and a felsic mineral composition (quartz, feldspar) identifies this rock as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing H and J:** Both are vesicular volcanic rocks. The key differentiator is color, which reflects composition. H (Scoria) is darker and denser, indicating a more mafic composition. J (Pumice) is very light in color and density, indicating a felsic composition.\n*   **Distinguishing I and K:** Both are made of multiple components. However, I (Volcanic Breccia) is a clastic rock, made of pre-existing rock *fragments* cemented together. K (Granite) is a crystalline rock, made of interlocking mineral *crystals* that grew in place from cooling magma.\n*   **Clastic vs. Crystalline:** Recognizing the difference between cemented fragments (clasts) and interlocking crystals is crucial for distinguishing between sedimentary/pyroclastic rocks and intrusive/extrusive crystalline igneous rocks.\n\nFinal Identifications:\n*   H: Scoria\n*   I: Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\n*   J: Pumice\n*   K: Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia (or Tuff)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
