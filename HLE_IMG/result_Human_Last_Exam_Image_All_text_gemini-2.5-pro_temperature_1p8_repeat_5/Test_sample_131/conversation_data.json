    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Ring System:**\n    *   The molecule is polycyclic, meaning it consists of multiple fused rings. By counting, we can see there are four rings fused together.\n    *   There are two nitrogen atoms incorporated into the ring system, which is a hallmark of alkaloids.\n    *   There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a six-membered ring. This functional group is called a lactam.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Skeleton:**\n    *   The overall structure is a complex tetracyclic framework built from four six-membered rings. This type of skeleton is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids.\n    *   The parent compound of this family, which lacks the carbonyl group, is called sparteine. The given molecule is an oxidized derivative of sparteine.\n\n3.  **Compare to Known Alkaloids:**\n    *   The structure is compared to known quinolizidine alkaloids, particularly those found in lupin plants (Lupinus species).\n    *   The presence of the lactam group on the sparteine skeleton is the defining feature of the alkaloid named **lupanine**.\n    *   Other related alkaloids like sparteine (lacks the C=O group) or cytisine (has a different, tricyclic pyridone structure) can be ruled out.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The wedges and dashes in the drawing indicate a specific three-dimensional arrangement (stereochemistry) of the atoms. The stereochemistry shown corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer of this alkaloid.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton and the presence of a lactam functional group, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe name of this alkaloid compound is Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
