    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices for the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Molecule for Analysis**\nThe image displays a chemical reaction: `Reactant A + Reactant B -> Product C`. The question asks for a property of \"the depicted molecule\". This refers to the final product molecule, labeled `C` in the reaction scheme. The reactants' structures seem complex and may not directly correspond to a simple synthesis of C, so we will focus solely on the product's structure.\n\nThe product molecule is `N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine`. This structure consists of a `5-fluoropyridin-2-yl` group linked via an amino bridge (`-NH-`) to the 4-position of a `6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine` core.\n\nThe molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₁FN₅. This is derived by counting the atoms:\n*   `5-fluoropyridin-2-yl` part: C₅H₃FN\n*   `NH` linker: H\n*   `6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl` core: C₆H₆N₃ (The parent core C₆H₇N₃ has one H removed from C4 for linking).\n*   Total: C₁₁H₁₀FN₅. Let me recheck the hydrogens. Pyridinyl (3H), Linker (1H), Core (C2-H, N7-H, C6-H₂, C5-H₂ -> 6H). Total = 3+1+6=10. So C₁₁H₁₀FN₅.\n*   The total number of atoms in the molecule, including hydrogens, is 11 (C) + 10 (H) + 1 (F) + 5 (N) = 27 atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Check the Crippen logP > 1 Condition**\nThe question specifies that the molecule has a Crippen logP > 1. Without computational tools, we must assume this condition is met for the product molecule. This condition would be used to select the correct molecule if there were ambiguities, but here there is only one product.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**\nThe Eccentric Connectivity Index (`ξ^c`) is a topological index calculated for a molecular graph. The formula is:\n`ξ^c = Σ [deg(i) * ecc(i)]`\nwhere the sum is over all atoms `i` in the molecule (including hydrogens as specified).\n*   `deg(i)` is the degree of atom `i` (number of chemical bonds connected to it).\n*   `ecc(i)` is the eccentricity of atom `i`, which is the maximum shortest path distance (number of bonds) from atom `i` to any other atom `j` in the graph. `ecc(i) = max_j {d(i, j)}`.\n\n**Step 4: Build the Molecular Graph and Calculate `deg(i)` and `ecc(i)` for each atom**\nThe molecular graph has 27 vertices. We will systematically determine the degree and eccentricity for each atom. For convenience, we label the heavy atoms first and then the hydrogen atoms. A key simplification is that for a terminal atom `X` (like H or F) attached to a parent atom `P`, its eccentricity is `ecc(X) = 1 + ecc(P)`.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the calculation for each atom.\n\n**A.

Re-summing carefully:\nSum Heavy = 27+24+24+16+27+21+10(F)+15+18+14+24+16+24+21+24+36+36 = 377\nSum H = 9+9+10+6+9+9+20+20 = 92\nTotal = 377+92 = 469. This is correct.\n\n*   Sum of `deg*ecc` for heavy atoms: **377**\n*   Sum of `deg*ecc` for hydrogen atoms: **92**\n*   **Total Sum (ξ^c)** = 377 + 92 = **469**\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the eccentric connectivity indices for all 27 atoms in the molecule.\n\nFinal Sum = 469.\n\n<<<469>>>"
