    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions.**\n*   **Reactants:** The starting materials are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), a cyclic aromatic compound with 6 π electrons, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), a cyclic alkene with 2 π electrons.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This is a critical piece of information, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for photochemical versus thermal reactions.\n*   **Product:** The product is a complex tricyclic molecule. Although there appears to be a discrepancy in the atom count between the reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₆ = C₁₀H₆F₆) and the drawn product skeleton (C₈), we can analyze the structural changes to deduce the reaction types. The product's core structure consists of three fused four-membered rings. This structure strongly suggests the involvement of reactions that form four-membered rings.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Plausible Pericyclic Reactions based on Structural Changes.**\nThe transformation from an aromatic six-membered ring and a four-membered ring with a double bond into a system of three fused four-membered rings requires significant skeletal rearrangement. This can be achieved through a sequence of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Mechanistic Pathway.**\nA logical and chemically sound pathway involves two sequential pericyclic reactions. Let's call this Pathway A.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction of Hexafluorobenzene.**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene can undergo a valence isomerization under UV light to form its isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (systematic name: hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   This transformation can be classified as a **4π electrocyclic reaction**. The π system of benzene can be considered to undergo a ring closure between opposite corners (C1 and C4). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a 4n π-electron system (here n=1, so 4π), the ring closure is photochemically allowed via a conrotatory process.\n    *   This first step transforms the six-membered ring into a bicyclic system containing two fused four-membered rings.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Photochemical Cycloaddition.**\n    *   The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is highly strained and contains two reactive double bonds. It can react with the double bond of cyclobutene.\n    *   The formation of a new four-membered ring by combining two double bonds is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** (often written as [2+2] cycloaddition).\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition (where both components react on the same face) is symmetry-allowed under photochemical conditions.\n    *   This reaction fuses the cyclobutene molecule to the Dewar benzene structure, creating the final tricyclic skeleton composed of three fused four-membered rings.\n\n**Step 4: Consider an Alternative Pathway.**\nAn alternative pathway (Pathway B) could involve the reactions happening in the reverse order.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition.** Hexafluorobenzene reacts with cyclobutene in a [2+2] cycloaddition to form a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative. This is a **cycloaddition reaction**.\n*   **Reaction 2: Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction.** The resulting intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety (a 4π system), which can then undergo an intramolecular photochemical **electrocyclic reaction** (ring closure) to form the final tricyclic product.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Types of Reactions.**\nBoth plausible pathways involve the same two types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order. The question asks for the kinds of reactions involved.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically, a 4π electrocyclization).\n2.  A **cycloaddition reaction** (specifically, a [2+2] cycloaddition).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The photochemical condition (`hv`) is key to determining the allowed reaction pathways.\n*   The discrepancy in the number of atoms in the drawing should be regarded as a likely error in the problem's illustration, and the focus should remain on the types of chemical transformations shown.\n*   Valence isomerization of benzene to Dewar benzene is a classic example of a photochemical electrocyclic reaction.\n*   The formation of a cyclobutane ring from two alkene units is a classic [2+2] cycloaddition, which is allowed photochemically.\n\n<<<A [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition."
