    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's subject and style:**\n    *   The image displays a circular relief sculpture, also known as a roundel or tondo.\n    *   The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground. This is often referred to as the \"Sacrament of the Altar\".\n    *   At the bottom of the roundel, there is a partially visible inscription that reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\", an archaic spelling of \"Sacramenti de l'autel,\" which translates from Italian/Old French to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject matter.\n    *   The style is characteristic of the Early Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century. Key features include the naturalistic yet idealized figures, the graceful flow of the drapery, and the use of perspective and varying depths of relief to create a sense of space. The very low relief (rilievo schiacciato) seen in the background figures is a technique perfected by artists of this period.\n\n2.  **Identify potential artists:**\n    *   The combination of technical skill, delicate execution, and emotional tenderness points towards the work of the leading Florentine sculptors of the mid-15th century. Artists known for this style include Donatello, Luca della Robbia, and their accomplished followers like Desiderio da Settignano and Benedetto da Maiano.\n    *   The particularly fine and sensitive carving, especially in the faces and hair, is a strong hallmark of Desiderio da Settignano (c. 1430â€“1464). His work is known for its refinement and sweet delicacy.\n\n3.  **Cross-reference the artwork with known works:**\n    *   Searching for \"Sacrament of the Altar relief sculpture\" along with the names of these artists leads to a specific, well-known commission.\n    *   This relief is documented as a detail from the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* (or *Altarpiece of the Sacrament*) created for the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence.\n    *   Art historical sources universally attribute this major work, completed around 1461, to the sculptor Desiderio da Settignano. While the altarpiece has been altered and moved from its original location within the church, this relief is recognized as an original part of the composition by Desiderio.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   Comparing the provided image with authenticated photographs of the details of Desiderio da Settignano's *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* in San Lorenzo confirms that this is the same work. The stylistic features perfectly match his known sculptures, such as the *Marsuppini Tomb* in Santa Croce, Florence.\n\nTherefore, the author of this detail of the altarpiece is Desiderio da Settignano.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
