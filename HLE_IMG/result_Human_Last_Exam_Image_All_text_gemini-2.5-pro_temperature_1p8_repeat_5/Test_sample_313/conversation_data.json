    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the First Clue and the Image**\n\n*   The first clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. A younger man with a beard is receiving a trophy from an older man.\n*   By searching for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, we can identify the event. The 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. On that night, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   As a prolific goal scorer in ice hockey, Nikita Kucherov is strongly associated with the \"hat trick\" â€“ scoring three goals in a single game. When a player scores a hat trick, fans traditionally throw hats onto the ice. This establishes a strong connection between the pictured individual and the concept of \"hats.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Second Clue**\n\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a specific historical industrial process. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the process of \"carroting,\" which was part of manufacturing felt from animal fur. This felt was then used to make hats.\n*   The process was extremely toxic and caused mercury poisoning in the workers, who were known as hatters. This led to neurological damage, giving rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Due to its toxicity, this mercury-based process for making felt has been almost entirely abandoned.\n*   Therefore, the \"X Y\" that has ceased to be used due to mercury salts is the **Felt Hat**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Clues and Determine X Y**\n\n*   From Step 1, we linked the person in the picture (Nikita Kucherov) to the concept of \"hats\" via the hockey hat trick.\n*   From Step 2, we identified the object made with toxic mercury salts as a \"Felt Hat.\"\n*   The puzzle uses \"X Y\" to refer to both. The first \"X Y\" is the concept of a hat as represented by the hockey player known for hat tricks. The \"another X Y\" is the physical object, the felt hat.\n*   Therefore, the two-word phrase \"X Y\" that fits both clues is **Felt Hat**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date in the clue (June 20) is off by one day from the actual event date (June 19), which is a minor discrepancy common in such puzzles.\n*   The connection in the first clue is indirect. The image doesn't show a literal felt hat, but a person who strongly represents the idea of \"hats\" in the context of their profession.\n*   The phrasing \"Another X Y\" is key, indicating two different meanings or instances of the same term.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis: X Y is Felt Hat.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
