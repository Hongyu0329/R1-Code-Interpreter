    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the basic elements of the sheet music:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#). This indicates the key is E major or its relative minor, C# minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), meaning there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (♩ = 80), which corresponds to a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Examine the musical content of the opening (Measures 1-2):**\n    *   The piece begins softly, marked with `p` (piano).\n    *   The right-hand melody starts on E5 and moves stepwise: E-F#-G#-A-B-A-G#-F#. This is the very famous and recognizable main theme of Frédéric Chopin's **Étude in E major, Op. 10, No. 3**. This piece is often nicknamed \"Tristesse\" (French for \"sadness\").\n    *   The left-hand provides a quiet, chordal accompaniment. The harmony supports the E major key.\n\n3.  **Analyze the subsequent sections (Measures 3 onwards):**\n    *   At measure 3, there is a dramatic and abrupt shift. The dynamic marking changes to `f` (forte), indicating a loud volume.\n    *   The texture transforms completely. Instead of a gentle melody, both hands play rapid, continuous sixteenth notes. This section is highly virtuosic and technically demanding. The left hand plays powerful broken chords and octaves, while the right hand plays fast passages.\n    *   This sudden explosion of technical difficulty is not part of Chopin's original composition. While the original \"Tristesse\" Étude has a more agitated middle section, it is musically very different from the passage shown here.\n\n4.  **Identify the source of this specific arrangement:**\n    *   This unique arrangement, which juxtaposes the serene opening of Chopin's \"Tristesse\" with a sudden, violent, and virtuosic outburst, is a key musical piece in the Japanese anime series **\"Your Lie in April\" (四月は君の嘘, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso)**.\n    *   In the anime, this piece is performed by the protagonist, Kousei Arima, during a competition. The arrangement reflects his intense emotional turmoil and a departure from a strict interpretation of the score. Fans often refer to this version by names like \"Kousei's Tristesse\" or sometimes combine it with the name of another virtuosic piece, calling it \"La Campanella 'Tristesse'\", due to its Lisztian difficulty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music displays the opening of Chopin's \"Étude Op. 10, No. 3\" followed by a highly dramatic and virtuosic arrangement of the same piece. This specific version is famously featured in the anime \"Your Lie in April\".\n\n<<<\"Tristesse\" (Chopin, Étude Op. 10, No. 3) as arranged in the anime \"Your Lie in April\".>>>"
