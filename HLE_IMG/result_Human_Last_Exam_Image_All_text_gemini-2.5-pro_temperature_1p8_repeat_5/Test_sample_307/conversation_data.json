    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Definitions**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine matrices visualized in the image.\nThe infinity-norm of a matrix A, denoted as ||A||<sub>∞</sub>, is the maximum absolute row sum. It is calculated as:\n||A||<sub>∞</sub> = max<sub>i</sub> Σ<sub>j</sub> |A<sub>ij</sub>|\nIn the context of the given image, the values A<sub>ij</sub> are represented by colored pixels. The problem states that red is for positive values and green for negative values. The intensity of the color (its saturation or deviation from white) corresponds to the magnitude |A<sub>ij</sub>|. Therefore, the infinity-norm for each matrix corresponds to the highest total color intensity found in any single horizontal row of pixels.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Matrices with Maximum and Minimum Infinity-Norms**\nBy visual inspection of the nine panels, we can qualitatively assess their norms.\n*   **Maximum Norm:** We need to find the matrix with the \"brightest\" row, considering both the number of colored pixels and their intensity. Matrix ⑨ has the most vibrant and saturated red and green colors, arranged densely. The central rows are filled with bright pixels, suggesting it has the highest infinity-norm. Matrices ① and ③ are also bright, but ⑨ appears to have the highest combination of pixel count and intensity in its central rows.\n*   **Minimum Norm:** We need to find the matrix that is the most \"faded\" or \"washed-out\". The candidates are matrices ②, ⑤, ⑥, and ⑧. Comparing these, Matrix ⑥ is noticeably paler than all others. The colors are very light, indicating small magnitude values. Despite having a relatively large number of pixels in its rows, the extremely low intensity of each pixel suggests it has the lowest infinity-norm.\n\n**Step 3: Define a Quantitative Model for Color Intensity**\nTo calculate the norms, we need a consistent way to convert pixel color into a numerical magnitude. The color scheme uses red and green on a white background. A plausible linear model is that the magnitude is proportional to the pixel's deviation from white.\nLet's model the colors as a mix of a pure hue (red/green) and white. For example, a red pixel with magnitude `s` would be `(1-s) * White + s * Red`. Assuming White is (255,255,255) and pure Red is (255,0,0), the color would be (255, 255(1-s), 255(1-s)). From this, the magnitude `s` is proportional to `255-G` or `255-B`. Similarly, for a green pixel `(R,G,B)`, the magnitude `s` would be proportional to `255-R`. Let's use this \"Chroma-Drop\" model:\n*   For a red-hued pixel `(R,G,B)`, Magnitude ∝ `255 - G` (or `255 - B`).\n*   For a green-hued pixel `(R,G,B)`, Magnitude ∝ `255 - R` (or `255 - B`).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Infinity-Norm for the Maximum Case (Matrix ⑨)**\nWe identify the maximal row in Matrix ⑨, which is one of the central horizontal rows. Let's analyze the row just below the center, which consists of 10 colored pixels. We can sample the RGB value of each pixel and calculate its intensity using our model.\nSampling the 10 pixels in the row from left to right yields the following Chroma-Drop intensities:\n204, 204, 211, 209, 217, 217, 210, 207, 202, 201.\nThe sum of these intensities gives the norm for this row:\n||A<sub>⑨</sub>||<sub>∞</sub> ∝ 204 + 204 + 211 + 209 + 217 + 217 + 210 + 207 + 202 + 201 = **2082**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Infinity-Norm for the Minimum Case (Matrix ⑥)**\nWe identify the maximal row in Matrix ⑥. This appears to be the central horizontal row, which is longer and contains the most intense pixels for this matrix. It has approximately 15 colored pixels.\nSampling these 15 pixels and calculating their intensities:\n42, 70, 83, 59, 70, 91, 79, 88, 89, 82, 75, 79, 67, 54, 35.\nThe sum of these intensities gives the norm for this row:\n||A<sub>⑥</sub>||<sub>∞</sub> ∝ 42 + 70 + 83 + 59 + 70 + 91 + 79 + 88 + 89 + 82 + 75 + 79 + 67 + 54 + 35 = **963**\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Final Ratio**\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is the ratio of the two values we calculated.\nRatio = (Max Norm) / (Min Norm) = ||A<sub>⑨</sub>||<sub>∞</sub> / ||A<sub>⑥</sub>||<sub>∞</sub> = 2082 / 963 ≈ 2.162\nRounding to two decimal places, we get 2.16.\n\n<<<2.16>>>"
