    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the given tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry is a property a shape or pattern has when it looks the same after being rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree turn. An n-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern is invariant under a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Components of the Tiling**\nThe image shows a periodic tiling composed of three types of polygons:\n1.  Dark blue regular hexagons.\n2.  Light yellow (tan) squares.\n3.  Orange rhombi.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry of the entire tiling, we need to find points (centers of rotation) around which we can rotate the whole pattern and have it map onto itself. The most likely candidates for these centers are the centers of the symmetrical shapes within the tiling.\n\n**Step 4: Test Different Centers of Rotation**\n*   **Center of a Hexagon:** Let's consider the center of one of the dark blue hexagons. A regular hexagon by itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, etc.). We must check if the surrounding pattern also respects this symmetry. Each hexagon is surrounded by six squares and six rhombi. If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° around the center of a hexagon, the central hexagon maps onto itself. Crucially, each of the surrounding squares moves exactly into the position previously occupied by an identical square, and each rhombus moves into the position of an identical rhombus. This alignment holds true for the entire pattern. Therefore, the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry** about the center of each hexagon.\n\n*   **Center of a Square:** Now let's consider the center of a light yellow square. A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°). If we rotate the tiling by 90° about the center of a square, the square maps onto itself. The surrounding shapes (hexagons and rhombi) also perfectly map onto identical shapes in the new positions. Thus, the tiling also possesses points of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Other Centers:** The pattern also has centers of 2-fold and 3-fold rotation at various vertices and edge midpoints. For example, the vertex where two hexagons and one square meet is a center of 3-fold rotation.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nWhen asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a periodic pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry present. We have found centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest of these is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling remains unchanged when rotated by 60° (360°/6) around the center of any dark blue hexagon. Since 6 is the highest order of rotational symmetry found in the pattern, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
