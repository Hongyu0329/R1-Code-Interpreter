    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the venue in the image.** The first step is to recognize the building where the photo was taken. The building has very distinctive architectural features: red brickwork, with some in a herringbone pattern; a tan stucco section with a curved roofline; a prominent decorative element resembling a quatrefoil; and a balcony with a white, crisscross \"X\" pattern railing. A search for these architectural details helps identify the building.\n\n2.  **Confirm the venue's identity.** A search using terms like \"brick theater with quatrefoil medallion\" or a reverse image search points to the **Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. Comparing images of this theater online confirms that it is an exact match for the building in the photograph. The semi-truck parked outside is a strong indicator that a touring production, such as a musical artist, is at the venue.\n\n3.  **Find the venue's event schedule for the specified date.** The question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on October 12, 2023. The next step is to search for the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox's event calendar for that specific date.\n\n4.  **Retrieve the performer's name.** By searching for \"Martin Woldson Theater events October 12 2023\" or by looking through the past events section on the theater's official website, we can find the schedule. The official calendar and other concert listing sites (like Bandsintown) show that the performer on Thursday, October 12, 2023, at the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox was the blues musician Keb' Mo'.\n\n5.  **Final verification.** Checking Keb' Mo's official 2023 tour dates confirms a concert in Spokane, WA, on October 12, 2023, solidifying the answer.\n\nTherefore, the musical artist who played at this venue on the specified date was Keb' Mo'.\n\n<<<Keb' Mo'>>>"
