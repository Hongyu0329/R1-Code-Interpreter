def identify_plant_genus():
    """
    This function identifies the genus of the plant shown in the image based on its distinct morphology.

    1.  **Observe Key Features:** The plant is a bryophyte with shoots that have a unique, tightly coiled or "braided" appearance. The leaves are arranged in a close spiral around the stem, resembling a screw thread.

    2.  **Compare with Known Bryophytes:** This highly characteristic structure is a well-known feature of the leafy liverwort genus Herbertus. Other genera may appear plaited but typically do not exhibit such a perfect, tight, cylindrical coil.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The genus is identified as Herbertus.
