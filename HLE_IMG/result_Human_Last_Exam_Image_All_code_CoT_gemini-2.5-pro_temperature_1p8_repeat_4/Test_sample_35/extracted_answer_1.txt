The protein S100B binds to the V, C1, and C2 domains of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products). It could be used as a prognostic marker because its downstream signaling directly leads to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, allowing its levels to predict the severity and progression of the disease.
