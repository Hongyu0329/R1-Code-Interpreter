    "This task requires a clinical interpretation of an ECG, which is beyond the scope of a coding assistant. However, I can provide a Python script that systematically analyzes the features of the ECG according to standard cardiological principles to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThis script mimics the thought process of a clinician analyzing an ECG.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Rhythm\")\n    print(\"The distance between consecutive QRS complexes (R-R interval) is highly variable.\")\n    print(\"This indicates an 'irregularly irregular' rhythm, which is a hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the Heart Rate\")\n    print(\"The rhythm is very fast (tachycardic). Some R-R intervals are only 1.5 large squares apart.\")\n    print(\"Rate calculation: 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute.\")\n    print(\"This confirms a rapid ventricular response.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the QRS Complexes\")\n    print(\"The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares).\")\n    print(\"Additionally, the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat.\")\n    print(\"There appears to be a slurred upstroke at the beginning of the QRS complexes, known as a delta wave.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Synthesize the Findings\")\n    print(\"We have three key features:\")\n    print(\"  1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the diagnosis according to this ECG image?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
