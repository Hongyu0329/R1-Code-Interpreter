    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the curvature of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is **straight**, holding the capsule erect and exserted (above the leaves).\n\nIn contrast, ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by an **arcuate**, or curved, seta. This gives the capsule a bent or nodding appearance.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
