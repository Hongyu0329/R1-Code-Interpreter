    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 晏廬清賞 (yàn lú qīng shǎng).\n\nIn simplified Chinese, they are written as **晏庐清赏**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the characters:\n*   **Top Right: 晏 (yàn)** - This character means peaceful, quiet, or late.\n*   **Top Left: 廬 (simplified: 庐, lú)** - This character means hut, cottage, or studio.\n*   **Bottom Right: 清 (qīng)** - This character means clear, pure, or quiet.\n*   **Bottom Left: 賞 (simplified: 赏, shǎng)** - This character means to enjoy, appreciate, or admire.\n\nThe entire phrase, **晏庐清赏 (Yàn Lú Qīng Shǎng)**, can be translated as \"Pure appreciation in the Yan Studio\" or \"Quietly enjoying in a peaceful cottage.\" This type of inscription is common for a \"leisure seal\" (闲印), used by scholars and artists to stamp their works, expressing a particular sentiment or the name of their studio.\n\nNotably, a well-known collector of paintings and seals from the Republic of China period, Ge Changying (葛昌楹), used \"晏庐\" (Yàn Lú) as his studio name. The famous artist Wu Changshuo is known to have carved a seal with the characters \"晏庐\" in 1914. The term \"清赏\" (qīng shǎng), meaning to view and appreciate in a leisurely manner, is also frequently found in art-related contexts.\n\n<<<晏庐清赏>>>"
