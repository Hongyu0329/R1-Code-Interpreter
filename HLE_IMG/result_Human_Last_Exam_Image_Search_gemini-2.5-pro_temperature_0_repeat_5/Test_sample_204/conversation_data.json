    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and knowledge of mineralogy, the minerals can be identified and ordered by the increasing complexity of their silicate structures. The complexity of silicate minerals is determined by how the fundamental building blocks, silica tetrahedra (SiO₄), are linked together.\n\n### Specimen Identification\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen shows a characteristic olive-green color and a granular habit, which are typical for olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning it has the simplest silicate structure, consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by iron and magnesium ions.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene**\n    This is a dark, prismatic crystal. Its short, stout crystal habit is common for pyroxenes like augite. Pyroxenes are inosilicates, specifically single-chain silicates, where tetrahedra link to form a chain by sharing two oxygen atoms each. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica (likely Chlorite or another green mica)**\n    This mineral is green and displays a flaky, sheet-like appearance, which is characteristic of the mica group of minerals. Micas are phyllosilicates, or sheet silicates. In this structure, each tetrahedron shares three of its oxygen atoms to form continuous sheets. This represents a higher degree of polymerization than the single chains of pyroxenes. The green color suggests it could be a mineral from the chlorite group.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This translucent, brownish crystal exhibits the typical hexagonal prism shape of quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate. In this structure, every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and polymerized silicate structure.\n\n### Order of Increasing Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nThe order from the simplest to the most complex silicate structure is based on the degree of polymerization of the silica tetrahedra:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra)**\n2.  **Inosilicates (Single Chain)**\n3.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheets)**\n4.  **Tectosilicates (Framework)**\n\nFollowing this classification, the correct order for the specimens is:\n\n**C (Olivine) → A (Pyroxene) → B (Mica) → D (Quartz)**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
