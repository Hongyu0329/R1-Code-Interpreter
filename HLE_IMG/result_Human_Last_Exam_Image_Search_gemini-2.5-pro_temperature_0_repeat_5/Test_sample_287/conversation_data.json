    "Based on the architectural landmarks visible, the image was taken in **Seoul, South Korea**.\n\nThe prominent buildings in the photograph are located in the Jongno District, a central business hub of the city. The two towers visible to the right of the center are the **Gran Seoul** towers. The lighter-colored building on the left is the **Centropolis**, which consists of two 26-story office towers.\n\nThese buildings are situated in close proximity to each other in the Jongno-gu area. The Centropolis building is noted for being \"sandwiched between other landmark skyscrapers in the crowded Jongno downtown district -- such as Jongno Tower and Gran Seoul\". The exterior of the Centropolis features an articulated porcelain panel system that pays homage to traditional Korean stone walls. Gran Seoul is a major commercial building complex that includes office space and is located near Jonggak subway station.\n\n<<<Seoul, South Korea>>>"
