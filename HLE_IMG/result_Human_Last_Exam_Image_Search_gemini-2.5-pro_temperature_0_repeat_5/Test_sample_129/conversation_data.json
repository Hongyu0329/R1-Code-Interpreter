    "Based on a visual comparison of the provided image with structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the protein is the **N-terminal region of the human ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)**.\n\nThe image corresponds to the crystal structure of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-606) of hRyR2, which is identified by the PDB code 4JKQ. This region of the protein is crucial as it is a target for numerous mutations that can cause arrhythmias. The structure reveals a complex arrangement of three domains (A, B, and C) that are held together by a network of interactions. The light blue portion represents an N-terminal extension, a common feature in many proteins that can have various functional roles.\n\n<<<N-terminal region of the human ryanodine receptor 2>>>"
