    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. This auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like noise. If the interrupting noise is loud enough to have masked the original sound had it continued, the human brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted tone.\n\nThis perceptual restoration is a common and typically unconscious process that demonstrates the brain's ability to create coherent and continuous perceptual experiences from fragmented sensory information. The effect is so compelling that listeners may not realize that a portion of the sound was physically absent.\n\nA well-known specific example of this illusion involving speech is the **phonemic restoration effect**, where a missing speech sound (a phoneme) in a word is replaced by a non-speech sound, yet listeners perceive the word as whole. The image provided, showing a pure tone interrupted by noise, is a classic example of the more general auditory continuity illusion. This process is considered a fundamental aspect of auditory scene analysis, helping us follow conversations in noisy environments or perceive a melody through intermittent sounds.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
