    "Yes, there is an animal in this image. Based on the distinct honeycomb-like pattern on its skin, it is a moray eel.\n\nThe scientific name for the species commonly known as the honeycomb moray (or laced moray) is *Gymnothorax favagineus*. Another species also called the honeycomb moray is *Muraena melanotis*. Both have a characteristic pattern of dark, polygonal spots that give them a honeycomb appearance. This pattern can vary, with morays in clearer waters having fewer spots than those in more turbid environments. These eels are a type of fish, despite their serpentine appearance, and can grow to be quite large.\n\n<<<Gymnothorax favagineus or Muraena melanotis>>>"
