    "This sheet music is from the piece \"To Zanarkand,\" the iconic opening theme from the video game *Final Fantasy X*. The composer is Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nThe piece is famous for its gentle, melancholic piano introduction that builds into a powerful and emotional main theme. The specific arrangement shown, with its fast arpeggios and complex passages, is recognizable from the *Piano Collections Final Fantasy X* album. Numerous arrangements for solo piano and other instruments are widely available.\n\n<<<To Zanarkand>>>"
