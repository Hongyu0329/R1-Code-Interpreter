    "The piece of sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of the opera *Wozzeck* by Alban Berg.\n\nThis can be identified by several key features in the score:\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large orchestra typical of early 20th-century works, including parts for \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten/2 large flutes), \"engl. Horn\" (English horn), and a full string section.\n*   **German Markings:** The musical directions and instrument names are in German. The specific instruction \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the curtain rises at the first measure, signifying the beginning of an act.\n*   **Musical Style:** The music is atonal, a hallmark of Alban Berg and the Second Viennese School. The complex, chromatic melody and dense harmonies are characteristic of his expressionistic style.\n*   **Act Structure:** The opera *Wozzeck* is in three acts. A search for the score confirms that this music is indeed the beginning of Act II. The first scene of the second act takes place in Marie's room.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
