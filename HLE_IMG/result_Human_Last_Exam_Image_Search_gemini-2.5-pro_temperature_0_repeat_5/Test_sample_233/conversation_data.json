    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified by the ID **Sö 281**.\n\nThis runestone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled around 1036-1041.\n\nThe fragment shown in the image is a distinctive close-up of the runes, which are carved within a grid pattern. Specifically, the image shows the runes that spell out Ingvar's name (`ikuari`). The runestone Sö 281 was discovered in the Strängnäs Cathedral, where it had been repurposed as a doorstep before being embedded in the church wall in 1863.\n\nThe inscription on this fragmented stone mentions Ingvar and his journey to Serkland (the Saracen lands). Although fragmented, it is a significant historical monument providing evidence for this fateful expedition.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
