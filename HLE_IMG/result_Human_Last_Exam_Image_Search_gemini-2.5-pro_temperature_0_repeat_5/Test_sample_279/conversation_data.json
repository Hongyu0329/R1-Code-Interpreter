    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to a **Class I** caries classification according to the G.V. Black classification system.\n\nThe image displays a posterior tooth (a molar) with a lesion located on the occlusal (chewing) surface, specifically in the pits and fissures. This location is the defining characteristic of a Class I cavity.\n\nThe lesion appears as decay surrounding an existing amalgam filling, which is known as recurrent or secondary caries. However, the classification according to G.V. Black is based on the anatomical location of the lesion, not whether it is a primary or recurrent decay. Therefore, since the decay is on the occlusal surface, it is classified as Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
