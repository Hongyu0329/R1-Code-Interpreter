    "The black organism in the photo is a species of slime mold, most likely *Hemitrichia calyculata*, also known as the Push Pin Slime Mold.\n\nThese tiny organisms are not actually fungi but belong to the kingdom Amoebozoa. They are characterized by their small, stalked fruiting bodies which resemble tiny pins. *Hemitrichia calyculata* is commonly found in moist, shaded environments, growing on decaying organic matter like logs and stumps. In the photo, it is seen growing on a type of bracket fungus, which is a common habitat.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like fungus it is growing on is likely a species of *Trametes*, such as *Trametes versicolor*, commonly known as Turkey Tail. This fungus is a widespread decomposer of dead wood. It is also possible that the black organism is a parasitic fungus called *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*, or fairy pin, which specifically grows on bracket fungi like *Trichaptum biforme* and sometimes *Trametes versicolor*. However, the morphology in the photo more closely resembles the golden, poofy \"hairdo\" of a mature *Hemitrichia calyculata* after its outer layer has worn away to expose the spore-bearing fibers.\n\n<<<Hemitrichia calyculata>>>"
