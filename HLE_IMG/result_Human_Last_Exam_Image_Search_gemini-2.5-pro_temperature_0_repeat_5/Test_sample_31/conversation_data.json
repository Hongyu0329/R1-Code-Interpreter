    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, also known as the s-invariant, for this knot is -6.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is an alternating knot with 8 crossings. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot's signature. The signature of the 8₁₉ knot is -6, and therefore its Rasmussen invariant is also -6.\n\nIt is worth noting that there is another famous knot, the Conway knot (11n34), which has a Rasmussen invariant of 0. This was a significant finding in Lisa Piccirillo's 2020 proof that the Conway knot is not a slice knot.\n\n<<<8₁₉, -6>>>"
