The specific form in the image corresponds to its depiction around 2500 BCE, which falls within the third millennium. For instance, a wall plaque from Ur, dated to this period, shows a similar representation for a temple.\n\nThe Sumerian term √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), literally meaning \"big house,\" was used for a palace, which served as the center of the city's administration.\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the cuneiform sign in its third-millennium form is \"Home\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
