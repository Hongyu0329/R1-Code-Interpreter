    "Based on the recurring annual spikes in the Google Trends data, the country in question is the **United States**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the three events represented by the colored lines:\n*   **Red Line:** The prominent spike in late January 2020, with smaller recurring peaks around the same time in subsequent years, corresponds to the death of basketball superstar **Kobe Bryant** on January 26, 2020. His death was a major news event that generated significant search interest, with anniversaries prompting renewed attention.\n*   **Yellow Line:** The massive spike in late May and June of 2020, followed by significant annual peaks, represents the protests and social justice movement that followed the murder of **George Floyd** on May 25, 2020. This event triggered widespread protests and a national conversation on race and police brutality, with anniversaries being widely commemorated.\n*   **Blue Line:** The consistent, smaller spikes in mid-June of each year align with **Juneteenth** (June 19th). This holiday, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, has gained increasing national recognition and was officially made a federal holiday in 2021, leading to more consistent search interest.\n\nA historian would recognize these three events as significant moments in recent American history, each prompting annual public reflection and discussion, which is accurately reflected in the provided search trend data.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
