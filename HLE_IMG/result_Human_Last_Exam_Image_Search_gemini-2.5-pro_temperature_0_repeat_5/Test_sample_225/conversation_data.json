    "The reaction in question involves a substituted dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium cation treated with hydrochloric acid under reflux for 12 hours.\n\nThe starting material is 8,10,12-trimethoxydibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium, a type of aryl methyl ether. The reaction conditions are 0.1 M HCl, reflux, and a duration of 12 hours. These conditions point towards an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether groups.\n\nIn this reaction, the oxygen atom of each methoxy group (-OCH₃) is protonated by the strong acid (HCl). This makes the attached methyl group susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the chloride ion (Cl⁻) from HCl. This type of reaction is a standard method for cleaving ethers, particularly aryl methyl ethers, although it often requires strong acids like HBr or HI. However, the prolonged heating under reflux (boiling the solution) for 12 hours provides the necessary energy to drive the reaction forward even with the less reactive HCl.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution mechanism (S<sub>N</sub>2) on the methyl group. For each of the three methoxy groups, the following steps occur:\n1.  Protonation of the ether oxygen by H⁺.\n2.  Attack of the chloride ion (Cl⁻) on the carbon of the methyl group.\n3.  Cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the aromatic ring and chloromethane (CH₃Cl) as a byproduct.\n\nSince there are three methoxy groups in the starting material, this process will occur three times, converting all methoxy groups into hydroxyl groups.\n\nTherefore, compound A is the corresponding trihydroxy derivative of the starting cation.\n\n**Compound A:** 8,10,12-trihydroxydibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium\n\nBelow is the chemical structure of Compound A.\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/26lqg4p.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br>\n\n<<<\nThe product, Compound A, is **8,10,12-trihydroxydibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium**.
