    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens, the following identifications can be made:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles, which is characteristic of scoria. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano.\n\n*   **I: Breccia** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture is distinctive of breccia, a clastic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation of rock fragments, often near the site of a landslide or fault zone.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This specimen is light-colored and has a frothy, vesicular texture. These are key features of pumice, a volcanic rock that forms from gas-rich, viscous lava. Its low density, due to the high number of vesicles, often allows it to float in water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock that forms from the slow crystallization of magma. Pegmatites are often found in dikes or lenses and can contain large crystals of minerals like feldspar, quartz, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
