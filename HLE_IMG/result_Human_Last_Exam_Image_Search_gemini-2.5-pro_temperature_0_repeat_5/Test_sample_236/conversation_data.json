    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the large milkweed bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae. It is characterized by its striking orange or reddish-orange and black coloring. The pattern on its back includes a black band across the middle and black patches on the front and back of its wings.\n\nLarge milkweed bugs primarily feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants. Their bright coloration serves as a warning to predators that they are unpalatable due to the toxic chemicals they sequester from the milkweed they consume. These bugs are found throughout North America, from Southern Canada down to Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
