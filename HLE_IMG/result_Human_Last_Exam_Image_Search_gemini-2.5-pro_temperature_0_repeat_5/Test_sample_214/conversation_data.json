    "The poetic form in this sequence adheres to a structure based on syllable count, a form known as syllabic verse. In this type of poetry, each line is defined by a specific number of syllables rather than by meter or rhyme.\n\nThe image provided displays three lines from a four-line stanza, with the number of syllables in each line being:\n\n*   Line 1: `, a vortex` (3 syllables)\n*   Line 2: `form s like a dance` (5 syllables)\n*   Line 3: `ghostly velum` (4 syllables)\n\nThe user noted that the final line of the last poem in the sequence is \"nacreous wavers,\" which contains 5 syllables. This consistent focus on syllable count across different stanzas points to a syllabic verse structure. This form is notably used by poets like Marianne Moore, who constructed stanzas where corresponding lines maintained the same syllable count throughout the poem. While many syllabic forms exist, such as the Haiku (5-7-5) or Cinquain (2-4-6-8-2), the pattern in this specific work (3-5-4-5) does not match a more common, named form, suggesting a unique structure created by the poet.\n\n<<<Syllabic verse>>>"
