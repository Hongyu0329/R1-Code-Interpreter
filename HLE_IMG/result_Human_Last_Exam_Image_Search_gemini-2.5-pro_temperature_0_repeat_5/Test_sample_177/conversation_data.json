    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\nWe can do this by calculating a weighted VMT for each scenario. The formula for the VMT contribution of each trip distance category is:\n\n*VMT Contribution = (Share of Total Trips) x (Total Car Mode Share for that distance) x (Average Trip Distance)*\n\nThe Total Car Mode Share is the sum of the mode shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT (Table 1)\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) x (0.25 + 0.28) (car mode share) x 1 (avg. distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 x (0.38 + 0.43) x 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 x (0.40 + 0.45) x 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 x (0.42 + 0.47) x 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT (Table 2)\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) x (0.01 + 0.02) (car mode share) x 1 (avg. distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 x (0.08 + 0.19) x 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 x (0.14 + 0.27) x 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 x (0.16 + 0.33) x 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) x 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) x 100 = 52.195%\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
