    "The process depicted in the sequential images L, M, and N is the **formation of a clamp connection** in a fungal hypha.\n\nThis is a characteristic and specialized process that occurs in most basidiomycete fungi. The key function of a clamp connection is to ensure that when a dikaryotic hyphal cell (a cell with two distinct nuclei) divides, the two resulting daughter cells each receive one of each type of nucleus, thus maintaining the dikaryotic state.\n\nThe stages shown in the image illustrate the beginning of this process:\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a typical dikaryotic hyphal cell, which is ready to divide. The arrowhead points to a septum, or cross-wall, separating cells.\n*   **Panel M:** A small, hook-like bulge, which is the initial clamp, begins to form on the side of the hypha.\n*   **Panel N:** The clamp continues to grow and curves backward.\n\nFollowing the stage shown in panel N, the two nuclei within the cell would divide. One of the newly formed nuclei moves into the clamp, which then fuses with the cell behind it, transferring the nucleus and ensuring both cells are dikaryotic before a new septum forms. The presence or absence of clamp connections is an important feature used in the classification of fungi.\n\n<<<The formation of a clamp connection.>>>"
