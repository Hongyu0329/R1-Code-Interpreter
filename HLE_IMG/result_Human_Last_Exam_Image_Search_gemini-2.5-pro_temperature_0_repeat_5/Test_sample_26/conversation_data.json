    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is required.\n\nFirst, it is essential to identify the key of the movement, which is C minor. The key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) confirms this.\n\nNext, we analyze the notes present in measure 30, which is circled in the provided image.\n*   **Right Hand:** The arpeggiated figure contains the notes G, B♮, D, and F.\n*   **Left Hand:** The chord consists of G, B♮, and F.\n\nCombining the notes from both hands, the complete harmony of the measure is G, B♮, D, and F. These notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n\nIn the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree (the dominant) is G. A chord built on the dominant is represented by the Roman numeral V. Because the chord is a dominant seventh (a major triad with a minor seventh), a \"7\" is added to the Roman numeral. The chord is major (G-B♮-D) due to the use of the raised seventh degree of the C minor scale (B♮, the leading tone), which creates a stronger resolution to the tonic, C.\n\nTherefore, the G7 chord in the key of C minor functions as the dominant seventh.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
