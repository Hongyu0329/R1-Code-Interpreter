    "The X Y is the **Balón de Oro** (Golden Ball).\n\nThe image provided shows French striker André-Pierre Gignac receiving the Balón de Oro award for Best Striker at the 2019 Liga MX awards ceremony. The man presenting the award to him is Enrique Bonilla, who was the president of Liga MX at the time. While the prompt states the event occurred on June 20, 2019, the actual ceremony took place on July 13, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe second clue refers to a different kind of \"golden ball\" which has fallen out of use due to the toxicity of mercury. In artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), mercury is used to extract gold from ore. The mercury binds with the gold to form a mixture called an amalgam, which is often formed into a small ball. This ball of amalgam is then heated, causing the toxic mercury to vaporize and leave behind the gold. This process is a major source of global mercury pollution and has devastating health impacts, leading to efforts to reduce or eliminate its use.\n\n<<<Balón de Oro>>>"
