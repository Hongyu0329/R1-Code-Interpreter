    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M+) peak at an m/z of 135. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, a principle known as the Nitrogen Rule.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   From the ¹³C NMR, we can identify 9 unique carbon environments (see below), leading to a C₉ base for the formula.\n    *   Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass 14) and nine carbon atoms (mass 108), the remaining mass is 135 - 108 - 14 = 13, which corresponds to 13 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   This gives a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4. This value is consistent with the presence of a single benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The IR spectrum displays peaks characteristic of:\n    *   Aromatic C-H stretching (above 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aliphatic C-H stretching (below 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aromatic C=C bond stretching (in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ region).\n    *   The absence of a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates no carbonyl (C=O) group is present.\n    *   The spectrum is consistent with a primary amine, which typically shows N-H stretching bands around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹.\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows seven distinct signals:\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Four signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring. The signal at 145.1 ppm is a quaternary carbon (ipso-carbon), as it does not show up in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Three signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n\n5.  **DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:** This experiment reveals:\n    *   **One negative signal**, which corresponds to a CH₂ (methylene) group. This must be the carbon at δ 43.5 ppm.\n    *   **Five positive signals**, corresponding to CH (methine) or CH₃ (methyl) groups. Three of these are the aromatic carbons (δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3), and two are aliphatic carbons (δ 49.6 and 19.2).\n\n6.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The proton NMR shows:\n    *   A multiplet in the aromatic region (δ ~7.2 ppm), integrating to 5H (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A multiplet at δ ~2.9 ppm, integrating to 2H.\n    *   A multiplet at δ ~2.8 ppm, integrating to 1H.\n    *   A doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm, integrating to 3H.\n    *   The total number of protons directly bonded to carbon is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, the remaining two protons must be attached to the nitrogen atom, confirming a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n7.  **HSQC Spectroscopy:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons:\n    *   The 3H doublet at δ 1.2 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm (a CH₃ group).\n    *   The 1H multiplet at δ 2.8 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6 ppm (a CH group).\n    *   The 2H multiplet at δ 2.9 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5 ppm (a CH₂ group).\n\n### **Structure Elucidation**\n\nCombining the fragments identified: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), a methine group (-CH-), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   The 3H doublet at δ 1.2 ppm indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n*   This CH group is the signal at δ 2.8 ppm (¹H) and 49.6 ppm (¹³C). The deshielding in the ¹³C spectrum is characteristic of a carbon attached to an electronegative atom like nitrogen.\n*   The 2H multiplet at δ 2.9 ppm is the benzylic -CH₂- group, attached to the phenyl ring.\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to the only logical structure: the phenyl group is attached to the CH₂ group, which is then attached to the CH group bearing both the NH₂ and the CH₃ groups.\n\n**Structure:** Phenyl-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n\n### **IUPAC Name**\n\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing this group is a three-carbon chain (propane). Numbering starts from the end closest to the phenyl group to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   The amine group is on carbon 2.\n*   The phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. This compound is commonly known as amphetamine. The provided spectral data is consistent with published data for this compound.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
