    "I am unable to answer your question because the image provided is completely black and does not show any molecules. To determine which type of isomers the molecules are, I would need to see their chemical structures.\n\nTo help you with your question, here is a brief explanation of the options provided:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be converted into one another by rotation around single bonds. Examples include the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of cyclohexane.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity of atoms. For example, butane and isobutane both have the formula C₄H₁₀, but the atoms are connected in a different order (a straight chain versus a branched chain).\n*   **(c) Identical:** The structures are the same molecule, just possibly rotated or viewed from a different angle. They are superimposable.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity of atoms, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This category includes enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images), such as cis-trans isomers.\n\nIf you can provide the image of the molecules, I would be happy to help you determine the correct classification."
