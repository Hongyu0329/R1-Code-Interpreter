    "Based on the provided reaction, two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved in the transformation of hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene into the final product.\n\nThe overall transformation is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. However, this process occurs in two sequential pericyclic steps:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening:** The first step involves the photochemical ring-opening of cyclobutene. Under the influence of ultraviolet light (hv), cyclobutene undergoes a 4Ï€-electron electrocyclic reaction to form 1,3-butadiene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this photochemical ring-opening is a conrotatory process.\n\n2.  **Diels-Alder Reaction ([4+2] Cycloaddition):** The 1,3-butadiene generated in the first step then reacts with hexafluorobenzene, which acts as the dienophile. This second step is a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the Diels-Alder reaction, to form the final tricyclic product.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction and a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, [4+2] cycloaddition]>>>"
