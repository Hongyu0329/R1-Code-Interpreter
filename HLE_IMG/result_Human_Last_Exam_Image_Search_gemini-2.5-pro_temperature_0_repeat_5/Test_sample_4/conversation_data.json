    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the 9₄₂ knot.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is:\n\nt⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1\n\nIt is noteworthy that the 9₄₂ knot is one of the first examples of a chiral knot that is not distinguished from its mirror image by the standard Jones polynomial, as well as by the more general HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials. This means that the knot and its reflection have the same Jones polynomial. The chirality of the 9₄₂ knot can be established using more advanced techniques like SU(2) Chern-Simons topological field theory.\n\n<<<t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1>>>"
