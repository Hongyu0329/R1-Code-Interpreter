    "To determine the total current flowing from the voltage source in the provided circuit, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Component Identification:** The circuit consists of a 1 V voltage source (V2) and five resistors with the following values:\n    *   R1 = 3 Ω\n    *   R2 = 7 Ω\n    *   R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   R7 = 100 Ω\n    *   R8 = 100 Ω\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Circuit:** The circuit contains two main parallel branches connected to the voltage source.\n    *   **Right Branch:** Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series. Their combined resistance is the sum of their individual resistances:\n        *   R_series = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω\n\n    *   **Left Branch:** This branch appears to have R1, R2, and R3 in series. However, a crucial detail is the wire that connects the top of the circuit (the positive terminal of the voltage source) directly to the node between resistor R2 and resistor R3. This wire creates a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2. Current will follow the path of least resistance, bypassing R1 and R2 entirely. Therefore, these two resistors do not contribute to the total resistance of the circuit. The only effective resistance in this branch is R3.\n\n3.  **Equivalent Circuit:** The simplified circuit consists of the 1 V source connected in parallel to two branches:\n    *   Branch 1: Resistor R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   Branch 2: The series combination of R7 and R8 = 200 Ω\n\n4.  **Calculating Branch Currents:** Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), we can find the current flowing through each parallel branch.\n    *   Current through Branch 1 (I₁):\n        *   I₁ = V2 / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.111 A\n    *   Current through Branch 2 (I₂):\n        *   I₂ = V2 / R_series = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n\n5.  **Calculating Total Current:** According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current leaving the source is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\n    *   I_total = I₁ + I₂\n    *   I_total = (1/9) A + (1/200) A\n    *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 1800:\n    *   I_total = (200/1800) A + (9/1800) A\n    *   I_total = 209 / 1800 A\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** Converting the fraction to a decimal gives the final value for the total current.\n    *   I_total ≈ 0.1161 A\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.1161 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.1161 A>>>"
