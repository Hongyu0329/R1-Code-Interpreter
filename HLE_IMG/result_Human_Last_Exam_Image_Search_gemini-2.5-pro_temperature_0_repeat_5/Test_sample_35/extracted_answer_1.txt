The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. It should be considered a **prognostic marker** because its expression level directly correlates with and contributes to the progression of neuropathology, including neuroinflammation and neuronal loss, thereby predicting the severity and outcome of the neurological disorder.
