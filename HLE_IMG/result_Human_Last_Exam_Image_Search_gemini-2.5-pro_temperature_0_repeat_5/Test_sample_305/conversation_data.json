    "The product advertised with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" was a face powder from the French-derived brand **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring World War II, the British government and various companies framed the use of cosmetics as a patriotic duty. The \"inherent limitations\" mentioned in the advertising referred to the harsh effects of factory work on women's skin.
