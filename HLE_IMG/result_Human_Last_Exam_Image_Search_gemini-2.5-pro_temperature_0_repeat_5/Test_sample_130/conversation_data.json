    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element Uranium.\n\nUranium has a complex atomic structure, which results in a very rich and detailed emission spectrum with a multitude of lines across the visible range, from blue to red. This complexity makes its spectrum a unique fingerprint for the element. The image provided is a well-known representation of the emission spectrum of uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
