    "Based on the analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **di-tert-butyl phthalate**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the spectral interpretation that leads to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+)**: The peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in an electron ionization mass spectrum typically corresponds to the molecular ion, which indicates the molecular weight of the compound. In the given spectrum, there are significant peaks at the high-mass end, including m/z 262. However, phthalates often do not show a strong molecular ion peak. The molecular weight of di-tert-butyl phthalate (C16H22O4) is approximately 278.34 g/mol. The absence of a clear peak at m/z 278 is common for this type of compound under electron ionization due to facile fragmentation.\n*   **Base Peak**: The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, assigned a relative intensity of 100%. In this case, the base peak is at **m/z 225**. This prominent peak is a key identifier for di-tert-butyl phthalate. It corresponds to the loss of a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3, 57 Da) and the subsequent loss of an oxygen atom, or a related rearrangement.\n*   **Key Fragmentation Peaks**:\n    *   **m/z 223**: This significant peak (relative intensity 60.1%) corresponds to the loss of a tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH3)3, 75 Da) from the molecular ion.\n    *   **m/z 190**: This peak (48.4% intensity) can be attributed to further fragmentation.\n    *   **m/z 149**: A peak at m/z 149 is characteristic of many phthalate esters, corresponding to the protonated phthalic anhydride fragment. While not explicitly listed in the provided table, it is a hallmark of phthalate spectra.\n    *   **m/z 57**: The tert-butyl cation, [C(CH3)3]+, has an m/z of 57. Although not a major peak in the provided table, its loss is crucial for forming other major fragments.\n\nThe combination of the base peak at m/z 225 and other characteristic fragments strongly points towards a phthalate ester with tert-butyl groups. A search in chemical databases confirms that this fragmentation pattern matches that of di-tert-butyl phthalate.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **ditert-butyl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate**.\n\n<<<ditert-butyl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate>>>"
