    "The reaction sequence shown in the image involves three steps to transform the starting material into the final product. To determine the molecular formula of the product, each step of the reaction must be analyzed.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n\nThe initial reaction uses ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile and water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group (C₈H₉O) attached to the nitrogen atom is cleaved and replaced with a hydrogen atom, yielding Intermediate 1.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The PMB group is removed (-C₈H₉O) and a hydrogen atom is added (+H). The resulting molecule is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The change in the molecular formula is -C₈H₈O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C₁₅₋₈H₁₄₋₈F₃NO₂₋₁ = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n\nThe second step involves the reaction of Intermediate 1 with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the bicyclic ring to a single bond. This reaction adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C₇H₆F₃NO\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The double bond is saturated, forming 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C₇H₆₊₂F₃NO = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis of the Lactam**\n\nThe final step is the treatment of Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. These conditions promote the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond within the bicyclic system is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H₂O). This opens the ring to form a cyclopentane ring substituted with an amino group (which will be protonated to an ammonium group, -NH₃⁺, in the acidic conditions) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C₇H₈F₃NO\n*   **Product:** The hydrolysis adds one molecule of water (H₂O).\n*   **Formula of the Product:** C₇H₈₊₂F₃NO₁₊₁ = C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid with the molecular formula C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
