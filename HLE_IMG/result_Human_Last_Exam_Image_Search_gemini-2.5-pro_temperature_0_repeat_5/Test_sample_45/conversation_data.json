    "The tiling shown in the image has a **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be observed by focusing on the center of any of the dark blue regular hexagons. If the entire pattern is rotated by 60 degrees (which is 360/6 degrees) around this central point, it aligns perfectly with its original position. This indicates a 6-fold rotation axis.\n\nThe overall pattern belongs to the p6m wallpaper group, which is characterized by having a 6-fold rotational symmetry as its highest order of rotation. This group also includes points of 2-fold and 3-fold rotational symmetry. For instance, the star-like shapes formed by the squares and rhombi are centers of 2-fold rotation within the context of the entire tiling.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
