    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, represent a **D major chord**.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's key, which is D minor.\n\n1.  **Identify the notes:** In the circled section on the second beat of measure 8, the left hand plays a D in the bass. The right hand plays an F-sharp and an A simultaneously. Together, these notes (D, F#, A) form a D major triad.\n2.  **Determine the chord's function in the key:** The key of the piece is D minor. The tonic, or the first degree of the D minor scale, is D.\n3.  **Assign the Roman numeral:** A chord built on the tonic (the 'I' chord) in a minor key is typically minor (D-F-A), denoted by a lowercase Roman numeral 'i'. However, in this measure, Mozart raises the third of the chord from F to F-sharp, creating a major triad. A major chord built on the tonic in a minor key is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral 'I'.\n\nThis shift from the expected minor tonic (i) to a major tonic (I) is a common expressive device in classical music. It briefly brightens the harmony before moving on. In this piece, the harmony changes from a D minor chord on the first beat of measure 8 to a D major chord on the second beat, which then leads to a G minor chord on the third beat.\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes is I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
