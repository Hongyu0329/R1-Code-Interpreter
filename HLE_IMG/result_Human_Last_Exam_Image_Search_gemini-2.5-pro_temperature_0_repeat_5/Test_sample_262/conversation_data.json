    "### Complexes with Ortho-Fluorine Substituents Exhibit Shorter Lifetimes\n\nThe operational lifetime of emitter complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is a critical parameter, determined by their chemical and photophysical stability under electrical bias. For the family of iridium(III) complexes shown, the key structural difference lies in the fluorination pattern of the 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. This variation is the primary determinant of their relative stability.\n\n*   **Complex 1, [Ir(ppy)₂(dtbbpy)]PF₆, and Complex 2, [Ir(dfppy)₂(dtbbpy)]PF₆:** These are considered benchmark emitters. Complex 1 is a robust green-to-orange emitter, while Complex 2, with fluorine atoms at the *meta* and *para* positions of the phenyl ring, is a stable blue-green emitter. Fluorination at these positions generally enhances stability and blue-shifts the emission color by stabilizing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).\n\n*   **Complex 3 and Complex 4:** These complexes feature fluorine atoms at the *ortho* position of the phenyl ring (the position adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to iridium). Complex 3 has one *ortho*-fluorine on each ppy ligand, and Complex 4 has two *ortho*-fluorine atoms on each ppy ligand.\n\nThe presence of substituents, particularly halogens, at the *ortho* position of the cyclometalating ligand is known to introduce degradation pathways that are not as prevalent in other isomers. Research has shown that *ortho*-fluorination can severely compromise the thermal stability and operational lifetime of the complex. A proposed mechanism for this instability involves the cleavage of the C-F bond, a process that can occur during device operation. This degradation leads to a rapid decrease in the performance of the LEC.\n\nTherefore, complexes with fluorine atoms in the *ortho* position relative to the Ir-C bond are expected to be less stable and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes compared to complexes without *ortho*-fluorine substituents. Both Complex 3 and Complex 4 fit this description.\n\n<<<J>>>"
