    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, here are the identified timestamps and the calculated average inter-burst interval.\n\n**1. Identification of Synchronized Bursts**\n\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense vertical columns where many neurons fire simultaneously. The approximate start times for these bursts are:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~2 seconds\n*   **Burst 2:** ~16 seconds\n*   **Burst 3:** ~26 seconds\n*   **Burst 4:** ~36 seconds\n*   **Burst 5:** ~48 seconds\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI)**\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time between the start of one burst and the start of the next.\n*   **Interval 1:** 16 s - 2 s = 14 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval**\n\nThe average of these intervals is calculated as follows:\n(14 + 10 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 seconds\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12 s>>>"
