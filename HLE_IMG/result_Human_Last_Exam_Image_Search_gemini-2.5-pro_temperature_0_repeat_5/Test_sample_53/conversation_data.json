    "The figure falling to the ground in front of the chariot is King Oenomaus of Pisa.\n\nThis ancient Greek vase, an Apulian red-figure pelike dating to approximately 370-360 B.C., depicts a famous mythological scene: the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus. The artwork is attributed to the Painter of the Dublin Situla.\n\nThe key figures and elements in the scene are:\n*   **King Oenomaus:** The figure on the ground is King Oenomaus, who has just been defeated and killed in the chariot race. An oracle had foretold that he would be killed by his son-in-law, so he challenged each of his daughter's suitors to a deadly chariot race.\n*   **Pelops and Hippodamia:** In the chariot are Pelops, the victor, and Hippodamia, Oenomaus's daughter, whose hand in marriage was the prize for winning the race. Pelops won by sabotaging the king's chariot, either with the help of the sea god Poseidon or by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus.\n*   **Nike:** The winged figure flying above is Nike, the goddess of victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n\nTherefore, the figure \"leaving the chariot\" in the most dramatic sense—by falling from it to his death—is King Oenomaus.\n\n<<<King Oenomaus"
