    "This chemical transformation is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol, followed by a series of shifts of methyl groups (CH3) and hydrides (H). This specific cascade is known as a Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangement, which is common in triterpenoid and steroid chemistry. The driving force is the formation of a more stable final product through a sequence of energetically favorable carbocation intermediates.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final substituent at each numbered position:\n*   **Step 1:** The hydroxyl group (OH) is protonated by the acid catalyst (HCl) and leaves as a water molecule. This generates a secondary carbocation.\n*   **Step 2 (The Rearrangement Cascade):** A series of consecutive-shifts of methyl groups and hydrogen atoms occurs, moving the positive charge across the molecular backbone from left to right. This rearrangement continues until a stable tertiary carbocation is formed at a position from which a proton can be eliminated to give the final, stable alkene.\n*   **Step 3 (Elimination):** A proton is removed from the carbon adjacent to the final carbocation, forming the tetrasubstituted double bond shown in the product.\n\nBased on tracking the starting positions of the methyl groups and hydrogens and their final positions after the rearrangement:\n*   **1 = CH3**: This is one of the two original methyl groups from the gem-dimethyl pair at position C-4 of the starting material. Its partner migrates away in one of the first steps of the rearrangement, but this one remains.\n*   **2 = H**: The methyl group that was originally at this position (C-10) migrates to an adjacent carbon. Its place is taken by a hydrogen atom that shifts from another carbon.\n*   **3 = H**: The methyl group originally at this position (C-8) migrates away during the cascade. A hydrogen atom shifts to this position to take its place.\n*   **4 = CH3**: A methyl group from an adjacent carbon (C-13) migrates to this position (C-14) during one of the final shifts of the rearrangement.\n*   **5 = H**: This position (C-13) originally held a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. The methyl group migrates away to position 4, leaving the hydrogen atom behind. The subsequent elimination step creates a double bond involving this carbon, so it has no other substituent.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
