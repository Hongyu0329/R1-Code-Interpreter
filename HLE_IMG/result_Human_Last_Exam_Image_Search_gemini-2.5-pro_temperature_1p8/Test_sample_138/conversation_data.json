    "To determine the sexes of the insects in each pair, we can look for common differences between males and females in these groups, a concept known as sexual dimorphism.\n\n*   **Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees from the genus *Coelioxys*. A key distinguishing feature is the shape of the abdomen. The female, on the left, has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen which she uses to pierce the nests of her host bees to lay eggs. The male, on the right, has a blunter abdomen that ends in multiple spines or teeth. Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. In many wasp species, a reliable way to tell the sexes apart is by their antennae. The individual on the left has distinctly long and curled antennae, a characteristic feature of male paper wasps. The wasp on the right has shorter, less curved antennae, which is typical for a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These appear to be long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a defining characteristic of males in this group, which gives them their common name. Males of many long-horned bee species also have a yellow or pale patch on their face (clypeus), as seen here. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae. Additionally, its hind legs are thick and covered with dense hairs laden with yellow pollen; these specialized pollen-collecting hairs are called scopae and are only found on females, who gather pollen to feed their offspring. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   A = Female, Male (4)\n*   B = Male, Female (3)\n*   C = Male, Female (3)\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
