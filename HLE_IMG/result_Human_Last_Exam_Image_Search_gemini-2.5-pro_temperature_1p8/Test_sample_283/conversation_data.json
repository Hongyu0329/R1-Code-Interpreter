    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is the United States. The graph illustrates search interest in three distinct sets of American military historical events and observances.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events represented by each colored line:\n\n*   **The Red Line:** This line shows consistent peaks in early December each year, which corresponds with National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day on December 7th. Congress designated this day in 1994 to honor the 2,403 Americans killed in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line:** This line has two major annual spikes: one in late May and another in mid-November. These align with two key U.S. federal holidays:\n    *   **Memorial Day:** Observed on the last Monday of May, this holiday honors military personnel who died in service. This accounts for the prominent late-May peak.\n    *   **Veterans Day:** Observed annually on November 11, this holiday honors all who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. This corresponds to the November peak.\n\n*   **The Blue Line:** This line shows peaks in early May and early June, which are consistent with the anniversaries of two major World War II events:\n    *   **Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day):** Celebrated on May 8th, this day marks the formal unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.\n    *   **D-Day:** The anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy is on June 6, 1944. The D-Day landings were a pivotal moment in the liberation of Europe.\n\nThe specific combination of these recurring search trends strongly points to the United States, as these events are central to the nation's historical identity and commemorative practices.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
