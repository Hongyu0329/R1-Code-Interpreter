    "The characters on the seal are read from top to bottom, right to left. They form a well-known Chinese idiom.\n\nThe characters are:\n*   **Top Right:** 讀 (dú) - to read\n*   **Bottom Right:** 萬 (wàn) - ten thousand\n*   **Top Left:** 卷 (juàn) - scrolls, volumes, or books\n*   **Bottom Left:** 書 (shū) - books\n\nTogether, they form the phrase **讀萬卷書 (dú wàn juàn shū)**. The simplified Chinese is **读万卷书**.\n\nThis phrase literally means \"to read ten thousand scrolls (or volumes) of books.\" It is a famous saying that emphasizes the importance of extensive reading and deep learning. It is often the first half of a longer couplet, \"读万卷书，行万里路\" (dú wàn juàn shū, xíng wàn lǐ lù), which means \"Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles,\" advocating for a balance of scholarly learning and real-world experience. Such phrases are common on seals used by scholars, artists, and book lovers.\n\nThe script used on the seal is an ancient style known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū), which was standardized during the Qin dynasty and is now primarily used for artistic purposes like calligraphy and seals.\n\n<<<读万卷书>>>"
