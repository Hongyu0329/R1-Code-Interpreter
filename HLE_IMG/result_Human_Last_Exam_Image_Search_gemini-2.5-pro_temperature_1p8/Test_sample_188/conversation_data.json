    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph, denoted `P(G, k)`, counts the number of proper vertex colorings of the graph G using a set of `k` colors. A proper coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The chromatic polynomial for the given graph can be computed using methods such as the deletion-contraction principle.\n\nTo determine the chromatic polynomial for the graph provided, we can employ the deletion-contraction method. Let's choose the edge `e = (1,5)` for this process. The principle states that `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G·e, k)`, where `G-e` is the graph with edge `e` deleted, and `G·e` is the graph with edge `e` contracted.\n\n1.  **Deletion (G-e)**: We remove the edge (1,5). In the resulting graph, `G-e`, we can compute the chromatic polynomial by choosing colors for the vertices sequentially.\n    *   Start by coloring vertices 3 and 4: there are `k` choices for vertex 3 and `(k-1)` for vertex 4.\n    *   Vertex 2 is adjacent to both 3 and 4, which have different colors, so there are `(k-2)` choices for vertex 2.\n    *   Similarly, vertex 5 is adjacent to 3 and 4, leaving `(k-2)` choices for its color.\n    *   Finally, vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 2, so it can be colored in `(k-1)` ways.\n    *   Multiplying these choices gives the polynomial for `G-e`: `P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2)(k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2`.\n\n2.  **Contraction (G·e)**: We contract the edge (1,5) into a single new vertex, let's call it `v`. This new vertex `v` is connected to all neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 5.\n    *   The neighbors of 1 are {2, 5}.\n    *   The neighbors of 5 are {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   So, the new vertex `v` is connected to {2, 3, 4}.\n    *   The original vertices {2, 3, 4} form a complete subgraph (a triangle, or `K_3`) among themselves.\n    *   The resulting graph `G·e` is a complete graph on 4 vertices (`K_4`), consisting of `v`, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph `K_n` is `k(k-1)...(k-n+1)`. Therefore, for `K_4`, the polynomial is `P(K_4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute these results back into the deletion-contraction formula:\n    *   `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G·e, k)`\n    *   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n    *   Factoring out the common terms `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    *   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3)]`\n    *   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k^2 - 3k + 2 - k + 3]`\n    *   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nExpanding this expression gives the polynomial in its standard form.\n\nThe final computed chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n`k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
