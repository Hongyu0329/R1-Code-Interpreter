    "The process depicted in the microscopic images is **plasmolysis** in filamentous cells, likely those of a fungus or alga.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is happening in the images:\n*   The images show elongated, rectangular cells arranged in a filament. These cells possess a rigid cell wall.\n*   **Image L** shows a turgid cell, which is the normal state. The protoplast (the plasma membrane and all of its contents) is full of water and presses firmly against the cell wall. The arrowhead points to a cross-wall, showing no gaps between the cell content and the wall.\n*   **Images M and N** show the cells after being exposed to a hypertonic solution (a solution with a lower water potential than the cell's interior). Due to osmosis, water moves out of the cell vacuole and cytoplasm, causing the protoplast to lose volume, shrink, and pull away from the cell wall. This shrinking and detachment is the process of plasmolysis.\n*   The arrowheads in images M and N specifically point to the gaps created between the cell wall and the retracted protoplast, clearly illustrating the effect of plasmolysis. The progression from L to M to N appears to show increasing severity of plasmolysis.\n\nIn summary, the images display a classic biological demonstration of how a cell with a rigid wall responds to hyperosmotic stress.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"
