    "The image provided is black and does not show the molecules in question. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the relationship between them.\n\nTo help you identify the correct answer once you can see the molecules, here is a guide to the different types of isomers listed in the options:\n\n*   **Constitutional (or Structural) Isomers**: These molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity, meaning the atoms are bonded in a different order. For example, 1-propanol and 2-propanol both have the formula C₃H₈O, but the location of the -OH group is different, making them constitutional isomers.\n\n*   **Stereoisomers**: These molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but they differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. Stereoisomers can be further divided into enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other).\n\n*   **Conformers (or Conformational Isomers)**: These are different spatial arrangements of the *same* molecule that can be interconverted simply by rotating around one or more single bonds. Because they can be easily interconverted without breaking bonds, they are often not considered to be true isomers, but rather different forms of the same compound.\n\n*   **Identical**: The molecules are the same in every way: same formula, same connectivity, and the same spatial arrangement. They are superimposable on each other. Note that just because two molecules are drawn differently (e.g., one is rotated) does not mean they are not identical.\n\nTo solve your problem, you should first check if the molecules have the same molecular formula. If they do not, they are different compounds. If they do, then determine their relationship based on the definitions above.\n\nWithout the image, a definitive answer cannot be provided."
