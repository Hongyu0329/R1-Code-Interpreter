    "This sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera **Der Rosenkavalier** by Richard Strauss.\n\nComposed between 1909 and 1910, *Der Rosenkavalier* is a comic opera in three acts with a German libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The premiere was held in Dresden in 1911. The opera is known for its lush, romantic score, which blends the grandness of Wagner with the refinement of Mozart. It is considered one of Strauss's most popular operas.\n\nThe music shown depicts the morning after a night of passion between the Marschallin and her young lover, Octavian. This introduction to the second act specifically sets the scene in the house of Herr von Faninal, as he and his daughter Sophie await the arrival of the \"Rosenkavalier,\" or the Knight of the Rose. The shimmering, delicate chords, especially in the flutes and strings, are said to represent the silver rose that Octavian will present to Sophie.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
