    "The jazz standard featured in the sheet music is **\"All the Things You Are\"**, composed by **Jerome Kern** with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\n\"All the Things You Are\" was originally written for the 1939 musical *Very Warm for May*. Despite the show's lack of success, the song became an enduring hit and a staple of the jazz repertoire. Its popularity was bolstered by recordings from artists like Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, and later, a landmark version by Charlie Parker which solidified its status as a jazz standard.\n\nThe song is celebrated for its sophisticated and logical, yet challenging, chord structure. It is most commonly played in the key of A-flat major and notably begins on the sixth degree of the scale (F minor), which is consistent with the provided sheet music. The composition is known for its modulations through several keys, making it a favorite for jazz musicians to improvise over.\n\n<<<\"All the Things You Are\" by Jerome Kern>>>"
