    "To determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\nAn examination of the score for measure 30 reveals the following:\n*   **Key Signature:** C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   **Time Signature:** Alla breve (2/2).\n*   **Left Hand:** The left hand holds a G in the bass throughout the measure, establishing a pedal point. On the first beat, a D is played, and on the second beat, an F# octave appears.\n*   **Right Hand:** A complex series of 32nd notes arpeggiates a complex harmony over the G pedal point. The notes include G, F#, D#, E, C, A, B, and G#.\n\nThe sustained G in the bass throughout the measure strongly indicates a dominant function, as G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant) in the key of C minor. The various chromatic notes in the right hand (like F#, D#, and G#) are part of a complex, tension-building chord designed to lead back to the tonic, C minor.\n\nThe collection of notes (G, B, D, F#) points towards an altered dominant seventh chord. Specifically, this measure features a heavily embellished and prolonged dominant chord. In harmonic analysis, such a passage built on the fifth scale degree pedal point is fundamentally classified by its dominant function.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for the underlying harmony of measure 30 is **V**.\n\n<<<V>>>"
