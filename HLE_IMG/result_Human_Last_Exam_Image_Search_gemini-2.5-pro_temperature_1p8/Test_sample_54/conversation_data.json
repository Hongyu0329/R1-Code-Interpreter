    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and chemical literature, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of an oxygen atom within a furan ring of the trioxatriangulenium core with an N-amino (N-NH₂) group. This type of reaction, introducing a nitrogen atom to form a pyrrole ring within the fused system, is characteristic of a reaction with hydrazine. Specifically, this is a known reaction where a single nitrogen atom from hydrazine is incorporated into the ring system, resulting in the N-amino product shown.\n\n**Reagent B: Butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe conversion of compound **2** to compound **3** involves a condensation and cyclization reaction. The N-amino group of compound **2** reacts with an aldehyde, in this case, butyraldehyde. This reaction proceeds through the formation of a hydrazone intermediate, which then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization onto the neighboring aromatic ring. This cyclization involves one of the adjacent methoxy groups, leading to the formation of a new six-membered ring and yielding the dimethoxy quinacridinium structure **3**. The propyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₃) from butyraldehyde becomes a substituent on one of the nitrogen atoms in the final product. This type of cyclization reaction of N-amino heterocycles with aldehydes is a known method for synthesizing fused heterocyclic systems like the one shown.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A: Hydrazine**\n*   **B: Butyraldehyde**\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: Butyraldehyde>>>"
