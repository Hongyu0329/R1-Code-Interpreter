    "The painting is titled ***The Burning Mill*** by the Belgian artist **Théodore Verstraete**.\n\nThéodore Verstraete (1850–1907) was a Realist painter and printmaker known for his empathetic depictions of rural life and landscapes. This particular work, \"The Burning Mill,\" captures a dramatic nocturnal scene with the powerful contrast of the flaming structure against a dark, stormy sky. This style, with its focus on dramatic light and shadow and emotional intensity, is characteristic of the 19th-century Romantic movement. While several artists have tackled the theme of a burning mill, this specific composition is a well-known work by Verstraete."
