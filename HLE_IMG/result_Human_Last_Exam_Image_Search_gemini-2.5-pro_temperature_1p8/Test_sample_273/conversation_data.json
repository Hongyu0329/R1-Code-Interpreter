    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, each chiral center must be analyzed according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. This involves identifying all chiral centers, assigning priorities to the groups attached to each center, and then determining if the configuration is R (rectus) or S (sinister).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Chiral Centers and IUPAC Naming**\n\nThe first step is to identify the main carbon chain and the chiral centers.\n*   **Principal Functional Group**: The alcohol (-OH) group has higher priority than the amine (-NH2) group, so the molecule is named as an alcohol.\n*   **Longest Carbon Chain**: The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a five-carbon chain (pentanol).\n*   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered from left to right to give the hydroxyl group the lowest possible number (position 2).\n*   **Substituents**: This numbering places an ethyl group at C3 and an aminomethyl group and a methyl group at C4. However, a more detailed look reveals the longest chain is a pentan-2-ol with an ethyl group at position 3 and a 1-(aminomethyl) group at position 4. This is complex. A more direct analysis names the main chain as a pentan-2-ol, resulting in the IUPAC name: **4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers (carbons bonded to four different groups) are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**2. Determining the Configuration of Each Chiral Center**\n\n**Chiral Center C2 (Carbon with -OH group):**\n*   **Group Priorities**: The priorities of the groups attached to C2 are assigned based on atomic number:\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -C3 (Carbon attached to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH₃ (Carbon attached to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n*   **3D Arrangement**: The -OH group is on a wedge (pointing out), and the -CH₃ group is on a dash (pointing in). This implies the C2-H and C2-C3 bonds are in the plane of the drawing.\n*   **Assignment**: To determine the configuration, we can visualize looking down the C2-H bond (lowest priority group). From this perspective, the sequence of the remaining groups (1 -> 2 -> 3) is clockwise.\n*   **Configuration**: **(2R)**\n\n**Chiral Center C3 (Carbon with ethyl group):**\n*   **Group Priorities**:\n    1.  -C2 (Carbon attached to O, C, H)\n    2.  -C4 (Carbon attached to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group, carbon attached to C, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n*   **3D Arrangement**: The ethyl group is on a wedge, which means the implicit hydrogen atom is on a dash (pointing away).\n*   **Assignment**: With the lowest priority group (H) pointing away, the configuration is determined by the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path from C2 (left) to C4 (right) to the ethyl group (up) is clockwise.\n*   **Configuration**: **(3R)**\n\n**Chiral Center C4 (Carbon with aminomethyl and methyl groups):**\n*   **Group Priorities**: The priorities are based on the first point of difference:\n    1.  -CH₂NH₂ (Carbon attached to Nitrogen, Z=7)\n    2.  -C3 (Carbon attached to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH₃ (Carbon attached to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n*   **3D Arrangement**: The -CH₃ group is on a dash. The bonds to C3 and -CH₂NH₂ are in the plane. This implies the implicit hydrogen (H) is on a wedge (pointing out).\n*   **Assignment**: Since the lowest priority group (H) is pointing towards the viewer, the configuration will be the opposite of the direction traced by the remaining groups. The path from group 1 (-CH₂NH₂) to group 2 (-C3) to group 3 (-CH₃) is clockwise. Because the H is wedged, we reverse the assignment.\n*   **Configuration**: **(4S)**\n\nCombining the results for all three chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
