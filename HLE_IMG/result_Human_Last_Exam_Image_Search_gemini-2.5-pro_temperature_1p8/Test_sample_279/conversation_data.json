    "Based on the location of the decay shown in the image, the lesion corresponds to a G.V. Black Class I classification.\n\nThe image displays a molar tooth with an existing restoration (filling). The carious lesion, which appears as a dark area, is located in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (chewing) surface, surrounding the old filling.\n\nAccording to the G.V. Black classification system, one of the most widely used methods for categorizing carious lesions based on their location, Class I caries are those that affect the pits and fissures of the posterior (back) teeth. This type of decay is also the most common. When a new cavity forms around or under an existing restoration, it is referred to as recurrent or secondary caries. Although this lesion is a recurrent carious lesion, its location on the occlusal surface still places it within the Class I classification.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
