    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\nAs its name suggests, ***Grimmia curviseta*** **is characterized by a curved or arcuate seta**. This causes the capsule to be inclined or horizontal.\n\nIn contrast, ***Grimmia montana*** **has a straight seta**, which holds the capsule in an erect and exserted (projecting beyond the leaves) position.\n\nTherefore, observing whether the seta is straight or curved is the key to telling these two species apart when they are in their reproductive (sporophyte-bearing) stage."
