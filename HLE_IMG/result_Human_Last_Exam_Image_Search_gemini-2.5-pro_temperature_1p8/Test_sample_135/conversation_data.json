    "The author of this detailed stonework from the Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament is Bernardo Rossellino.\n\nThis piece is a relief sculpture from the \"Altare del Santissimo Sacramento\" (Altar of the Holy Sacrament), located in the Pienza Cathedral in Italy. The altar was created in 1462 by the Florentine sculptor and architect Bernardo Rossellino. He was commissioned by Pope Pius II for the construction and decoration of the cathedral in his hometown of Pienza, which the pope envisioned as an ideal Renaissance city.\n\nThe inscription visible at the bottom of the roundel, \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL,\" translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is consistent with the subject matter of the Eucharist depicted. This work is a significant example of Rossellino's sculptural skill and his contribution to the art of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n<<<Bernardo Rossellino>>>"
