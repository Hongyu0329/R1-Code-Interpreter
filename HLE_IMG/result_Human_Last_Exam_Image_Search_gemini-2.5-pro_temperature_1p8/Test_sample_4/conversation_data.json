    "The knot in the image is known as the 9_42 knot in the Rolfsen table. The Jones polynomial, a knot invariant discovered by Vaughan Jones in 1984, can be used to distinguish different knots.\n\nInterestingly, the 9_42 knot is a chiral knot, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. However, its chirality is not detected by the standard Jones polynomial, nor by the more generalized two-variable HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials. This means the knot and its mirror image share the same Jones polynomial.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is:\n\n$t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2$\n\nReordering this in decreasing degree order gives:\n\n$t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\n<<<$t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$>>>"
