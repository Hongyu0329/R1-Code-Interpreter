    "Based on the organisms visible in the photograph, the species that definitively indicates the picture was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast of North America is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nHere's the evidence:\n*   **Distinctive Appearance:** The larger snails in the image have a robust, solid-colored, conical shell, which is characteristic of *Littorina littorea*.\n*   **Geographic Distribution:** The common periwinkle is native to Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century. It has since become the most common and abundant intertidal snail on rocky shores along the northwestern Atlantic, with a range from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware in the United States.\n*   **Status on the Pacific Coast:** While *Littorina littorea* has been found on the U.S. West Coast in isolated locations such as bays in California, Oregon, and Washington, it is not widely established there. Most populations have died out, and it is not considered an established part of the general Pacific coast intertidal ecosystem. Pacific coast periwinkle species are generally smaller and have different shell characteristics.\n\nThe other visible organisms, such as acorn barnacles (likely *Semibalanus balanoides*), are also characteristic of the Atlantic, but the periwinkle is more easily and clearly identifiable from the photograph and has a more definitive distribution pattern for this purpose. The overwhelming abundance and established range of *Littorina littorea* on the Atlantic coast, compared to its rare and unestablished presence on the Pacific coast, make it the key indicator species in this image.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
