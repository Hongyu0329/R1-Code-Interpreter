    "A terracotta panel from the Kushan period, dating to the 3rd century AD, depicts a deity believed to be a syncretic representation of Zeus, Serapis, and the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd, alongside a worshiper. This panel was discovered in Bactria, near the Oxus river in modern-day Afghanistan. The artwork displays a blend of cultural styles, including Indian divine iconography, an Iranian compositional arrangement of two figures, and Greco-Roman naturalism in the rendering of drapery and the use of light and shadow. The panel was likely part of a set that decorated the interior of a sanctuary, possibly a family shrine.\n\nAnother relevant archaeological find is a gold medallion that was part of a hoard discovered in 1902 in Aboukir, Egypt. This collection included twenty gold medallions with various mythological scenes, portraits of the emperor Caracalla, and busts of Alexander the Great and Olympias, alongside hundreds of gold coins from the 3rd century AD. These medallions are thought to have been created as anniversary issues for the Alexandria Olympia, athletic games held between AD 225 and 250.\n\nFurthermore, a silver plaque featuring a bust of Zeus, identified by a Greek inscription, was found in what is now south-central Turkey. Based on the dating system used in the inscription and the style of the artwork, this piece is estimated to have been created in either AD 70 or AD 180, with the latter date being more favored by experts.\n\nBased on these related artifacts and their dating, the medallion in question is likely from the Roman period. The terracotta panel from Bactria specifically points to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
