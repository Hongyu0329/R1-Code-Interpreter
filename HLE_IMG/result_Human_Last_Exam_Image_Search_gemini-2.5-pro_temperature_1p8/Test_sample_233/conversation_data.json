    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided image and a review of scholarly sources, the Ingvar runestone depicted in the fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis identification is confirmed by comparing the distinctive runes and their arrangement with high-resolution images and descriptions of Sö 281. Key matching features include the specific runic characters and the use of \"x\" as a word divider. The inscription on this stone mentions Ingvar and his fateful expedition.\n\nThe runestone, which is a fragment, is located in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. It is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were erected to commemorate those who died during a Swedish Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled between 1036 and 1041. The inscription on Sö 281, classified in runestone style Pr2, notes that the monument was made in memory of Ulv's brother who was with Ingvar in \"Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens).\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
