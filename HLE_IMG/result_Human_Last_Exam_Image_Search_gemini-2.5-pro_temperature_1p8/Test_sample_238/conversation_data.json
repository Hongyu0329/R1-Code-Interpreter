    "The tiny, black, hair-like organisms growing on the surface of the larger bracket fungus are a type of parasitic or saprobic fungus. Based on their appearance as minute, black, pin-like structures, they are commonly referred to as \"Fairy Pins.\"\n\nThese organisms are not part of the larger host fungus but are a separate species growing on it. Several different microfungi look like this, and precise identification often requires microscopic examination. One common example that fits this description is *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*, a species known to grow on bracket fungi. Another possibility could be a species of *Chaenotheca*, which are tiny, lichenized \"pin\" fungi that can also grow on polypores.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like fungus is a type of polypore, also known as a bracket fungus. These fungi are important decomposers of wood and are characterized by a pore surface on their underside instead of gills. The presence of bracket fungi indicates decay within the host tree.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"black fungus\" is also used to describe *Auricularia polytricha* (wood ear mushroom) in culinary contexts and, more clinically, a dangerous human infection called mucormycosis. However, in this image, the organism is clearly a minuscule fungus growing on another fungus.\n\n<<<Fairy Pins (a type of parasitic or saprobic microfungus)>>>"
