    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node `a₀`, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance (`R_th`) seen by the capacitor `C`. The cutoff angular frequency (`ω_c`) is then given by the formula `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`.\n\n1.  **Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance (R_th)**\n\n    The Thevenin resistance is the equivalent resistance looking into the terminals `a₀` and `b₀` (ground) with all independent sources turned off. We assume the input \"IN\" at node `c₀` is a voltage source connected to ground. Turning it off means `c₀` is shorted to ground. Therefore, `R_th` is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder network between node `a₀` and ground.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\n\n    The structure is an infinite ladder composed of resistors, each with resistance `r`. Let `R_th` be the equivalent resistance of this infinite network looking into nodes `a₀` and `c₀`. Due to the infinite nature of the ladder, if we consider the section to the right of nodes `c₁` and `d₁`, its equivalent resistance is also `R_th`.\n\n    Looking into nodes `a₀` and `c₀`, the equivalent resistance `R_th` is composed of:\n    *   The first resistor connecting `c₀` and `a₀` vertically (resistance `r`).\n    *   This is in parallel with the rest of the network, which consists of the top horizontal resistor (`r` from `c₀` to `c₁`), the bottom horizontal resistor (`r` from `a₀` to `d₁`), and the remainder of the infinite ladder seen from `c₁` and `d₁` (which has resistance `R_th`).\n\n3.  **Setting up the Self-Consistency Equation**\n\n    We can write a self-consistency equation for `R_th`:\n    `R_th` is equal to `r` in parallel with (`r` + `r` + `R_th`).\n    `R_th = r || (2r + R_th)`\n\n    Using the formula for resistors in parallel, `R_p = (R₁ * R₂) / (R₁ + R₂)`:\n    `R_th = (r * (2r + R_th)) / (r + 2r + R_th)`\n    `R_th = (2r² + r * R_th) / (3r + R_th)`\n\n4.  **Solving for R_th**\n\n    To solve for `R_th`, we rearrange the equation into a quadratic form:\n    `R_th * (3r + R_th) = 2r² + r * R_th`\n    `3r*R_th + R_th² = 2r² + r*R_th`\n    `R_th² + 2r*R_th - 2r² = 0`\n\n    We solve this quadratic equation for `R_th` using the quadratic formula `x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)] / 2a`:\n    `R_th = [-2r ± sqrt((2r)² - 4(1)(-2r²))] / 2`\n    `R_th = [-2r ± sqrt(4r² + 8r²)] / 2`\n    `R_th = [-2r ± sqrt(12r²)] / 2`\n    `R_th = [-2r ± 2r*sqrt(3)] / 2`\n    `R_th = r * (-1 ± sqrt(3))`\n\n    Since resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n    `R_th = r * (sqrt(3) - 1)`\n\n5.  **Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\n\n    The angular cutoff frequency `ω_c` is:\n    `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`\n    `ω_c = 1 / (r * (sqrt(3) - 1) * C)`\n\n    This expression can be rationalized for a cleaner form:\n    `ω_c = (1 / (rC(sqrt(3) - 1))) * ((sqrt(3) + 1) / (sqrt(3) + 1))`\n    `ω_c = (sqrt(3) + 1) / (rC * (3 - 1))`\n    `ω_c = (sqrt(3) + 1) / (2rC)`\n\n    The cutoff frequency in Hertz (`f_c`) is `ω_c / (2π)`:\n    `f_c = (sqrt(3) + 1) / (4πrC)`\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, for which the expression for angular frequency is standard.\n\n<<<`ω_c = (sqrt(3) + 1) / (2rC)`>>>"
