    "Based on the visual evidence provided in the spectrogram and waveform, along with the accompanying description, the phenomenon in question is known as the **auditory continuity illusion**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is perceived as being continuous even when it has been briefly interrupted by another sound, such as a burst of noise. The brain essentially \"fills in\" the missing auditory information, creating the perception of an unbroken sound. This perceptual restoration happens unconsciously and demonstrates the brain's ability to create a coherent understanding of the auditory world, even with incomplete sensory input.\n\nKey aspects of this phenomenon include:\n*   **Alternative Names**: It is also referred to as perceptual restoration of sound or temporal induction. When the interrupted sound is speech, it is often called the phonemic restoration effect.\n*   **Conditions for the Illusion**: For the illusion to occur, the interrupting sound (the masker) must be sufficiently loud and have appropriate characteristics to convincingly cover the gap in the original sound. If the gap is replaced by silence instead of a masking sound, the illusion typically does not happen, and the interruption is correctly perceived.\n*   **Relation to Real-World Listening**: This perceptual ability is crucial for understanding sounds in noisy environments. For example, it allows us to follow a conversation even when parts of it are momentarily drowned out by other noises, such as a cough or a door slamming.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt, as both are examples of how the brain resolves ambiguity to form a stable and continuous perception from the available sensory information.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
