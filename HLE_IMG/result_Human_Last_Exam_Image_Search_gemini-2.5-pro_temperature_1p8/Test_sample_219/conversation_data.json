    "The timestamps of the synchronized bursts in the provided graph are identified as the center of the dense vertical collections of firing activity. The approximate timestamps are:\n*   **Burst 1:** 3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 18 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 36 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 50 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (IBIs) are the time differences between these consecutive bursts:\n*   **IBI 1:** 18 s - 3 s = 15 s\n*   **IBI 2:** 36 s - 18 s = 18 s\n*   **IBI 3:** 50 s - 36 s = 14 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval, we take the mean of these values:\nAverage IBI = (15 + 18 + 14) / 3 = 47 / 3 â‰ˆ 15.67 s\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives 16 s.\n<<<16>>>"
