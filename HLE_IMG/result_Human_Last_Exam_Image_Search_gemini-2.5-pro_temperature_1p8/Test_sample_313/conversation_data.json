    "The solution to this puzzle involves connecting two distinct clues: a visual from a specific date and a riddle about mercury toxicity.\n\n*   **The Mercury Clue:** The prompt states that \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This is a strong reference to the process of making felt hats. For centuries, hat makers used mercuric nitrate to separate fur from pelts and stiffen the fibers, a process called \"carroting\". Workers often inhaled mercury vapors in poorly ventilated rooms, leading to a neurological disorder with symptoms like tremors and psychosis, which became known as \"Mad Hatter's disease\". This practice was largely phased out and banned by 1941. Therefore, the \"X Y\" related to mercury is a **Felt Hat**.\n\n*   **The Visual Clue:** The image shows two men at an awards ceremony, dated June 20, 2019. The key is to identify the individuals and the event to find the corresponding \"Felt Hat.\" The man presenting the award is Viacheslav \"Slava\" Fetisov, a legendary Russian ice hockey defenseman and former Minister of Sport in Russia. A phonetic connection can be made between \"Felt Hat\" and \"Fetisov.\" A search for his activities on the given date confirms his presence at events in Moscow.\n\nBy connecting the phonetic similarity of the name \"Fetisov\" to the answer of the mercury riddle, \"Felt Hat,\" we can identify the person pictured.\n\n<<<Viacheslav Fetisov>>>"
