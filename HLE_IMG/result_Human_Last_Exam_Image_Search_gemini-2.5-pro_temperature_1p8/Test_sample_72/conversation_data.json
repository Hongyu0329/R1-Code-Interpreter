    "The transformation shown involves the reaction of hexafluorobenzene with cyclobutene under photochemical conditions. Based on the structures of the reactants and the product, two distinct pericyclic reactions occur.\n\nThe first step is a **[2+2] cycloaddition** (also known as an ortho photocycloaddition) between one of the double bonds of the hexafluorobenzene ring and the double bond of cyclobutene. In this reaction, a new four-membered ring is formed, connecting the two reactant molecules. This type of reaction is common for benzene derivatives when initiated by light.\n\nThe second pericyclic reaction is an **electrocyclic ring-opening** of the cyclobutene ring that was originally part of the starting material. This reaction is also photochemically allowed and results in the formation of a conjugated diene system within the newly formed larger ring structure. Specifically, under photochemical conditions, a 4Ï€-electron electrocyclic reaction, such as the ring-opening of cyclobutene, proceeds through a disrotatory mechanism. This electrocyclic reaction converts a sigma bond and a pi bond into two new pi bonds, expanding the four-membered ring into a six-membered diene fused to the other rings.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic ring-opening.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic ring-opening>>>"
