    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry\n\nFirst, let's analyze the geometric properties shown in the image:\n*   The overall shape is a sector of a circle with its center at the bottom vertex.\n*   The radius of the circle, `R`, is given as 34.\n*   A crucial piece of information is the segment of length 17. This segment is perpendicular to a radius and connects a point on that radius to a point on the circular arc. Let the center of the circle be O, the point on the radius be A, and the point on the arc be P. We have a right-angled triangle OAP with the right angle at A. The hypotenuse is the radius OP, so `OP = R = 34`. The side opposite to the angle at the center is `AP = 17`.\n*   The angle `∠AOP`, which is labeled as `θ` in the diagram, can be found using trigonometry:\n    sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = AP/OP = 17/34 = 1/2.\n    This gives `θ = 30°` or `π/6` radians.\n*   The diagram shows that the total angle of the large sector is composed of three adjacent angles, each labeled `θ`. The image also marks the total angle as a right angle (90°). This is consistent with our finding, as `3 * θ = 3 * 30° = 90°`.\n\n### 2. Defining the Shaded Regions\n\n*   The shaded regions are the areas enclosed between the circular arc and the tangents drawn at the endpoints of that arc. The right-angle symbols where the straight-line boundaries meet the arc's endpoints confirm they are tangent lines.\n*   The **blue shaded region** corresponds to the arc spanning from the first radius to the third radius. The angle of this sector is `2θ = 2 * 30° = 60°` or `π/3` radians.\n*   The **red shaded region** corresponds to the arc spanning from the second radius to the fourth radius. The angle of this sector is also `2θ = 60°` or `π/3` radians.\n*   The two regions overlap. The **overlapping region** corresponds to the arc between the second and third radii, which has an angle of `θ = 30°` or `π/6` radians.\n\n### 3. Formula for a Single Shaded Region\n\nLet's find the area of a single shaded region formed by tangents to an arc with an angle `α`. This area can be calculated as the area of the kite formed by the two tangents and the two radii to the endpoints, minus the area of the circular sector itself.\n*   **Area of the kite**: The kite can be split into two identical right-angled triangles. The area is `R² * tan(α/2)`.\n*   **Area of the sector**: The area is `(1/2) * R² * α`, where `α` is in radians.\n*   **Area of the shaded region `A(α)`**: `A(α) = R² * tan(α/2) - (1/2)R² * α`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Areas\n\nWe need to find the total area, which is `Area(Blue) + Area(Red) - Area(Overlap)`.\n\n*   **Area of the blue region (`A_blue`)**:\n    Here, the angle `α = 2θ = 60° = π/3` radians. The half-angle `α/2 = 30° = π/6` radians.\n    `A_blue = R² * tan(30°) - (1/2)R² * (π/3)`\n    `A_blue = 34² * (1/√3) - (1/2) * 34² * (π/3)`\n    `A_blue = 1156/√3 - 578π/3`\n\n*   **Area of the red region (`A_red`)**:\n    This region is identical to the blue one in size and shape.\n    `A_red = 1156/√3 - 578π/3`\n\n*   **Area of the overlapping region (`A_overlap`)**:\n    Here, the angle `α = θ = 30° = π/6` radians. The half-angle `α/2 = 15° = π/12` radians.\n    `A_overlap = R² * tan(15°) - (1/2)R² * (π/6)`\n    We use the identity `tan(15°) = tan(45° - 30°) = 2 - √3`.\n    `A_overlap = 1156 * (2 - √3) - (1/2) * 1156 * (π/6)`\n    `A_overlap = 1156 * (2 - √3) - 289π/3`\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Shaded Area\n\n`Total Area = A_blue + A_red - A_overlap`\n`Total Area = 2 * (1156/√3 - 578π/3) - [1156 * (2 - √3) - 289π/3]`\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`Total Area = (2312/√3 - 1156π/3) - (2312 - 1156√3 - 289π/3)`\n`Total Area = 2312/√3 - 1156π/3 - 2312 + 1156√3 + 289π/3`\n\nGroup the terms:\n*   Constant term: `-2312`\n*   `π` terms: `-1156π/3 + 289π/3 = -867π/3 = -289π`\n*   `√3` terms: `2312/√3 + 1156√3 = 2312√3/3 + 3468√3/3 = 5780√3/3`\n\nSo, the total area is:\n`Total Area = 5780√3/3 - 2312 - 289π`\n\nWe can factor out 289 (since `289 = 17²`, `2312 = 8 * 289`, and `5780 = 20 * 289`):\n`Total Area = 289 * (20√3/3 - 8 - π)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value:\n`Total Area ≈ 289 * (20 * 1.732 / 3 - 8 - 3.1416)`\n`Total Area ≈ 289 * (11.547 - 8 - 3.1416)`\n`Total Area ≈ 289 * (3.547 - 3.1416)`\n`Total Area ≈ 289 * 0.4054`\n`Total Area ≈ 117.16`\n\nThe exact area is `5780√3/3 - 2312 - 289π`.\n\n<<<117.16>>>"
