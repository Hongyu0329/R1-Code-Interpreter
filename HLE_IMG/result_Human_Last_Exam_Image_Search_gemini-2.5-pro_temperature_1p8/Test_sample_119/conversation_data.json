    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a molecule with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Therefore, this compound likely contains one nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's determine the molecular formula. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   Dividing the remaining mass by the atomic weight of carbon (12) gives 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's assume there are 9 carbons (9 x 12 = 108).\n*   The remaining mass for hydrogen is 121 - 108 = 13.\n*   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\n\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Weak, broad peaks are visible, characteristic of N-H stretching in a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chain).\n*   **~1600-1450 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions corresponding to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum supports the presence of a primary amine and an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy\n\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This signal is characteristic of the five protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 2H):** An aliphatic signal corresponding to a -CH₂- group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 1H):** An aliphatic signal corresponding to a -CH- group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 3H):** An aliphatic signal corresponding to a -CH₃ group. The multiplicity appears to be a doublet, which indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n\nThe sum of integrated protons is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11H. The molecular formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 hydrogens. The two missing protons are from the -NH₂ group, which often appears as a broad signal that may not be cleanly integrated or may have exchanged with solvent.\n\n### 4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy\n\n*   **¹³C Signals:** Seven distinct signals are observed at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal (indicating a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating CH or CH₃ groups). Quaternary carbons are not visible in DEPT spectra.\n    *   This means one of the seven ¹³C signals must be a quaternary carbon. This is the peak at **δ 145.1**, which is in the aromatic region and typical for a carbon atom to which a substituent is attached (ipso-carbon).\n    *   **Negative Signal (CH₂):** The signal at **δ 43.5** must be the CH₂ group.\n    *   **Positive Signals (CH and CH₃):** This leaves five positive signals.\n        *   The aliphatic signals at **δ 49.6** and **δ 19.2** correspond to the CH and CH₃ groups, respectively.\n        *   The aromatic signals at **δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3** must account for the remaining three positive signals. This indicates that the five CH protons of the benzene ring correspond to only three distinct carbon signals due to accidental chemical shift equivalence (a common occurrence).\n\n### 5. HSQC Spectroscopy\n\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals.\n*   **Aromatic region:** The proton signals around δ 7.2 ppm correlate with the carbon signals between δ 126-129 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic region:**\n    *   The ¹H signal at δ ~2.8 ppm (2H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 43.5** (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The ¹H signal at δ ~2.7 ppm (1H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 49.6** (the CH group).\n    *   The ¹H signal at δ ~1.2 ppm (3H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 19.2** (the CH₃ group).\n\n### 6. Structure Elucidation\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural components:\n*   A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   A propyl-amine side chain containing a CH₂ group, a CH group, a CH₃ group, and an NH₂ group.\n\nLet's assemble these pieces. The side chain is C₃H₈N.\n*   The fragments are -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n*   The ¹H NMR suggests a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group (doublet at 1.2 ppm).\n*   The CH group is also next to the CH₂ group.\n*   This leads to the structure: **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N (Correct).\n*   **¹H NMR:** C₆H₅- (5H), -CH₂- (2H), -CH(NH₂)- (1H), -CH₃ (3H). Matches the integrations and general chemical shifts. The splitting patterns are also consistent (CH₃ is a doublet next to CH; CH₂ is a multiplet next to CH; CH is a multiplet next to CH₂ and CH₃).\n*   **¹³C NMR/DEPT:** Phenyl group (1 quaternary C, 5 CH C's giving 3 signals), -CH₂- (1 negative signal), -CH- (1 positive signal), -CH₃ (1 positive signal). This is fully consistent with the observed data (1 quaternary C, 1 negative CH₂, 5 positive CH/CH₃ signals).\n\nThe compound is identified as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, commonly known as amphetamine.\n\n### IUPAC Name\n\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain it is attached to is a three-carbon chain (propane). The numbering starts from the end closer to the phenyl group to give the substituent the lowest possible locant.\n*   Chain: Propane\n*   Amine group at position 2: Propan-2-amine\n*   Phenyl substituent at position 1: 1-Phenyl\n\nThus, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
