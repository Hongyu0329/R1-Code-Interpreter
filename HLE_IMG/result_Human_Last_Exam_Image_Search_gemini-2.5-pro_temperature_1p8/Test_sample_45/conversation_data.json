    "The tiling in the image exhibits **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be determined by identifying points in the pattern around which the entire tiling can be rotated to coincide with its original position. In this specific tessellation, there are two such distinct centers of 6-fold rotation:\n\n*   **The center of each dark blue hexagon:** If the pattern is rotated around the central point of any of these hexagons, it will align perfectly with its initial layout after a rotation of 60 degrees (360 degrees / 6).\n*   **The vertices where six of the light-yellow, irregularly shaped hexagons meet:** These points also serve as centers for 6-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the tiling by 60 degrees around these vertices results in the pattern mapping onto itself.\n\nThe presence of these 6-fold rotation centers defines the overall rotational symmetry of the pattern. While other points with lower rotational symmetries (like 2-fold) exist, the highest order of rotation dictates the classification. Such patterns with 6-fold rotational symmetry are common in geometric art and are classified under the wallpaper group p6 or p6m in crystallography.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
