    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we first need to establish its recurrence relation. A recurrence relation defines the algorithm's running time for an input of size `n` in terms of its running time on smaller inputs.\n\nThe provided pseudocode is:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's break down the operations for `sort(a, n)` when `n > 1`:\n1.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: A recursive call is made for a problem of size `n - 1`.\n2.  **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(...)`**: This involves a single comparison and, at most, one swap. These are constant time operations, which can be represented as O(1).\n3.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: Another identical recursive call is made for a problem of size `n - 1`.\n\nIf we denote the time complexity for an input of size `n` as T(n), the recurrence relation can be written as:\n**T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)**\n\nThis relation indicates that the time to solve a problem of size `n` is twice the time to solve a problem of size `n - 1`, plus some constant amount of work. This is a classic recurrence relation often associated with the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nTo solve this, we can expand the recurrence:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c\n*   ...and so on.\n\nFollowing this pattern, after `k` expansions, we get:\nT(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c\n\nThe recursion stops at the base case, which is `n = 1`. This occurs when `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to 2^n.\n\n**Conclusion:** The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
