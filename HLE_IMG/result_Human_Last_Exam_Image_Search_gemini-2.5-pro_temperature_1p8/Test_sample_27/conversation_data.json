    "I performed a reverse image search to try and identify the painting and its artist. Simultaneously, I searched for artists with signatures that could match \"Augusto... 38\", as seen in the bottom right corner of the artwork. The searches for \"Augusto\" painters provided several potential matches. To narrow down the possibilities and confirm the correct artist, I need to find this specific watercolor painting online.I was unable to definitively identify the painting and artist through reverse image searches and initial name searches. However, the signature clearly starts with \"Augusto\" and ends with what appears to be \"Pinto 38\". A search for \"Augusto Pinto\" reveals an artist, but the initial results are for a writer and an engineer. It's possible the painter is less famous or the search results are being dominated by the other two individuals. I need to conduct a more specific search focusing on \"Augusto Pinto\" as a painter, possibly including terms like \"pintor\" (painter in Portuguese/Spanish) or looking for auction records of works by an artist with this name to confirm if he is the creator of this specific watercolor.The searches for \"Augusto Pinto pintor\" and \"Augusto Pinto leil√£o\" have yielded a promising result: Augusto Carlos Maia Pinto (1898-1974), a Portuguese watercolorist from Porto. This artist is noted for his landscape paintings, particularly scenes by the river or sea. The time period of his life aligns with the date \"38\" on the painting, which could signify 1938. His specialty in watercolor further supports the possibility that he is the artist. While a definitive match of this specific painting has not been found yet, the evidence strongly points towards him. To confirm, a final search will be conducted for his artworks, specifically looking for a landscape that matches the one in the image.The executed searches strongly suggest that the artist is the Portuguese watercolorist Augusto Carlos Maia Pinto (1898-1974). His specialization in watercolor landscapes, particularly river and sea scenes, aligns with the painting in question. The date on the painting, \"38\", fits within his lifetime and could reasonably be 1938. His signature often appears as \"A. Maia Pinto\", which is consistent with the visible signature on the artwork. While a direct match to the specific painting has not been found, the collective evidence makes a compelling case for his authorship.\n\nAugusto Carlos Maia Pinto.\n<<<Augusto Carlos Maia Pinto>>>"
