    "Based on detailed analysis of the artwork, the individual depicted is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nThis image is a well-known fresco from the King's Church (the Church of Saints Joachim and Anne) in the Studenica Monastery in Serbia. The church was founded by the Serbian King Milutin, and its frescoes were painted around the year 1314 by the Greek painters Michael Astrapas and Eutychios.\n\nThe fresco is located on the north wall of the nave and is part of a collection considered to be masterpieces of the Palaiologan era. The depiction shows Saint Simeon with a long, forked beard and holding a scroll, which are characteristic features in some representations of this saint. While many ascetic saints are shown with scrolls, this particular artistic style, combined with the location, confirms the identity as Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
