    "Based on an analysis of the provided ECG rhythm strip, the longest R-R interval is approximately 1.76 seconds.\n\nThis is determined by the following steps:\n*   **ECG Paper Speed**: The recording speed is listed as 25 mm/sec at the top of the strip.\n*   **Time Calculation**: At a speed of 25 mm/sec, each small 1 mm square on the grid represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds.\n*   **Locating the Interval**: The longest pause between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes) occurs on the fourth line of the tracing, which starts near the timestamp 0:06:08.\n*   **Measurement**: The interval in question spans approximately 8 large squares and 4 small squares.\n*   **Calculation**: The total duration is calculated as (8 large squares × 0.2 seconds/large square) + (4 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square) = 1.6 seconds + 0.16 seconds = 1.76 seconds.\n\n<<<1.76>>>"
