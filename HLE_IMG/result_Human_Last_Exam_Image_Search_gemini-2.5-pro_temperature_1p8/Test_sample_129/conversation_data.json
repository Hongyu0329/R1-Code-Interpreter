    "The protein structure shown in the image corresponds to the PDB entry **1YCR**, which is the complex of the **MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain**.\n\nThe structure contains two chains from *Homo sapiens*:\n*   **Chain A (dark blue)** is a 109-amino acid segment of the **MDM2 protein**. This protein is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a crucial role in regulating the p53 tumor suppressor by targeting it for degradation.\n*   **Chain B (light blue)** is a 15-amino acid peptide from the transactivation domain of the **p53 tumor suppressor**.\n\nThe interaction between these two proteins is significant in cancer research. MDM2 binds to and inactivates p53, thereby inhibiting p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The structure reveals that this binding is achieved by the insertion of key hydrophobic amino acids from the p53 helix into a cleft on the surface of MDM2. Because MDM2 is often amplified in various tumors, it is a target for cancer therapy.\n\n<<<MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain>>>"
