    "The picture was taken in the RBC Convention Centre in Winnipeg, Canada.\n\nThe key architectural features in the image, a distinctive geometric lattice ceiling and panels of blue dotted glass, are signatures of the convention centre's City View Room. This space is located on the third floor of the facility.\n\nThe unique ceiling design is described as being inspired by ice crystals and floe patterns. It is composed of 324 identical suspended modules that create the intricate geometric pattern seen in the photograph. The City View Room, where this ceiling is located, features floor-to-ceiling windows that offer panoramic views of downtown Winnipeg.\n\n<<<Winnipeg>>>"
