    "The Ancient Greek word in the image is **μθᾶλλον**.\n\nThis appears to be a scribal variation of the very common Ancient Greek adverb **μᾶλλον** (mâllon). The meaning of μᾶλλον is \"more\" or \"rather\".\n\nThe inclusion of the letter theta (θ) is unusual and likely a scribal error. In the copying of manuscripts, unintentional errors such as the insertion, omission, or substitution of letters were known to occur. The rest of the word's features, such as the initial mu, the circumflex accent on the alpha, the double lambda, and the ending, align perfectly with the standard form of μᾶλλον. This suggests that μᾶλλον was the intended word.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
