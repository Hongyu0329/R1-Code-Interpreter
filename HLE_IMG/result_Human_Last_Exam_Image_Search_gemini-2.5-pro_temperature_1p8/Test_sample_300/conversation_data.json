He is a master of fusing poetry, calligraphy, and painting in his works.\n\n5.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**: This oil painting is the celebrated work *Tajik Bride* (塔吉克新娘) created in 1983 by Jin Shangyi. It is considered a seminal piece of Neoclassicism in Chinese oil painting, noted for its blend of Western classical technique with an Eastern aesthetic sensibility.

Wu was known for depicting everyday life and landscapes in a style that merged Eastern and Western aesthetics.\n\n8.  **Li Keran (李可染)**: This landscape painting with red-sailed boats navigating through imposing cliffs is characteristic of Li Keran's style. A prominent 20th-century painter, he is famous for his innovative landscape works that often feature dramatic light and layered ink washes, a style he developed after numerous sketching trips, including to the Li River.\n\n9.  **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**: The painting of the single lobster (often referred to as a shrimp in the context of his work) is by Qi Baishi, one of the most well-known modern Chinese painters.
