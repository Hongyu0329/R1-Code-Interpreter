    "The final product of the reaction sequence is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the transformations:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that attaches the propanoyl group to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   Propiophenone reacts with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the ring at the position meta to the acyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n    *   Intermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces both the ketone and the aryl halide. The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂), and the bromine atom is removed from the benzene ring (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    *   Propylbenzene reacts with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator. This reaction specifically brominates the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring—because the intermediate benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance.\n    *   **Product:** 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
