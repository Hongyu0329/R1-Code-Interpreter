    "Here is the identification of the four rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and full of bubble-like holes, which are called vesicles. This texture is characteristic of scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock formed when gas-rich lava cools. Scoria is often basaltic in composition.\n\n*   **I: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)** This specimen is composed of various fragments of other rocks cemented together. This fragmental, or clastic, texture is typical of pyroclastic rocks, which are formed from explosive volcanic eruptions. When the fragments are primarily ash-sized, the rock is called tuff. If it contained larger, more angular blocks, it could be called a volcanic breccia. Given the mix of visible fragments in a finer matrix, it is likely a tuff.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This is a light-colored, fine-grained, and highly vesicular rock. These features are indicative of pumice, an extrusive igneous rock. Pumice is essentially a glassy froth formed by the very rapid cooling of gas-rich lava, and it is known for being so lightweight due to the high volume of vesicles that it can often float.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which define a pegmatitic texture. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks that are known for their exceptionally large crystals, which are a result of very slow cooling of magma, often with a high water content. This specimen appears to be a granite pegmatite, composed of light-colored minerals like feldspar and quartz.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
