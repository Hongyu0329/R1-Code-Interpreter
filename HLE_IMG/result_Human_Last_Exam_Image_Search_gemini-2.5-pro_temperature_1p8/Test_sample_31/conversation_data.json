    "The knot in the picture is identified as the **8_20 knot** in the Rolfsen knot table. It is also known as the pretzel knot P(3, -3, 2).\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a knot invariant that provides information about the topology of the knot, specifically a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus. For the 8_20 knot, the Rasmussen invariant is **0**.\n\n<<<0>>>"
