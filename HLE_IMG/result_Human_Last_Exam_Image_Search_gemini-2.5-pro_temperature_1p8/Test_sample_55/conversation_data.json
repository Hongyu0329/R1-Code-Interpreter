    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397 constitute a secondary dominant chord.\n\nThe key of the piece is D minor. The chord in question consists of the notes E, G-sharp, and B. This forms an E major triad in root position.\n\nIn the context of D minor, the dominant chord (V) is A major. The E major chord functions as the dominant of A major, leading strongly to the A major chord that appears in the following measure (measure 9). Therefore, the accurate Roman numeral for this chord is V/V, which reads as \"five of five\".\n\nThis harmonic progression is a common way to build tension and lead to the dominant chord before resolving back to the tonic. An analysis of the piece confirms that the E major chord in measure 8 serves as the \"dominant of the dominant\".\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
