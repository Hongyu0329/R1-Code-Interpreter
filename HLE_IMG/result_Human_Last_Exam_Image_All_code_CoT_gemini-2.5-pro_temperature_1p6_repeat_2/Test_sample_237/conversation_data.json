    "Of course, I can help with that. Based on the visual characteristics of the insect in the image, I can identify the animal and its scientific name.\n\nThe image shows an insect with a black body, a distinct reddish-orange heart-shaped or band-like marking at the base of its wing covers (elytra), and long, segmented antennae. These are characteristic features of a longhorn beetle from the family Cerambycidae. Specifically, it strongly resembles the Rufous-shouldered Longhorn Beetle.\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal = True\n  common_name = \"Rufous-shouldered Longhorn Beetle\"\n  scientific_name = \"Anaglyptus mysticus\"\n\n  if is_animal:\n    print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    print(f\"It is an insect, likely a {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The animal's scientific name is {scientific_name}.\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal could be identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Anaglyptus mysticus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
