    "Here is my plan to identify the island where the plant was endemic:\n1.  First, I will analyze the visual characteristics of the plant in the image. It has distinctive dark green leaves with a prominent, light-colored, net-like vein pattern (reticulate venation). The leaves appear to be arranged in a whorl at the tip of the stem.\n2.  Based on these features, I will search for plants with similar foliage. The unique venation is the most striking feature.\n3.  My initial search points towards species like *Helwingia* or *Daphniphyllum*, but these are native to mainland Asia, not endemic to a single island.\n4.  The phrasing of the question, \"was endemic,\" suggests the plant might be extinct or its range has changed. This is a crucial clue.\n5.  I will refine my search to look for extinct plants from islands that match the visual description. This leads me to the Saint Helena Olive, *Nesiota elliptica*.\n6.  I will verify this identification by comparing images and descriptions of *Nesiota elliptica* with the plant in the photo. The leaf shape, whorled arrangement, prominent venation, and its history match perfectly.\n7.  *Nesiota elliptica* was endemic to the island of Saint Helena and is now unfortunately extinct.\n8.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island to which the plant in the image was endemic.\n    The plant is the Saint Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica).\n    This species was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
