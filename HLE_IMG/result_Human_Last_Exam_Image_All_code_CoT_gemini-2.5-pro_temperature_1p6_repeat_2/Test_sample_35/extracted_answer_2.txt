The specific receptor domain for which S100B shows affinity is the extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. S100B can be used as a prognostic marker because its overexpression actively drives pathological processes like neuroinflammation and apoptosis, meaning its levels can be used to predict the course and severity of the neurological disorder.
