    explanation = """Based on the provided diagram and information, here is the analysis:

1.  **Receptor Identification:**
    The protein being investigated, S100B, exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). The diagram shows S100B binding directly to the extracellular portion of the RAGE receptor, which is composed of the V, C1, and C2 immunoglobulin-like domains.

2.  **Marker Role (Adjunct vs. Prognostic):**
    S100B should be considered a **prognostic marker**. Here's the reasoning:
    - An adjunct marker typically aids in diagnosis, confirming the presence of a disease alongside other tests.
    - A prognostic marker, however, provides information about the likely course and outcome of a disease.
    - The diagram illustrates that the binding of S100B to RAGE is not just a correlational event but a causative one. It actively triggers downstream signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead directly to the core pathologies of neurological disorders: neuroinflammation, apoptosis (neuronal cell death), and overall neurodegeneration.
    - Because the concentration of S100B directly drives the severity of these damaging processes, measuring its levels can be used to predict the future progression and severity of the disorder. This predictive capacity is the defining characteristic of a prognostic marker.
