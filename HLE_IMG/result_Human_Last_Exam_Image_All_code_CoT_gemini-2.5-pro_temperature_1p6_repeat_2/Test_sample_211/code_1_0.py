    This function identifies the bird that matches the target image.

    To solve this, I performed a detailed visual comparison:
    1.  I analyzed the feather patterns on the target bird, specifically the unique scalloping on its back and the distinctive stripes on its wings.
    2.  I looked for any unique irregularities or "fingerprints." On the target image, there is a subtle, slightly darker patch and a minor disruption in the scalloped pattern on the upper back, just to the right of the bird's centerline.
    3.  I compared this specific detail with all the options from A to I.
    4.  Image E is the only image that perfectly replicates this specific pattern irregularity, in addition to having the same overall posture, shape, and feather arrangement as the target bird.
    5.  Therefore, image E shows the same individual as the target image.
