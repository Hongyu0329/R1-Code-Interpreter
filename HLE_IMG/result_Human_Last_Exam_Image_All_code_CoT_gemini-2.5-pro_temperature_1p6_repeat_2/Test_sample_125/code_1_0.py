# Step 1: Suzuki cross-coupling to form the C32 precursor backbone.
step_1 = 1

# Step 2: First intramolecular cyclization (Scholl reaction) to form an intermediate polycyclic system.
step_2 = 1

# Step 3: Final double intramolecular cyclization (harsher Scholl reaction) to yield the target molecule.
step_3 = 1

# Calculate the total minimum number of steps
total_steps = step_1 + step_2 + step_3

# Print the equation representing the sum of steps
print(f"{step_1} + {step_2} + {step_3} = {total_steps}")

# Print the final answer clearly
print(f"The minimum number of steps required is {total_steps}.")
