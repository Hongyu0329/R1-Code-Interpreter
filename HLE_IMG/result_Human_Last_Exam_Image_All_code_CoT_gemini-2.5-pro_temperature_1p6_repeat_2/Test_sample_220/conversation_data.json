    "Answering this question requires knowledge of crystallography and how crystal structures appear when viewed from different directions (projections).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Target Structure:** First, I need to know what a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice looks like when viewed along the `[110]` direction.\n2.  **Theoretical Pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the `[110]` axis results in a 2D pattern called a **centered rectangular lattice**. In this pattern, atoms are located at the corners of a rectangle, with an additional atom situated at the exact center of the rectangle. The ratio of the side lengths of this rectangle is âˆš2 : 1.\n3.  **Analyze the Images:** I will examine each of the four images (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches this theoretical centered rectangular pattern.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the visual patterns in the images with the expected pattern, I can identify the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n*   **Image A:** The arrangement of atoms does not form a simple or centered rectangular pattern. It appears somewhat irregular or represents a different, more complex projection.\n*   **Image C:** This image displays a **simple rectangular lattice**. You can see atoms forming rectangles, but there are no atoms at the center of these rectangles.\n*   **Image D:** Similar to image C, this also shows a **simple rectangular lattice**, with different spacing. It lacks the centering atom required for the FCC [110] view.\n*   **Image B:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular pattern**. For example, one can identify a rectangle formed by atoms at coordinates approximately `(1, 3)`, `(6, 3)`, `(1, 9)`, and `(6, 9)`. The center of this rectangle would be at `( (1+6)/2, (3+9)/2 ) = (3.5, 6)`. There is indeed an atom at this central position in the image. This matches the characteristic pattern for an FCC [110] projection.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, Image B is the only one that displays the correct centered rectangular structure.\n\n```python\ndef identify_fcc_110_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the correct image for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction\n    # is a centered rectangular pattern.\n    # Let's analyze the options based on this fact.\n    analysis = {\n        'A': 'Pattern is not a clear rectangular lattice.',\n        'B': 'Shows a centered rectangular pattern. Atoms are at the corners and the center of rectangles.',\n        'C': 'Shows a simple rectangular pattern (no centering atom).',\n        'D': 'Shows a simple rectangular pattern (no centering atom).'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = 'B'\n\n    print(\"Which of these crystal lattice patterns indicates a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction?\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis of the options:\")\n    for option, desc in analysis.items():\n        print(f\"- Image {option}: {desc}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction is a centered rectangular lattice.\")\n    print(f\"Only Image {correct_answer} exhibits this specific arrangement.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is {correct_answer}.\")\n\nidentify_fcc_110_projection()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
