    "Based on my analysis of the images, the process being depicted is the formation of a new branch from a fungal filament. This is a biological process and does not require calculation. I will provide a Python script that prints the explanation of this process.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze the images**: The three panels, labeled L, M, and N, show a time-lapse sequence of a filamentous structure under a microscope. This structure is segmented, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha (the basic cellular unit of a fungus).\n2.  **Observe the changes**:\n    *   In panel **L**, we see a relatively straight hyphal filament. An arrowhead points to a septum (the cross-wall between cells).\n    *   In panel **M**, the hypha is slightly bent. At the point indicated by the arrowhead, a small bulge is emerging from the side of a cell.\n    *   In panel **N**, the hypha is more bent, and the bulge from panel M has developed into a distinct new side branch. The arrowhead continues to highlight this point of new growth.\n3.  **Identify the process**: The sequence L -> M -> N clearly illustrates the initiation and early development of a new lateral branch from an existing hypha. This biological process is known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to grow, expand their network (mycelium), and explore their environment.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that, when run, will print out this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef describe_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints an explanation of the process shown in the provided images.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal Branching\"\n  structure_name = \"fungal hypha\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image sequence is: {process_name}\")\n  print(\"\\n--- Step-by-Step Observation ---\")\n  print(f\"The images show a time-lapse of a {structure_name}, a filamentous structure composed of cells.\")\n  \n  # Describing image L\n  image_l_desc = \"Panel L shows the initial state of the hypha. It is straight, and the arrowhead points to a septum between cells.\"\n  print(f\"1. Image L: {image_l_desc}\")\n  \n  # Describing image M\n  image_m_desc = \"Panel M shows the initiation of a new branch. A small bulge is forming on the side of a cell, highlighted by the arrowhead.\"\n  print(f\"2. Image M: {image_m_desc}\")\n  \n  # Describing image N\n  image_n_desc = \"Panel N shows the further development of this branch. The bulge has grown into a new, distinct lateral branch.\"\n  print(f\"3. Image N: {image_n_desc}\")\n  \n  print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n  print(\"The entire sequence illustrates how a fungus creates a new branch from an existing filament. This allows the fungal network (mycelium) to expand.\")\n\n# Run the function to get the explanation\ndescribe_biological_process()\n```\n<<<The process is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new lateral branch from a fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
