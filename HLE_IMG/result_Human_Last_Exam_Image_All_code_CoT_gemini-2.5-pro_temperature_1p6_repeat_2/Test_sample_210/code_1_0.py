    # Key features of the Target Nyala:
    # 1. Horn shape: A specific lyre-shape with a distinct smooth curve on the left horn.
    # 2. Stripe pattern: A unique pattern of ~10-12 thin vertical stripes.
    # 3. Spot pattern: A characteristic cluster of white spots on the rear flank.

    # Comparing with the options:
    # A: Horns are different (shorter, less curved). Likely a different, younger individual.
    # B: Spots are similar, but horn shape is hard to confirm.
    # C: Horns and stripe pattern are clearly different.
    # D: The horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot cluster on the flank are all an excellent match to the target.
    # E: Has a distinct white marking on its front leg, which the target lacks.
    # F: Partially obscured, but what is visible does not provide a better match than D.

    # The most conclusive match is D based on the identical horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot pattern.
