    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we first need to determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit. Then, we can use Ohm's Law (I = V/R) to calculate the current.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit branches:** The circuit can be broken down into two main branches connected in parallel to the voltage source V2.\n2.  **Simplify Branch 1 (left side):** This branch contains resistors R1, R2, and R3. Due to the wiring, R1 and R3 are short-circuited. A wire from the positive terminal bypasses R1, and a wire connects the node between R2 and R3 directly to the negative terminal (ground), bypassing R3. Therefore, the only effective resistance in this branch is R2.\n3.  **Simplify Branch 2 (right side):** This branch contains resistors R7 and R8, which are connected in series. Their equivalent resistance is simply their sum.\n4.  **Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance (Req):** The two simplified branches are in parallel. We'll use the formula for parallel resistors to find the total equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.\n5.  **Calculate Total Current (I_total):** Using Ohm's Law, we'll divide the source voltage (V2) by the total equivalent resistance (Req) to find the total current.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to solve for the total current.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total current flowing from the voltage source in the given circuit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given values from the circuit diagram ---\n    V2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\n    R1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\n    R2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\n    R3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\n    R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n    R8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n    # --- Step 1: Simplify the first branch ---\n    # R1 and R3 are short-circuited by the wires connected in parallel to them.\n    # Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the left branch is just R2.\n    req_branch1 = R2\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the left branch.\")\n    print(f\"Resistors R1 ({R1} Ω) and R3 ({R3} Ω) are short-circuited.\")\n    print(f\"The equivalent resistance of this branch is R2 = {req_branch1} Ω.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Simplify the second branch ---\n    # R7 and R8 are in series.\n    req_branch2 = R7 + R8\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the right branch.\")\n    print(\"Resistors R7 and R8 are in series.\")\n    print(f\"The equivalent resistance is R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {req_branch2} Ω.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate total equivalent resistance ---\n    # The two branches are in parallel.\n    req_total = (req_branch1 * req_branch2) / (req_branch1 + req_branch2)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req).\")\n    print(\"The two branches are in parallel.\")\n    print(f\"Req = ({req_branch1} * {req_branch2}) / ({req_branch1} + {req_branch2}) = {req_total:.4f} Ω.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate total current using Ohm's Law ---\n    i_total = V2 / req_total\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the total current (I_total) using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\")\n    # Using sys.stdout.write to prevent the print function from adding an extra newline\n    # so the <<<answer>>> tag appears on the same line as the final result.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"I_total = {V2} V / {req_total:.4f} Ω = {i_total:.4f} A\")\n    \n    # Return the raw value for the final answer tag\n    return i_total\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    result = solve_circuit()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{result:.4f}>>>\")\n\n```"
