    "Based on a visual analysis, the provided image shows the emission spectrum of an element. Each element has a unique spectral fingerprint, which allows for its identification. By comparing the pattern of the spectral lines (their colors and positions) in the image to known reference spectra, we can determine the element.\n\nThe key features in the provided spectrum are:\n1.  A prominent line in the deep blue/violet region.\n2.  A very strong, bright line in the green region.\n3.  A distinct pair of lines in the yellow-orange region.\n4.  Several other lines across the blue, green, and red parts of the spectrum.\n\nThis specific pattern, particularly the combination of a strong blue line (~436 nm), a very strong green line (~546 nm), and a strong yellow doublet (~577/579 nm), is the characteristic signature of the element Mercury (Hg).\n\nThe following Python code simulates this identification process by comparing a set of observed prominent lines from the image against a small database of known spectral lines for different elements.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its observed spectral lines to a database of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Database of prominent visible spectral lines for various elements (wavelengths in nm).\n    spectral_database = {\n        'Hydrogen': [410, 434, 486, 656],\n        'Helium': [447, 502, 588, 668],\n        'Sodium': [589, 590],\n        'Mercury': [405, 436, 546, 577, 579],\n        'Neon': [633, 640, 651, 660]\n    }\n\n    # Prominent lines identified from the image (estimated wavelengths in nm).\n    # These are the most characteristic lines: a strong blue, a very strong green, and a strong yellow.\n    observed_lines = [436, 546, 578]\n\n    # Tolerance for matching wavelengths (in nm).\n    tolerance = 5\n\n    print(\"Identifying element from spectral lines.\")\n    print(f\"Observed prominent lines (nm): {observed_lines}\\n\")\n\n    best_match_element = None\n    max_matches = -1\n\n    # Compare observed lines with the database\n    for element, known_lines in spectral_database.items():\n        matches = 0\n        for obs_line in observed_lines:\n            for known_line in known_lines:\n                if abs(obs_line - known_line) <= tolerance:\n                    matches += 1\n                    # A single observed line can only match one group of known lines\n                    break\n        \n        print(f\"Checking {element}: Found {matches}/{len(observed_lines)} matches.\")\n        \n        if matches > max_matches:\n            max_matches = matches\n            best_match_element = element\n\n    # Announce the final result\n    if best_match_element and max_matches == len(observed_lines):\n        print(\"\\n--- Identification Complete ---\")\n        print(f\"The best match is {best_match_element}.\")\n        print(\"This is confirmed by matching the observed lines to the reference lines:\")\n        \n        mercury_ref_lines = spectral_database['Mercury']\n        print(f\"Observed Blue Line ({observed_lines[0]} nm) matches Mercury's reference line at {mercury_ref_lines[1]} nm.\")\n        print(f\"Observed Green Line ({observed_lines[1]} nm) matches Mercury's reference line at {mercury_ref_lines[2]} nm.\")\n        print(f\"Observed Yellow Line ({observed_lines[2]} nm) matches Mercury's reference doublet at {mercury_ref_lines[3]}/{mercury_ref_lines[4]} nm.\")\n\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nCould not find a conclusive match.\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Mercury>>>"
