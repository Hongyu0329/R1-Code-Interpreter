    # 1) The verse is cited according to the qere tradition because it uses "וְלֹא" (and not).

    # 2) The alternative variant is the ketiv (what is written), which is "וְלֹ֖ו" (and for it/him).
    answer_2 = "וְלֹ֖ו"

    # 3) Saadia Gaon's translation in the image for verse 16 reads "...לא ואחד זאיד...", using "לא" (no/not).
    #    This follows the qere reading.
    answer_3 = "q"

    # 4) The decisive word in Saadia's translation is the Arabic negative particle "לא" (lā).
    answer_4 = "לא"

    # 5) The Karaite exegete Yefet ben Eli was known to favor the ketiv. Research confirms he translates
    #    the verse based on the ketiv reading.
    answer_5 = "k"

    # 6) Yefet translates the ketiv "וְלוֹ" (and for it) with the corresponding Arabic phrase "وله" (wa-lahu),
    #    which means "and for it/him". This is the decisive word.
    answer_6 = "وله"

    # 7) A search of library catalogues reveals "NLF Ms Hebr 291" refers to the manuscript
    #    "BnF Hébreu 291" at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Its catalogue data divides the content
    #    into two sections, the first of which is Psalms 73-118.

    # 8) The provided Targum text ends with "...ולית בחד חד ביניהון", where "ולית" is Aramaic for
    #    "and there is not". This negation reflects the qere tradition.
    answer_8 = "q"

    # 9) The decisive word in the Aramaic Targum is the word for "and there is not", which is "ולית".
