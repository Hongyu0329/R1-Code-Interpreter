    Identifies the alkaloid from its structural image.

    The structure shown is a tetracyclic (four-ring) system.
    Key features include:
    - A quinolizidine core (two fused six-membered rings sharing a nitrogen).
    - Two nitrogen atoms in total.
    - One carbonyl group (C=O) as part of a lactam (an amide in a cyclic ring).
    - Specific stereochemistry indicated by wedged and dashed bonds.

    This specific combination of features corresponds to a well-known lupin alkaloid.
