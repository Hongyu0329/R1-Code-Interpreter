    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I can identify its genus. The organism is a thallose liverwort, characterized by its flat, dichotomously branching growth form that creates a distinctive web-like mat on the tree bark. This morphology is a hallmark of the genus *Metzgeria*.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the genus of the epiphytic species in the image.\n  The species is a thallose liverwort with a characteristic web-like,\n  dichotomously branching pattern on the bark.\n  \"\"\"\n  genus = \"Metzgeria\"\n  print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
