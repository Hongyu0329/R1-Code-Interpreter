  Analyzes the image and determines the best answer choice.
  The image shows a woman holding an overflowing arrangement of natural items.
  This collection includes:
  - A large red flower.
  - Other smaller flowers and foliage.
  - A piece of reddish fruit.
  - The arrangement is abundant and spilling from her lap.

  Let's evaluate the choices:
  A. red roses: Incomplete. She holds more than just flowers.
  B. fruit and flowers: Correct, but general.
  C. a cornucopia of fruit and flowers: This is the most descriptive answer. A "cornucopia"
     refers to an abundant, overflowing supply, which perfectly matches the visual.
  D. a teardrop: This refers to a single, small element in the composition.
  E. a moth under glass: This is a minor, speculative detail.

  Therefore, the best answer is C.
