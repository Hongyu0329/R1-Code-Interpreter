    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by analyzing the molecular structures of the four complexes. The key to determining the lifetime of these emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) lies in their chemical stability.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the general structure:** All four molecules are Iridium(III) complexes with two cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands (C^N) and one bipyridine-type ligand (N^N). This is a common and robust structure for phosphorescent emitters.\n2.  **Identify structural differences:** The key difference between the four complexes is the position of fluorine (F) substituents on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n3.  **Relate structure to stability:** The stability of these complexes, and thus their operational lifetime in a device, is highly dependent on the strength of the bonds between the iridium center and the ligands, especially the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) sigma bond.\n4.  **Evaluate steric effects:** Substituents placed at the \"ortho\" position of the phenyl ring (the position adjacent to the Ir-C bond) can cause steric hindrance (a \"clash\") with other ligands around the central iridium atom. This steric strain weakens the Ir-C bond.\n5.  **Conclusion:** A weaker Ir-C bond makes the complex more prone to degradation, leading to a shorter operational lifetime. Therefore, complexes with ortho-substituents will have shorter lifetimes.\n6.  **Apply to the specific complexes:**\n    *   **Complex 1 & 2:** The fluorine atoms are on the phenyl ring but are not in the ortho position relative to the Ir-C bond. They do not cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **Complex 3 & 4:** Both complexes have a fluorine atom in the ortho position of the phenyl ring, adjacent to the Ir-C bond. This will introduce steric strain.\n7.  **Final Deduction:** Complexes [3] and [4] are expected to be less stable and therefore have shorter lifetimes.\n\nI will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and identify the correct complexes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes to predict their lifetime in LECs.\n\n    The stability and lifetime of these complexes are primarily affected by steric hindrance\n    around the Iridium metal center.
