    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to determine the time (in seconds) corresponding to the center of each major synchronized burst of activity. These are the dense vertical bands where many electrodes fire at once.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps identified in the previous step.\n3.  **Compute the Average IBI:** I will then calculate the average of all the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final average will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations, clearly showing the identified timestamps, the calculation of the intervals, and the final average.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 1. Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# By visual inspection, the center of each major burst occurs at approximately these times in seconds.\nburst_timestamps = [4, 15, 25, 36, 47]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# 2. Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The interval is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\nintervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"Calculating the inter-burst intervals (s):\")\nfor i in range(len(intervals)):\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {intervals[i]} s\")\nprint(f\"\\nAll intervals: {intervals.tolist()} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# 3. Compute the average IBI.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(intervals)\n\n# 4. Display the final calculation equation.\n# We build a string to show how the average was calculated.\nnumerator_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals))\nequation = f\"Average IBI = ({numerator_str}) / {len(intervals)}\"\nprint(\"Calculation for the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"{equation} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# 5. Round the result to two significant figures.\n# For 10.75, the two significant figures are 1 and 0. The next digit is 7,\n# so we round up, resulting in 11.\naverage_ibi_rounded = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"The final average inter-burst interval, rounded to two significant figures, is {average_ibi_rounded} s.\")\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
