    This function identifies the matching giraffe based on visual analysis.

    Analysis Steps:
    1.  Observe the 'Target' giraffe's spot pattern. Key features include a distinctive
        checkmark-shaped pattern above the front shoulder and a specific arrangement of
        large spots along the spine.
    2.  Compare this pattern with the options:
        - A: Lighter color, different pattern.
        - B: The checkmark pattern and the spots along the spine are a clear match. The overall
             size, shape, and placement of the visible spots correspond perfectly to the target.
        - C: Lighter color, rounder spots, pattern does not match.
        - D: Much larger, blockier spots, pattern does not match.
        - E: Different spot shapes and arrangement, no checkmark pattern.
        - F: Blurry spots, different pattern.
    3.  Conclusion: Image B is the correct match.
