    "The image you've provided illustrates a classic auditory illusion.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the image.** The image contains two plots. The bottom plot is a waveform, representing sound amplitude over time. The top plot is a spectrogram, representing the frequency content of the sound over time.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the plots.** Initially, the plots show a pure tone, represented by a perfect sine wave and a single horizontal line on the spectrogram. This tone is then interrupted by a short burst of noise, which is visible as a complex, jagged section in the waveform and a vertical band covering a wide range of frequencies in the spectrogram. After the noise, the sound continues.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the perceptual phenomenon.** When a sound (like a tone or a spoken word) is interrupted by a sufficiently loud noise, listeners often perceive the original sound as continuing uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise. The brain fills in the missing auditory information. This effect is a powerful example of perceptual restoration.\n*   **Step 4: Name the phenomenon.** This specific auditory illusion is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. A closely related phenomenon, specifically concerning speech, is called the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the perceptual phenomenon\n    illustrated by the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image shows a continuous tone interrupted by a burst of noise.\n    # The human brain typically perceives the tone as continuing through the noise,\n    # an illusion known as the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n\n    print(f\"The name of the phenomenon shown in the image is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
