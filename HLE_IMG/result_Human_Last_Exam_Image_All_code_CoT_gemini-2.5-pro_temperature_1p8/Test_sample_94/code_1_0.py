# Step 1: Define knowns from the conversation with AGI
monte_carlo_samples = [730, 740, 735, 732, 739]
total_points = 1000
area_ratio_green_rect = 0.04

# Step 2: Calculate the average area ratio for circles from Monte Carlo data
avg_circle_points = sum(monte_carlo_samples) / len(monte_carlo_samples)
area_ratio_circles = avg_circle_points / total_points

# Step 3: Address the geometric contradiction
# A literal interpretation of the image shows 10 circles, which leads to a paradox where the
# length of the top row (6R + w) must equal the length of the middle row (8R + w), which is impossible.
# The only way to resolve this is to assume the number of circles per row is consistent,
# meaning 3 circles per row, for a total of N=9 circles.
N_circles = 9

# Step 4: Find the relationship between the radius (R) and the green rectangle width (w)
# From ratios: (Area_green / Area_total) / (Area_circles / Area_total) is known
# (w * h) / (N * pi * R^2) = area_ratio_green_rect / area_ratio_circles
# From image: h = 2R
# w * 2R / (N_circles * pi * R^2) = area_ratio_green_rect / area_ratio_circles
# w / R = (area_ratio_green_rect / area_ratio_circles) * (N_circles * pi / 2)

target_w_over_R = (area_ratio_green_rect / area_ratio_circles) * (N_circles * math.pi / 2)

# Step 5: Find the best integer pair (w, R) that matches this ratio
best_pair = (0, 1)
min_error = float('inf')

# We search for integer solutions for R and w
for R_candidate in range(1, 20):
    for w_candidate in range(1, 20):
        # The prompt says width and height are integers
        current_ratio = w_candidate / R_candidate
        error = abs(current_ratio - target_w_over_R)
        if error < min_error:
            min_error = error
            best_pair = (w_candidate, R_candidate)

w, R = best_pair
h = 2 * R

# Step 6: Calculate the outer rectangle dimensions based on the consistent geometry
# W = 3 rows * diameter_of_circle
# L = 3 * diameter_of_circle + width_of_green_rectangle
W = 6 * R
L = 6 * R + w
