    "This is a music identification task. Based on my analysis of the melody and chord progression from the sheet music, I can identify the jazz standard. The melody, starting with the notes F-G-Ab-G, and the chord progression in the key of F minor are characteristic of a well-known piece. I will use a simple Python script to display the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n    The analysis is based on the distinct melodic line and harmonic structure,\n    which are hallmarks of this specific composition.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Hot House\"\n    composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n    \n    print(f\"The title of the jazz standard is: {title}\")\n    print(f\"The composer of the piece is: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
