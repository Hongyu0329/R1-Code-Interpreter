    "Based on art historical analysis, the medallion in the image is a Roman gold piece from the era of the Tetrarchy. The figures are typically identified as the emperors Galerius (on the left, with the horns of Jupiter) and Maximinus Daia (on the right). Galerius's reign was from 305 AD to 311 AD. This firmly places the object's creation in the early 4th century AD.\n\nTo determine the century from a given year, we can use a simple calculation. I will use the representative year 310 AD for this calculation in the Python script below. The formula to find the century is `(year - 1) // 100 + 1`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_century_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the century for a given year and prints the process.\n    The medallion is dated to the reign of Roman Emperor Galerius (305-311 AD).\n    We will use a representative year, 310 AD, for the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 310\n    \n    # The formula to calculate the century from a year is (year - 1) // 100 + 1\n    # Step 1: Subtract 1 from the year\n    step1_val = year - 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Integer divide by 100\n    step2_val = step1_val // 100\n    \n    # Step 3: Add 1\n    century = step2_val + 1\n\n    print(f\"The medallion dates to approximately {year} A.D.\")\n    print(f\"To find the century, we calculate: ({year} - 1) // 100 + 1\")\n    print(f\"Which is: ({step1_val}) // 100 + 1\")\n    print(f\"Which is: {step2_val} + 1\")\n    print(f\"Resulting in the {century}th century A.D.\")\n\nsolve_century_calculation()\n```\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
