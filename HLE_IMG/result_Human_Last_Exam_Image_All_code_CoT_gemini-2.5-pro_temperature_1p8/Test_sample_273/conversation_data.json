    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we must analyze each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the three chiral centers in the molecule. For clarity, we will label them C2, C3, and C4 from left to right.\n2.  For each chiral center, determine the four groups attached to it.\n3.  Assign priorities (1=highest, 4=lowest) to these four groups based on atomic number.\n4.  Observe the 3D orientation of the groups from the drawing, paying special attention to the position of the lowest-priority group (priority 4).\n5.  Determine if the sequence from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (R) or counter-clockwise (S).\n6.  Apply the final rule:\n    *   If the lowest-priority group points away from the viewer (dashed bond), the configuration is as determined in step 5.\n    *   If the lowest-priority group points towards the viewer (wedged bond), the configuration is the opposite of what was determined in step 5.\n7.  Repeat for all three centers and state the final combined configuration.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step process for determining the absolute\n    configuration of the chiral centers in the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Introduction\n    print(\"To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to each of the three chiral centers.\")\n    print(\"We will label the chiral centers from left to right as C2, C3, and C4 for this explanation.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis for C2 ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Chiral Center C2 (leftmost, with -OH) ---\")\n    print(\"1.
