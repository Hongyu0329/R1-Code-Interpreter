    This script solves the riddle by identifying 'X Y'.
    
    Clue 1: 'X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.'
    The image shows a highly reflective, silver-plated trophy.
    This object can be described as a 'Silver Mirror'.

    Clue 2: 'Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.'
    The historical process for making mirrors involved using a toxic tin-mercury amalgam.
    This method has been almost entirely replaced, making 'Silver Mirror' fit this clue as well.
