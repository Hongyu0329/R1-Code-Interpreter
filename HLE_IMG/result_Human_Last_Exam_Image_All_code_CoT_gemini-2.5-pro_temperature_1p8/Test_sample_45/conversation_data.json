    "My plan is to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling by visual inspection and logical deduction.\n\n1.  **Understand Rotational Symmetry**: A shape or pattern has rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of symmetry is the number of times it looks the same in a full 360-degree rotation.\n2.  **Identify a Center of Rotation**: I will examine the provided image to find a point around which the pattern seems to be organized symmetrically. The most prominent candidates for centers of symmetry are the centers of the large blue decagons (10-sided polygons).\n3.  **Determine the Order**: Let's test the center of a decagon. A decagon itself has 10-fold symmetry. I will check if the entire pattern surrounding the decagon also aligns perfectly after a rotation corresponding to 10-fold symmetry.\n4.  **Calculate the Rotation Angle**: The angle of rotation for N-fold symmetry is 360 / N degrees. For 10-fold symmetry, this would be 360 / 10 = 36 degrees.\n5.  **Verify**: By mentally rotating the pattern by 36 degrees, I can confirm that every element in the tiling (decagons, pentagons, squares, rhombi) maps onto an identical element in a new position, leaving the overall pattern unchanged.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final numerical answer, showing the calculation involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the geometric pattern to find its rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(\"Rotational symmetry is determined by the number of times a pattern fits onto itself during a full 360-degree rotation.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the central repeating motif.\")\n    print(\"By observing the tiling, we can see prominent dark blue, 10-sided polygons (decagons) that act as centers of local symmetry.\")\n    print(\"Let's check if the entire pattern has a rotational symmetry centered on these decagons.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    order_of_symmetry = 10\n    total_degrees = 360\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Calculating the angle of rotation.\")\n    print(f\"A {order_of_symmetry}-sided regular polygon (decagon) suggests a {order_of_symmetry}-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation for the rotation angle is: total_degrees / order_of_symmetry\")\n    \n    angle_of_rotation = total_degrees / order_of_symmetry\n    \n    print(f\"So, the specific calculation is: {total_degrees} / {order_of_symmetry} = {int(angle_of_rotation)} degrees.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"Rotating the entire tiling by {int(angle_of_rotation)} degrees around the center of any decagon makes the pattern look identical to its original state.\")\n    print(\"This means the tiling possesses 10-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is:\")\n    print(order_of_symmetry)\n\n\nsolve_symmetry()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
