    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Baseline Car VMT:** For each trip distance category, we'll multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and then by the average trip distance. Summing these values across all distance categories gives the total weighted Baseline Car VMT.\n2.  **Calculate the Proposed Car VMT:** We will repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n3.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** The reduction is found by subtracting the Proposed VMT from the Baseline VMT, dividing by the Baseline VMT, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nThe formula for weighted VMT is:\n`VMT = Î£ (Share of Trips_i * Car Mode Share_i * Average Trip Distance_i)` for each distance category `i`.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Data from Table 1 (Baseline) and Table 2 (Proposed)\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\navg_trip_distances = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\ntrip_distance_labels = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n# Baseline car mode shares\nbaseline_car1_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\nbaseline_car2_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# Proposed car mode shares\nproposed_car1_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\nproposed_car2_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# --- 1.
