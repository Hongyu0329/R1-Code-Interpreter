    explanation = f"""The figure leaving the chariot is the Greek hero {identity}.

The scene depicted is the {event}, which represents his ascent to Mount Olympus to become a god following his earthly death. The key clues that lead to this identification are:

1.  The Nimbus: The figure has a large, pale circle, or nimbus, around his head. In Greek art, this is a clear symbol of divinity or deification.
2.  The Charioteer: He is being driven by {charioteer}, his divine patron who guided him throughout his life and is now escorting him to immortality.
3.  The Fallen Enemy: Below the chariot lies {fallen_figure}. His presence signifies the hero's past victories over formidable adversaries, which earned him his place among the gods.
4.  The Winged Figure: Flying above is {winged_figure}, who symbolizes the triumph of the hero over mortality.

These elements together confirm that the figure ascending from the chariot is Heracles at the moment of his transformation into a god."""
