    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.
    
    The clues are:
    1. The language is German (e.g., "Vorhang," "mit DÃ¤mpfer").
    2. The score is for a large, late-Romantic orchestra.
    3. The marking "(Vorhang)" indicates the music begins as the curtain rises.
    4. The user specifies it is the opening of the second act.

    to Act II of Richard Strauss's opera, "Der Rosenkavalier".
