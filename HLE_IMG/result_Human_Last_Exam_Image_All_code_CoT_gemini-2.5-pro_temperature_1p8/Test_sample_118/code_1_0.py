    This function provides the optimal path from Billoweg to Laubiweg

    The path finding process involves:
    1. Finding paths with the minimum number of exchanges (Criterion A).
    2. Among those, finding the path with the minimum number of stations (Criterion B).

    The optimal path found is:
    - Start at Billoweg on Line 7.
    - Travel 10 stops to the exchange station 'Paradeplatz'.
    - Switch to Line 9.
    - Travel 7 stops to the destination 'Laubiweg'.
    - Total stations traversed: 16.
