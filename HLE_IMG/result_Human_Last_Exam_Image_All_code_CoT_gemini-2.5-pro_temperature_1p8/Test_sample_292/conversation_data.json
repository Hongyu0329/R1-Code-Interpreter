    "This image displays the iconic glass ceiling of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, located in New York City. The distinctive architectural style, featuring a space frame with glass panels printed with a blue circular \"frit\" pattern, is a key feature of the center's recent expansion. This design is not only visually striking but also serves a functional purpose in managing light and heat. Therefore, the photograph was taken in New York City.\n\nI will provide a simple python script that declares the city name and prints it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_from_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city from the provided image.\n    The image shows the ceiling of the Jacob K.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
