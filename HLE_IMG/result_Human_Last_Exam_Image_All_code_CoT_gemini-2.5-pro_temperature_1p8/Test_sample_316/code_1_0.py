def solve_mapping():
    """
    This function solves the CA mapping puzzle based on visual feature analysis.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Characterize patterns A-H (long-term growth) and 1-8 (single-step evolution).
    2.  Match patterns based on distinctive features:
        -   Density: D is sparsest, H is densest. This maps D->3 and H->5.
        -   Texture: G has a unique checkerboard pattern, matching it to 1.
                       B has a unique chaotic pattern, matching it to 8.
    3.  Use relative density ranking to map the remaining, more similar patterns:
        -   Remaining A-H (ordered by density): A < E < F < C
        -   Remaining 1-8 (ordered by density): 4 < 7 < 2 < 6
        -   This implies: A->4, E->7, F->2, C->6.
    4.  Combine all matches to get the final mapping.
