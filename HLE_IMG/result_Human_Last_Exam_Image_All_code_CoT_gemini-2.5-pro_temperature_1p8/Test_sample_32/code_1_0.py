      "1. Grimmia montana: This species has a very short, straight seta. As a result, its capsule is held erect and is typically immersed or just emergent among the perichaetial leaves.\n\n"
      "2. Grimmia curviseta: As its specific name 'curviseta' implies ('curved seta'), this species is characterized by a longer, distinctly curved or arcuate seta. This curvature causes the capsule to be bent over, nodding, or even hidden on the side of the plant cushion."
