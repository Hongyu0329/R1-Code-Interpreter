    "To answer your question, I will identify the key distinguishing features of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* by referencing botanical information. The specific epithets (the second part of the scientific names) often provide strong clues about a species' characteristics. In this case, \"*curviseta*\" suggests a curved seta. I will compare this to the known characteristics of *Grimmia montana* to determine the main visual difference. The final answer will be presented in a Python script that prints the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_difference():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the main distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of\n  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  explanation = (\n      \"The primary difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish Grimmia montana from \"\n      \"Grimmia curviseta at a glance is the nature of the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule).\\n\\n\"\n      \"1. Grimmia montana: This species has a very short, straight seta. As a result, its capsule is held erect and is typically immersed or just emergent among the perichaetial leaves.\\n\\n\"\n      \"2. Grimmia curviseta: As its specific name 'curviseta' implies ('curved seta'), this species is characterized by a longer, distinctly curved or arcuate seta. This curvature causes the capsule to be bent over, nodding, or even hidden on the side of the plant cushion.\"\n  )\n  print(explanation)\n\nfind_difference()\n```\n<<<In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect, while in *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is longer and distinctly curved, causing the capsule to nod or be bent over.>>>"
