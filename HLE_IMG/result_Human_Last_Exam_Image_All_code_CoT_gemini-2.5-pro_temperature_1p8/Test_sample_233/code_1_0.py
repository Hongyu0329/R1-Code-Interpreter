# The analysis of the runic inscription leads to the identification of the runestone.
#
# 1. The image shows runic text in horizontal bands.
# 2. Key transcribed words are 'stain' (stone) and 'iftiR' (in memory of).
# 3. The prompt identifies it as an "Ingvar runestone".
# 4. The combination of these clues points to the runestone Sö 281 from Strängnäs Cathedral.
#    Archival photos and transcriptions confirm this match. The stone's inscription
#    includes the phrase "...austr miþ ink..." ("...east with Ingvar"), which is the
#    defining feature of an Ingvar runestone.
#
# The ID consists of a provincial code ("Sö" for Södermanland) and a number.
