    "An analysis of the coat of arms reveals several key features: a shield divided horizontally (per fess), with the top half blue (azure) bearing a yellow crescent moon (crescent or) and the bottom half yellow (or) bearing a black crab (crab sable). A search for coats of arms with this specific and distinctive combination of charges and tinctures leads to the city of Ochakiv in Ukraine. While the crown and surrounding wreath in the image are artistic embellishments, the central shield is nearly identical to the historical and current coat of arms of Ochakiv.\n\n```python\n# The plan is to identify the city based on the distinct heraldic elements shown in the image.\n# Step 1: Analyze the shield. It is divided horizontally (per fess).\n# The top field is blue (azure) and contains a yellow crescent moon (a crescent Or).\n# The bottom field is yellow (or) and contains a black crab (a crab Sable).\n# Step 2: Search for a municipal coat of arms with this combination.\n# The combination of a crab and a crescent moon on a blue and yellow field is very specific.\n# Step 3: The search points to the coat of arms of Ochakiv, a city in southern Ukraine.\n# Its coat of arms perfectly matches the description of the shield in the image.\n# Step 4: Conclude that the city in question is Ochakiv.\n# The following code will print the name of the identified city.\n\ndef find_city_by_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the city with a coat of arms\n    matching the visual description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key elements from the shield\n    top_color = \"Blue\"\n    top_charge = \"Crescent Moon\"\n    bottom_color = \"Gold\"\n    bottom_charge = \"Crab\"\n\n    # The city identified based on these heraldic elements\n    city_name = \"Ochakiv\"\n\n    print(f\"Based on the elements of the shield ({top_color} field with a {top_charge}, {bottom_color} field with a {bottom_charge}), the city is {city_name}.\")\n\nfind_city_by_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Ochakiv>>>"
