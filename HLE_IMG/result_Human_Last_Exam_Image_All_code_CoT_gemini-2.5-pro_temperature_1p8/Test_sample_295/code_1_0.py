# This problem does not require complex calculations, but I will outline the logic for clarity.
# 1. Analyze the polar plot for area PGp.
# 2. Identify significant connections (those extending beyond the inner black circle).
# 3. From the PGp plot, we can see significant connections to:
#    - Ig1 (Insula, yellow)
#    - Ig2 (Insula, yellow)
#    - 45 (Frontal lobe, light blue), which is BA45.
# 4. The set of true connections is {Ig1, Ig2, BA45}.
# 5. Now, we evaluate the given answer choices against this true set.
#    A. Middle anterior temporal areas, orbitofrontal areas, occipital areas -> 0/3 correct.
#    B. Frontal operculum, Insular area Id1, and lateral inferior occipital lobe -> 0/3 correct.
#    C. Insular area Id1, temporal poles, BA45 -> 1/3 correct (BA45).
#    D. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and BA45 -> 2/3 correct (Ig2, BA45). Incorrectly swaps Ig1 for Id1.
#    E. Lateral inferior occipital lobe, BA45, and frontal operculum -> 1/3 correct (BA45).
#    F. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and orbitofrontal areas -> 1/3 correct (Ig2).
#    G. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and Ig1 -> 2/3 correct (Ig1, Ig2). Incorrectly includes Id1 and omits BA45.
# 6. Both D and G contain two correct items. However, the strong connection to the posterior insula is a key feature, which involves BOTH Ig1 and Ig2.
# 7. Choice G is the only one that includes both correct insular connections {Ig1, Ig2}. It seems the question prioritizes identifying this cluster of connections.
# 8. Therefore, despite its flaws, G is the best answer among the choices.
