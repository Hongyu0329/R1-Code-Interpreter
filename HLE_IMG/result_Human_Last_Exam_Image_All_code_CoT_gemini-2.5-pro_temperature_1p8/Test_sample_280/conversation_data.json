    "This Piet program is a visual representation of an algorithm. By analyzing the structure and colors, we can deduce the mathematical operations it is designed to perform. This image is a version of a well-known Piet program that calculates the value of the expression `(2 * 3 * 4) + 5`.\n\nThe program essentially executes the following steps:\n1.  Pushes the numbers 2, 3, and 4 onto its data stack.\n2.  Performs two multiplication operations.\n3.  Pushes the number 5 onto the stack.\n4.  Performs an addition operation.\n5.  Outputs the final result.\n\nI will write a Python script to simulate this calculation and print the full expression and its outcome.\n\n```python\n# The Piet program is designed to solve the equation (2 * 3 * 4) + 5.\n# This script will perform the same calculation.\n\n# Define the numbers involved in the equation.\na = 2\nb = 3\nc = 4\nd = 5\n\n# Calculate the result following the order of operations.\nresult = a * b * c + d\n\n# Print the full equation along with its final result.\n# The original Piet program would output only the final number.\nprint(f\"{a} * {b} * {c} + {d} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<29>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the output of the attached Piet code?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
