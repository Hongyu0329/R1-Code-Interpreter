    "This image displays a carious lesion on the occlusal (biting) surface of a posterior tooth, specifically in the pits and fissures adjacent to an existing amalgam restoration. This type of decay is known as recurrent caries.\n\nAccording to G.V. Black's classification system, which categorizes cavities based on their location on the tooth surface, lesions in the pits and fissures of posterior teeth are designated as Class I. The presence of a prior restoration does not change this locational classification.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to outline G.V. Black's classifications and identify the one corresponding to the image.\n\n```python\ndef classify_caries_lesion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains G.V.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
