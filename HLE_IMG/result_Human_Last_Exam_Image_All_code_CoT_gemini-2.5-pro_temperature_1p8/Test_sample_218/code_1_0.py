    # Define the starting material: Geraniol
    # IUPAC Name: (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-ol
    # SMILES string for Geraniol: CC(=CCC/C(=C/CO)/C)C
    
    # Step-by-step reaction analysis:
    # Step 1: Geraniol + O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate in Pyridine
    # This reaction converts the primary alcohol (-OH) into a thionocarbonate,
    # which is a good leaving group for the next step.
    # The intermediate is O-((E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate.
    
    # Step 2: Reduction with LiAlH4
    # This is a deoxygenation reaction. LiAlH4 provides a hydride ion (H-)
    # which displaces the thionocarbonate group in an SN2 reaction.
    # The overall transformation is the replacement of the -OH group with a -H atom.
    # So, the -CH2OH group of geraniol becomes a -CH3 group.

    # Determine the product structure:
    # Geraniol structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2OH
    # Product A structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3
    
    # IUPAC Naming of Product A:
    # 1. Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bonds: 8 carbons (octa).
    # 2. Number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest locants.
    #    CH3(1)-CH(2)=C(CH3)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-CH(6)=C(CH3)2(7,8)
    # 3. Identify position of double bonds: at C2 and C6 -> octa-2,6-diene.
    # 4. Identify substituents: methyl groups at C3 and C7 -> 3,7-dimethyl.
    # 5. Determine stereochemistry: The C2=C3 bond retains the (E) geometry from geraniol.
