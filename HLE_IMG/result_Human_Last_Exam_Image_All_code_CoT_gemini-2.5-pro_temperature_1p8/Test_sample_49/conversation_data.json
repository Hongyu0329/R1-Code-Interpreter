    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node `a_0`, we first need to find the Thévenin equivalent circuit as seen from the terminals `a_0` and `b_0` (ground), where the capacitor `C` is connected. The cutoff frequency `f_c` (or angular frequency `ω_c = 2πf_c`) for the resulting RC circuit is given by `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`, where `R_th` is the Thévenin resistance.\n\n**1. Calculating the Thévenin Resistance (R_th)**\n\nTo find `R_th`, we set all independent sources to zero. This means the input terminal `IN` at node `c_0` is grounded. `R_th` is then the equivalent resistance seen from terminal `a_0` to ground.\n\nThe resistance path from `a_0` to ground is through the resistor `r` between `a_0` and `d_1`, plus the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder from node `d_1` to ground. So, `R_th = r + R_{d1, gnd}`.\n\nThe rest of the network is an infinite ladder. The key to solving this is to find its characteristic impedance, let's call it `R_eq`. This is the impedance looking into the ladder between any pair of nodes `(c_k, d_k)` for `k ≥ 1`.\n\nLooking into nodes `(c_k, d_k)`, we see:\n- The horizontal resistor `r` connecting `c_k` and `d_k`.\n- In parallel with this, the rest of the ladder starting from `k+1`. This path consists of two series resistors `r` (from `c_k` to `c_{k+1}` and `d_k` to `d_{k+1}`) connected to the load, which is the rest of the infinite ladder, also having impedance `R_eq`.\n\nThis self-similar structure gives us the equation:\n`R_eq = r || (2r + R_eq)`\n`R_eq = (r * (2r + R_eq)) / (r + (2r + R_eq))`\n`R_eq * (3r + R_eq) = 2r² + r * R_eq`\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n`R_eq² + 2r * R_eq - 2r² = 0`\n\nSolving for `R_eq` using the quadratic formula and taking the physically meaningful positive root gives:\n`R_eq = r * (sqrt(3) - 1)`\n\nNow, we replace the entire infinite ladder starting from `(c_1, d_1)` with this single equivalent resistance `R_eq` connected between nodes `c_1` and `d_1`. The circuit to find `R_{d1, gnd}` simplifies to:\n- A resistor `r` from `c_1` to ground (since `c_0` is grounded).\n- A resistor `R_eq` from `c_1` to `d_1`.\n\nThe resistance from `d_1` to ground `R_{d1, gnd}` is the sum of `R_eq` and `r` in series.\n`R_{d1, gnd} = R_eq + r`\n\nSo, the total Thévenin resistance at `a_0` is:\n`R_th = r + R_{d1, gnd} = r + (R_eq + r) = 2r + R_eq`\n`R_th = 2r + r*(sqrt(3) - 1) = r * (1 + sqrt(3))`\n\n**2. Calculating the Cutoff Frequency (ω_c)**\n\nThe circuit at `a_0` is a simple low-pass RC filter with resistance `R_th` and capacitance `C`. The angular cutoff frequency `ω_c` is:\n`ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`\nSubstituting our expression for `R_th`:\n`ω_c = 1 / (r * (1 + sqrt(3)) * C)`\n\nThe following Python script prints out the final formula for the cutoff frequency.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script prints the final derived formula for the cutoff frequency.\n\n# The Thevenin resistance R_th found from the ladder network analysis is:\n# R_th = r * (1 + sqrt(3))\n\n# The angular cutoff frequency omega_c is given by the formula:\n# omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\n\nprint(\"The cutoff frequency (in radians per second) is given by the equation:\")\nprint(\"omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the derived value for the Thevenin resistance R_th = r * (1 + sqrt(3)), we get the final equation:\")\nprint(\"omega_c = 1 / (r * (1 + sqrt(3)) * C)\")\nprint(\"\\nTo show each number in the final equation as requested:\")\nnumerator = 1\nnum_in_factor = 1\nnum_in_sqrt = 3\nprint(f\"Final Equation: omega_c = {numerator} / (r * C * ({num_in_factor} + sqrt({num_in_sqrt})))\")\n\n# Provide an approximate numerical factor for context\nfactor = 1 + math.sqrt(3)\nprint(f\"\\nThe numerical factor (1 + sqrt(3)) is approximately {factor:.4f}.\")\n```\n<<<omega_c = 1 / (r * (1 + sqrt(3)) * C)>>>"
