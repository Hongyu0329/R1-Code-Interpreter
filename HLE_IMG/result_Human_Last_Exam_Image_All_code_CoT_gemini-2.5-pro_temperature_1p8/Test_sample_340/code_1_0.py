def solve_gravitational_wave_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the gravitational wavelet puzzle by determining the
    wavelet type and letter index for each of the nine plots.

    The solution is derived from a detailed visual and logical analysis:
    1.  Wavelet Identification: Plots are grouped into M={1,5,9}, G={2,7,8}, P={3,4,6}.
    2.  Parameter Analysis: Letter indices 'a'-'i' are mapped to physical parameters
        (masses via 'y', PN order via 'z').
    3.  Logical Matching: Visual features (chirp shape, duration, intensity) are
        systematically matched to the physical parameters of each letter index.

    The final deduced mapping is hardcoded and printed in the specified format.
