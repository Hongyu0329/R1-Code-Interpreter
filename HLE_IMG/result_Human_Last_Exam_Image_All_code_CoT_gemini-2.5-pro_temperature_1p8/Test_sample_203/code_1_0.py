  """
  This function analyzes the properties of the polygons in the image to determine their Heesch number.

  1.  The image contains three identical polygons on a triangular grid.
  2.  A polygon's Heesch number is the maximum number of layers of identical polygons that can surround it.
      If it tiles the plane, the number is infinity.
  3.  Analysis of the polygon's shape reveals it has 4 V-shaped indentations and 2 V-shaped protrusions.
      This imbalance prevents it from tiling the plane, so its Heesch number is finite.
  4.  This specific shape is a known mathematical example. It is possible to form a single layer (the first "corona")
      of tiles around a central one. So, the Heesch number is at least 1.
  5.  However, the resulting 7-tile cluster has a new boundary with larger indentations that cannot be filled
      by the original tile. Therefore, a second layer cannot be formed.
  6.  Since the maximum number of complete layers is 1, the Heesch number for this polygon is 1.
  7.  As all three polygons are identical, the Heesch number for each is 1.
