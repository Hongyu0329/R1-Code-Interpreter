    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify ECG Parameters**: From the top-left corner of the image, we can see the paper speed is 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG paper is composed of 1 mm small squares. Therefore, the time duration of one small square is 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = 0.04 seconds.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we search for the largest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall, sharp peaks). A noticeably long pause occurs in the fourth strip, which starts near the time marker `0:06:08`. This pause is between the third and fourth QRS complexes on that line.\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval**: We measure the distance of this pause by counting the number of small squares between the two R-wave peaks.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave before the pause aligns well with a thick vertical line.\n    *   Counting from that line to the peak of the R-wave after the pause, we can count 7 large squares and approximately 2 additional small squares.\n    *   Since each large square is 5 small squares wide, the total distance is (7 * 5) + 2 = 37 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds**: We convert the distance in small squares to time in seconds using the parameter from step 1.\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 37 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the given parameters.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n# Each small square on the grid is 1 mm.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# 2. Measure the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip by counting small squares.\n# By inspection, the longest interval is found on the fourth strip and measures approximately 37 small squares.\nlongest_interval_in_small_squares = 37\n\n# 3. Calculate the duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_interval_in_seconds = longest_interval_in_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# 4. Print the calculation steps and the final answer.\nprint(\"Step 1: Determine the time represented by one small square on the ECG.\")\nprint(f\"Paper speed = {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square = 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Measure the longest R-R interval in number of small squares.\")\nprint(f\"The longest interval visually identified on the strip is {longest_interval_in_small_squares} small squares.\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the interval duration in seconds.\")\nprint(\"Duration = Number of small squares * Time per small square\")\nprint(f\"Duration = {longest_interval_in_small_squares} * {time_per_small_square_sec}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {longest_interval_in_seconds:.2f} seconds.\")\n\n```\n<<<1.48>>>"
