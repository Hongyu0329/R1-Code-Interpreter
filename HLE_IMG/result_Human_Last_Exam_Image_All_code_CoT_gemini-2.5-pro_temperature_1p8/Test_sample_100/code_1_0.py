    # Step 1: Determine the formula of Intermediate 1.
    # The starting material is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.
    # The first step is the deprotection of the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group from the nitrogen atom.
    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.
    # This results in a net loss of C8H8O.
    # Let's start from the structure of Intermediate 1: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.
    # Let's count its atoms:
    # - Bicyclic core (C6H5N): 6 Carbon, 5 Hydrogen, 1 Nitrogen
    # - Carbonyl group (C=O): 1 Carbon, 1 Oxygen
    # - Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): 1 Carbon, 3 Fluorine
    # - Hydrogen on Nitrogen (after deprotection): 1 Hydrogen
    # Total for Intermediate 1:
    # C = 6 + 1 + 1 = 8... wait, my analysis of the structure was off. Let's recount directly.
    # 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one core has C6H7N skeleton.
    # C1(CH), C2(N), C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(CH)=C6(CH), C7(CH2) -> C6H5NO
    # Substituting at C6 with CF3 removes one H and adds CF3: C6H4NO(CF3) -> C7H4F3NO.
    # After deprotection, N has an H: C7H5F3NO. Let's re-verify the H count again from the structure.
    # Core: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.
    # H atoms: C1(H), C4(H), C5(H), C7(H2), N(H) = 1+1+1+2+1 = 6 Hydrogens.
    # C atoms: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C(from CF3) = 7 Carbons.
    # F atoms: 3. N atoms: 1. O atoms: 1.
    # So, formula for Intermediate 1 is C7H6F3NO.
