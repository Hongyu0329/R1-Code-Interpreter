    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Intermediates**: I will break down the reaction into three steps as shown in the image and determine the chemical structure of the starting material, Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and the final Product.\n2.  **Step 1: PMB Deprotection**: The first step uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), which is a standard reagent for removing the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from the nitrogen atom. I will calculate the molecular formula of Intermediate 1 after this deprotection.\n3.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation**: The second step uses Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond in Intermediate 1 to a single bond, forming Intermediate 2. I will adjust the molecular formula accordingly.\n4.  **Step 3: Lactam Hydrolysis**: The third step involves treating Intermediate 2 with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and heat. This will hydrolyze the lactam (cyclic amide) ring, adding a water molecule (H2O) to form the final product, which is an amino acid.\n5.  **Calculate Final Formula**: After analyzing all the reaction steps, I will sum up the atoms to get the final molecular formula of the product.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to programmatically follow these steps, calculating the number of atoms for each element and printing the final molecular formula as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef get_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    # The starting material is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # The first step is the deprotection of the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group from the nitrogen atom.\n    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    # This results in a net loss of C8H8O.\n    # Let's start from the structure of Intermediate 1: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Let's count its atoms:\n    # - Bicyclic core (C6H5N): 6 Carbon, 5 Hydrogen, 1 Nitrogen\n    # - Carbonyl group (C=O): 1 Carbon, 1 Oxygen\n    # - Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): 1 Carbon, 3 Fluorine\n    # - Hydrogen on Nitrogen (after deprotection): 1 Hydrogen\n    # Total for Intermediate 1:\n    # C = 6 + 1 + 1 = 8... wait, my analysis of the structure was off. Let's recount directly.\n    # 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one core has C6H7N skeleton.\n    # C1(CH), C2(N), C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(CH)=C6(CH), C7(CH2) -> C6H5NO\n    # Substituting at C6 with CF3 removes one H and adds CF3: C6H4NO(CF3) -> C7H4F3NO.\n    # After deprotection, N has an H: C7H5F3NO. Let's re-verify the H count again from the structure.\n    # Core: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # H atoms: C1(H), C4(H), C5(H), C7(H2), N(H) = 1+1+1+2+1 = 6 Hydrogens.\n    # C atoms: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C(from CF3) = 7 Carbons.\n    # F atoms: 3.
