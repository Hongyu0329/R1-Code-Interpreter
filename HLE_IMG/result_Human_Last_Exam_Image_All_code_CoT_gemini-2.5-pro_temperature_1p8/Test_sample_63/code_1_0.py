    print("2. Amide Proton: A broad singlet appears at ~9.0 ppm, indicating the presence of an amide N-H proton.")
    print("3. Isolated Methylene Group: A singlet is present at ~3.4 ppm, corresponding to a CH2 group (2H) with no adjacent protons, likely positioned between a carbonyl and a nitrogen atom (-CO-CH2-N-).")
    print("4. Aryl Methyl Group: A singlet is observed at ~2.4 ppm, which is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (3H).")
    print("5. Aromatic Protons: Signals around ~7.1 ppm belong to protons on the aromatic ring.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Evaluation of Candidate Structures ---")
    print("A-G and B-G: These structures lack an ethyl group. They cannot produce the required triplet and quartet signals. Thus, they are eliminated.")
    print("D-L (Lidocaine): This structure contains two methyl groups on the benzene ring. These two groups are equivalent and would produce a single singlet with an integration corresponding to 6 protons (6H). The observed singlet at 2.4 ppm is not large enough to be 6H when compared to the other signals. Thus, D-L is incorrect.")
    print("C-L (o-Lidocaine Isomer): This structure fits all the observed data perfectly.")
    print("   - A diethylamino group accounts for the 6H triplet at 1.2 ppm and the 4H quartet at 2.8 ppm.")
    print("   - An amide proton accounts for the 1H singlet at 9.0 ppm.")
    print("   - The -CO-CH2-N- group accounts for the 2H singlet at 3.4 ppm.")
    print("   - A single methyl group on the benzene ring accounts for the 3H singlet at 2.4 ppm.")
    print("   - The 4 protons on the aromatic ring account for the signals at 7.1 ppm.\n")
