    "To determine the stereochemical assignments, we will analyze each of the four stereocenters in the reaction scheme from left to right. This involves assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the substituents on each chiral carbon and then determining the (R) or (S) configuration based on their 3D arrangement.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride Reactant):** Determine the configuration of the chiral center in the starting acyl chloride.\n2.  **Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol Reactant):** Determine the configuration of the chiral center in the starting alcohol.\n3.  **Stereocenter 3 (Product - Alcohol Moiety):** Analyze the reaction's effect on the alcohol's chiral center and determine its configuration in the final ester product.\n4.  **Stereocenter 4 (Product - Acyl Moiety):** Analyze the reaction's effect on the acyl chloride's chiral center and determine its configuration in the final ester product. Note that while the center itself is not part of the reaction, its CIP priority assignments may change.\n\nThe final result will be presented as a sequence of the four assignments: (Assignment 1), (Assignment 2), (Assignment 3), (Assignment 4).\n\n```python\ndef assign_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme\n    and prints the step-by-step assignment and final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction scheme from left to right.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride (left reactant)\n    print(\"1.
