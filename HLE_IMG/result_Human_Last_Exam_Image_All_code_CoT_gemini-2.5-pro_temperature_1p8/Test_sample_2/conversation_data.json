    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its behavior in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The algorithm `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function. The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`. For `n > 1`, the function does the following:\n    a. It makes a recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` to sort the first `n-1` elements.\n    b. It compares the last two elements of this `n`-element slice, `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`.\n    c. If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it swaps them.\n    d. Crucially, if a swap occurred, it makes a *second* recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)` to re-sort the first `n-1` elements, as the swap may have broken their sorted order.\n\n2.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. We can define `T(n)` based on the operations performed:\n    *   One recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is always made. This has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n    *   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   A second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is made only if the `if` condition is true. This also has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n\n    This leads to two possibilities for the recurrence relation:\n    *   If `a[n-1] >= a[n-2]` (no swap): `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`\n    *   If `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` (swap happens): `T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1) = 2T(n-1) + c`\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst Case:**\n    The worst-case complexity occurs when the workload is maximized. This happens when the `if` condition is met at every step of the recursion, triggering the second recursive call. A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`) is a perfect example of a worst-case input. In this scenario, the smallest element is always at the end of the current sub-array, which will nearly always result in a swap and a second recursive call.\n\n4.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    For the worst case, the recurrence relation is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`. We can solve this by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2T(n-2) + c) + c = 4T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   This pattern continues. After `k` expansions, we get:\n        `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n    *   The sum `(2^(k-1) + ... + 1)` is a geometric series equal to `2^k - 1`.\n    *   So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n    *   The recursion stops when the size is 1, so we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`. The base case `T(1)` is a constant.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    *   The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is `O(2^(n-1))`. This simplifies to `O(2^n)`. This is an exponential time complexity, making the algorithm highly inefficient for large `n`.\n\nThe following Python code prints this analysis and the final equation for the number of operations.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis_text = \"\"\"\n### Analysis of the Algorithm's Worst-Case Time Complexity\n\n1.  **Recurrence Relation:** The algorithm's runtime, T(n), is defined by its recursive structure. In the worst-case (e.g., a reverse-sorted array), a swap occurs at each level of recursion, triggering two subsequent calls on a problem of size n-1. This gives the recurrence relation:\n    T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c (where c is a constant for the compare and swap operations)\n\n2.  **Solving the Recurrence:** We can solve this by expansion.\n    - T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + c\n    -      = 2*(2*T(n-2) + c) + c = 4*T(n-2) + 2c + c\n    -      = 4*(2*T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8*T(n-3) + 7c\n    This unrolls to the general form: T(n) = 2^(n-1)*T(1) + c*(2^(n-1) - 1).\n\n3.  **Complexity:** The dominant term in this expression is 2^(n-1). Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n).\n\n4.  **Final Equation:**\n    If we assume the base case T(1) = 1 and the constant work c = 1, the number of operations is described by the equation:\n    T(n) = 2^n - 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(analysis_text)\n    print(\"The numbers in this final equation are:\")\n    print(2)\n    print(1)\n\nexplain_complexity_analysis()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
