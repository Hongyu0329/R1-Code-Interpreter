### Analysis of the Algorithm's Worst-Case Time Complexity

1.  **Recurrence Relation:** The algorithm's runtime, T(n), is defined by its recursive structure. In the worst-case (e.g., a reverse-sorted array), a swap occurs at each level of recursion, triggering two subsequent calls on a problem of size n-1. This gives the recurrence relation:
    T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c (where c is a constant for the compare and swap operations)

2.  **Solving the Recurrence:** We can solve this by expansion.
    - T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + c
    -      = 2*(2*T(n-2) + c) + c = 4*T(n-2) + 2c + c
    -      = 4*(2*T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8*T(n-3) + 7c
    This unrolls to the general form: T(n) = 2^(n-1)*T(1) + c*(2^(n-1) - 1).

3.  **Complexity:** The dominant term in this expression is 2^(n-1). Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n).

4.  **Final Equation:**
    If we assume the base case T(1) = 1 and the constant work c = 1, the number of operations is described by the equation:
    T(n) = 2^n - 1.
