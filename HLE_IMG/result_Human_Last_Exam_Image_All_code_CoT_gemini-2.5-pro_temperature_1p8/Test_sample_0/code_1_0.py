def solve_chess_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.

    The position is: Black to move, without moving the queens.
    The goal is a forced mate in 2.

    The thinking process is as follows:
    1. Black's first move is Nf2+. This checks the white king on h1.
    2. White's only legal response is to move the king to g2 (Kg2). The knight on f2 is protected by the queen on a2, and the escape square g1 is covered by the bishop on h3.
    3. Black's second move is Rf3#. This delivers checkmate. The king on g2 is checked by the rook and all escape squares are covered or blocked:
       - f1 (occupied by Bishop)
       - f2 (occupied by Knight)
       - f3 (occupied by Rook)
       - g1 (attacked by Bishop h3)
       - g3 (attacked by Rook f3)
       - h1 (attacked by Bishop h3)
       - h2 (occupied by Pawn)
       - h3 (occupied by Bishop)
    """
    move1 = "Nf2+"
    move2 = "Rf3#"
    
    # The prompt asks to output each "number in the final equation".
    # I will interpret this as providing the move numbers for Black.
    print(f"1. ... {move1}")
    print(f"2. ... {move2}")
