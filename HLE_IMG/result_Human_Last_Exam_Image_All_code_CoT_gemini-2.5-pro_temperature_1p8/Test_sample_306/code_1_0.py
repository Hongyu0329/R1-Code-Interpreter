# The orbital eccentricity of the stars is given by e = n/20, for n = 0, 1, ..., 8.
# An eccentricity of e=0 corresponds to a circular orbit, which creates the most regular
# and stable conditions for the planet's motion. As eccentricity 'e' increases, the
# system becomes more perturbed and chaotic.
#
# By visually inspecting the plots, we can order them from most regular (lowest 'e')
# to most chaotic (highest 'e').
# - Plot 3: Most regular (large, perfect sphere) -> n=0
# - Plot 9: Slightly distorted sphere -> n=1
# - Plot 1: Deformed into a cylinder -> n=2
# - Plot 5: Smaller, more cubic stable region -> n=3
# - Plot 2: Further fragmentation of stable zones -> n=4
# - Plot 6: Increased chaos and scattered points -> n=5
# - Plot 7: Smaller coherent structures -> n=6
# - Plot 4: More fragmented and chaotic -> n=7
# - Plot 8: Most chaotic, no large stable regions -> n=8
#
# This analysis establishes a mapping from the plot number to its 'n' value.
