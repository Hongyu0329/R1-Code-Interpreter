    "Based on the visual evidence in the image sequence, here is my analysis of the depicted process.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the initial state (Panel L).** The image shows a filamentous structure, characteristic of a fungal hypha, which is composed of multiple cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The structure is relatively straight. An arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n*   **Step 2: Observe the change in the intermediate state (Panel M).** A distinct bulge has formed on the side of the hypha, just below the septum that was indicated in the first panel. This suggests that a new point of growth is initiating from the side of the existing filament.\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the final state (Panel N).** The bulge observed in panel M has now elongated into a new filament, forming a distinct branch. The original filament has now bent as this new branch has grown. This demonstrates the creation of a new growth axis from the side of the parent hypha.\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the process.** This sequence of events—the formation of a lateral bulge that develops into a new filament—is the biological process known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for the growth and spread of fungal mycelia.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and describes the biological process shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal branching\"\n  explanation = \"The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a fungal hypha initiating a new branch. \"\n  explanation += \"Panel L shows the original hypha. \"\n  explanation += \"In panel M, a bulge forms on the side of the hypha, which is the start of the new branch (branch primordium). \"\n  explanation += \"In panel N, this bulge has elongated, forming a new hyphal tip and creating a clear branch. \"\n  explanation += \"This process is essential for the expansion of the fungal colony (mycelium).\"\n\n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process_name}.\")\n  print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n  print(explanation)\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
