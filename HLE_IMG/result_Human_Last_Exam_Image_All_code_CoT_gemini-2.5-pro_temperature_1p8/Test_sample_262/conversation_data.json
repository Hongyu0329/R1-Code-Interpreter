    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four complexes are Iridium(III) emitters for Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). They share a common structure of `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`, where `(N^N)` is the di-tert-butyl-bipyridine ligand and `(C^N)` is a fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand. The key difference between the four complexes is the number and position of fluorine atoms on the two phenylpyridine ligands.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** The operational lifetime of an LEC is heavily dependent on the chemical stability of the emitter complex. A major degradation pathway for these Ir(III) complexes is oxidation. Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups. Adding fluorine atoms to the phenylpyridine ligands increases the complex's resistance to oxidation. Therefore, a higher degree of fluorination leads to a more stable complex and a longer device lifetime.\n\n3.  **Count Fluorine Atoms:** To predict relative lifetimes, we can compare the number of fluorine atoms on the critical cyclometalating ligands (`C^N`) for each complex. Complexes with fewer fluorine atoms will be less stable and thus have shorter lifetimes.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has **2** fluorine atoms.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The ligands are 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has **1** fluorine atom.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The ligands are 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has **1** fluorine atom.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The ligands are 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has **3** fluorine atoms.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the counts, we can see that Complexes 2 and 3 have the fewest fluorine atoms (one per ligand). They are therefore expected to be the least stable against oxidation and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 4, which are more heavily fluorinated.\n\nThe following Python code implements this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes to determine which have shorter lifetimes.\n\n    The stability of these emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs)\n    is related to their resistance to oxidation.
