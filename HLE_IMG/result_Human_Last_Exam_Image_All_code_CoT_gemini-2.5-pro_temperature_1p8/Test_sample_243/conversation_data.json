    "This is a bit of a tricky question, as the plant shown in the image and the question's premise seem to conflict.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Identify the plant in the image:** The plant with the distinctive white, net-like or \"cracked porcelain\" venation on its leaves is almost certainly *Helwingia omeiensis*.\n2.  **Determine its native habitat:** The species name \"*omeiensis*\" refers to Mount Omei (Emei) in Sichuan, China, which is its native habitat. This is on the mainland, not an island.\n3.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the name of an *island* where a plant *was endemic*. The past tense \"was\" suggests the plant may be extinct in the wild or no longer found there.\n4.  **Reconcile the conflict:** There is a contradiction between the identified plant (from mainland China) and the question (asking for an island). This suggests two possibilities:\n    *   The image is correct, but the question's premise about it being from an island is wrong.\n    *   The question is referring to a different, famous plant that *was* endemic to an island, and the image shown is incorrect for that question. This is a common issue in automated quizzes.\n5.  **Identify the likely intended plant:** The most famous case of a recently extinct plant that was endemic to an island is the St. Helena Olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). This plant was endemic to the island of St. Helena and the last one in the wild died in 1994, with the last cultivated specimen dying in 2003.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the phrasing of the question (especially \"was endemic\"), it is most likely referring to the famous St. Helena Olive, even though the image displayed is of a different plant. Therefore, the answer is the island to which the St. Helena Olive was endemic.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the task by identifying the island based on the likely intended subject of the question.\n\n    The image shows Helwingia omeiensis, native to mainland China.\n    The question asks for an island where a plant \"was endemic,\" strongly implying a famous extinct plant like the St. Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica).\n    This plant was endemic to the island of St. Helena.\n    Therefore, the code will print the name of this island.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_name = \"St. Helena\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<St. Helena>>>"
