    explanation = """
Based on the text and diagram provided, the framework defines salience through four components that are characteristics of the diagnostic information and the simulation's design, not the learner. Let's review them:

1.  **Access:** Refers to the physical availability of information. This is determined by the simulation's creator.
2.  **Prominence:** Relates to how information stands out due to cues and plot. This is also a design choice within the simulation.
3.  **Simplicity:** Describes the amount and complexity of the information presented. This is an inherent property of the information chosen for the simulation.
4.  **Clarity:** Refers to how unambiguously the information points to a conclusion. This is a quality of the information itself.

The diagram reinforces this by showing that these components are part of the "Diagnostic Information" box, which is an element of the simulation environment. There are no elements in the diagram that represent the learner's individual characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge, attention span, or cognitive abilities).

Therefore, within the confines of the framework as it is described, salience is treated as an objective property of the stimuli, designed by the simulation creator. It does not depend on the learner's individual differences.
