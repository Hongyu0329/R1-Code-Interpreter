    "My plan is to identify the city by analyzing the buildings in the image. The architectural style suggests a modern Asian city. I will use reverse image search tools to identify the specific buildings, which will pinpoint the city.\n\nThe key identifiable buildings in the image are the **Trade Tower (Korea World Trade Center)** and the **Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas** hotel, both located within the **COEX complex** in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea. This confirms the location.\n\nAs per your request, I will provide a Python script that prints the name of the city.\n\n```python\n# The analysis of the image reveals several landmark buildings.\n# The prominent structures, including the Trade Tower and the Grand InterContinental hotel,\n# are part of the COEX complex.\n# This complex is a famous landmark in the Gangnam district.\n# Therefore, the city is identified as Seoul.\n\ndef identify_city_from_image():\n  \"\"\"\n  Based on visual analysis of the landmarks, this function returns the city's name.\n  \"\"\"\n  city_name = \"Seoul\"\n  print(f\"The city identified in the image is: {city_name}\")\n\nidentify_city_from_image()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2024.
