    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. To determine which species definitively places the photo on the Atlantic coast, we must identify the organisms and their geographic ranges.\n\n1.  **Identify the species:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** The rock is covered with acorn barnacles, likely of the genus *Semibalanus* or similar, which are common in both the Atlantic and Pacific.\n    *   **Large Snails:** The two most prominent snails are Common Periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*). This species is native to the Northeast Atlantic (Europe) and is a very common invasive species on the Northwest Atlantic coast (North America). However, it has also been introduced to the Pacific Coast, so its presence is not a *definitive* indicator of an Atlantic location.\n    *   **Small, Dark Snails:** There are several smaller, darker, ridged snails. These are Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*).\n\n2.  **Analyze Geographic Distribution:**\n    *   *Littorina saxatilis* (the rough periwinkle) is a species native to the shores of the North Atlantic Ocean (both European and North American coasts). Critically, it is **not found** in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The presence of *Littorina saxatilis* definitively indicates that the photograph was taken on a coast of the Atlantic Ocean. While *Littorina littorea* is more visually dominant, its presence in some Pacific locations disqualifies it as a *definitive* indicator. The smaller *Littorina saxatilis* is the key.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species from the image that is exclusively found on the Atlantic Coast\n    and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image contains several species, including barnacles and two types of periwinkle snails.\n    # The larger snail is the Common Periwinkle, Littorina littorea. While native to the Atlantic,\n    # it has been introduced to the Pacific coast, so it's not a definitive indicator.\n    # The smaller, darker snails are Rough Periwinkles, Littorina saxatilis.\n    # The geographic range of Littorina saxatilis is restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean.\n    # Therefore, its presence definitively indicates the photo was taken on an Atlantic coast.\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina saxatilis\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina saxatilis>>>"
