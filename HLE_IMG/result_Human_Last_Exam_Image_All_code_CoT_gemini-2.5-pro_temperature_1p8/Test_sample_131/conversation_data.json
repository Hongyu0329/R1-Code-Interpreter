    "My plan to identify the alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the provided chemical structure. The image shows a complex, polycyclic molecule containing nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of an alkaloid.\n2.  I will examine the specific ring system and functional groups. The molecule has a tetracyclic (four-ring) core and includes a carbonyl group (C=O) within one of the rings, forming a lactam.\n3.  I will compare this structure to known alkaloids in my database. The core skeleton is related to sparteine, and the presence of the lactam functional group points to a specific derivative.\n4.  This specific structure is known as Lupanine, a quinolizidine alkaloid commonly found in plants of the Lupin genus.\n5.  To fulfill the request format, I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of the compound in a variable and then prints it.\n\n```python\n# This script stores the name of the alkaloid compound and prints it to the console.\n\n# The compound is identified based on its characteristic tetracyclic quinolizidine lactam structure.\ncompound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n\n# Print the name of the compound.\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
