    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single C-C bond that connects each peripheral phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to the main structure of the iridium complex. Free rotation occurs when there is low steric hindrance, while high steric hindrance restricts rotation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each ring:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The complex consists of a central Iridium (Ir) ion coordinated by three bidentate ligands. Two of these are cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligands (rings A-B and C-D), and one is likely a bipyridine-type ligand (rings E-F). This coordination holds the main ligand framework in a relatively rigid conformation.\n\n2.  **Evaluate rotation of ring H:** Ring H is attached at position 4 of the main phenyl ring A. This position is analogous to a 'para' position relative to the Iridium coordination site and 'meta' to the connection to ring B. It is located on the periphery of the molecule, far from other bulky groups. Therefore, it experiences minimal steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\n\n3.  **Evaluate rotation of ring J:** Similar to ring H, ring J is attached at position 4 of the main phenyl ring C. This position is also far from the sterically crowded metal center and other ligands. Thus, ring J can also rotate freely.\n\n4.  **Evaluate rotation of rings G and K:** Ring G is attached at position 2 of ring C, and ring K is at position 2 of ring A. These positions are 'ortho' to the bond connecting the phenyl and pyridine rings within their respective ligands (C-D and A-B). Due to the rigid nature of the chelated ligand, this 'ortho' positioning causes a significant steric clash between the substituent ring (G or K) and the adjacent pyridine ring (D or B). This high steric hindrance severely restricts their rotation.\n\n5.  **Evaluate rotation of ring L:** Ring L is attached at position 5 of ring C. This position is 'ortho' to the carbon atom (C6) that is bonded directly to the Iridium center. This proximity places ring L deep within the crowded coordination sphere of the metal, leading to severe steric clashes with the other ligands (e.g., ligand E-F). Consequently, the rotation of ring L is also restricted.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, only rings H and J are in positions that allow for free rotation.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational freedom of peripheral phenyl rings in a complex based on steric hindrance.\n\n    Steric Hindrance Rules:\n    - Rings at 'ortho' positions to other bulky groups (like another ring or a metalation site) are restricted.\n    - Rings at 'para' or 'meta' positions are generally unhindered and can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about each ring's position relative to sources of steric hindrance.\n    # The positions are simplified to 'ortho', 'meta', or 'para' based on visual inspection of the diagram.\n    ring_info = {\n        'G': \"ortho to adjacent pyridine ring D\",\n        'K': \"ortho to adjacent pyridine ring B\",\n        'L': \"ortho to the Iridium coordination site\",\n        'H': \"para/meta to bulky groups\",\n        'J': \"para/meta to bulky groups\"\n    }\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of each phenyl ring's rotational freedom:\")\n    \n    # Sort the rings for consistent output order\n    sorted_rings = sorted(ring_info.keys())\n\n    for ring in sorted_rings:\n        description = ring_info[ring]\n        if 'ortho' in description:\n            status = \"RESTRICTED\"\n            print(f\"- Ring {ring}: Rotation is {status}.
