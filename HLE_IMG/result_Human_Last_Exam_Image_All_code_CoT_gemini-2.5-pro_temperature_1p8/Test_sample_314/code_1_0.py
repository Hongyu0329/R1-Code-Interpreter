    # --- Analysis based on physics principles ---
    # The tight-binding energy bands for graphene can be approximated by:
    # E(k) ~ (+/- t*|f(k)|) / (1 +/- s*|f(k)|)
    # where t is hopping, s is overlap, and f(k) is the structure factor.
    # 1. 's' introduces electron-hole asymmetry.
    #    - s=0 -> symmetric bands.
    #    - s>0 -> bottom-heavy bands (standard case).
    #    - s<0 -> top-heavy bands.
    # 2. '|t|' scales the overall bandwidth.

    # --- Mapping conditions to simulations based on visual analysis ---

    # Condition 1: Minimum t (hopping parameter)
    # This corresponds to the smallest bandwidth. Visual estimation of the total
    # energy range for each plot:
    # Sim 1 (symmetric, |s|~0): E_v(Gamma) ~ -15 eV -> Total span ~ 30 eV
    # Sim 2 (asymmetric): Span ~ 5 - (-10) = 15 eV
    # Sim 3 (asymmetric): Span ~ 5 - (-15) = 20 eV
    # Sim 4 (asymmetric): Span ~ 15 - (-10) = 25 eV
    # Simulation 2 has the smallest bandwidth among the asymmetric plots and
    # a smaller estimated |t| than the symmetric one.
    min_t_simulation = 2

    # Condition 2: Minimum |s| (overlap magnitude)
    # This corresponds to the most symmetric band structure.
    # Simulation 1 is the only one that is highly symmetric.
    min_s_mag_simulation = 1

    # Condition 3: Unique sign(s) (overlap sign)
    # This corresponds to a unique asymmetry direction. Simulations 2 and 3 are
    # "bottom-heavy" (standard s > 0), while Simulation 4 is "top-heavy".
    # This uniqueness points to s < 0.
    unique_s_sign_simulation = 4

    # Condition 4: Maximum s (overlap value)
    # Comparing simulations 2 and 3 (both s>0), simulation 3 is more
    # asymmetric ("more bottom-heavy"), which implies it has a larger s value.
