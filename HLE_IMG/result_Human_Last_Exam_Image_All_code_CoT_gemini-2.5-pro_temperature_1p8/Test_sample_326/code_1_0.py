# The problem presents a logical contradiction.
# The existence of a "flat-top" soliton in the given NLSE implies v2 > v1.
# The definitions of v1 (global max velocity) and v2 (subset max velocity) imply v2 <= v1.
# The only way to resolve this contradiction is to assume the boundary case where the two conditions meet: v2 = v1.
# This simplifies the ratio r = v2/v1 to 1.

# Set the ratio of velocities
v2_div_v1 = 1.0

# Calculate the coefficients of the nonlinear terms based on this ratio.
N1 = v2_div_v1**2
N2 = 1 - v2_div_v1**4

# From the problem, the eigenvalue lambda of the soliton solution is given.
# The logarithmic derivative d/dt(ln(Phi)) = i*lambda.
# We are given d/dt(ln(Phi)) = i * 17/324.
# Therefore, lambda = 17/324.
lmbda = 17/324

# The relationship between the soliton's amplitude (A) and its eigenvalue (lambda)
# is derived from the NLSE by assuming a solution of the form Phi = A * exp(i*lambda*t)
# in the flat-top core (where spatial derivatives are zero):
# lambda * A = N1 * A**9 + N2 * A**17
# Dividing by A (assuming A is not zero), we get:
# lambda = N1 * A**8 + N2 * A**16

# Substituting the values of N1 and N2 for the v2=v1 case:
# lmbda = (1) * A**8 + (0) * A**16
# This simplifies to A**8 = lmbda

A_pow_8 = lmbda

# The maximum amplitude of the soliton is A.
# max|Phi| = A = (A**8)^(1/8)
max_Phi = A_pow_8**(1/8)

# The final value to be determined is (1 - max|Phi|).
result = 1 - max_Phi

# Print the final equation with all numbers.
# We are calculating 1 - A, where A = lambda^(1/8)
# So the final expression is 1 - (17/324)^(1/8)
print(f"The equation for the amplitude A is A^8 = \u03BB, where \u03BB = {lmbda:.5f}")
print(f"This gives A = ({lmbda:.5f})^(1/8) = {max_Phi:.5f}")
print("The expression to calculate is (1 - max|\u03A6|), which is 1 - A.")
print(f"Final calculation: 1 - {max_Phi:.5f} = {result:.5f}")
print("\nFinal equation with all numbers:")
# Since the problem asks for the numbers in the final equation, let's construct a clear output.
# A**8 = 17/324. We need to find 1-A. So, 1 - (17/324)^(1/8).
# A = (17/324)^1/8
# 1-A = 1-(17/324)^1/8
print("1 - (17 / 324)^(1/8) = ?")
