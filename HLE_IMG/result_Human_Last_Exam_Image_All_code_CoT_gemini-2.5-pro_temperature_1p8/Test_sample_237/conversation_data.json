    "This is an interesting insect. Let me help you identify it.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Examine the key features of the insect in the image. It's a beetle with a black body, very long antennae, and a striking red-orange patch across its \"shoulders\" (the base of the hard wing covers, called elytra).\n2.  The long antennae are a classic trait of long-horned beetles, which belong to the family Cerambycidae.\n3.  The specific coloration is characteristic of several species within this family. I will identify a species that is a very strong visual match. *Brachyleptura rubrica*, commonly known as the red-shouldered beetle, is an excellent candidate that fits the appearance perfectly.\n4.  I will write a Python script to present this identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_insect_in_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the insect in the provided image based on its visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image clearly shows an insect.\n    is_animal_present = True\n\n    # Based on the long antennae and beetle-like body, it's a long-horned beetle.\n    common_name = \"Long-horned Beetle\"\n    family = \"Cerambycidae\"\n\n    # The specific markings (black body with a prominent red/orange band at the\n    # base of the elytra) strongly suggest a particular species. While several\n    # species share this look, a very close match is Brachyleptura rubrica.\n    likely_scientific_name = \"Brachyleptura rubrica\"\n\n    if is_animal_present:\n        print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image. It is an insect.\")\n        print(f\"It belongs to the {common_name} family ({family}).\")\n        print(f\"Based on its appearance, a likely scientific name for this species is {likely_scientific_name}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_insect_in_image()\n```\n<<<Brachyleptura rubrica>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
