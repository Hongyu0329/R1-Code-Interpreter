    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to sum the total duration of the notes within it. The time signature tells us how many beats are in a measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the music:** The simplest way to determine the time signature is to look at the notes in one of the staves and add up their durations. The bottom staff (left hand part) is rhythmically simpler and easier to analyze.\n2.  **Identify the notes in the bottom staff:** The bottom staff contains three notes/chords.\n    *   The first is a two-note chord (E and G#).\n    *   The second is a single note (B).\n    *   The third is a single note (C#).\n3.  **Determine the duration of each note:** By observing the note heads (filled in) and stems (single stem with no flags), and considering how they align with the more complex rhythm in the top staff, we can identify each of these as a quarter note. A quarter note has a duration of 1/4 of a whole note.\n4.  **Calculate the total duration:** We sum the durations of the three quarter notes in the measure. The total duration will give us the time signature. For example, a total duration of 3/4 means the time signature is 3/4.\n5.  **Write the code:** The python code will perform this calculation and print out the equation and the resulting time signature.\n\n```python\ndef find_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by summing the note durations in the measure.\n    We will analyze the simpler bottom staff (left hand).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In music notation, note durations are fractions of a whole note.\n    # A quarter note has a value of 1/4.\n    quarter_note_value = 1/4\n    note_type = \"1/4\"\n\n    # The bottom staff clearly contains three notes. By their shape and context,\n    # each is a quarter note.\n    number_of_notes = 3\n\n    # Calculate the total duration of the measure.\n    total_duration = number_of_notes * quarter_note_value\n\n    print(\"To find the time signature, we sum the duration of all notes in the measure.\")\n    print(f\"The bottom staff contains {number_of_notes} notes, each identified as a quarter note ({note_type}).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation is as follows:\")\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    equation_parts = [note_type] * number_of_notes\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_duration}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nA total duration of 3/4 per measure corresponds to the time signature 3/4.\")\n    print(\"This means there are 3 beats in the measure, and a quarter note gets one beat.\")\n\n\nfind_time_signature()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
