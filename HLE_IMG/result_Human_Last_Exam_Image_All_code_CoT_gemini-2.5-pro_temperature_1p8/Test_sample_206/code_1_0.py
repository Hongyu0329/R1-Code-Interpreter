        3: "Potentially misleading. While the peaks around the hydroxyl oxygen (hydrophilic part) are higher for methanol, this RDF doesn't account for the differing hydrophobic effects of the methyl vs. ethyl groups. So, a conclusion about the entire 'local environment' may be an oversimplification.",
        4: "Correct. For both alcohols, the OA-HW peak (r ~ 1.8 Å) precedes the OA-OW peak (r ~ 2.7 Å), indicating water donates a hydrogen bond to the alcohol's oxygen. This orientation is similar for both.",
        5: "Incorrect. The RDF for ethanol (solid green line) shows only two clear shells, with the second being very broad. A third is not visible.",
        6: "Correct/Plausible. The RDF for methanol (solid purple line) shows three distinct areas of localization (peaks/bands at ~2.7 Å, ~4.7 Å, and ~6.7 Å), which can be interpreted as three hydration shells."
