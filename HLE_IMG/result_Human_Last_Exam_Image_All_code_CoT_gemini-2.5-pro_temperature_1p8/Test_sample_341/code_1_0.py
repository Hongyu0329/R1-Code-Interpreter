    # SS (Square Shoulder): Repulsive shoulder -> suppression in g(r) for 1 < r/sigma < 1.5. Plot 1.
    # SR (Sticky Rods): Strong attraction at contact -> sharp delta-like peak. Plot 7.
    # R (Ramp): Repulsive ramp. By elimination and characteristic shape. Plot 5.
    # HS (Hard Spheres): Classic saw-tooth g(r) for 1D hard rods. Plot 3.
    # TW (Triangle Well): Attractive well -> enhanced g(r) for 1 < r/sigma < 1.5. Plot 9.
