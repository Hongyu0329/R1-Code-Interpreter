The key difference is the symmetry of the Münchnone intermediate. In Reactions 1 and 2, the Münchnone derived from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine is pseudo-symmetric, with similar methyl groups at both ends of the dipole (C2 and C4). This leads to a lack of regioselectivity, as proven by the 1:1 scrambling in the isotope labeling experiment (Reaction 2). In contrast, the Münchnone from N-acetyl-proline in Reaction 3 is highly asymmetric. Its C4 position is a sterically hindered bridgehead atom of a fused ring. This significant steric and electronic difference forces the cycloaddition to proceed through a single, sterically favored pathway, resulting in the formation of only one regioisomer, Product B.
