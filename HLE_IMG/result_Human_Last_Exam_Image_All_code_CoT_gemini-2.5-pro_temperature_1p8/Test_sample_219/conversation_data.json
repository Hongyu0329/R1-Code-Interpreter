    "My plan is to first visually inspect the provided graph to identify the synchronized bursts of neuronal activity. These bursts are characterized by dense vertical clusters of firing events across many electrodes. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I'll scan the x-axis (Time) and locate the approximate center of each dense vertical band.\n    *   Burst 1: ~2.5 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~16 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~27 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~37 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~49 s\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n    *   IBI 1: 16 s - 2.5 s = 13.5 s\n    *   IBI 2: 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI 3: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 4: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will find the average of these calculated intervals.\n    *   Average IBI = (13.5 + 11 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 46.5 / 4 = 11.625 s\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result, rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a neuronal activity graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals, and computes their average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph\n    burst_timestamps = [2.5, 16, 27, 37, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures\n    # To round to n significant figures, we can use a format string.\n    # The format '{value:.{sf}g}' formats the 'value' to 'sf' significant figures.\n    rounded_average_ibi = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation\n    intervals_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(\"\\nCalculation of the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"({intervals_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {average_ibi:.4f} s.\")\n    print(f\"Rounding to two significant figures, the result is {rounded_average_ibi} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
