# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the provided synthetic schemes (A, B, C, D, E) to determine which one is chemically correct.
# 2. Scheme A correctly depicts all three steps:
#    - Step A: Formation of the N-thiocarbonylimidazole intermediate from the piperazine and TCDI.
#    - Step B: Substitution of the imidazole with hydrazine to form the thiosemicarbazide.
#    - Step C: Condensation of the thiosemicarbazide with the ketone to form the final thiosemicarbazone product.
# 3. Schemes B, C, D, and E all contain significant errors in at least one step, either showing an incorrect reaction product or an impossible transformation.
# 4. Therefore, Synthesis A is the correct answer. The corresponding choice is 'A'.
# 5. Print the correct answer choice.

correct_synthesis = 'A'
print(f"The correct synthesis is {correct_synthesis}.")
