    "This musical piece is identifiable by its distinct melody and structure, which are characteristic of a famous jazz standard.\n\n*   **Melody:** The opening phrase is very recognizable to jazz enthusiasts. It is the main theme of \"Au Privave\".\n*   **Structure and Harmony:** The piece is a 12-bar blues, a common form in jazz. The chords used (C, E7, F, G7, etc.) and the syncopated rhythm are hallmarks of the bebop style. Instructions like \"D.S. al Coda\" are also typical for jazz lead sheets.\n*   **Composer:** The tune \"Au Privave\" was composed by the pioneering alto saxophonist Charlie Parker.\n*   **Origin:** Bebop is a style of jazz that developed in the United States during the 1940s.\n\nBased on these points, I can determine the requested information. The following Python code will print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the song\n    identified from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Au Privave\"\n    musical_style = \"Bebop / Jazz\"\n    country_of_origin = \"United States\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Au Privave, Musical Style: Bebop / Jazz, Country of Origin: United States>>>"
