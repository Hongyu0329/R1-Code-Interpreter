# The seal contains four characters in seal script.
# Traditional Chinese seals are read from right to left, top to bottom.
# Top-right character: 景 (jǐng)
# Bottom-right character: 行 (xíng)
# Top-left character: 惟 (wéi)
# Bottom-left character: 賢 (xián) - The simplified version is 贤.
# The phrase is 景行惟賢 (jǐng xíng wéi xián).

# Convert to simplified Chinese and print the result.
char1 = "景"
char2 = "行"
