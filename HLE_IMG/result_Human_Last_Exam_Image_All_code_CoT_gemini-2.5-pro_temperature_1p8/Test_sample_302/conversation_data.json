    "I have analyzed the seal script characters. The reading order for traditional Chinese seals is from top to bottom, right to left.\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character**: This is `景` (jǐng), which means \"scenery\" or \"admire.\"\n2.  **Bottom-Right Character**: This is `行` (xíng), which means \"to walk,\" \"to act,\" or \"conduct.\"\n3.  **Top-Left Character**: This is `惟` (wéi), which means \"only\" or \"to think.\"\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character**: This is `賢` (xián) in traditional script, which means \"virtuous\" or \"worthy.\"\n\nPutting them together, the phrase is `景行惟賢` (jǐng xíng wéi xián). This is a classical phrase meaning \"to admire and follow the conduct of the virtuous.\"\n\nNow, I will convert the traditional character to simplified Chinese.\n*   景 -> 景\n*   行 -> 行\n*   惟 -> 惟\n*   賢 -> 贤\n\nThe simplified Chinese characters are `景行惟贤`.\n\n```python\n# The seal contains four characters in seal script.\n# Traditional Chinese seals are read from right to left, top to bottom.\n# Top-right character: 景 (jǐng)\n# Bottom-right character: 行 (xíng)\n# Top-left character: 惟 (wéi)\n# Bottom-left character: 賢 (xián) - The simplified version is 贤.\n# The phrase is 景行惟賢 (jǐng xíng wéi xián).\n\n# Convert to simplified Chinese and print the result.\nchar1 = \"景\"\nchar2 = \"行\"\nchar3 = \"惟\"\nchar4 = \"贤\" # Simplified form of 賢\n\nprint(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\")\n```\n<<<景行惟贤>>>"
