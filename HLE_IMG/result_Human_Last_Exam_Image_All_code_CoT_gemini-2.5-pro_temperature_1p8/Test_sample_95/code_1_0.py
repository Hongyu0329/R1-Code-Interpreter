# Step 2: Analyze the layout to determine the total area in terms of R_w (radius of a white circle).

# The width W includes the 4 columns of circles (8 * R_w) plus a green rectangle (width R_w) on each side.
# W = R_w + 8 * R_w + R_w = 10 * R_w.
# Total Area = W * H = (10 * R_w) * (6 * R_w) = 60 * R_w^2

# Center of column 1: R_w(rect)+R_w(radius) = 2*R_w. Column 2: 4*R_w. Column 3: 6*R_w. Column 4: 8*R_w.
