    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135.\n    *   According to the Nitrogen Rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ (~3030 cm⁻¹) suggest aromatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ (~2960 cm⁻¹) suggest aliphatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of aromatic C=C stretching.\n    *   The absence of a strong, sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates there is no carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   There are some weak, broad signals in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which could be N-H stretches of an amine, although they are not prominent.\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals.\n    *   Signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are in the aromatic region (110-160 ppm). The signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region (0-60 ppm).\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n        *   **Negative Signal:** Indicates one CH₂ (methylene) group. From the chemical shifts, this must be the carbon at δ **43.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Positive Signals:** Indicate CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups. There are five such signals.\n    *   Combining with the ¹³C shifts:\n        *   The signal at δ 145.1 ppm is a quaternary carbon (Cq) as it does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum. This is likely the aromatic carbon attached to the side chain (ipso-carbon).\n        *   The three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be CH carbons. This accounts for 3 of the 5 positive signals.\n        *   The remaining two positive signals must come from the aliphatic carbons at δ 49.6 and 19.2 ppm. This means one is a CH group and the other is a CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-). The HSQC would show these correlating to the aromatic CH carbons (126-129 ppm).\n    *   **HSQC Analysis:** This 2D spectrum links protons to their directly attached carbons.\n        *   **δ 1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H) correlates with δ 19.2 ppm in ¹³C.** This signal is a 3H doublet, characteristic of a CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This confirms the **CH₃** group.\n        *   **δ ~2.75 ppm (multiplet, 1H) correlates with δ 49.6 ppm in ¹³C.** This signal is a 1H multiplet, confirming it's a **CH** group.\n        *   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 2H) correlates with δ 43.5 ppm in ¹³C.** This signal is a 2H multiplet, confirming it's a **CH₂** group.\n\n5.  **Structure Elucidation:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:**\n        *   Fragments identified: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃.\n        *   These fragments sum to C₉H₁₁. Mass = (9 × 12) + (11 × 1) = 119.\n        *   The molecular weight is 135. Mass difference = 135 - 119 = 16. This suggests an oxygen atom. However, a formula of C₉H₁₁O gives a non-integer Degree of Unsaturation (DBE = 4.5), which is impossible for a neutral molecule.\n        *   Let's reconsider the nitrogen rule (odd MW = odd N). Let's assume one N atom. The mass of the C/H framework would be 135 - 14 (for N) = 121. To get a mass of 121 from C₉, we need 13 H's (9 × 12 + 13 = 121). The proposed formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n        *   DBE for C₉H₁₃N = 9 - (13/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4. A benzene ring accounts for exactly 4 DBEs. This formula is a perfect fit.\n        *   The formula C₉H₁₃N means our identified fragments (C₉H₁₁) are missing NH₂. The two protons of the primary amine group (-NH₂) often appear as a broad, exchangeable signal in ¹H NMR and are sometimes not clearly observed, which explains the discrepancy in proton integration (11H observed vs. 13H in formula).\n    *   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n        *   We have the fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n        *   From the ¹H NMR, the CH₃ group (δ 1.2) is a doublet, meaning it's attached to the CH group. This gives a ` -CH(CH₃)` fragment.\n        *   The remaining pieces are C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂. We need to attach these to the `-CH(CH₃)` fragment.\n        *   Let's consider the carbon chemical shifts. We have C-CH₂ at 43.5 ppm and C-CH at 49.6 ppm. A carbon attached to an electronegative nitrogen atom (C-N) is typically more deshielded (higher ppm) than a benzylic carbon (C-Ph).\n        *   Therefore, the CH group (δ 49.6) must be attached to the -NH₂ group, and the CH₂ group (δ 43.5) must be attached to the C₆H₅- (phenyl) group.\n        *   This leads to the following assembly: `C₆H₅ - CH₂ - CH(NH₂) - CH₃`.\n    *   **Final Structure:** 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n6.  **IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) has 3 carbons (propane).\n    *   The amine group is on carbon 2, making it a propan-2-amine.\n    *   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 1.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analysis of all provided spectra (MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC),\n# the structure of the compound has been determined.\n# This script will print the final IUPAC name of the compound.\n\ndef get_iupac_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Returns the IUPAC name of the compound based on spectral data analysis.\n  \n  Analysis Summary:\n  - MS: M+ = 135 (odd, suggests Nitrogen).\n  - Formula: C9H13N (DBE = 4).\n  - NMR Fragments: Phenyl group (C6H5), CH, CH2, CH3.\n  - Connectivity: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3.\n  - The structure is consistent with all spectra.\n  \"\"\"\n  iupac_name = \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\"\n  return iupac_name\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  final_name = get_iupac_name()\n  print(f\"The IUPAC name of the compound is: {final_name}\")\n```\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
