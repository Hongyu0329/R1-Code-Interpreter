    Solves the heat transfer problem based on the provided image and text.
    
    The function follows these steps:
    1. Determines n_0 and m_0 from analysis of the problem description and images.

    # Step 1: Determine n_0 and m_0 from the image analysis.
    # From the temperature profiles (plots 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), plot 9 shows the lowest
    # heat transfer rate (Q = 7.19061 W). Since Q is proportional to thermal conductivity,
    # and carbon steel has the lowest conductivity, plot 9 represents the carbon steel fin.
    n_0 = 9

    # To determine the geometry, we link the rendering plots to the profile plots.
    # Plot 4, which shows a square fin, has a temperature value of 48.6596.
    # This value closely matches the tip temperature of the fin in plot 9.
    # This indicates that the carbon steel fin has a square cross-section.
    m_0 = -1

    # Step 2: Calculate the theoretical ratios R(c) and R(s).
    # The heat transfer ratio is R = Q_conv / Q_adi.
    # Given Q_conv = M * (tanh(mL) + h/mk) / (1 + (h/mk)*tanh(mL)) and Q_adi = M * tanh(mL),
    # R = [ (tanh(mL) + h/mk) / (1 + (h/mk)*tanh(mL)) ] / tanh(mL).
    # The problem specifies conditions such that h/(mk) = 1 for both cases.
    # This simplifies the ratio to R = 1 / tanh(mL).

    # For the circular fin (c): mL = ln(13)
    # Using the identity tanh(ln(x)) = (x^2 - 1) / (x^2 + 1)
    # R(c) = 1 / tanh(ln(13)) = (13^2 + 1) / (13^2 - 1)
    Rc_num = 13**2 + 1
    Rc_den = 13**2 - 1
    Rc = Fraction(Rc_num, Rc_den)

    # For the square fin (s): mL = ln(2)
    # R(s) = 1 / tanh(ln(2)) = (2^2 + 1) / (2^2 - 1)
    Rs_num = 2**2 + 1
    Rs_den = 2**2 - 1
    Rs = Fraction(Rs_num, Rs_den)

    # Step 3: Compute the final value.
    # The expression is n_0 * (R(c) / R(s))^m_0
    ratio_R = Rc / Rs
    final_value = n_0 * (ratio_R ** m_0)
