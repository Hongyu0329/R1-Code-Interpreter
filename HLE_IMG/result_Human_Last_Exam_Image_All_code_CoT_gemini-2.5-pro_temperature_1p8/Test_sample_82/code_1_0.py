# The intramolecular Heck reaction proceeds via three main steps:
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C-Br bond at C9.
# 2. Intramolecular carbopalladation: The C9-Pd complex adds across the C4=C5 double bond.
#    A new C-C bond forms between C9 and C5, and the palladium migrates to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from an adjacent carbon (a beta-carbon) is removed
#    along with the palladium at C4. The available beta-hydrogen is on C3.
#    Elimination of H from C3 and Pd from C4 forms a new double bond.
