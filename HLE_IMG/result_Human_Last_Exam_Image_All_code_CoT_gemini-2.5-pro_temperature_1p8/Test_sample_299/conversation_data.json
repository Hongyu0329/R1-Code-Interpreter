    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to find the mate in 2:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** First, I'll examine the board. White is to move. The Black King is on `e4`. Let's check its escape squares:\n    *   `d3` and `d4` are controlled by White's light-squared Bishop on `g1`.\n    *   `e3` is controlled by the Rook on `f3` and the Bishop on `g1`.\n    *   `f3` is occupied by a White Rook, which is defended by the Bishop on `g2`. So, the King cannot capture it.\n    *   `f5` is controlled by White's King on `h4` and the Rook on `h5`.\n    The Black King has no legal moves. This means Black is in a state of zugzwang. Any move Black is forced to make will worsen its position. White needs to make a \"quiet\" move (one that is not a check) that maintains this trap while ensuring a checkmate on the next move, regardless of Black's reply.\n\n2.  **Identify Black's possible moves:** Since the King and the `e5` pawn cannot move, Black's only possible moves are with the Queen on `d5`, the Rook on `c6`, or for the `f4` pawn to capture the Rook on `f3` (`...fxf3`).\n\n3.  **Find the key move for White:** The solution must counter every possible reply from Black. The key move is `1. Qa5`. This move doesn't give check but sets up multiple mating threats.\n\n4.  **Analyze Black's responses to `1. Qa5`:**\n    *   **Case 1: Black captures the White Queen (`1... Qxa5`).** This removes Black's most powerful defender. White responds with `2. Ne3#`. The Knight from `e7` moves to `e3`, delivering a check that cannot be blocked or escaped, and the Knight cannot be captured because the Black Queen is gone.\n    *   **Case 2: Black captures the White Rook (`1... fxf3`).** This removes the Rook on `f3`. White responds with `2. Ng3#`. The Knight from `e7` moves to `g3`, checking the King. The King has no escape squares. Crucially, the Black Queen from `d5` cannot legally move to `g3` to capture the knight. It is checkmate.\n    *   **Case 3: Black moves its Queen without capturing (`1... Qd4` or any other Queen move).** White mates with `2. b5#`. This is a discovered check. The pawn on `b4` moves to `b5`, revealing a check from the White Queen on `a5` to the Black King on `e4` along the 4th rank. The King has no escape squares, and the check cannot be blocked by Black's Queen or Rook.\n    *   **Case 4: Black moves its Rook (`1... Rc5` or any other Rook move).** White plays the same mating move: `2. b5#`. The discovered check from the Queen on `a5` is decisive. The Black Rook cannot intervene to block the check.\n\nSince all of Black's possible moves lead to an unstoppable checkmate on White's second move, `1. Qa5` is the correct solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The chess library is not a standard Python library.\n# This code block demonstrates the logic rather than being directly executable\n# without installing the 'chess' library (e.g., pip install python-chess).\n# However, the output is formatted as requested without requiring the library.\n\ndef print_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The puzzle is a mate in 2 for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_move_white = \"1.
