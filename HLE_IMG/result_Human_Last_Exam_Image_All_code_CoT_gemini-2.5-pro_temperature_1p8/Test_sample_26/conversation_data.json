    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** I'll first establish the key of the piece by examining the key signature. The piece is in C minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** I'll look at all the notes being played in measure 30, across both the treble and bass clefs, to identify the chord.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord:** Based on the collection of notes, I will determine the chord's root and quality (e.g., major, minor, diminished). The chord is G-sharp fully diminished seventh (G#°7).\n4.  **Determine Harmonic Function:** I will analyze how this chord functions within the established key of C minor. This involves understanding its relationship to the surrounding chords and its role in the harmony. This specific chord functions as a leading-tone chord to the tonic, C minor.\n5.  **Assign the Roman Numeral:** Finally, based on the chord's function as the leading-tone seventh chord, I will assign the correct Roman numeral. I will write a Python script to present this analysis step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pathetique_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata (Op. 13, Mvt. 1)\n    to determine its Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure_number = 30\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the Key Signature\")\n    print(f\"The key signature is three flats (Bb, Eb, Ab).
