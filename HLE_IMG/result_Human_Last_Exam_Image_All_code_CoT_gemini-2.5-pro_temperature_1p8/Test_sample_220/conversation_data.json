    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we can predict the expected 2D projection and compare it with the given options.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC lattice:** An FCC lattice can be described by atomic positions `(x, y, z)` where the coordinates are all integers or two are half-integers and one is an integer. A simpler description for this problem is to consider a lattice where points `(i, j, k)` are occupied if `i+j+k` is an even integer. This represents a basis of `(0,0,0)` placed on a simple cubic lattice of side length 2, effectively. We'll use a unit lattice constant `a=1` for the projection, so the points are integer coordinates and their sum is even.\n2.  **Define the projection:** A view along the [110] direction means we project the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] vector. We can choose the axes of this plane to be along the [-110] and [001] directions.\n    *   A 3D point `P = (x, y, z)` is projected to a 2D point `P' = (x', y')`.\n    *   The new coordinates are `x' = y - x` and `y' = z`.\n3.  **Analyze the projected pattern:** We will apply this projection to our FCC atomic coordinates and analyze the resulting 2D pattern.\n    *   If `z` (our `y'` coordinate) is an even integer, then `x+y` must be even. This means `x` and `y` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Their difference, `y-x` (our `x'` coordinate), must therefore also be an even integer.\n    *   If `z` (our `y'` coordinate) is an odd integer, then `x+y` must be odd. This means `x` and `y` have different parities (one even, one odd). Their difference, `y-x` (our `x'` coordinate), must therefore be an odd integer.\n    *   The resulting pattern consists of points at `(even, even)` coordinates and `(odd, odd)` coordinates. This structure is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n4.  **Compare with images:** We will examine images A, B, C, and D to see which one displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image B** clearly shows rows of atoms that are staggered. If we define a rectangle with atoms at its corners, there is another atom in the center of the rectangle. This matches the description of a centered rectangular lattice. For example, considering a rectangle with corners at approximately `(y,z) = (2.5, 5)`, `(6.5, 5)`, `(2.5, 9)`, `(6.5, 9)`, there is an atom at its center `(4.5, 7)`.\n    *   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image C** shows two interleaved centered rectangular patterns, which is characteristic of a diamond-cubic structure.\n    *   **Image D** shows a face-centered square pattern, characteristic of an FCC [100] view.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The pattern in Image B matches the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction. The python code below will generate coordinates for such a projection to demonstrate this.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and analyzes the 2D projection of an FCC lattice\n    when viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    atoms_3d = []\n    # Generate points (i, j, k) in a 4x4x4 cube where i+j+k is even.\n    # This represents an FCC lattice.\n    for i in range(-2, 3):\n        for j in range(-2, 3):\n            for k in range(-2, 3):\n                if (i + j + k) % 2 == 0:\n                    atoms_3d.append((i, j, k))\n\n    # Project the 3D atoms onto a 2D plane perpendicular to [110].\n    # The new axes are x' = y - x and y' = z.\n    projected_atoms = set()\n    for x, y, z in atoms_3d:\n        xp = y - x\n        yp = z\n        projected_atoms.add((xp, yp))\n\n    # Find a sample rectangle and its center to demonstrate the pattern\n    # The pattern consists of points where (x', y') have the same parity.\n    # e.g., (even, even) and (odd, odd)\n    \n    # Let's find corners of a rectangle.
