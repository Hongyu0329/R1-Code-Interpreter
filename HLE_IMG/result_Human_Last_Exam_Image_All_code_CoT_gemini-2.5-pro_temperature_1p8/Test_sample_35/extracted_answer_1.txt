The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**, specifically interacting with its extracellular **V, C1, and C2 domains**. S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** because its binding to RAGE directly initiates signaling cascades (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that cause apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B is directly linked to the progression of the pathology, allowing it to predict the future course and severity of the neurological disorder.
