    "This is a complex medical interpretation task that requires careful analysis of the provided ECG. I will break down the features of the ECG step-by-step to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I will determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular by looking at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes).\n2.  **Determine the Heart Rate:** I will estimate the ventricular rate. A rapid rate is called tachycardia.\n3.  **Assess the QRS Complex:** I will measure the duration of the QRS complex to see if it is narrow (< 120 ms) or wide (â‰¥ 120 ms). I will also observe the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes.\n4.  **Evaluate Atrial Activity:** I will look for P waves to determine the atrial rhythm.\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** I will combine these findings to differentiate between the given answer choices and select the most fitting diagnosis. The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a rapid rate, and wide QRS complexes is key.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect print to a string buffer to simulate the thought process for the final output format.\nfrom io import StringIO\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    # Observation: The distances between the tall sharp peaks (R waves) are not consistent.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    print(f\"1.

Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: SVT (like AVNRT/AVRT) is a regular tachycardia.\")\n    print(\"   - D.
