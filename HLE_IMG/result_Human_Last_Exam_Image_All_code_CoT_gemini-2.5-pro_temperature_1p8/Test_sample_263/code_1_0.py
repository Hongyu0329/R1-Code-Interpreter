    print("This complex incorporates two key features known to increase device stability:")
    print("1. Fluorination: The 'dfppy' ligand has two fluorine atoms. These electron-withdrawing groups make the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation, which is a major failure mode in LECs.")
    print("2. Steric Hindrance: The 'dtbbpy' ligand has bulky tert-butyl groups. This steric bulk protects the complex by preventing close intermolecular interactions that can lead to quenching or degradation. It also improves the physical stability of the material film.")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Complex 3 is explicitly designed for high stability by combining two powerful strategies: electronic stabilization through fluorination and steric protection through bulky groups. Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.")
