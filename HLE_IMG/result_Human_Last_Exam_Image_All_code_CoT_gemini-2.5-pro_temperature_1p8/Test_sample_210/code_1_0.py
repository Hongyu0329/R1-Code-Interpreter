  This function identifies the correct Nyala based on visual analysis.

  Analysis Steps:
  1. Target's Horns: The shape, curve, and tips of the horns are noted. The right horn is particularly distinct.
  2. Target's Stripes: The pattern of vertical stripes on the flank is observed.
  3. Target's Spots: A unique cluster of white spots behind the front leg is a key identifier.
  4. Comparison with Options:
     - A: Horns are too small (younger animal).
     - B: Spot pattern is similar, but horn shape is unclear.
     - C: Different build and appearance.
     - D: Horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot pattern all match the target very closely. This is the strongest match.
     - E: Horns appear different, and there is a foreign object (band) on the leg.
     - F: The animal is too obscured for a positive ID.
  5. Conclusion: Image D is the same individual as the target.
