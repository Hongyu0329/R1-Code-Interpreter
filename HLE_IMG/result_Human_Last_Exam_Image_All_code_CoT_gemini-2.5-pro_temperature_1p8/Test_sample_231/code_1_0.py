    Compound C is a triarylmethylium cation. Its structure is derived from the reaction sequence as follows:

    1.  The initial reaction creates a tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)methylium cation skeleton (A) from three molecules of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (total 9 methoxy groups) and one carbon from diethyl carbonate.

    2.  The reaction of A with diethylamine results in the substitution of one para-methoxy group with a diethylamino group, forming compound B. This leaves 8 methoxy groups.

    3.  The final step is the cleavage of all 8 methyl ethers in compound B using lithium iodide (LiI). Each -OCH3 group is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.

    Therefore, the final structure of compound C consists of a central cationic carbon attached to three substituted phenyl rings:
    - Two rings are 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl groups.
    - One ring is a 4-diethylamino-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl group.
