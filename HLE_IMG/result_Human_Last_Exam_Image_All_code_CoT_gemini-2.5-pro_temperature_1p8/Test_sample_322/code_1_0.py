def solve_vortex_puzzle():

    This function prints the 16-letter sequence corresponding to the analysis
    of the 16 vortex trajectory plots.

    The logic for each plot is as follows:

    2: B (Blue is central, stronger)
    3: g (Green is tossed around by the R-B pair, weaker)
    4: b (Blue is dragged along by the R-G pair, weaker)
    5: R (Red is central, stronger)
    6: B (Blue is central, stronger)
    7: r (Red is tossed around by the G-B pair, weaker)
    8: R (Red is central, stronger)
    9: g (Green has a tiny path compared to the R-B pair, weaker)
    10: G (Green is central, stronger)
