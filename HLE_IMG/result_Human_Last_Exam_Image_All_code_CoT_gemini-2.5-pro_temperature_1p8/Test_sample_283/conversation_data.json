    "The chart displays Google search trends for three topics over several years. The consistent, annual peaks in the data strongly suggest these topics are recurring events, like holidays or anniversaries. By analyzing the timing of these peaks, we can deduce the events and the associated country.\n\n1.  **Red Line:** This line shows a significant spike every year around late January and February. In the United States, February is designated as Black History Month, which would account for this regular increase in search interest.\n2.  **Yellow Line:** This line has sharp peaks around mid-to-late June. The peaks become progressively higher each year, with a massive spike in 2023. This pattern corresponds perfectly with Juneteenth (June 19th), which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. It was declared a federal holiday in 2021, explaining the growing search interest.\n3.  **Blue Line:** This line has smaller but consistent spikes, notably in January and late May. The January spike aligns with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a major U.S. federal holiday. The spike in late May corresponds to the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, an event of major historical significance in the U.S.\n\nThe combination of these three specific timelines—Black History Month, Juneteenth, and key dates related to the Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter movements—points unequivocally to the **United States**.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the events represented in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n  - The red line's annual peak in February corresponds to Black History Month in the USA.\n  - The yellow line's growing annual peak in June corresponds to Juneteenth in the USA.\n  - The blue line's peaks in January and May correspond to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the anniversary of George Floyd's death, both significant in the USA.\n  \"\"\"\n  country = \"United States\"\n  print(f\"The country where these historic events took place is the {country}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
