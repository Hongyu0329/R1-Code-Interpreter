    "My plan to solve this is to focus on the top-most part of the Kakuro puzzle, as the question only asks for the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n1.  **Identify the Clue:** I will first identify the \"run\" and the corresponding sum for the top two white squares from the puzzle image. A run is a sequence of white squares in a line (horizontally or vertically) that add up to the clue number in the adjacent black square.\n2.  **Determine Constraints:** The rules of Kakuro state that each run must be filled with unique digits from 1 to 9. For the top two squares, this means we need to find two *different* numbers between 1 and 9.\n3.  **Find the Combination:** I will look for all possible pairs of unique digits that add up to the identified clue number.\n4.  **Formulate Code:** I will write a Python script that systematically finds this pair of numbers and prints the reasoning and the final answer. The script will demonstrate how the solution is found based on the rules.\n\nBased on this plan, the clue for the two top squares is 17. The code will find the two unique digits from 1 to 9 that sum to 17.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_top_row_of_kakuro():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves for the numbers in the top two squares of the provided Kakuro puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Present the result. For this specific clue, there is only one possibility.\n    if len(valid_combinations) == 1:\n        result = valid_combinations[0]\n        num1 = result[0]\n        num2 = result[1]\n        \n        print(\"Step 3: A single unique combination was found.\")\n        print(f\"The only pair of unique digits that sums to 17 is {num1} and {num2}.\")\n        print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {target_sum}\")\n        print(\"\\nTherefore, the two numbers present in the top white squares must be:\")\n        # The question's example format is \"1,3\", so we print in that format.\n        print(f\"{num1},{num2}\")\n\n    else:\n        # This part handles cases where more information would be needed, though not for this problem.\n        print(f\"Found {len(valid_combinations)} possibilities.
