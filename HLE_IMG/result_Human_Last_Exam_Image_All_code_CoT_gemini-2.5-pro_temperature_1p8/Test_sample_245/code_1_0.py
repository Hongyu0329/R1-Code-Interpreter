  # Part (b): Risk of Lyme disease transmission
  lyme_risk_assessment = "(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). The primary vector for Lyme disease in much of North America is the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis). However, American Dog Ticks can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever."
