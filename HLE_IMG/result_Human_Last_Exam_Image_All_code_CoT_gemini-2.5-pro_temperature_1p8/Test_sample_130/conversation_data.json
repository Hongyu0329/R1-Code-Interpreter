    "Based on the unique pattern of spectral lines, especially the prominent green line, the element can be identified by comparing its emission spectrum to known spectra of various elements. The provided spectrum, with its strong lines in the green, blue-violet, and yellow-orange regions, is a characteristic fingerprint of a specific element.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this comparison. The script will contain a database of prominent spectral lines for a few candidate elements. It will then compare a set of wavelengths estimated from the image against this database to find the best match. The most prominent lines I can visually estimate from the image are approximately at 405 nm (violet), 436 nm (blue), 546 nm (green), and a pair around 578 nm (yellow-orange).\n\nThe script will calculate a match score for each element and identify the one with the highest score.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its observed spectral lines\n    with a database of known spectral lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Database of prominent visible spectral lines for some elements (in nanometers)\n    spectral_lines_data = {\n        'Hydrogen': [410.2, 434.0, 486.1, 656.3],\n        'Helium': [447.1, 501.6, 587.6, 667.8],\n        'Mercury': [404.7, 435.8, 546.1, 577.0, 579.1],\n        'Sodium': [589.0, 589.6] # Strong doublet\n    }\n\n    # Prominent spectral lines estimated from the provided image (in nanometers)\n    # The image shows strong lines in violet, blue, green, and a yellow-orange doublet.\n    observed_spectrum_approx_nm = [405, 436, 546, 578]\n\n    print(\"Attempting to identify the element from its spectral lines.\")\n    print(f\"Observed prominent lines (approx. nm): {observed_spectrum_approx_nm}\\n\")\n\n    best_match_element = None\n    best_match_score = -1\n    match_details = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n    # Tolerance for matching wavelengths (in nm)\n    tolerance = 8.0\n\n    # Compare the observed spectrum with the known spectra\n    for element, known_lines in spectral_lines_data.items():\n        score = 0\n        current_matches = []\n        for obs_line in observed_spectrum_approx_nm:\n            for known_line in known_lines:\n                if abs(obs_line - known_line) <= tolerance:\n                    score += 1\n                    current_matches.append(f\"{obs_line}nm ~ {known_line}nm\")\n                    break # Count each observed line only once per element\n        \n        match_details[element] = current_matches\n        \n        if score > best_match_score:\n            best_match_score = score\n            best_match_element = element\n\n    print(\"--- Matching Results ---\")\n    for element in spectral_lines_data:\n        score = len(match_details[element])\n        print(f\"Element: {element}, Match Score: {score}/{len(observed_spectrum_approx_nm)}\")\n        if match_details[element]:\n            print(f\"  Matched lines: {', '.join(match_details[element])}\")\n    print(\"------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    if best_match_element:\n        print(f\"The element with the best match is {best_match_element}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not identify the element.\")\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Mercury>>>"
