    "This is a piano arrangement of the theme song \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\" from the video game *Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*. The piece is known for its frantic and complex melody, which has led to numerous highly virtuosic piano arrangements circulating online. The provided sheet music showcases many of these characteristic elements, such as the rapid arpeggios, complex chord progressions, and sudden dynamic shifts.\n\nThe main, recognizable melody begins in measure 4.\n\nI will write a simple python script to print the name of the music.\n\n```python\ndef guess_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music from the sheet music provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    game_title = \"Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\"\n    song_title = \"U.N.
