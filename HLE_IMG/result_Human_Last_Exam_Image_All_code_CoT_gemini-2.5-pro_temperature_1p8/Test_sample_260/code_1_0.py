    - The image of a faded, ghostly "lost small deity" points to the transient nature of existence and the fading of beliefs.
    - The poem "Velvet fades" reinforces the theme of impermanence and the passage of time.
    - The series title 'Phantasmagoria' (dream-like, ghostly apparitions) supports these themes.
    - Option B, "The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs," best encapsulates these core ideas.
