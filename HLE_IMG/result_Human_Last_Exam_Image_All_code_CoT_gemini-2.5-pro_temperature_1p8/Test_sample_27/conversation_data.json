    "My plan is to identify the artist's full name from the signature visible in the painting.\n\n1.  I will examine the provided images, specifically the cropped versions, to find the artist's signature.\n2.  The last crop, showing the bottom-right corner of the painting, clearly displays a signature and a date.\n3.  The signature appears to be \"Picabia\" and the date \"39\", likely referring to 1939.\n4.  A search for an artist named Picabia reveals the prominent French avant-garde painter, **Francis Picabia**.\n5.  I will now write a Python script to print this full name.\n\n```python\n# The artist's full name as identified from the signature in the painting.\nartist_full_name = \"Francis Picabia\"\nprint(artist_full_name)\n```\n<<<Francis Picabia>>>"
