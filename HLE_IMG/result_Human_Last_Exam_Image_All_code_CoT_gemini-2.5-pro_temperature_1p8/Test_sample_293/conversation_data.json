    "Based on my analysis of the provided histopathology image, I will identify the key pathological features and determine the diagnosis. The primary finding is the presence of a crescent-shaped cellular proliferation within Bowman's space, which is characteristic of a specific type of severe glomerular injury.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Key Features:** The image shows a glomerulus with a large, cellular crescent filling Bowman's space and compressing the glomerular tuft. There are also signs of glomerular hypercellularity and inflammation.\n2.  **Determine Diagnosis:** The presence of a crescent is the defining feature of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n3.  **Output with Code:** I will use a Python script to print the diagnosis along with the key features observed in the image, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features from the histopathology image and provides a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic glomerulonephritis\"\n    \n    key_features = [\n        \"A large cellular crescent filling Bowman's space.\",\n        \"Compression of the glomerular tuft.\",\n        \"Hypercellularity within the glomerulus.\",\n        \"Signs of fibrinoid necrosis (pink, amorphous material).\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(f\"Histopathological Diagnosis: {diagnosis}\")\n    print(\"\\nKey Observable Features:\")\n    for feature in key_features:\n        print(f\"- {feature}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
