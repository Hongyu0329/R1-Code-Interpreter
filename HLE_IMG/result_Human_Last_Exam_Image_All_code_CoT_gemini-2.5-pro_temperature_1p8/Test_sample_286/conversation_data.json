    "To determine which diagram shows a physically valid quantum evolution for a single qubit, we must check if the plotted quantities obey the fundamental constraints imposed by quantum mechanics. The quantities are `<σz>` (the expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator), `|<σ+>|` (the magnitude of the expectation value of the raising operator), and `S` (the von Neumann entropy).\n\nThe main physical constraints are:\n1.  **Bounds on Expectation Values**:\n    *   The eigenvalues of σz are +1 and -1, so its expectation value `<σz>` must lie in the range `[-1, 1]`.\n    *   The magnitude of the expectation value of the raising operator, `|<σ+>|`, is bounded by `0.5`.\n2.  **Entropy**: The von Neumann entropy `S` must be non-negative, `S >= 0`.\n3.  **Purity and the Bloch Vector**: The state of a qubit can be represented by a Bloch vector **r** with components `(rx, ry, rz)`, where `rz = <σz>`. The purity of the state is related to the length of this vector, `|r|^2 <= 1`. This leads to a combined constraint on the plotted observables: `4 * |<σ+>|^2 + <σz>^2 <= 1`. For a pure state, `S=0` and `|r|^2 = 1`. For a mixed state, `S>0` and `|r|^2 < 1`.\n\nThe following Python code systematically checks each plot against these rules using representative data points estimated from the graphs.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_plots():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes six plots of quantum evolution and identifies the physically valid one by\n    checking fundamental physical constraints for a single-qubit system.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the physical validity of the quantum evolution in each plot for a single qubit system.\\n\")\n    print(\"The primary constraints we check are:\")\n    print(\"1. -1 <= <σz> <= 1\")\n    print(\"2. 0 <= |<σ+>| <= 0.5\")\n    print(\"3.
