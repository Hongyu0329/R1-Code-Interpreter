# Plan:
# 1. Synthesize Perylene from 2-acetylnaphthalene.
# 2. Synthesize Diphenylacetylene (DPA) from benzaldehyde.
# 3. Combine Perylene and DPA to form the final product.

# Number of steps to synthesize Perylene from 2-acetylnaphthalene
steps_perylene = 4

# Number of steps to synthesize Diphenylacetylene from benzaldehyde
steps_dpa = 3

# Number of steps for the final assembly from Perylene and DPA
steps_final_assembly = 3

# Calculate the total minimum number of steps
total_steps = steps_perylene + steps_dpa + steps_final_assembly

# Output the calculation
print(f"The calculation for the total number of steps is:")
print(f"{steps_perylene} + {steps_dpa} + {steps_final_assembly} = {total_steps}")
print(f"Therefore, the minimum number of steps required is {total_steps}.")
