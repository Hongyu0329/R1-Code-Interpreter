    "My plan is to first identify the insect in the image. The insect is black and orange/red, perched on a yellow flower which appears to be goldenrod. Based on its distinctive markings (a red-orange band across the top of the thorax and red-orange borders on its wing covers), I can identify it as a Small Milkweed Bug. I will then find its scientific name and provide a Python script to print it.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n  The animal has been identified as the Small Milkweed Bug.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Lygaeus kalmii\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
