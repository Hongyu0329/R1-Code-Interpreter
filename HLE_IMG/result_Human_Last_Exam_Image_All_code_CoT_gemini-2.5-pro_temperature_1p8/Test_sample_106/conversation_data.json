    "This problem describes a classic acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a triterpenoid, specifically the conversion of friedelan-3β-ol to olean-12-ene. This transformation involves a cascade of carbocation rearrangements ([1,2]-shifts).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism to determine the final positions of the migrating groups:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 is protonated by HCl, and subsequently leaves as a water molecule (H₂O), forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial carbocation undergoes a series of shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations, propagating the positive charge across the molecule's backbone.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH₃) from C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge is now at C-4 (tertiary carbocation). The original C-4 now has only one methyl group left.\n    *   **Shift 2:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C-5 migrates to C-4. The positive charge is now at C-5 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 3:** A methyl group (CH₃) from C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge is now at C-10 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 4:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge is now at C-9 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 5:** A methyl group (CH₃) from C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge is now at C-8 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 6:** A methyl group (CH₃) from C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge is now at C-14 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 7:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge is now at C-13 (tertiary carbocation).\n3.  **Elimination:** A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-12 position to form the stable, tetrasubstituted C-12=C-13 double bond, yielding the final product, olean-12-ene.\n\nNow, we can identify the substituent at each numbered position in the final product based on which group migrated where:\n\n*   **Position 1 (original C-4):** Started with two methyl groups. One migrated away. Thus, a **CH₃** group remains.\n*   **Position 2 (original C-10):** Started with a methyl group which migrated to C-5. It received a hydrogen atom from C-9. Thus, a **H** atom is now at this position.\n*   **Position 3 (original C-9):** Started with a hydrogen atom which migrated to C-10. It received a methyl group from C-8. Thus, a **CH₃** group is now at this position.\n*   **Position 4 (original C-8):** Started with a methyl group which migrated to C-9. It received a methyl group from C-14. Thus, a **CH₃** group is now at this position.\n*   **Position 5 (original C-14):** Started with a methyl group which migrated to C-8. It received a hydrogen atom from C-13. Thus, a **H** atom is now at this position.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at the labeled positions\n    after the backbone rearrangement and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: 'CH3',\n        2: 'H',\n        3: 'CH3',\n        4: 'CH3',\n        5: 'H'\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as \"1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\"\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        group = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {group}\")\n\n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
