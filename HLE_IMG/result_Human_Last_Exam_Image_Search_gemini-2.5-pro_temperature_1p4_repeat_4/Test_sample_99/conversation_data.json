    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we can follow the reaction step-by-step and balance the atoms.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction is a condensation and cyclization between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n\n1.  **Reactant Molecular Formulas:**\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** The chemical formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** The chemical formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic heterocyclic synthesis (a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis or similar condensation). The amino group and the ring nitrogen of the thiazole react with the chloro-keto-ester. This type of reaction typically involves the formation of a fused ring system with the elimination of small molecules. In this case, the reaction is a condensation that forms a bicyclic product with the elimination of a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and a molecule of water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Intermediate Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   **Atoms in reactants:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 9 = 13\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1\n        *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   **Atoms eliminated:** HCl and H₂O\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 1 + 2 = 3\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1\n    *   **Atoms in intermediate:**\n        *   C: 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   S: 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe intermediate is then reacted with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The reagent combination of trimethylaluminum and a primary amine (benzylamine) is used to convert a carbonyl group (C=O), such as a ketone or an ester, into an imine (C=N-R) or an amide. In this case, one of the two oxygen atoms in the intermediate is replaced by the nitrogen from benzylamine. This is a condensation reaction where the carbonyl group reacts with benzylamine to form an imine, eliminating one molecule of water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula of Benzylamine:** The formula for benzylamine is C₇H₉N.\n\n3.  **Final Product Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   We start with the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and react it with benzylamine (C₇H₉N), eliminating water (H₂O).\n    *   **Atoms in:** (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + (C₇H₉N)\n    *   **Atoms out:** H₂O\n    *   **Atoms in the final product:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 9 + 7 = 16\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 10 + 9 - 2 = 17\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₆H₁₇N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C₁₆H₁₇N₃OS>>>"
