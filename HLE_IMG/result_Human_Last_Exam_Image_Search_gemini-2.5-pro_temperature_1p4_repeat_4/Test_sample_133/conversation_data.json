    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The group of peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio appears at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This cluster, with peaks separated by 2 mass units, is characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine or bromine atoms. The relative intensities of these peaks (m/z 260: 34.8%, m/z 262: 29.0%, m/z 264: 12.9%, m/z 266: 3.22%) approximate the theoretical abundance ratio for a molecule containing **three chlorine atoms** (which is roughly 27:27:9:1). Therefore, the molecular ion containing the lightest isotopes (³⁵Cl) is at m/z 260.\n\n2.  **Base Peak and Primary Fragmentation:** The most intense peak in the spectrum (the base peak) is at m/z 225. The mass difference between the molecular ion peak and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (specifically, the ³⁵Cl isotope), a very common initial fragmentation step for organochloride compounds.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Base Peak:** The base peak fragment at m/z 225 shows its own isotopic cluster, with a significant peak at m/z 227 (relative intensity 66.7%). The intensity ratio of the peak at m/z 227 to the peak at m/z 225 is 66.7 / 100 = 0.667. This value is a perfect match for the theoretical ratio for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms** (approximately 2/3 or 6:9). This confirms that the initial molecule contained three chlorine atoms, and the loss of one leads to this stable fragment.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Determination:** From the above analysis, the molecule contains three chlorine atoms. The mass of the rest of the molecule (the CₓHᵧ portion) can be calculated from the monoisotopic molecular mass: 260 u (for M⁺) - 3 × 35 u (for 3 × ³⁵Cl) = 155 u. The most plausible atomic combination for a mass of 155 u is C₁₂H₁₁. Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n5.  **Structure and IUPAC Name:** The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6, suggesting the presence of aromatic rings. While the exact isomeric structure cannot be determined with absolute certainty without a library match, a plausible structure must account for the observed formula. One possible isomer that fits the molecular formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ is **1,2,3-Trichloro-1-phenylcyclohexane**.\n\nTherefore, the compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is an isomer of trichlorophenylcyclohexane.\n\n<<<1,2,3-Trichloro-1-phenylcyclohexane>>>"
