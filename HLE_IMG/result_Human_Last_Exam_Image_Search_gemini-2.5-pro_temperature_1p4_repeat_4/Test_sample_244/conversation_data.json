    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Graphis***, commonly known as **script lichen**.\n\nThis identification is based on the distinct visual characteristics of the organism. It presents as a thin, pale, crust-like growth (the thallus) on the smooth bark of a tree. The most notable feature is the presence of fine, black, branching lines that resemble ancient script or hieroglyphs. These markings are the lichen's reproductive structures, called apothecia.\n\nThis type of lichen is a crustose lichen, meaning it grows tightly adhered to the substrate, in this case, the tree's bark. While there are other epiphytic organisms like liverworts that also grow on trees, their appearance is different. For example, leafy liverworts like *Frullania* have more scale-like or leafy structures, and thallose liverworts such as *Metzgeria* form forked, ribbon-like patches which are typically yellowish-green. The intricate, dark, script-like pattern in the photo is the hallmark of the *Graphis* genus.\n\n<<<Graphis>>>"
