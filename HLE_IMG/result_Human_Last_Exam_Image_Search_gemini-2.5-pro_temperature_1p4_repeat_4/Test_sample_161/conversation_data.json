    "The reactant needed for the transformation is a protected form of aminoguanidine. Aminoguanidine itself has the structure `H₂N-NH-C(=NH)NH₂`. In this reaction, a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group is attached to one of the hydrazine nitrogen atoms.\n\nThe specific reactant is **N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine** (sometimes referred to as N-Boc-aminoguanidine). Its chemical structure is `Boc-NH-NH-C(=NH)NH₂`.\n\nThis compound reacts with the α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, in a cyclocondensation reaction to form the substituted 1,2-diaminoimidazole product. The α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, while the N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine provides the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the substituents at N1 and C2. This type of reaction is a known method for synthesizing N-amino-2-aminoimidazoles.\n\n<<<N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
