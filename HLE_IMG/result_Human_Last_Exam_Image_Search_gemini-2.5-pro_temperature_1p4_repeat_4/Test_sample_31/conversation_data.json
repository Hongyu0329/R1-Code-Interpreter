    "The knot depicted in the image is identified as the $8_{19}$ knot in the Rolfsen knot table. It is also known as the torus knot T(4,3) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2).\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, also referred to as the s-invariant, is a powerful tool in knot theory. It is an integer assigned to a knot that provides valuable information about its properties within 4-dimensional space. For the $8_{19}$ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is -6. This invariant is derived from the Khovanov homology of the knot.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the signature of the $8_{19}$ knot is also 6. While the Rasmussen invariant and the signature are related, they are not always equal, although they are for alternating knots. The $8_{19}$ knot is the first non-homologically thin knot in the Rolfsen table, meaning its Khovanov homology has entries off the main diagonal.\n\n<<<âˆ’6>>>"
