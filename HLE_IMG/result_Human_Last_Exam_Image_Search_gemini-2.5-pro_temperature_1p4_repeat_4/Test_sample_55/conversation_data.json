    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397 form an F-sharp half-diminished seventh chord.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Notes:** The notes present in the circled portion of measure 8 are F#, A, C, and E.\n*   **Chord Quality:** These notes construct an F-sharp half-diminished seventh chord, also known as an F-sharp minor seventh flat five (F#m7♭5). A half-diminished seventh chord consists of a root, a minor third, a diminished fifth, and a minor seventh. The notes F#-A-C-E fit this structure.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** The piece is in the key of D minor. The F# half-diminished seventh chord resolves to a G minor chord in the following measure (measure 9). In the key of D minor, G minor is the subdominant (iv). A leading-tone chord typically resolves to its tonic. Since the F# half-diminished chord resolves to G minor, it is functioning as a secondary leading-tone chord for the subdominant.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** Therefore, the correct Roman numeral for this chord is **viiø⁷/iv**. The \"ø\" symbol signifies a half-diminished quality, the \"7\" indicates it's a seventh chord, and the \"/iv\" shows that it is the leading-tone chord of the subdominant.\n\n<<<viiø⁷/iv>>>"
