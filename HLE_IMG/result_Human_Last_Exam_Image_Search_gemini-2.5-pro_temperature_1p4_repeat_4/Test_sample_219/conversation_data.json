    "The synchronized bursts, which are the dense vertical bands of firing activity across a large number of electrodes, occur at approximately the following timestamps:\n*   **Burst 1:** 2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 15 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 36 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 48 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval, we find the time difference between the start of each consecutive burst:\n*   **Interval 1:** 15 s - 2 s = 13 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 27 s - 15 s = 12 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 36 s - 27 s = 9 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\nThe average of these intervals is:\n(13 + 12 + 9 + 12) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n<<<12>>>"
