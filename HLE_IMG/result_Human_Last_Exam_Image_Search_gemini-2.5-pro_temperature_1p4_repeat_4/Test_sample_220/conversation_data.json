    "To identify which diagram represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, it's necessary to understand the characteristic atomic arrangement of this projection.\n\nAn FCC lattice has atoms at each corner and in the center of each face of a cube. When this structure is viewed along the direction (a line passing through a corner and a diagonal on the opposite face), the atoms project onto a 2D plane in a specific pattern. The defining feature of the FCC projection is a centered rectangle. The atoms form a rectangular grid with an additional atom in the center of the rectangle. These rectangular arrangements are then stacked in an ABAB... sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the given images:\n*   **Image A:** Shows two identical rectangular patterns of atoms, one behind the other. It lacks the central atom characteristic of the FCC projection.\n*   **Image B:** This image clearly shows a rectangular arrangement of atoms with another atom located in the center of the rectangle. This matches the known pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the direction. The other atoms visible belong to an adjacent layer, consistent with the layered structure of this projection.\n*   **Image C:** Displays a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image D:** Presents a simple rectangular grid of atoms, which does not correspond to the centered rectangular pattern of the FCC view.\n\nBased on this analysis, Image B is the correct representation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
