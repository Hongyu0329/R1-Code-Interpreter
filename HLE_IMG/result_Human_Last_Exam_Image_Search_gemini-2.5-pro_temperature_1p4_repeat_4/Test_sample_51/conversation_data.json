    "The Ancient Greek word in the manuscript is **μάνθανε** (mánthane).\n\nThis is the present active imperative, second-person singular form of the common verb **μανθάνω** (manthánō), which means \"to learn.\" Therefore, the word commands, \"Learn!\"\n\nHere is a breakdown of the transcription from the Byzantine minuscule script:\n\n*   **μ (mu)**: The first letter is a standard mu.\n*   **α (alpha)**: The second letter is an alpha.\n*   **ν (nu)**: The third letter is a nu, written in a form that connects to the following letter.\n*   **θ (theta)**: The fourth letter is a clearly identifiable theta.\n*   **α (alpha) with circumflex**: The fifth letter is an alpha with a circumflex accent (περισπωμένη), indicating the correct accentuation for this verb form.\n*   **ν (nu)**: The sixth letter is a nu.\n*   **ε (epsilon)**: The final letter is a Byzantine epsilon, which can sometimes resemble a small loop or a mirrored 'c'.\n\nThe word is a common term found in classical and Byzantine Greek texts.\n\n<<<μάνθανε>>>"
