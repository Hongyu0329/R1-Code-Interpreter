    "Based on the visual evidence from the images and entomological facts, here is the determination of the sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n*   **A: Male, Female (3)** The bee on the right (A2) has a distinctly pointed, conical abdomen, which is characteristic of a female cuckoo bee of the genus *Coelioxys*. Females use this specialized abdomen to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. The bee on the left (A1) has a less pointed abdomen with visible spines at the tip and longer antennae, which are characteristic features of male *Coelioxys*.\n\n*   **B: Female, Male (4)** The wasps pictured are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. A key feature for telling the sexes apart is the antennae. The wasp on the right (B2) has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips, a classic trait for males. The wasp on the left (B1) has straighter, non-curled antennae and a more pointed abdomen, consistent with a female possessing a stinger.\n\n*   **C: Male, Male (1)** The bees in this pair are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The bee on the left (C1) exhibits features typical of a male: very long antennae and a yellow patch on its face (clypeus). The bee on the right (C2) also appears to be a male, as it lacks the dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on the hind legs that females of this genus possess. Both male and female long-horned bees feed on nectar, but only females collect pollen.\n\n<<<3, 4, 1>>>"
