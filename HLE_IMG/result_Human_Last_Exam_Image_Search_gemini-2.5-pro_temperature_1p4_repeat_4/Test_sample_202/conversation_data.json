    "H: **Scoria** - This specimen is a reddish-brown volcanic rock characterized by its high vesicularity (numerous holes). Scoria forms when gas-rich magma is ejected from a volcano and solidifies, trapping gas bubbles within the rock. Its color can range from black or dark gray to a deep reddish-brown. Unlike the lighter-colored pumice, scoria has thicker vesicle walls and is denser.\n\nI: **Breccia** - This rock is composed of various angular and poorly sorted fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This composition defines it as a clastic sedimentary rock known as breccia. The angular nature of the clasts indicates that they were not transported far from their source before being consolidated.\n\nJ: **Pumice** - This is a light-colored, extrusive igneous rock with a frothy and vesicular texture. Pumice is formed from the rapid cooling of gas-rich, frothy lava, creating a rock so porous that it can often float on water. Its light color, which can be white, cream, or gray, helps distinguish it from the darker scoria.\n\nK: **Pegmatite** - This specimen is an intrusive igneous rock distinguished by its very large, interlocking crystals. Pegmatites typically have a composition similar to granite but are defined by their exceptionally coarse-grained texture, which results from the slow crystallization of magma, often in the final stages of a magma body cooling. The large crystals of minerals like feldspar and quartz are clearly visible.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
