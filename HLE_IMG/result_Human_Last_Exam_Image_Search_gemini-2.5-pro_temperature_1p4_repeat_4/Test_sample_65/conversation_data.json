    "The distinctive, tightly curled leaves that give the shoots a braided or rope-like appearance are characteristic of a few moss genera.\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the search results point towards a couple of possibilities known for this \"filiform\" or braided growth habit. One strong candidate is *Pterigynandrum filiforme*, which is specifically described as having \"slender, sleek, braided stems\". Another possibility is a variety of *Hypnum*, specifically *Hypnum cupressiforme var. filiforme*, which is also noted for its distinctive \"filiform julaceous stems\".\n\nHowever, the common name \"screw moss\" typically refers to the genus *Tortula*. Species in this genus, like *Tortula muralis* (Wall Screw-moss), are known for having leaves that twist and curl when dry. When moist, the leaves spread out. The plant in the image appears to be moist, yet it retains a very strong, regular, braided coiling along the entire stem, which is a hallmark of *Pterigynandrum*.\n\nComparing the image to the descriptions, the term \"braided\" seems more apt than \"screwed\" or \"twisted\" in this case. *Pterigynandrum filiforme* is consistently described with this braided appearance. Therefore, the plant most likely belongs to the genus *Pterigynandrum*.\n\n<<<Pterigynandrum>>>"
