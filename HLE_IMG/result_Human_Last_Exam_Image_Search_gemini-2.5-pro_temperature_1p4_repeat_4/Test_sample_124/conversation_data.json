    "To determine the current flowing through the circuit, we first need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit. The total current can then be found using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the left branch (R1, R2, R3):**\n    *   Resistor R1 (3 Ω) is connected in parallel with a wire. A wire is assumed to have zero resistance, so it creates a short circuit across R1. When a resistor is in parallel with a short circuit, all the current will flow through the short circuit (the path of least resistance). Therefore, R1 is effectively bypassed and can be ignored for the calculation.\n    *   Similarly, resistor R3 (9 Ω) is connected in parallel with a wire that leads to the ground. This wire shorts out R3. Consequently, R3 is also bypassed.\n    *   This leaves only resistor R2 (7 Ω) in the left branch, connected directly across the 1 V voltage source.\n\n2.  **Analyze the right branch (R7, R8):**\n    *   Resistor R8 (100 Ω) and resistor R7 (100 Ω) are connected in series.\n    *   The total resistance of this branch is the sum of the individual resistances: R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n3.  **Combine the branches:**\n    *   The circuit simplifies to two parallel branches connected to the 1 V source.\n    *   Branch 1 has a resistance of 7 Ω (R2).\n    *   Branch 2 has a resistance of 200 Ω (R7 + R8).\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we can calculate the current flowing through each branch and then sum them to find the total current from the source.\n\n*   **Current in the left branch (I₁):**\n    Using Ohm's Law: I₁ = V / R₂ = 1 V / 7 Ω ≈ 0.1429 A\n\n*   **Current in the right branch (I₂):**\n    Using Ohm's Law: I₂ = V / (R₇ + R₈) = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n\n*   **Total Current (I_total):**\n    The total current is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\n    I_total = I₁ + I₂\n    I_total = (1/7) A + (1/200) A\n    I_total = (200/1400) A + (7/1400) A\n    I_total = 207 / 1400 A\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\nI_total ≈ 0.147857 A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is approximately 0.148 A.\n\n<<<0.148 A>>>"
