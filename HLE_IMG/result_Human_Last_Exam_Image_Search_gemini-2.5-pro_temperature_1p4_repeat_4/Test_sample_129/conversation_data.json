    "This image displays the crystal structure of the human **NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE)**, also known as the **APPBP1-UBA3 heterodimer**, in a complex with the protein NEDD8. The specific structure shown corresponds to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry **1R4N**.\n\nKey details about this protein complex:\n\n*   **Function:** NAE is the E1 activating enzyme essential for neddylation, a crucial post-translational modification process. This process involves attaching the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, which regulates various cellular activities, including cell cycle progression, survival, and development.\n*   **Structure:** NAE is a heterodimer, meaning it is composed of two different protein subunits:\n    *   **NAE1** (also called APP-BP1): The regulatory subunit, depicted in the image as the larger dark blue domain.\n    *   **UBA3:** The catalytic subunit.\n*   **Complex:** The image shows the NAE heterodimer bound to **NEDD8** (the small, light blue protein) and an ATP molecule at the active site. This quaternary complex illustrates a key step in the activation of NEDD8 before it is transferred to other enzymes in the neddylation pathway. The neddylation pathway is a target for cancer therapy, with inhibitors like Pevonedistat being developed to block the function of this enzyme.\n\n<<<NEDD8-activating enzyme (APPBP1-UBA3) complexed with NEDD8>>>"
