    "Based on the visible organisms, the definitive species indicating this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle.\n\nThe larger snail with the light and dark brown spiraled shell is identifiable as the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*). This species is native to the coasts of Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It has since become one of the most abundant snails in the intertidal zone of the Northwest Atlantic, with a range from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey or Delaware in the United States.\n\nCrucially, while there have been sporadic introductions on the Pacific coast, *Littorina littorea* has not established sustained populations there. Its established and widespread presence is a key feature of Atlantic rocky shores.\n\nOther organisms in the photo support an Atlantic location but are not as definitive:\n*   **Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*):** The whitish snail is likely a Dog Whelk. This species is native to the North Atlantic coasts of both North America and Europe and is not found on the Pacific coast.\n*   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*):** The acorn barnacles are most likely this species. However, *Semibalanus balanoides* is common on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and therefore cannot be used as the sole indicator.\n\nThe presence of *Littorina littorea* provides the most conclusive evidence for an Atlantic coast location.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
