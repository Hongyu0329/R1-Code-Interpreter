    "This image was taken in Seattle, Washington.\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the location is Golden Gardens Park in the Ballard neighborhood. The park is well-known for its stunning sunsets over Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains, as well as for allowing bonfires in designated fire pits on the beach. The photograph's perspective, looking down over a chain-link fence onto the beach, aligns with the park's geography, which features steep, forested hills with trails and facilities like an off-leash dog park situated above the main beach area. The combination of the sunset, the beach fire, and the elevated viewpoint from behind a fence makes Golden Gardens Park the definitive location.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
