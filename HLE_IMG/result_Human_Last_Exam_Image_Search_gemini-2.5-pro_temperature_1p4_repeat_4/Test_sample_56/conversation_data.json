    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe painting is titled \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Holes of Memory.\" This surrealist artwork was created by the Swiss painter Dominique Appia (1926-2017). His paintings often feature dreamlike scenarios where familiar elements are juxtaposed in imaginative ways. \"Entre les trous de la mémoire\" is one of his most recognized works and is noted for its blend of interior and exterior environments, and the interplay of elements like fire and water within the same space.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
