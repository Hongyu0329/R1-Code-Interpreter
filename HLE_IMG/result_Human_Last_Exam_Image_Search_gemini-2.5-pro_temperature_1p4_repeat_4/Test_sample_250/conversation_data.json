    "This jazz standard is titled \"Nica's Dream\" and was composed by Horace Silver.\n\nThe piece, written in 1954, is a tribute to the jazz patron Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. It was first recorded in 1956 by the Jazz Messengers. The composition is noted for its blend of Afro-Cuban rhythms and a bluesy feel, and it features a distinctive chord progression. The key signature with four flats and the initial F- chord are characteristic of the tune's typical arrangement in F minor.\n\n<<<\"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver>>>"
