    "The alkaloid compound shown in the image is **Matrine**.\n\nMatrine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid derived from plants of the *Sophora* genus. The chemical formula for the compound is C15H24N2O. While the name matrine sometimes refers to the structure with two saturated CH2 groups in the final ring, it is more formally and commonly used for the compound containing the carbonyl (C=O) group, which is chemically a lactam. The structure without the oxygen is named (âˆ’)-Sophoridine.\n\nThis compound and its derivatives are known for a variety of pharmacological effects, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. The name Matrine can also refer to a family of related alkaloids. Research has explored modifying its structure, particularly at the carbonyl position, to create derivatives with different biological activities.\n\nAnother name sometimes used for this structure is Sophocarpidine.\n\n<<<Matrine>>>"
