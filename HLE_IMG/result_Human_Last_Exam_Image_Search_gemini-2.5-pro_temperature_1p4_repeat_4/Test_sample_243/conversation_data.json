    "The plant in the image is a cultivar of *Hebe*, a genus of plants primarily endemic to New Zealand. The specific cultivar appears to be *Hebe* 'Celina', which is known for its distinctive dark green leaves with a striking network of creamy-white veins.\n\nHebes are popular evergreen shrubs, and while some are native to Australia and South America, the vast majority of species originate from New Zealand. Cultivars like 'Celina' are prized for their unique foliage and are derived from these native New Zealand species. Therefore, the island nation to which this plant's parent species were endemic is New Zealand.\n\n<<<New Zealand>>>"
