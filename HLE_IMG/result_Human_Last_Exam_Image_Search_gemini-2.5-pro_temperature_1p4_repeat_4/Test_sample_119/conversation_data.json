    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The mass spectrum displays a molecular ion peak (M+) at an m/z of 135. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, a principle known as the nitrogen rule.\n\n2.  **Elemental Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation:** Assuming one nitrogen atom, a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N. The degrees of unsaturation for this formula are calculated as 4, which is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Peaks observed above 3000 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C-H stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Signals below 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching in aliphatic (sp³) chains.\n    *   The absorptions in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ range are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    The combination of these signals points to a structure containing both a substituted phenyl group and an alkyl chain.\n\n4.  **¹³C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and DEPT-135:**\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows seven distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The DEPT-135 experiment, which distinguishes carbon types, reveals one negative signal (indicating a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (representing CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   The absence of one of the seven ¹³C signals in the DEPT spectrum implies it is a quaternary carbon. The signal at 145.1 ppm is assigned to this quaternary carbon, which is typical for a carbon atom in a benzene ring directly attached to a substituent.\n    *   Based on these data, the carbons are assigned as follows:\n        *   One quaternary C (145.1 ppm).\n        *   Three aromatic CH groups (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm).\n        *   One aliphatic CH group (49.6 ppm).\n        *   One aliphatic CH₂ group (43.5 ppm).\n        *   One aliphatic CH₃ group (19.2 ppm).\n\n5.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):**\n    *   A multiplet in the aromatic region (~7.2 ppm) integrates to 5 protons, which confirms the presence of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   The aliphatic region shows three distinct signals:\n        *   A multiplet corresponding to 2 protons (~2.7 ppm).\n        *   A multiplet corresponding to 1 proton (~3.1 ppm).\n        *   A doublet corresponding to 3 protons (~1.2 ppm), which is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a CH group.\n\n6.  **Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) Spectroscopy:** This 2D NMR technique correlates proton signals with their directly bonded carbon signals:\n    *   The 3H doublet at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm (the CH₃ group).\n    *   The 2H multiplet at ~2.7 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The 1H multiplet at ~3.1 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm (the CH group).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nBy assembling the identified fragments (a C₆H₅- group, a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and a -CH₃ group) and accounting for the molecular formula C₉H₁₃N, the structure is determined to be **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. This structure is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. Its common name is amphetamine.\n\nThe assignments are:\n*   **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**\n*   **¹H NMR:** 7.2 ppm (5H, C₆H₅), 2.7 ppm (2H, -CH₂-), 3.1 ppm (1H, -CH-), 1.2 ppm (3H, -CH₃). The two amine protons (-NH₂) are not distinctly observed, likely due to exchange or broadening.\n*   **¹³C NMR:** 145.1 (ipso-C), 128.5/127.3/126.3 (aromatic CH), 43.5 (-CH₂-), 49.6 (-CH-), 19.2 (-CH₃).\n\n### IUPAC Name\n\nThe parent chain is propane. The amine group is located on carbon 2, and the phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
