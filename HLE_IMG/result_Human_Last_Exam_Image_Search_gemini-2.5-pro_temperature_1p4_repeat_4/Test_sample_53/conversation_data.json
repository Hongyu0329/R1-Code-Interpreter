    "The figure leaving the chariot is the Greek goddess Aphrodite.\n\nThis scene is depicted on an Attic red-figure pelike, a type of storage jar, dating to around 370-360 BCE. The vase is attributed to the Meleager Painter and is currently housed at the Walters Art Museum.\n\nThe scene portrays a mythological narrative. The driver of the chariot is a figure in oriental-style clothing, identified in some contexts as a follower or aspect of the goddess. A winged figure, likely Eros, the god of love and Aphrodite's son, flies above. On the ground lies a deceased or dying youth, who may represent Adonis, Aphrodite's mortal lover. The overall composition suggests a story of departure and loss, possibly related to the myth of Aphrodite and Adonis.\n\nThe Meleager Painter was a notable Attic red-figure vase painter active in the first third of the 4th century BCE. He is known for painting various vase shapes and often depicted mythological scenes, including those with figures in oriental attire.\n\n<<<Aphrodite>>>"
