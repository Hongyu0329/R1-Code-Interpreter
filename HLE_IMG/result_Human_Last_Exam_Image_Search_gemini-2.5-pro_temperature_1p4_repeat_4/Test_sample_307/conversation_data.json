    "I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question because the specific parameters of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized in the image cannot be determined from the image alone. To calculate the infinity-norm for each of the nine symbols, which represents the maximum absolute value within each dataset, the defining quantum numbers (j₁, j₂, j₃, m₁, m₂, m₃) for each plot are required.\n\nDespite multiple search attempts using reverse image search techniques and targeted keyword queries, the original source of the image, which would contain this essential information, could not be located. The search results provided general information about Wigner 3-j symbols, their properties, graphical representations, and available calculation software, but did not contain the specific image or the parameters needed to perform the calculation.\n\nFor example, searches for galleries of Wigner 3-j symbols, and even for publications by researchers known for this type of visualization, such as H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén, did not yield the provided image.\n\nTherefore, without the specific quantum numbers for each of the nine plots, it is impossible to calculate the individual infinity-norms and their subsequent ratio.\n\n<<<Unable to answer>>>"
