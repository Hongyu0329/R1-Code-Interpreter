    "The chemical reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol, likely friedelan-3β-ol, which results in a complex skeletal rearrangement known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a \"backbone rearrangement\". This process involves a cascade of consecutive hydride (H⁻) and methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts, ultimately leading to the formation of a more stable alkene, olean-13(18)-ene.\n\nTo determine the final substituents, we must trace the migration of the original methyl groups and hydrogens:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The alcohol at C-3 is protonated by HCl and departs as a water molecule, creating a carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Rearrangement Cascade:** A series of seven sequential 1,2-shifts occurs, moving the positive charge across the rings from C-3 to C-13. During this cascade, methyl groups and hydrogens migrate to adjacent carbons.\n3.  **Termination:** The rearrangement stops when the carbocation is at C-13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent C-18 to form the final, stable tetrasubstituted double bond.\n\nBy tracking the groups that migrate *away* from a position and the groups that migrate *to* it, we can identify the final substituents:\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-10):** The original methyl group at C-10 migrates away. A hydrogen atom from C-9 then shifts to this position. Therefore, the substituent at position 1 is H.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-5):** A methyl group migrates *to* this position from C-10. Therefore, the substituent at position 2 is CH₃.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-14):** The original hydrogen atom at C-14 migrates away. A methyl group then shifts to this position from C-13. Therefore, the substituent at position 3 is CH₃.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** The original methyl group at C-8 migrates away. A hydrogen atom then shifts to this position from C-14. Therefore, the substituent at position 4 is H.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-12):** This position is not directly involved in the rearrangement cascade. The hydrogen atom originally at C-12 remains in its position. Therefore, the substituent at position 5 is H.\n\n<<<1 = H, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
