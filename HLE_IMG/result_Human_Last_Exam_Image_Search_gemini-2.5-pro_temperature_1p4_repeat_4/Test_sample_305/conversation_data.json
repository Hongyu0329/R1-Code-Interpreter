    "The product with a French-derived name featured in the full version of this advertisement is **Bourjois** face powder.\n\nThis particular World War II era ad was part of a campaign that also included products like Tampax, using the same slogan \"Women are winning the War of Freedom.\" The campaign was aimed at the millions of women who had joined the workforce to support the war effort. In the case of the Bourjois ad, the full copy, not visible in the image provided, argues that while women were doing \"a man's work,\" the face powder helped them maintain their femininity and morale. This messaging was built on the idea that looking good was important for morale, which in turn helped women overcome the perceived social and physical limitations of their new roles.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
