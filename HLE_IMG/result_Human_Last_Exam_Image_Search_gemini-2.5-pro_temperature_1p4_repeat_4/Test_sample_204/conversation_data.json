    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and knowledge of mineral structures, the minerals can be identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n### Specimen Identification\n\n*   **Specimen C (Olivine):** This specimen displays a granular habit with a distinct olive-green color, which is characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra.\n*   **Specimen A (Tourmaline or Pyroxene):** This is a dark, prismatic crystal. Its elongated form and cross-section are common for tourmaline or pyroxene. Tourmaline is a cyclosilicate (ring silicate), and pyroxene is an inosilicate (single chain silicate). Both structures are more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n*   **Specimen B (Mica/Chlorite):** This specimen is flaky and has a greenish, pearly luster, which is typical for minerals in the mica or chlorite group. These minerals are phyllosilicates (sheet silicates), characterized by sheets of linked silica tetrahedra.\n*   **Specimen D (Quartz):** This specimen is a translucent, prismatic crystal, characteristic of quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate (framework silicate), where all four oxygen atoms of each silica tetrahedron are shared with other tetrahedra, forming a continuous three-dimensional framework.\n\n### Order of Increasing Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nThe complexity of silicate mineral structures is determined by the degree to which the silica (SiOâ‚„) tetrahedra are linked together (polymerized). The order from least to most complex is as follows:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** Individual silica tetrahedra are linked only by cations.\n2.  **Cyclosilicates (Ring Silicates) / Inosilicates (Chain Silicates):** Tetrahedra are linked to form rings or single/double chains.\n3.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheet Silicates):** Tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms to form two-dimensional sheets.\n4.  **Tectosilicates (Framework Silicates):** Tetrahedra share all four oxygen atoms to create a three-dimensional framework.\n\nFollowing this classification, the correct order for the specimens is:\n\n**C, A, B, D**\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
