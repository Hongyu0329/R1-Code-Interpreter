    "The solution to the riddle is \"Felt hat\". Here is a breakdown of how this answer fits both clues provided.\n\n### Clue 1: Pictured at an Event\n\nThe image displays Nikita Kucherov, a prominent Russian professional ice hockey player, receiving the Hart Memorial Trophy at the NHL Awards ceremony on June 19, 2019 (news reports about the event appeared on June 20). Kucherov had an outstanding season, leading the league with 128 points and winning not only the Hart Trophy for MVP but also the Ted Lindsay Award and the Art Ross Trophy.\n\nThe connection to \"felt hat\" comes from the hockey tradition of the \"hat trick,\" where a player scores three goals in a single game. When a player achieves this feat, fans often celebrate by throwing hats onto the ice, which can include felt hats. The term \"hat trick\" itself has historical ties to a hat-maker who would reward players with a free hat for scoring three goals. Therefore, the concept of a felt hat is intrinsically linked to the sport and the player pictured.\n\n### Clue 2: Discontinued Use Due to Mercury Toxicity\n\nThe second clue refers to the historical manufacturing process of felt hats. For centuries, hat-makers used a toxic compound, mercuric nitrate, in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur (like beaver, rabbit, or hare) to produce high-quality felt.\n\nThis process exposed hatters to mercury vapors, leading to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism, characterized by symptoms like tremors, confusion, and hallucinations. The phrase \"mad as a hatter,\" popularized by Lewis Carroll's character in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, is believed to have originated from this occupational hazard. Due to its severe toxicity, the use of mercury in felt production was banned in the United States in the early 1940s.\n\nThus, \"felt hat\" is the X Y that connects the hockey star in the image with a historical artifact whose creation involved toxic mercury salts.\n\n<<<Felt hat>>>"
