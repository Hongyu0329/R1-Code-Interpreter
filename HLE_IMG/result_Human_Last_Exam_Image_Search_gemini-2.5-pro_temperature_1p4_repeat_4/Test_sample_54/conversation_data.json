    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and established chemical literature, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\nThe first step of the reaction transforms compound **1**, a trioxatriangulenium salt, into compound **2**. This transformation involves the substitution of one of the oxygen ether bridges with an N-amino (`-N-NH₂`) group. This type of reaction is a characteristic nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the electron-deficient core, and the introduction of the `N-NH₂` moiety is achieved by using hydrazine, often in its hydrated form (N₂H₄·H₂O).\n\n**Reagent B: Butanal (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\nThe second step converts compound **2**, an N-amino-azatriangulenium derivative, into the dimethoxy quinacridinium salt **3**. This complex transformation involves a rearrangement of the molecular skeleton from a triangulenium core to a linear quinacridinium core. The reaction also substitutes the N-amino group and a second oxygen bridge to form an N-propyl group and an NH group, respectively. This specific reaction is documented in the chemical literature as the reaction of compound **2** with butanal (also known as butyraldehyde). The process initiates with the formation of a hydrazone, which then undergoes an acid-catalyzed rearrangement cascade to yield the final N-propyl substituted quinacridinium product **3**.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A**: Hydrazine\n*   **B**: Butanal\n\n<<<**A: Hydrazine (or Hydrazine hydrate), B: Butanal (or Butyraldehyde)**>>>"
