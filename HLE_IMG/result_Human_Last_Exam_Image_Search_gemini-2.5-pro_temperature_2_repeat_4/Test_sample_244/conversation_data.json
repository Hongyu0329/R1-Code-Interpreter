    "The epiphytic species in the image, characterized by its dark, net-like growth on the tree bark, belongs to the genus *Radula*. This organism is a type of liverwort.\n\nSpecifically, its appearance is highly characteristic of *Radula holtii*, commonly known as Holt's Scalewort. This species is described as being slender, flat, and often dark in color, forming patches on trees or damp, shaded rocks. The genus *Radula* is known to be abundant on tree trunks and branches. These liverworts are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants for support without being parasitic.\n\n<<<*Radula*>>>"
