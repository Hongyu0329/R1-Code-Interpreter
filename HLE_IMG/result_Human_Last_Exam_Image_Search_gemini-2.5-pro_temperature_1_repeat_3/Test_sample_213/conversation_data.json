    "The provided sheet music is from the opening of the second act of Alban Berg's opera, *Wozzeck*.\n\nThis can be identified by several key features in the score:\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a specific ensemble including two flutes (`2 gr. Fl.`), oboe (`I. Hob.`), English horn (`engl. Horn`), bassoon (`I. Fag.`), and a full string section, which matches the orchestration of *Wozzeck*.\n*   **German Markings:** The instruction \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the curtain rises at this point, marking the beginning of the act. Other German terms like `(mit DÃ¤mpfer)` (with mute) are also present.\n*   **Musical Style:** The atonal and expressionistic musical language, characterized by complex harmonies, detailed dynamic markings (from `pp` to `mf`), and specific instrumental effects like `gliss.` (glissando), is a hallmark of Alban Berg's compositional style in this opera.\n\nThe second act of *Wozzeck* begins in Marie's room, and the music sets a tense and atmospheric scene that reflects the dramatic development of the story.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
