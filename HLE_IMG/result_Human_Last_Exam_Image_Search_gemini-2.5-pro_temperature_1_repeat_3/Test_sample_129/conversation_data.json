    "Based on a reverse image search and analysis of the protein's structure, the name of the protein is **Hen egg-white lysozyme**.\n\nHen egg-white lysozyme, often abbreviated as HEWL, is an enzyme found in egg whites that plays a role in the immune system by damaging bacterial cell walls. It is a small, single-chain protein composed of 129 amino acids. The structure of HEWL was famously one of the first enzyme structures to be solved using X-ray diffraction.\n\nThe image displays a ribbon diagram of the protein's three-dimensional structure, determined through methods like X-ray crystallography. Numerous crystal structures of this protein are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a worldwide repository for biological macromolecule structures. The image provided is a common representation used for this particular protein.\n\n<<<Hen egg-white lysozyme>>>"
