    "The plant in the image is most likely *Daphne pontica*, commonly known as Pontic daphne or twin-flowered daphne. This identification is based on its leathery, evergreen leaves with a distinct reticulated or net-like vein pattern and its shrub-like appearance.\n\n*Daphne pontica* is not endemic to a single island. Its native range extends from Southeastern Bulgaria to Northern Iran, including regions like northern Turkey and the Caucasus. It is often found in the understory of woodlands in its natural habitat.\n\nWhile there is a closely related and morphologically similar plant, *Daphne libanotica*, which was historically considered endemic to Lebanon, major botanical databases currently list it as a synonym of the more widespread *Daphne pontica*. Therefore, based on current taxonomic consensus, the plant is native to a broader continental region rather than being endemic to an island.\n\n<<<*Daphne pontica* is not endemic to an island.>>>"
