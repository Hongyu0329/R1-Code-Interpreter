    "The knot in the image is the **5₂ knot**, also known as the three-twist knot. The image displays a diagram of an alternating knot with five crossings, which corresponds to the 5₂ knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K), for a knot K is an integer invariant derived from Khovanov homology. For alternating knots, a significant property is that the Rasmussen invariant is equal to twice the knot's signature (σ).\n\nThe signature of the 5₂ knot is -2. Therefore, its Rasmussen invariant can be calculated as follows:\n\ns(5₂) = 2 * σ(5₂) = 2 * (-2) = -4.\n\nThe Knot Atlas, a comprehensive database of knot properties, also lists the Rasmussen s-invariant for the 5₂ knot as -4.\n\n<<<−4>>>"
