    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element **Mercury (Hg)**.\n\nThe emission spectrum of mercury is characterized by a series of distinct bright lines across the visible spectrum, which are clearly visible in the provided image. Key spectral lines for mercury include:\n\n*   A violet line at approximately 405 nm.\n*   A blue line around 436 nm.\n*   A very prominent green line at 546 nm.\n*   A pair of distinct yellow lines at 577 nm and 579 nm.\n\nThe image provided by the user shows a pattern of lines that strongly corresponds to these known emission lines of mercury. Specifically, one can observe the lines in the blue region, a particularly bright and isolated green line, and prominent lines in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum. This unique \"fingerprint\" of spectral lines is characteristic of mercury vapor when it is excited, for instance, in a mercury-vapor lamp.\n\n<<<Mercury>>>"
