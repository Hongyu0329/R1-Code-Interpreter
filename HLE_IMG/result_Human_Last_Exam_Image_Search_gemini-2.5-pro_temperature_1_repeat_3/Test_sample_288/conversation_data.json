    "Based on the architectural details, the venue in the image is the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington.\n\nA search of the theater's past events indicates that there was no musical artist performing on October 12, 2023. A different event may have been scheduled, or the date may have been dark. A review of live music in 2023 mentions the band Metric played on October 12, 2023, but at The Roxy in Los Angeles, not the Martin Woldson Theater.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, no musical artist played at this venue on that specific date."
