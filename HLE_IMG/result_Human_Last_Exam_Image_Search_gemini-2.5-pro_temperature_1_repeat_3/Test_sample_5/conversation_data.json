    "This sheet music is a piano arrangement of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\". It is the theme music for the character Flandre Scarlet, the extra stage boss from the game *Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*.\n\nThe piece was originally composed by ZUN, the creator of the Touhou Project series. It has become one of the most popular and frequently arranged songs from the franchise, known for its energetic and complex nature. Many fan-made arrangements exist, including notoriously difficult \"Black MIDI\" versions.\n\n<<<U.N. Owen Was Her?>>>"
