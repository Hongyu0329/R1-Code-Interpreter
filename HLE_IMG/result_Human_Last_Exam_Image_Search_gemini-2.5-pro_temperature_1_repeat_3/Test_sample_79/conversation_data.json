    "The structure visible at coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is located in Presidio County, Texas, an area rich with historical and archaeological significance at the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos, known as La Junta de los Ríos.\n\nBased on the location and historical context of the area, the visible square outline is likely the remains of an early settlement or a fort. The La Junta de los Ríos region has been continuously occupied for thousands of years and was the site of numerous Native American pueblos and later, Spanish missions and presidios (forts).\n\nSeveral significant historical sites are in the immediate vicinity of Presidio, Texas:\n\n*   **Millington Site (41PS14):** A large prehistoric and early historic village, believed to be the settlement of \"Santiago\" mentioned in a 1582-1583 Spanish expedition. It was later the site of a Spanish mission. This site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a State Archeological Landmark.\n*   **Loma Alta (41PS15):** An archaeological site thought to be the historic pueblo of San Juan Evangelista, dating to roughly A.D. 1200 to 1700.\n*   **Fort Leaton State Historic Site:** Located a few miles southeast of Presidio, this was a large, fortified adobe trading post built in the 1830s. The area also contains markers for several other historical forts, including El Fortin de la Cienega and Presidio del Norte.\n\nWhile the specific name of the structure at the given coordinates is not definitively identified in the search results, its location within the La Junta Archeological District strongly suggests it is a historic landmark. The area is protected, and many of the ruins are part of ongoing archaeological investigations.\n\n<<<The square structure is part of the historically significant La Junta de los Ríos archaeological area in Presidio County, Texas, and is considered a historic landmark.>>>"
