    "The primary and most easily distinguishable difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the orientation of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the sporophyte features a **straight seta**. This results in an erect capsule.\n\nConversely, ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by an **arcuate, or curved, seta**. This curvature causes the capsule to be bent or nodding.\n\nTherefore, by observing whether the seta is straight or curved, one can readily distinguish between the sporophytes of these two moss species.\n\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
