    "This jazz standard is titled \"All the Things You Are,\" with music composed by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\nThe song was originally written for the 1939 musical *Very Warm for May*. Despite the musical's lack of success, \"All the Things You Are\" became a hit and an enduring jazz standard. Its popularity among jazz musicians is due to its strong melody and a challenging, logical chord structure that modulates through several keys.\n\nThe piece is known for its 36-measure form, a slight variation on the more common 32-bar AABA structure. Notable early recordings that helped popularize the song were made by artists such as Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, and Frankie Masters. It has since been recorded by a vast number of jazz artists, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Ella Fitzgerald, solidifying its place as an essential part of the jazz repertoire.\n\n<<<All the Things You Are by Jerome Kern>>>"
