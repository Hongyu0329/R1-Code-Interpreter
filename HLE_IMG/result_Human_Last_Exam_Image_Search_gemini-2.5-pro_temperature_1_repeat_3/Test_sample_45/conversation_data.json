    "The tiling in the image exhibits **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be determined by identifying points in the pattern around which the entire tiling can be rotated by a specific angle to appear unchanged. In the provided image, there are distinct star-shaped motifs and central points where multiple tiles meet.\n\nIf you focus on the center of one of the prominent star-like patterns, you can see that it is composed of seven \"arms\" or \"petals.\" Rotating the image around this central point by an angle of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) results in the tiling looking exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The number of times a pattern can be rotated within 360 degrees and still look the same is called the order of rotational symmetry. Since this can be done 7 times before returning to the original position, the tiling has 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nThis type of tiling is known as an aperiodic tiling, meaning it lacks translational symmetryâ€”it cannot be shifted in any direction to perfectly overlap with itself. Such tilings, particularly those with symmetries like 5-fold or 7-fold which are forbidden in periodic crystals by the crystallographic restriction theorem, are often related to quasicrystals. The specific tiling shown appears to be a known type of aperiodic tiling that can be generated using a set of specific geometric shapes, including rhombuses and other polygons, to achieve 7-fold symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
