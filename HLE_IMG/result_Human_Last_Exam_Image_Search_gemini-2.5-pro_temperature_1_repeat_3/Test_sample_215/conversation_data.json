    "Based on visual analysis of the home, its rural setting, and the number \"433\" on the utility pole, the residence is located at 433 West Street in Pittsfield, Illinois.\n\nThe user specified that the town must have a population of over 5,000. According to the 2020 census, the population of Pittsfield was 4,206, and it was estimated to be 4,072 in 2023. This is below the requested population.\n\nThe home is located in Pike County, which has a total population of 14,739. Pittsfield is the county seat. However, a county is not a town. There are no towns in Pike County with a population exceeding 5,000.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to name a town that is both home to the residence in the image and has a population of over 5,000.\n\n<<<Pittsfield>>>"
