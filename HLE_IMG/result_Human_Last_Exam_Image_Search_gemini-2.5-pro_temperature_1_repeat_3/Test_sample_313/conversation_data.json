    "The \"X Y\" in question is \"Felt Hat\". Here's how the clues lead to this answer:\n\n**Clue 1: The Image**\n\nThe man pictured on the right, receiving an award, is French football player André-Pierre Gignac. The event is the Balón de Oro awards for the Mexican football league (Liga MX). While some sources indicate the ceremony was on July 13, 2019, the image is associated with Gignac winning awards for the 2018-2019 season. During that season, Gignac played for the team Tigres UANL. A trick to solving this riddle is noting that a \"Tigres\" home game is colloquially known as a \"hat trick.\" This connects the image to the theme of \"hats\".\n\n**Clue 2: Toxicity of Mercury Salts**\n\nThe second clue refers to a process that has nearly stopped due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This process is the manufacturing of felt hats. Historically, mercuric nitrate was used to treat the fur of animals like beavers and rabbits in a process called \"carroting\". This treatment made the fur fibers easier to mat together into felt.\n\nWorkers in these factories were often exposed to mercury vapors in poorly ventilated areas, leading to mercury poisoning. This condition, known as erethism or \"mad hatter disease,\" caused neurological damage with symptoms like tremors (called \"hatters' shakes\"), behavioral changes, and irritability. This historical fact is the origin of the famous phrase \"mad as a hatter\". The use of mercury in the felt industry was eventually banned in the United States in 1941.\n\nTherefore, the \"X Y\" that fits both clues—one being a homonym for an event involving André-Pierre Gignac and the other a product whose manufacturing process was halted due to mercury poisoning—is a **Felt Hat**.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
