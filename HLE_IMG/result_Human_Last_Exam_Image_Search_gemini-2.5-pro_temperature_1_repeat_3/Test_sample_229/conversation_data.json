    "Based on the provided sheet music, here are the details of the song:\n\n**Title:** \"Wave\" (also known as \"Vou Te Contar\" in Portuguese).\n\n**Musical Style:** The song is a classic example of Bossa Nova, a genre that blends Brazilian samba with American cool jazz. Bossa Nova, which literally means \"new trend\" or \"new wave\" in Portuguese, originated in the late 1950s. It is characterized by a relaxed tempo, syncopated rhythms, and sophisticated harmonies.\n\n**Country of Origin:** The song and the Bossa Nova genre originate from Brazil. The style was developed in Rio de Janeiro by a group of artists and musicians, with composer Antônio Carlos Jobim and guitarist João Gilberto being the primary architects of the sound.\n\nThe piece was composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim and first released in 1967 on his album of the same name. It has since become a jazz and Bossa Nova standard, recorded by numerous artists worldwide. The sheet music provided is a lead sheet for the song, notated in the key of C Major, which is a common key for transcriptions of this piece."
