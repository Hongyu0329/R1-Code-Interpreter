    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement, is V7 (a dominant seventh chord).\n\nThe first movement of the sonata is in the key of C minor. Measure 30 contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F in the right hand, with G and D in the left hand. These notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G7). In the key of C minor, the G major triad is the dominant chord (V), and the G7 is the dominant seventh chord (V7).\n\nSome analyses note that this section features an augmented 6th chord, which resolves to the dominant. However, the chord in measure 30 itself clearly outlines the G7 harmony, functioning as the dominant of C minor. This harmonic device is part of a connecting episode leading to the second subject of the sonata.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
