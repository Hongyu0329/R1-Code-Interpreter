    "The phenomenon illustrated is the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**, also known as perceptual restoration.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone or a speech segment, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, typically noise. If the interrupting noise is sufficiently loud, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the perception that the original sound continued uninterrupted through the noise. This is a common and generally unconscious perceptual ability that helps us maintain a stable understanding of our auditory environment, such as following a conversation in a noisy room.\n\nThe image displays a spectrogram and a waveform that are often used to demonstrate this effect. On the left, a single, pure tone is shown. This tone is then interrupted by a burst of wideband noise (the vertical bar in the spectrogram). After the interruption, the original tone continues, but a second, new tone is introduced. The illusion is that a listener typically perceives the original tone as continuous, while hearing the new tone as having started at the same time as the noise burst. This specific example demonstrates a principle of Auditory Scene Analysis called the \"old-plus-new\" heuristic, where the brain assumes a pre-existing sound will continue and attributes new sounds to new sources.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube relates to the bistable, or ambiguous, nature of the perception. A listener can perceive the stimulus in two ways: either the original tone stops and a new, complex tone begins after the noise, or the original tone continues uninterrupted while a new sound is added. The brain's tendency is to resolve this ambiguity in favor of continuity.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion"
