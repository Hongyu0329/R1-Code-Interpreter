    "The title of the 19th-century painting is most likely **\"A windmill burning, by night\"** by the Dutch artist **Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate (1803-1856)**.\n\nMultiple art auction databases and catalogues list works by this 19th-century painter with titles such as \"A windmill burning\" or \"Burning mill\". One specific painting, titled \"A windmill burning, by night,\" was featured in a 2014 exhibition called \"Lucht! in de Nederlandse kunst sinds 1850\" (Air! in Dutch art since 1850) at the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem. A review of this exhibition includes an image of a painting titled \"Brandende Molen bij Nacht\" (Burning Mill at Night) by Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate which strongly matches the provided fragment in its composition, the depiction of the fire, the structure of the windmill, and the dramatic, stormy sky.\n\n<<<A windmill burning, by night"
