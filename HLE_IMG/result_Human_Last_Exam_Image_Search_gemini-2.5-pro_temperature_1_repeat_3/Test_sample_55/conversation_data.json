    "The notes circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\nTo determine the Roman numeral, we first identify the notes and the key:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Circled Notes:** The notes in the left hand are G♯, B, and D. The concurrent notes in the right hand are F and A.\n*   **Combined Harmony:** When combined, the notes present are G♯, B, D, F, and A.\n\nThe core of this harmony is the G♯ diminished seventh chord, which consists of the notes G♯, B, D, and F. This chord functions as a secondary dominant, leading to the dominant chord of the home key.\n\nHere is the harmonic breakdown:\n*   The home key is D minor.\n*   The dominant (V) chord of D minor is A major.\n*   The leading-tone seventh chord (vii°⁷) of A major is built on G♯ and is spelled G♯-B-D-F.\n\nThis G♯ diminished seventh chord strongly pulls towards the A major chord, which appears in the following measure. Therefore, the chord in measure 8 is the leading-tone seventh of the dominant.\n\nThe correct Roman numeral for this chord is **vii°⁷/V**.\n\n<<<vii°⁷/V>>>"
