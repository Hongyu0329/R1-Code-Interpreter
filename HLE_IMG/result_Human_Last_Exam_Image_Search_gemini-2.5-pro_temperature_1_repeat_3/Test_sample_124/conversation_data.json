    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we must first determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Left Branch (R1, R2, R3):**\n    *   Resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω) appear to be in series.\n    *   However, there is a wire that connects the positive terminal of the voltage source directly to the node between R2 and R3. This wire is in parallel with the series combination of R1 and R2.\n    *   An ideal wire has a resistance of 0 Ω. When a resistor or a combination of resistors is in parallel with a short circuit (a wire), the current will follow the path of least resistance, bypassing the resistors entirely.\n    *   Therefore, resistors R1 and R2 are shorted out and can be ignored for calculation purposes. The only effective resistance in this branch is R3.\n    *   **Effective resistance of the left branch = 9 Ω.**\n\n2.  **Analyze the Right Branch (R8, R7):**\n    *   Similarly, resistors R8 (100 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω) are in series.\n    *   A wire connects the positive terminal of the voltage source to the node between R8 and R7. This wire acts as a short circuit across resistor R8.\n    *   Therefore, R8 is shorted out, and the only effective resistance in this branch is R7.\n    *   **Effective resistance of the right branch = 100 Ω.**\n\n### Calculating the Total Current\n\nThe simplified circuit consists of two effective resistors, R3 (9 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω), connected in parallel across the 1 V voltage source. The total current from the source is the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch.\n\n1.  **Current in the left branch (through R3):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (I = V / R):\n    *   I_left = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.111 A\n\n2.  **Current in the right branch (through R7):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law:\n    *   I_right = 1 V / 100 Ω = 0.01 A\n\n3.  **Total Current:**\n    *   The total current is the sum of the currents in the two branches.\n    *   I_total = I_left + I_right\n    *   I_total = (1/9) A + (1/100) A\n    *   I_total = (100/900) A + (9/900) A\n    *   I_total = 109 / 900 A\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n*   **I_total ≈ 0.121 A**\n\n<<<0.121 A>>>"
