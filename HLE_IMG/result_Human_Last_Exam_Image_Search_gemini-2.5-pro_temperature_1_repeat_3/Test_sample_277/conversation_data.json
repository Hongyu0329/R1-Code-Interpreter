    "I am sorry, but the image you provided is black. Therefore, I cannot see the molecules to determine which type of isomers they are.\n\nIn order to answer your question, please provide the image of the molecules.\n\nHowever, I can give you a brief explanation of the different options, which might help you once you see the molecules:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (or conformers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. They are not different compounds.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity (the atoms are bonded in a different order).\n*   **(c) Identical:** These are the same molecule, just viewed from a different angle or in a different orientation.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but they differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\nIf you can provide the structures, I will be able to give you a definitive answer."
