    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its distinctive markings, the animal is **Stictoleptura cordigera**, also known as the heart-bearing longhorn beetle.\n\nThis beetle belongs to the family Cerambycidae. Key identifying features visible in the photograph are its black head, pronotum (the part of the thorax behind the head), and a large, heart-shaped red or orange marking on the upper part of its black elytra (wing covers). This species is found in many parts of Europe and extends into Turkey and Iran. The adults are typically 14â€“20 millimeters long and can be seen from June to August. Their larvae develop in the decaying wood of deciduous trees.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"
