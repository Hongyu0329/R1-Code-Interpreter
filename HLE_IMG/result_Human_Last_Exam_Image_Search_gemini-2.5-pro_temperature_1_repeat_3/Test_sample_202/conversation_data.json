    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and confirmatory web search results, the rocks can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and can be basaltic or andesitic in composition. Its vesicular nature is a result of gases escaping from lava as it cooled. The reddish color is likely due to the oxidation of iron within the rock.\n\n*   **Specimen I is a Volcanic Breccia.** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This type of rock is known as a breccia. When the fragments are of volcanic origin, the rock is called a volcanic breccia.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This specimen is light-colored and has a very frothy, vesicular appearance. Pumice is a volcanic rock known for its low density, which is a result of a high concentration of gas bubbles trapped within the volcanic glass as it rapidly cooled. It is typically light in color, ranging from white to grey or tan.\n\n*   **Specimen K is a Pegmatite.** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which is characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks, meaning they cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, which allowed for the growth of exceptionally large crystals. While having a similar mineral composition to granite, pegmatites are defined by their significantly larger crystal size.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
