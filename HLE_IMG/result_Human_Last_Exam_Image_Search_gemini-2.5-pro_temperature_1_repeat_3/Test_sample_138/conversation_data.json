    "Based on distinct anatomical differences between the sexes of the insects shown, the correct indices are as follows:\n\n**A: 4 (F, M)**\nThe insect on the left is a female cuckoo bee from the genus *Coelioxys*. A key identifying feature for females of this genus is a distinctly pointed, cone-shaped abdomen, which is used to pierce the nest cells of their host bees. The insect on the right, likely a cuckoo bee from the genus *Triepeolus*, has a blunter abdomen, which is characteristic of males.\n\n**B: 3 (M, F)**\nThese are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. The individual on the left is a male, identifiable by his long antennae with distinctly curled tips. The individual on the right is a female, who has shorter, straight antennae.\n\n**C: 1 (M, M)**\nThe bee on the left is a male long-horned bee, so-named because males possess antennae that are noticeably longer than their bodies. The bee on the right is a male wool carder bee (*Anthidium manicatum*). In this species, males are typically larger and more brightly colored than females and are known for their aggressive, territorial behavior. Both individuals shown are males.\n\n<<<4, 3, 1>>>"
