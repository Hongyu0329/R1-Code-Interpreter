    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectra, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at an m/z of 135. Applying the Nitrogen Rule, the odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, most likely one. This leads to a probable molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N (molecular weight: 135.21 g/mol), which corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4. This is indicative of a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** The IR spectrum shows key absorptions:\n    *   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretches from an aromatic ring.\n    *   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to aliphatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Absorptions around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   A broadness in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region suggests the presence of an N-H bond, likely from an amine group.\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135:**\n    *   Seven distinct carbon signals are present: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm. The four signals between 126 and 146 ppm are in the aromatic region, while the three signals at lower chemical shifts are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (indicating one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating a total of five CH or CH₃ groups).\n    *   Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals and the DEPT spectrum accounts for 6 of them (1 negative + 5 positive), there must be one quaternary carbon (which is invisible in DEPT spectra).\n    *   **Signal Assignment:**\n        *   **Quaternary (C):** The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon of the benzene ring.\n        *   **CH:** The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are the CH carbons of the monosubstituted benzene ring. The signal at 49.6 ppm is an aliphatic CH.\n        *   **CH₂:** The signal at 43.5 ppm is the negative signal, corresponding to an aliphatic CH₂ group.\n        *   **CH₃:** The signal at 19.2 ppm is an aliphatic CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A multiplet integrating to 5 protons between 7.1-7.3 ppm is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A doublet at approximately 1.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   A complex multiplet region between 2.7-3.1 ppm integrates to a total of 3 protons. This region corresponds to the remaining protons: a -CH₂- group (2H) and a -CH- group (1H).\n\n5.  **HSQC Spectrum:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons, confirming the assignments:\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~128 ppm).\n    *   The methyl protons (~1.2 ppm) correlate with the methyl carbon (19.2 ppm).\n    *   The protons in the multiplet around 2.75 ppm correlate with the CH₂ carbon (43.5 ppm).\n    *   The proton signal around 3.0 ppm correlates with the CH carbon (49.6 ppm).\n\n### **Structure Elucidation**\n\nCombining all the pieces of evidence:\n*   A monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   A three-carbon side chain containing a methyl group (-CH₃), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methine group (-CH-).\n*   An amine group (-NH₂), which accounts for the nitrogen atom and the two protons not observed in the ¹H NMR integration (common for labile amine protons).\n\nThe only arrangement of these fragments that is consistent with all the data, particularly the ¹H NMR splitting (a methyl doublet) and the HSQC correlations, is a phenyl group attached to carbon 1 of a propane chain, with an amine group on carbon 2.\n\nThe structure is:\n**C₆H₅—CH₂—CH(NH₂)—CH₃**\n\nThis compound is commonly known as amphetamine. Published spectral data for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine are consistent with the provided spectra.\n\n### **IUPAC Name**\n\nThe parent chain is propane. The principal functional group is the amine on carbon 2, making it a propan-2-amine. A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 1.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
