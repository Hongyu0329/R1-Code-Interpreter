    "The organisms in the photo lead to an identification of a North Atlantic coastal environment. The key indicator species are the common periwinkle snail and the northern rock barnacle.\n\n*   **The Common Periwinkle (***Littorina littorea***):** The larger, light-colored snail with brownish spiral bands is the common periwinkle. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It is now abundant on rocky shores from Labrador, Canada, down to states like New Jersey and Delaware in the U.S. While there have been sporadic introductions to the Pacific coast, established, reproducing populations are characteristic of the Atlantic coast.\n\n*   **The Northern Rock Barnacle (***Semibalanus balanoides***):** The numerous acorn barnacles covering the rock are identifiable as the northern rock barnacle. This species is common in the intertidal zones of the northern oceans. On the Atlantic coast of North America, it is found as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, while on the Pacific coast, its southern limit is British Columbia.\n\nThe presence of a well-established community of *Littorina littorea*, which is an invasive species widespread on the Atlantic coast but not established on the Pacific coast, is the most definitive indicator. The co-occurrence with *Semibalanus balanoides* is consistent with a North Atlantic habitat.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
