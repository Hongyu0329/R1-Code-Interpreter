    "I am unable to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized in the image. To calculate this ratio, it is necessary to know the specific parameters (the quantum numbers *j*<sub>1</sub>, *j*<sub>2</sub>, and *j*<sub>3</sub>) for each of the nine plots. These parameters determine the values of the Wigner 3-j symbols and, consequently, their norms.\n\nDespite conducting extensive searches using descriptions of the image, such as \"3x3 grid of Wigner 3-j symbol plots\" and \"gallery of Wigner 3-j symbols\", the original source of the image could not be located. The search results provided general information about Wigner 3-j symbols, their properties, and methods for their calculation, but did not contain the specific visual gallery presented in the question.\n\nWithout the source of the image or the parameters for each plot, the numerical values of the symbols cannot be calculated. Visual inspection alone is insufficient for determining a precise numerical ratio, as the color intensity cannot be mapped to exact values without a reference scale. Therefore, the requested calculation cannot be performed.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
