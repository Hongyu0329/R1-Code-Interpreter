    "The figure leaving the chariot is Medea, the powerful sorceress from Greek mythology.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure vase, attributed to the Darius Painter around 340-330 B.C., depicts a dramatic scene from the myth of Medea. In the most famous version of her story, notably recounted in Euripides' tragedy, Medea enacts a terrible revenge on her unfaithful husband, Jason. After Jason leaves her for the princess of Corinth, Medea murders both the princess and her father, the king.\n\nAs a final act of vengeance to leave Jason with no legacy, she kills their own children. The scene on the vase captures the moment of her escape from Corinth. She is depicted departing in a chariot, often described as golden and drawn by dragons, which was sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios. The lifeless body on the ground is one of her victims, likely one of her sons. The figure with the patterned sleeves and Phrygian cap driving the chariot is a common artistic representation for an inhabitant of the East, and in this context, may represent a divine helper for the Colchian princess Medea.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
