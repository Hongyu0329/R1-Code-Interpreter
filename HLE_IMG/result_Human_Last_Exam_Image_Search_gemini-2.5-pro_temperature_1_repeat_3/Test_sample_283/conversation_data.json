    "The analysis of the Google Trends graph points to three annually recurring historical commemorations. The peaks on the graph correspond with the timing of major American historical events.\n\n*   **Red Line (Early December):** The distinct and strong peaks every year in early December align with National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, which is observed annually in the United States on December 7. This day commemorates the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment that led to the U.S. entering World War II. Congress designated December 7 as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994.\n\n*   **Yellow Line (Late May):** The prominent peaks occurring annually at the end of May are consistent with Memorial Day. This U.S. federal holiday, observed on the last Monday of May, honors military personnel who died in service. The date was moved to create a three-day weekend by the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which took effect in 1971.\n\n*   **Blue Line (Early June):** The smaller, yet consistent, peaks in early June correspond to the anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. This event marked the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe during World War II and is commemorated annually. The proximity of its anniversary to Memorial Day explains why the yellow and blue peaks appear close together on the graph.\n\nGiven that all three of these significant historical events—Pearl Harbor, Memorial Day, and D-Day—are major annual observances in the United States, the country in question is evident.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
