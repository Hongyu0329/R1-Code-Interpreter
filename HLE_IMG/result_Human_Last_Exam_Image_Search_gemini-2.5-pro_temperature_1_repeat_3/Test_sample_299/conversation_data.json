    "The two-move checkmate for White is as follows:\n\n**Move 1: Qd4+**\n\nThis move forces Black into one of three responses, all of which lead to checkmate on the next move. The Black king on e4 has no escape squares (d3 and f3 are covered by the Rook on f3), so it must capture the checking Queen.\n\n*   If Black plays **1... exd4** (pawn captures queen).\n*   If Black plays **1... Qxd4** (queen captures queen).\n*   If Black plays **1... Kxd4** (king captures queen).\n\n**Move 2: Nf5#**\n\nIn all three variations, White's second move is the same:\n\n*   **2. Nf5#** (Knight from e7 moves to f5, delivering checkmate).\n\nLet's examine why this is checkmate in each case:\n*   After **1... exd4**, the Black king on e4 is trapped by its own pawns on d4 and f4, while the squares d3 and f3 are controlled by the White rook on f3.\n*   After **1... Qxd4**, the Black king on e4 is trapped by its own queen on d4 and pawn on f4, while the squares d3 and f3 are controlled by the White rook on f3.\n*   After **1... Kxd4**, the Black king is now on d4. It is checked by the knight on f5 and all of its potential escape squares are covered:\n    *   c3 is covered by the pawn on b4.\n    *   d3 and e3 are covered by the rook on f3.\n    *   c5 is covered by the knight on b7.\n    *   e5 is occupied by a Black pawn.\n\n<<<1. Qd4+, 2. Nf5#>>>"
