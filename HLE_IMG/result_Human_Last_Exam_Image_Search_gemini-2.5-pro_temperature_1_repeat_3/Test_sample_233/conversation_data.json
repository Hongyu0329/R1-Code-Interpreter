    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is the famous **Gripsholm Runestone**, which has the Rundata catalog ID of **Sö 179**.\n\nThis identification is confirmed by comparing the runes visible in the photograph with the known inscription of Sö 179. The text on the stone is arranged in horizontal bands that form the body of a serpent. The fragment shows three of these bands.\n\nThe inscription on the Gripsholm Runestone reads:\n\"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\"\n\nThe visible portions in the image correspond to the beginning of this text:\n*   **Top visible line**: `...(rai)sa : stain : þ(insa)...` which translates to \"...raise(d) this stone...\"\n*   **Middle visible line**: `...at : sun : sin : h(aralt)...` which translates to \"...in memory of her son H(araldr)...\"\n*   **Bottom visible line**: `...(br)uþur : inkuars...` which translates to \"...(br)other of Ingvarr...\"\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of about 26 \"Ingvar runestones\" raised to commemorate those who died during Ingvar the Far-Travelled's disastrous Viking expedition to \"Serkland\" (likely the area around the Caspian Sea) between 1036 and 1041. It is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Sweden. Discovered in the 1820s, it was being used as a threshold in the castle's cellar before being properly identified and preserved.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
