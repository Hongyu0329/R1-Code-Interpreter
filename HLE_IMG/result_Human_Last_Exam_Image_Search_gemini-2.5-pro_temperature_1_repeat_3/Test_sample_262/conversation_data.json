    "Based on the principles of iridium complex stability in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) and supporting scientific literature, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are those with less stable ligand systems. The key factors influencing stability in these complexes are the strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond on the cyclometalating ligand and the presence of bulky, protective groups on the ancillary bipyridine ligand.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the four complexes:\n*   **Complex 1:** Features difluorinated phenylpyridine ligands and a bipyridine ligand with bulky tert-butyl groups. The fluorine atoms strengthen the Ir-C bond, and the tert-butyl groups offer steric protection against degradation. This combination is expected to result in the highest stability and longest lifetime.\n*   **Complex 2:** This complex has non-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligands, leading to a weaker Ir-C bond compared to its fluorinated counterparts. This weaker bond makes the complex more susceptible to degradation, and thus it is expected to have a short lifetime.\n*   **Complex 3:** This complex has monofluorinated phenylpyridine ligands. While more stable than the non-fluorinated Complex 2, it is less stable than the difluorinated Complex 1. It is therefore expected to have a shorter lifetime than Complex 1.\n*   **Complex 4:** This complex has the same stable, difluorinated ligands as Complex 1 but lacks the bulky tert-butyl groups on the bipyridine ligand. The absence of these protective groups makes the complex more vulnerable to intermolecular quenching and degradation pathways, which is expected to result in a shorter lifetime.\n\nContrary to the expectation that fluorination always increases stability, some studies have shown that increasing the fluorine content can lead to shorter device lifetimes in certain contexts. One study directly comparing a series of complexes found that emitters with more fluorine substituents can show a decrease in lifetime. This suggests that while fluorination strengthens the Ir-C bond, it might also introduce new degradation pathways or alter the electronic properties in a way that is detrimental to lifetime under operational conditions.\n\nHowever, the lack of fluorination (as in Complex 2) is a well-established factor that reduces stability compared to fluorinated analogs. Similarly, the lack of bulky substituents for steric protection (as in Complex 4) is known to decrease stability. Therefore, Complexes 2, 3, and 4 are all expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes than Complex 1, which benefits from both difluorination and bulky substituents.\n\nConsidering these factors, Complexes 2, 3, and 4 are all predicted to have shorter lifetimes than Complex 1.\n\n<<<N>>>"
