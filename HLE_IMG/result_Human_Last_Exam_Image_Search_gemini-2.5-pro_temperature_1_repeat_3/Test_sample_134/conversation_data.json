    "Based on the visual information and search results, the molecule depicted is **Cyclocarbon**.\n\nCyclocarbon, with the chemical formula C₁₈, is a molecular allotrope of carbon. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms. High-resolution atomic force microscopy has revealed that its structure consists of alternating single and triple bonds, a form known as a polyyne. This structure has a 9-fold symmetry.\n\nThis fascinating molecule has been a subject of interest for chemists for many years but was only synthesized and characterized in the late 2010s. The synthesis was achieved by manipulating a cyclocarbon oxide precursor (C₂₄O₆) or a bromocyclocarbon precursor (C₁₈Br₆) on a sodium chloride surface at very low temperatures (5 Kelvin). Due to its high reactivity, it is challenging to isolate and study.<<<Cyclocarbon>>>"
