    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided raster plot, the synchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands where many electrodes fire simultaneously.\n\nThe timestamps corresponding to the approximate center of each synchronized burst are:\n*   2.5 s\n*   10.5 s\n*   18.5 s\n*   27.5 s\n*   36.5 s\n*   47.5 s\n\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time between the start of consecutive bursts. The individual intervals are calculated as follows:\n*   **Interval 1:** 10.5 s - 2.5 s = 8.0 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 18.5 s - 10.5 s = 8.0 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 27.5 s - 18.5 s = 9.0 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 36.5 s - 27.5 s = 9.0 s\n*   **Interval 5:** 47.5 s - 36.5 s = 11.0 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the sum of the individual intervals divided by the number of intervals:\nAverage IBI = (8.0 s + 8.0 s + 9.0 s + 9.0 s + 11.0 s) / 5\nAverage IBI = 45.0 s / 5\nAverage IBI = 9.0 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, to two significant figures, is 9.0 seconds.\n\n<<<9.0>>>"
