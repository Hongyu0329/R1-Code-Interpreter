Based on the provided information and supporting research, S100B binds with strong affinity to the V-domain and C1 domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be utilized as a prognostic marker to assess the progression and severity of neurological disorders due to its direct role in pathological pathways like neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, because it is not specific to a single disease, it is most reliably used as an adjunct marker in combination with other clinical and diagnostic findings.
