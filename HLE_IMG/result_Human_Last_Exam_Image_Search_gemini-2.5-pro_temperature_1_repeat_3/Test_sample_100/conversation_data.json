    "The reaction proceeds in three steps:\n1.  **PMB Deprotection:** The first step uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) to remove the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from the nitrogen atom. The starting material has a molecular formula of C15H14F3NO2. The removal of the PMB group (C8H9O) and the addition of a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen results in **Intermediate 1** with a molecular formula of C7H6F3NO.\n2.  **Hydrogenation:** The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the bicyclic system. Adding two hydrogen atoms to Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) gives **Intermediate 2**, with a molecular formula of C7H8F3NO.\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step involves the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide) under acidic conditions (4 N HCl) and heat. This reaction breaks the amide bond by adding a molecule of water (H2O). The ring opens to form an amino acid. Adding H2O to Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) yields the final **Product**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is calculated as follows:\nC7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2) + H2O (from hydrolysis) = C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
