    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant structure:** The question asks about the sporophyte, which in mosses is the diploid generation that produces spores. The main parts of the sporophyte visible for identification are the **seta** (the stalk) and the **capsule** (the spore-containing urn). The combination of these parts and their orientation is key to identifying many moss species.\n\n2.  **Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short and, most importantly, **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held erect and is typically **immersed** or **emergent** amongst the upper leaves of the gametophyte. This means it doesn't rise far above the moss cushion and often appears nestled within it, as seen in the provided image. The capsules are symmetrical and look like small, upright urns.\n\n3.  **Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The species name *curviseta* provides the main clue: \"curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" is the stalk. The seta of this species is relatively long and distinctly **curved**, often in a swan-neck or C-shape (cygneous).\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** This strongly curved seta causes the capsule to be **cernuous** (nodding) or pendent, hanging to one side of the stalk. It is not held erect like in *G. montana*.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the main distinguishing difference:**\n    *   The most significant and easily observed (\"at a glance\") difference lies in the **seta**.\n    *   In ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is **straight and short**, leading to an erect, immersed capsule.\n    *   In ***Grimmia curviseta***, the seta is **long and strongly curved**, leading to a nodding or hanging capsule.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** The primary difference is the shape and length of the seta, which dictates the capsule's orientation.\n*   **Use the Latin Name:** The name *curviseta* itself means \"curved stalk\" and is a direct hint to the plant's key feature.\n*   **Observe the Capsule Position:** Notice *how* the capsule is held relative to the rest of the plant. Is it upright and hidden (*G. montana*) or does it emerge and hang over (*G. curviseta*)?\n*   **Context of the Image:** The provided image shows *Grimmia montana*, correctly depicting erect, wide-mouthed capsules nestled among the hyaline-tipped leaves on very short, straight setae. If it were *G. curviseta*, you would expect to see the capsules hanging from curved stalks.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the character of the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, resulting in an erect and immersed capsule. *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, strongly curved (cygneous) seta, which causes its capsule to be nodding or pendent.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous), causing the capsule to nod or hang to the side."
