    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Measure:** The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the sheet music, the second system starts on measure 28. Measure 29 follows, and then measure 30 is the subsequent measure, which is conveniently circled in the provided image.\n\n2.  **Determine the Key Context:** The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, \"Pathétique\". The first movement is in C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). While music modulates, this section (the first theme group of the Allegro) is firmly establishing the home key of C minor.\n    *   Measure 28 is a C minor chord (`i`).\n    *   Measure 29 has B natural, D, and F in the right hand over a G in the left hand. This chord functions as a preparation for the dominant.\n    *   The goal is to analyze the harmony in measure 30. This measure resolves to measure 31, which contains a clear G major chord (G-B♮-D), the dominant (`V`) of C minor.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays a D in the low bass and a G above it. These notes are held for the entire measure.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays a sequence of four sixteenth notes, repeated: F♯, A♮, C, E♭.\n\n4.  **Identify the Harmonic Function:**\n    *   Let's analyze the collection of notes in the right hand first, as they form a distinct melodic and harmonic pattern. The notes are F♯, A, C, E♭.\n    *   If we stack these notes in thirds, they form an F♯ fully-diminished seventh chord (F♯ - A - C - E♭).\n    *   A fully-diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone functions as a dominant substitute. We must determine what chord this F♯°7 is leading to. The leading tone, F♯, resolves up by a half step to G.\n    *   Therefore, the F♯°7 chord functions as the leading-tone chord of G.\n    *   In our home key of C minor, the G major chord is the dominant, which is represented by the Roman numeral `V`.\n    *   So, the F♯°7 chord is a \"secondary dominant\" or \"applied chord\" that targets the dominant. Specifically, it is the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a leading-tone seventh chord is `vii°7`.\n    *   Because it is applied to the dominant (`V`), we write it as `vii°7/V` (read as \"seven-diminished-seven of five\").\n    *   The notes in the left hand (D and G) are members of the G major chord (`V`) that the F♯°7 is resolving to. Beethoven places them in the bass to strengthen the arrival of the dominant harmony that begins in earnest in the next measure. The D in the bass is the 5th of the upcoming G chord, acting as a bass anticipation or pedal tone underneath the `vii°7/V` harmony. The functional harmony of the measure is defined by the `vii°7/V` chord in the right hand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the harmonic analysis, the chord in measure 30 is an applied chord, specifically the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
