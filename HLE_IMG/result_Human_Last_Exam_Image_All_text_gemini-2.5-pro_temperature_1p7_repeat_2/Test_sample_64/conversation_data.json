    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Subject:** The image shows a filamentous structure composed of several rectangular cells arranged end-to-end. Each cell has a distinct and rigid outer boundary, which is a cell wall. The interior of the cells contains granular material, which is the cytoplasm and its contents (together called the protoplast). This type of cellular organization is common in organisms like filamentous algae or fungi, or in certain plant tissues like root hairs.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Image L:**\n    *   This panel shows the cells in what appears to be their normal, healthy state.\n    *   The protoplast completely fills the volume enclosed by the cell wall. It is pressed firmly against the cell wall, indicating that the cell is turgid. Turgor pressure is the force of the cell's contents pushing against the cell wall, which happens when the cell is in a hypotonic or isotonic solution and has a high internal water content.\n    *   The arrowhead points to a cross-wall, where two adjacent cells meet.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Image M:**\n    *   This panel shows a change from the state in panel L.\n    *   The protoplast appears to have started shrinking.\n    *   The arrowhead points to a location where the plasma membrane (the outer boundary of the protoplast) has pulled away from the rigid cell wall, creating a visible gap and a concave curve. This indicates a loss of water and a decrease in turgor pressure.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Image N:**\n    *   This panel shows a more advanced stage of the process seen in panel M.\n    *   The shrinkage of the protoplast is much more pronounced. There is a significant space between the shrunken protoplast and the cell wall.\n    *   The arrowhead again highlights this separation. The cell has clearly lost a substantial amount of water. The overall filament appears less rigid and is starting to curve, which is a result of the loss of turgor in the constituent cells.\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Identification of the Process:**\n    *   The sequence of events from L to M to N shows a progressive loss of water from the cells.\n    *   This water loss causes the protoplast to shrink and detach from the stationary cell wall.\n    *   This specific biological process, where the protoplast shrinks away from the cell wall due to water loss through osmosis when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, is called **plasmolysis**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Presence of Cell Wall:** The key feature that allows for this specific phenomenon is the rigid cell wall. Animal cells, which lack a cell wall, would shrivel (crenate) but not exhibit this distinct separation of the membrane from a rigid outer structure.\n*   **Role of Osmosis:** This process is a direct consequence of osmosis. Water moves from an area of higher water potential (inside the turgid cell) to an area of lower water potential (the hypertonic solution outside the cell).\n*   **Turgor Pressure:** Panel L depicts a cell with high turgor pressure. Panels M and N show cells that have lost turgor pressure, leading to a flaccid and then a plasmolyzed state.\n*   **Arrowheads as Clues:** The arrowheads are strategically placed to draw the viewer's attention to the most important evidence of the process: the retraction of the plasma membrane from the cell wall.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the process shown is plasmolysis.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"
