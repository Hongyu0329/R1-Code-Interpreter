    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the artwork style and subject:** The image displays a scene painted on an ancient Greek vase. The style, with figures painted in added white and other colors on a black background, is characteristic of South Italian vase painting, specifically Apulian, from the 4th century BC. The scene is mythological and narrative, centered around a chariot.\n    2.  **Identify the figures in the scene:**\n        *   **On the ground:** A mature, nude male figure lies defeated or dead in front of the chariot. His position suggests he was a competitor in a race or was run down.\n        *   **In the chariot:** There are two main figures. One is driving, holding the reins. This figure wears an elaborate, patterned sleeved tunic and a Phrygian cap (a conical cap with a bent top), which in Greek art often denotes a non-Greek, typically \"oriental\" or Anatolian, origin. The second figure, a woman, is seated next to the driver. She is draped in cloth and is looking backward, over her shoulder, with a dramatic expression.\n        *   **Above the chariot:** A small, winged figure (partially visible in the original and crop 1) is flying, holding what looks like a goad. This winged boy is Eros (Cupid), the god of love.\n    3.  **Interpret the mythological narrative:** The combination of these elements points to a specific myth: the chariot race of Pelops and Oenomaus.\n        *   King Oenomaus (the fallen figure) would challenge any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a deadly chariot race.\n        *   Pelops (the driver in the Phrygian cap, marking his Anatolian origin) was a suitor who accepted the challenge.\n        *   Pelops won the race, causing Oenomaus's death, either through divine help or by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot.\n        *   Hippodamia is the woman in the chariot. Having been won by Pelops, she is now eloping with him. Her backward glance signifies her departure from her homeland and her reaction to her father's death.\n        *   The presence of Eros signifies that love was the motivation for Pelops's heroic deed and a divine force that aided his victory.\n    4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". The phrasing \"leaving the chariot\" is best interpreted in this context as \"departing in the chariot\" or \"leaving her former home.\" The figure who fits this description is the woman being carried away as the prize of the contest. She is looking back at what she is leaving behind. This figure is Hippodamia.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The \"leaving\" in the question does not mean getting out of the vehicle, but rather departing from the scene of the race and her father's kingdom.\n    *   The distinctive Phrygian cap and patterned sleeve on the driver are key iconographic details that help identify him as Pelops.\n    *   Hippodamia's backward glance is a classic artistic device to convey emotion and the narrative of departure.\n    *   The identification of the artwork (Apulian pelike, ca. 360-350 BC, attributed to the Painter of the Karlsruhe Pelops) confirms this iconographic interpretation.\n\nThe figure leaving in the chariot (the female passenger looking backward) is Hippodamia.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
