The structures of the three products are:

*   **Product A:** A methyl dihydropyrrolizine-carboxylate derivative bearing an N-acetylaminoalkyl side chain. This structure results from an intramolecular rearrangement following a [3+2] cycloaddition. An example representation is a pyrrolizine core with -COOCH₃ and -(CH₂)n-NHCOCH₃ substituents.

*   **Product B:** 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-5,7-dione. This is a bicyclic system where a pyrrolidine ring is fused to a maleimide ring.

*   **Product C:** 6-acetyl-tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-5,7-dione. This is a bicyclic system where a pyrrolidine ring is fused to a succinimide ring, which is substituted by an acetyl group at the 6-position.

**Drawings of the structures:**

**Product A (Schematic representation):**
```
      (Pyrrolizine core)-COOCH₃
               |
          -(CH₂)n-NH-C(=O)CH₃
```
*Note: The exact structure of the pyrrolizine core and the length of the alkyl chain 'n' are complex, but the key features are the fused pyrrole ring, the ester, and the N-acetylaminoalkyl side chain.*

**Product B:**
```
      O
     //
   -C
  /  \
CH    N-(CH₂)₃-CH
||    |         |
CH----C=O----CH₂
```
More formally drawn as: a 5-membered ring (pyrrolidine part: N-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH) fused at the N and CH atoms to another 5-membered ring (maleimide part: -CO-CH=CH-CO-).

**Product C:**
```
      O
     //
   -C
  /  \
CH₂   N-(CH₂)₃-CH
|     |         |
CH----C=O----CH₂

CH₃
```
More formally drawn as: a 5-membered ring (pyrrolidine part: N-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH) fused at the N and CH atoms to another 5-membered ring (succinimide part: -CO-CH(COCH₃)-CH₂-CO-).
