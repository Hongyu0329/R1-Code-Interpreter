    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the geometric construction**\n\nLet O be the vertex of the circular sector (the center of the circle). Let the arc start at point P_L (left) and end at P_R (right).\nThe image provides construction details for the left (blue) side. There's a right-angled triangle indicated. Let's analyze it.\n- One vertex is the center O.\n- Another vertex is the leftmost point of the arc, P_L.\n- A tangent line is drawn at P_L. A radius is always perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency, which is indicated by the right-angle symbol at P_L.\n- A point V is marked on this tangent line such that the length of the tangent segment P_L V is 17.\n- A line is drawn from the center O to this point V, and its length is given as 34.\n- This forms a right-angled triangle, ΔOP_L V, with the right angle at P_L.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the radius of the sector and the angle**\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the right-angled triangle ΔOP_L V:\n(OP_L)² + (P_L V)² = (OV)²\nLet R be the radius of the sector, so R = OP_L.\nR² + 17² = 34²\nR² + 289 = 1156\nR² = 1156 - 289 = 867\nR = √867 = √(289 * 3) = 17√3.\n\nNow let's find the angle ∠P_L O V. Let's call it α.\nIn the right-angled triangle ΔOP_L V:\nsin(α) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = P_L V / OV = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\nThis implies α = 30°.\nThis angle α corresponds to 2θ in the diagram, so 2θ = 30°, and θ = 15°.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the full figure using symmetry**\n\nThe figure is symmetric. The red region is constructed identically on the right side.\n- The top vertex V is common and is the intersection of the tangents at P_L and P_R.\n- The total angle of the sector is ∠P_L O P_R = ∠P_L O V + ∠P_R O V = α + α = 30° + 30° = 60°.\n- This matches the diagram where the total angle is shown as 4θ = 4 * 15° = 60°.\n- The entire geometric setup consists of a kite OP_LVP_R and a circular sector OP_L P_R, sharing the same center O and boundary radii OP_L and OP_R.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the total shaded area**\n\nThe blue and red shaded regions have curved bottom edges which are parts of the circular arc.\n- The blue shaded region is bounded by the tangent segment P_L V, the arc from P_L to the center line of symmetry, and the line segment from V to that point on the arc.\n- The red shaded region is the symmetric counterpart.\n- The \"total area of the shaded regions\" is the area of their union.\n- The union of the red and blue regions is the area enclosed by the two tangent segments P_L V and P_R V, and the arc P_L P_R.\n- This total area can be calculated by taking the area of the kite OP_LVP_R and subtracting the area of the circular sector OP_L P_R.\n\nThe note about the \"small overlapping area\" seems to be inconsistent with the visual representation, where the red and blue regions are adjacent and share a common boundary but do not overlap to form a region with positive area. Assuming the visual and numerical information is correct, we proceed with this calculation.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the areas**\n\n- **Area of the Kite OP_LVP_R:**\nThe kite is composed of two identical right-angled triangles, ΔOP_L V and ΔOP_R V.\nArea(ΔOP_L V) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OP_L * P_L V = (1/2) * R * 17\nArea(ΔOP_L V) = (1/2) * (17√3) * 17 = (289√3) / 2.\nArea(Kite) = 2 * Area(ΔOP_L V) = 2 * (289√3 / 2) = 289√3.\n\n- **Area of the Sector OP_L P_R:**\nThe sector has a radius R = 17√3 and a central angle of 60°.\nArea(Sector) = (Angle / 360°) * π * R²\nArea(Sector) = (60 / 360) * π * (17√3)² = (1/6) * π * 867 = 289π / 2.\n\n- **Total Shaded Area:**\nTotal Area = Area(Kite) - Area(Sector)\nTotal Area = 289√3 - 289π/2.\n\nThis is the exact area. We can approximate it numerically:\n√3 ≈ 1.73205\nπ ≈ 3.14159\nTotal Area ≈ 289 * 1.73205 - (289 * 3.14159) / 2\nTotal Area ≈ 500.562 - 453.959 ≈ 46.603.\n\nThe final answer is the exact expression.\n\n<<<289√3 - 289π/2>>>"
