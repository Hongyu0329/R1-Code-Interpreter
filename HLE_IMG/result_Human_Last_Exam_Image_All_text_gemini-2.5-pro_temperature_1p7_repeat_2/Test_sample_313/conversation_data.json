    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man receiving an award at a formal event. By identifying the people and the trophy, we can identify the event.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n*   The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019 (the date in the clue is off by one day, which is a common small error in such questions).\n*   At this event, Nikita Kucherov won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (MVP voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   Winning three major awards is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. Therefore, the \"X Y\" pictured at the event is a **Hat Trick**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue refers to a historical process or object that is no longer common due to mercury poisoning.\n*   The process of making felt for hats, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, involved using a mercury-based solution (mercuric nitrate) in a process called \"carroting\".\n*   Hat-makers (\"hatters\") who were exposed to the mercury vapors often developed neurological damage, including tremors, shyness, and irritability. This condition is believed to be the origin of the expression \"mad as a hatter\".\n*   The \"trick\" of the hatter's trade was this use of mercury. This \"trick\" or method of making hats has almost ceased to be used because of the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize both clues to find the answer.**\n*   The two-word phrase \"X Y\" must fit both descriptions.\n*   The phrase is **Hat Trick**.\n*   Clue 1 refers to the modern, metaphorical use of \"Hat Trick\" for Nikita Kucherov's accomplishment of winning three awards. This is what is \"pictured\".\n*   Clue 2 refers to the historical origin related to the \"Hat\" part of the phrase. The \"trick\" of making hats with mercury is what has ceased to be used. The word \"Another\" is used to distinguish between the two different contexts of the phrase \"Hat Trick\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Date Discrepancy:** Be aware that the date in the prompt might be slightly off from the actual event date, but close enough to find the correct event.\n2.  **Figurative Language:** The clue \"X Y is pictured\" does not necessarily mean a physical object is pictured. A concept or an achievement, like a hat trick, can be pictured.\n3.  **Wordplay:** The second clue uses wordplay, using the word \"trick\" to refer to a specific \"trick of the trade\" or method used by hatters.\n4.  **Connecting the Clues:** The key is finding the common two-word phrase that links the seemingly unrelated subjects of a modern sports award ceremony and historical industrial toxicology.\n\nBy combining the analysis of both clues, the answer is determined.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
