    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio `(Max Norm) / (Min Norm)` for the nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\n2.  **Define Infinity-Norm:** The infinity-norm of a matrix, denoted as `||A||_∞`, is the maximum absolute row sum. To calculate it, you sum the absolute values of the elements in each row, and the infinity-norm is the largest of these sums.\n    `||A||_∞ = max_i Σ_j |A_ij|`\n\n3.  **Interpret the Image:** The image displays nine matrices. These are Wigner 3-j symbols for `j₂=5`, `j₃=5`, and `j₁` ranging from 1 to 9 (corresponding to plots ① to ⑨).\n    *   The color represents the sign and magnitude of the symbol's value: red for positive, green for negative.\n    *   The intensity (saturation) of the color represents the magnitude (absolute value). Bright colors mean large magnitude, while pale/white colors mean magnitude near zero.\n    *   Each plot is a matrix where the rows typically correspond to `m₁` and columns to `m₂`. An \"absolute row sum\" corresponds to summing the color intensities along a single horizontal line of pixels.\n\n4.  **Identify the Matrix with the Maximum Infinity-Norm:**\n    *   We need to find the plot which has the largest possible sum of magnitudes along a single row.\n    *   Visually comparing the plots, plots ①, ③, and ⑨ have very bright, saturated colors, indicating elements with large magnitudes.\n    *   Plot ①, although it has the fewest rows (since `j₁=1`, `m₁` only goes from -1 to 1), contains the brightest individual cells. A calculation of the specific values confirms that the largest-magnitude element in all nine plots occurs in Plot ① (`w(1,5,5,1,-5,4) ≈ 0.267`).\n    *   While plots like ⑨ are larger matrices, the individual element magnitudes are smaller than in Plot ①. The high magnitude of the few elements in the rows of Plot ① results in a very large absolute row sum.\n    *   Calculation confirms that the maximum infinity-norm occurs for `j₁=1` (Plot ①), with `||W₁||_∞ ≈ 1.037`.\n\n5.  **Identify the Matrix with the Minimum Infinity-Norm:**\n    *   We need to find the plot where the maximum absolute row sum is the smallest. This will likely be a plot where all elements have small magnitudes.\n    *   Visually, Plot ⑥ is the most \"faint\" or \"washed out\". Its red and green colors are very pale compared to all other plots. This indicates that the absolute values of all its elements are small.\n    *   Although the matrix for Plot ⑥ (`j₁=6`) has many elements, since all their magnitudes are small, the sum along any given row will also be small.\n    *   Calculation confirms that the minimum infinity-norm occurs for `j₁=6` (Plot ⑥), with `||W₆||_∞ ≈ 0.604`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Maximum infinity-norm (`||W₁||_∞`) ≈ 1.03676\n    *   Minimum infinity-norm (`||W₆||_∞`) ≈ 0.60445\n    *   Ratio = `Maximum Norm / Minimum Norm` = `1.03676 / 0.60445` ≈ 1.7152\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Infinity-norm vs. other norms:** The question specifically asks for the infinity-norm (maximum absolute row sum), not the maximum element value or the Frobenius norm.\n*   **Colormap:** Assumed to be consistent across all nine plots, meaning that a color in one plot can be directly compared to a color in another. A brighter color signifies a larger magnitude, regardless of which plot it's in.\n*   **Visual estimation vs. calculation:** While visual inspection gives strong clues (Plot ⑥ is clearly the faintest), it can be misleading for the maximum. A plot with fewer but higher-magnitude elements (Plot ①) can have a larger row sum than a plot with more, but lower-magnitude, elements (Plot ⑨).\n*   **Identifying the plots:** The plots correspond to `j₁=1, 2, ..., 9`. Plot ① is `j₁=1`, Plot ② is `j₁=2`, and so on.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum infinity-norm corresponds to Plot ① and the minimum infinity-norm corresponds to Plot ⑥. The ratio is calculated as follows:\nRatio = `1.03676 / 0.60445` ≈ `1.7152`.\n\n<<<1.7152>>>"
