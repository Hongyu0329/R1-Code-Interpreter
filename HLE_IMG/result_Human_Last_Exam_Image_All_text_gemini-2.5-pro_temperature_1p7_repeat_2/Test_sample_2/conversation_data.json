    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe algorithm `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a` (i.e., the slice `a[0...n-1]`).\n\nLet's break down its actions when `n > 1`:\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first calls itself to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first step, `a[n-2]` should be the largest element in the `a[0...n-2]` subarray. This `if` statement checks if the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than this largest element.\n3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it swaps these two elements. This moves `a[n-1]` one position to the left, but it may disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the swap might have broken the sorted order of the prefix, it calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing, as an array of size 0 or 1 is already sorted.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n\nLet T(n) be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)`.\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function takes constant time. So, T(1) = O(1).\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the time taken is the sum of the time for its operations:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: T(n - 1)\n    *   Comparison and potential swap: O(1)\n    *   Conditional `sort(a, n - 1)`: This call only happens if the `if` condition is met.\n\nTo find the worst-case time complexity, we must assume the scenario that leads to the maximum amount of work. This occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true at every level of recursion, forcing the second recursive call to be executed every time.\n\nIn this worst-case scenario, the recurrence relation becomes:\nT(n) = T(n - 1)  (first call) + O(1) (comparison/swap) + T(n - 1) (second call)\nT(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where c is a constant representing the O(1) work)\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve the recurrence T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c.\nLet's expand it:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...\nThis pattern shows that after `k` expansions:\n*   T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nTo reach the base case T(1), we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)\n\nThe sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series with sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2-1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\nSince T(1) is a constant (let's call it c'), the equation becomes:\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n*   T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c\n*   T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, this is O(2^(n-1)), which is equivalent to O(2^n).\n\n### Step 4: Confirm that a Worst-Case Input Exists\n\nWe need to be sure that there's an input that actually triggers this worst-case behavior. Consider an array sorted in reverse (descending) order, for example, `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n\n*   At the top level, `sort(a, n)` is called. The first call `sort(a, n-1)` will sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]` (which is `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`). Let's assume recursively this works, making the prefix `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The whole array `a` is now `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n*   The condition `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `if 1 < n`, which is true.\n*   The swap occurs, and the second `sort(a, n-1)` is called.\n*   This logic applies recursively. For every call `sort(sub-array, k)` on a reverse-sorted sub-array, the smallest element is at the end, which will always be less than the element before it after the first recursive sort. Thus, the `if` condition is always met.\n\nSince a worst-case input exists, the worst-case time complexity is indeed O(2^n).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The algorithm terminates because the problem size `n` decreases in each recursive call.\n*   The worst-case recurrence relation is T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c.\n*   Solving this recurrence relation yields a time complexity of O(2^n).\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
