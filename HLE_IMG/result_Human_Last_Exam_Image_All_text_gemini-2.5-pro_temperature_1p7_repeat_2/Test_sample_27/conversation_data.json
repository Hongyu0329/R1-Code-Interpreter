    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the artist's signature.**\nThe artist's signature is typically found in one of the corners of a painting. By examining the original image and the provided cropped details, we can find the signature in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the signature and date.**\nThe signature is written in two lines.\n*   The top line, written in a cursive script, appears to be a name or nickname. Close examination reveals the letters to spell out \"Marquinho\".\n*   The bottom line is clearer and spells out the surname \"Pinheiro\", followed by the number \"'38\", which indicates the year the painting was created, 1938.\nSo, the signature reads \"Marquinho Pinheiro '38\".\n\n**Step 3: Research the artist's identity.**\nThe signature \"Marquinho Pinheiro\" suggests a Portuguese or Brazilian artist. \"Marquinho\" is a common Portuguese diminutive (nickname) for the name \"Marcos\". Researching the name \"Marquinho Pinheiro\", specifically for an artist active around 1938, leads to art auction records and catalogs.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the artist's full name.**\nInformation from art auction databases and art historical resources identifies the artist \"Marquinho Pinheiro\" with his formal name. These sources state that Marquinho Pinheiro's full birth name is Marcos Pinheiro da Silva. He was a Brazilian artist born in 1911.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the full name.**\nBased on the analysis of the signature and research from reliable sources, the full name of the artist who created this painting is Marcos Pinheiro da Silva.\n\n<<<Marcos Pinheiro da Silva>>>"
