    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the image:** The image provided is a line drawing of an ancient cuneiform sign. The style is pictographic, meaning it resembles the object it represents. The sign clearly depicts a structure, a building. It has a base, vertical elements suggesting walls or posts, and a triangular top suggesting a roof. The internal pattern within the main rectangular body may represent the texture of the walls, possibly made of woven reeds or bricks.\n    2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the meaning of this specific sign in its \"third-millennium form.\" The third millennium BCE (3000-2001 BCE) includes the Early Dynastic, Akkadian, and Ur III periods of Mesopotamian history. During this time, cuneiform script evolved from its earlier pictographic forms (like the one shown) into more abstract wedge-based characters. The sign in the image is a characteristic archaic or pictographic form from the early part of this period.\n    3.  **Evaluate the answer choices against the visual evidence:**\n        *   **A. Tool:** A tool would be depicted differently (e.g., a hammer, a sickle, a spade). This is a building.\n        *   **B. Guard:** A guard is a person. The sign for a person (LU‚ÇÇ) is different and does not look like a building.\n        *   **C. Bread:** The cuneiform sign for bread (NINDA, read logographically as GAR) is typically represented by a ration bowl. It does not look like this building structure.\n        *   **D. Home:** This is the most plausible option. The Sumerian word for \"house,\" \"temple,\" or \"home\" is E‚ÇÇ. The cuneiform sign for E‚ÇÇ (íÇç) originated as a pictograph representing the ground plan of a rectangular house. The image shown is a well-known, albeit more elaborate, archaic form of the sign E‚ÇÇ, depicting a complete building, not just its floor plan. As it represents a building, \"Home\" is the best fit.\n        *   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (íÄ≠), representing the heavens. It looks nothing like the image.\n        *   **F. Beard:** The sign for a beard (SU‚ÇÜ) is a pictograph of a beard on the lower half of a face and does not resemble the structure shown.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The sign is a clear pictograph of a building. In Sumerian, the word for house/home/temple is E‚ÇÇ. This sign is a known archaic form of the logogram E‚ÇÇ. Therefore, its meaning is \"Home\" (or more broadly, \"house\" or \"temple\").\n\n*   **List of careful points:**\n    *   The sign is pictographic, so its visual appearance is the primary clue to its meaning.\n    *   The question specifies the third millennium BCE, which points to early forms of cuneiform script.\n    *   The sign clearly shows a building/structure.\n    *   Each answer choice must be evaluated to see if it matches the visual representation of a building.\n    *   The Sumerian logogram for \"house/home\" is E‚ÇÇ, and this is a known archaic representation of it.\n\n<<<D>>>"
