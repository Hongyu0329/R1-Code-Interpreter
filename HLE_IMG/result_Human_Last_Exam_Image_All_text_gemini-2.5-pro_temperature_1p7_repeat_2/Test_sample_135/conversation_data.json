    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Content and Style:** The image shows a circular, sculpted relief (a tondo or roundel) depicting a religious scene. A priest is administering the sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) to several kneeling figures, including a child. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, noted for its naturalism, balanced composition, and graceful figures.\n\n2.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, on a scroll-like banner (cartouche), there is an inscription. Although partially faded, it can be read as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic spelling, likely French or influenced by French, for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which directly confirms the subject of the artwork.\n\n3.  **Identify the Medium and Technique:** The artwork is a relief sculpture. The smooth finish and the specific style of modeling are strong indicators of glazed terracotta. This technique was pioneered and made famous by the della Robbia family workshop in 15th-century Florence. They were renowned for their vibrant, durable terracotta sculptures, which were widely commissioned for churches and public buildings.\n\n4.  **Connect to a Specific Artwork and Artist:** The combination of the subject (Eucharist), the format (tondo from a predella), and the unmistakable glazed terracotta style points directly to the work of the della Robbia family. A search for a \"della Robbia altarpiece\" featuring the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" leads to a specific masterpiece: the **Altarpiece of the Sacraments** (*Pala dei Sacramenti*). This very roundel is a known detail from the predella (the base panel) of that altarpiece.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Author:** Art historical sources universally attribute the Altarpiece of the Sacraments to **Andrea della Robbia**, a nephew of the more famous Luca della Robbia who founded the workshop. Andrea continued and expanded the family's artistic legacy. This specific altarpiece, located in the Cathedral of Volterra, is considered one of his major works, dating to around 1471.\n\nBased on this analysis, the author of this specific detail of the altarpiece is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
