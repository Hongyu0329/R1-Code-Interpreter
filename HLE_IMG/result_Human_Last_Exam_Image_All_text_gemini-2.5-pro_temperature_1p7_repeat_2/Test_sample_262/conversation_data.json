    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes would have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Shorter lifetime implies lower stability and faster degradation under operating conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general structure `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   **Central Metal Ion:** Iridium(III), Ir(III).\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** The bidentate nitrogen-coordinating ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) in all four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups are known to improve solubility and can help prevent self-quenching, but they are identical across all four complexes and thus not the differentiating factor.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** The cyclometalating ligands are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). This is where the four complexes differ. A cyclometalating ligand binds to the metal through both a nitrogen atom (from the pyridine ring) and a carbon atom (from the phenyl ring), forming a stable five-membered ring with the metal center. The difference lies in the number and position of fluorine (F) substituents on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring, one *ortho* to the Ir-C bond and one *para* to the Ir-C bond. The ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy).\n        *   **Complex 2:** Has one fluorine atom on each phenyl ring, located *para* to the Ir-C bond. The ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n        *   **Complex 3:** Has one fluorine atom on each phenyl ring, located *ortho* to the Ir-C bond. The ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n        *   **Complex 4:** Has four fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring, occupying all available positions (ortho, meta, para relative to the Ir-C bond). The ligand is 2-(2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl)pyridine.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to LEC Lifetime:** The operational stability of these complexes in LECs is a well-studied topic. The lifetime is determined by the complex's resistance to degradation under electrical bias. Two main competing factors related to fluorination are known to influence stability:\n\n    *   **Factor 1: Electrochemical Instability (Destabilizing Effect):** Fluorine is a potent electron-withdrawing group. Increasing the number of fluorine atoms on the ligands makes the complex more electron-deficient. This lowers the energy of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), making the complex easier to reduce (i.e., its reduction potential becomes less negative). A primary degradation pathway in LECs is initiated by the reduction of the stable Ir(III) complex to an unstable Ir(II) species (`[Ir(III)]+ + e- â†’ [Ir(II)]^0`), which can then undergo irreversible decomposition (e.g., ligand loss). Therefore, complexes that are very easy to reduce tend to have shorter lifetimes. This predicts that heavily fluorinated complexes will be less stable.\n\n    *   **Factor 2: Bond Strength and Steric Protection (Stabilizing Effect):** The Ir-C bond is often considered the weakest point in these structures. Fluorination, particularly at the *ortho*-position of the phenyl ring (next to the Ir-C bond), has two key stabilizing effects:\n        *   **Electronic:** It strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond.\n        *   **Steric:** It provides a bulky shield that protects the vulnerable Ir-C bond from chemical attack by other species (e.g., mobile ions, water impurities) present in the LEC.\n        This predicts that complexes with *ortho*-fluorine atoms will be more stable, while those lacking them will be less stable.\n\n4.  **Apply Principles to the Complexes:** We can now evaluate each complex based on these two competing factors. Literature has shown that there is an optimal level of fluorination; moderate fluorination is beneficial, while excessive fluorination is detrimental.\n\n    *   **Complex 4:** This complex is heavily fluorinated (four F atoms per ligand). According to Factor 1, it will be very easy to reduce. This high susceptibility to reductive degradation makes it highly unstable. Thus, **Complex 4 is expected to have a very short lifetime.**\n\n    *   **Complex 2:** This complex has only a single *para*-fluorine. It completely lacks the crucial *ortho*-fluorine substituent. According to Factor 2, the Ir-C bond is not sterically protected and is more vulnerable to degradation pathways compared to its *ortho*-fluorinated counterparts. Therefore, **Complex 2 is also expected to have a shorter lifetime.**\n\n    *   **Complex 3:** This complex has the key *ortho*-fluorine substituent. This provides significant electronic and steric stabilization to the Ir-C bond, making the complex relatively stable. It has only one fluorine, so it is not excessively electron-deficient. It should have a longer lifetime than Complex 2.\n\n    *   **Complex 1:** This complex features both an *ortho*- and a *para*-fluorine. It benefits from the crucial *ortho*-F stabilization (like Complex 3) and an additional electron-withdrawing group. This combination (dfppy ligand) is widely reported in the literature to produce some of the most stable and efficient blue/green-emitting Ir(III) complexes for both OLEDs and LECs. This complex is expected to have the longest lifetime among the four.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the two complexes that have structural features associated with lower stability and shorter lifetimes are Complex 2 (lack of ortho-F protection) and Complex 4 (over-fluorination leading to electrochemical instability). The expected order of stability (longest to shortest lifetime) is: Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2 > Complex 4. Therefore, complexes [2] and [4] are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n6.  **Select the Answer:** The combination of complexes [2] and [4] corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
