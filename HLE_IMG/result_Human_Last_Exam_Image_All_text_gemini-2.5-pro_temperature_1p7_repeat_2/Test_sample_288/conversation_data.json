    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the venue shown in the image. The building has several distinct architectural features:\n    *   Red brickwork, including sections with a herringbone pattern.\n    *   A large, beige facade section on the left with a prominent decorative quatrefoil medallion.\n    *   A curved roofline over the beige section.\n    *   A white, diamond-patterned railing on an upper level.\n    *   A large semi-truck and trailer are parked in front, which is common for venues hosting touring musical acts.\n\n2.  **Location Search:** A reverse image search or a descriptive search based on these features (e.g., \"red brick music venue with quatrefoil logo\") points to the **Knitting Factory** located at 919 W Sprague Ave in **Spokane, Washington**. Comparing images of the Knitting Factory in Spokane online confirms a perfect match with the building in the photo.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule:** The question asks for the performer on a specific date: October 12, 2023.

The event was part of \"The Lola Tour\".\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The analysis has successfully identified the venue and the specific artist who performed on the requested date.
