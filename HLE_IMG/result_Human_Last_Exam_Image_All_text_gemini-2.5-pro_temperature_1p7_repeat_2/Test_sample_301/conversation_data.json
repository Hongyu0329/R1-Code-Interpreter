    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the 9 works.\n\n**Overall Approach:**\nThe image displays a 3x3 grid of famous Chinese artworks. To identify the author of each piece, I will analyze the style, subject matter, signatures, and seals (if visible) for each work, moving from left to right, and top to bottom.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Work 1 (Top Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** This painting shows four fish, rendered in a simple, childlike, and whimsical style with bold outlines and bright watercolor washes. One fish has a human-like face.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This distinctive style, characterized by playful depictions of animals with strong calligraphic lines and a sense of innocence, is the signature style of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**. He is a contemporary artist famous for his animal paintings and sculptures (including the \"Fuwa\" mascots for the 2008 Beijing Olympics).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Han Meilin.\n\n2.  **Work 2 (Top Middle):**\n    *   **Visuals:** This is a classical Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums next to a rock. A red seal is visible in the upper left corner.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** The brushwork is vigorous and powerful, showing a mastery of ink and brush that integrates calligraphic and seal-carving techniques. This style is characteristic of the late Qing Dynasty master **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**. Chrysanthemums were one of his favorite subjects, and the bold, rugged aesthetic is his hallmark. The seal also confirms his identity.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Wu Changshuo.\n\n3.  **Work 3 (Top Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A realistic oil portrait of an elderly Yi woman. The detail is incredible, capturing the texture of her skin and clothing. The style is known as Scar Art or Native Soil Realism.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This powerful and moving realist style is the trademark of **Luo Zhongli (罗中立)**. While his most famous work is \"Father,\" this painting of a woman from the Yi ethnic group is another one of his masterpieces, showcasing his deep empathy and technical skill in portraying the rural people of China.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Luo Zhongli.\n\n4.  **Work 4 (Middle Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly fluid and energetic cursive script (草书).\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This dynamic, unrestrained, and wildly cursive style is characteristic of the Ming Dynasty calligrapher **Zhu Yunming (祝允明)**. He was known for his mastery of cursive script, creating works that appear almost chaotic yet are controlled with incredible skill. This piece showcases his distinctive, powerful hand.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Zhu Yunming.\n\n5.  **Work 5 (Middle Center):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A modern painting featuring two large orbs (a red sun and an orange moon/sun) above an abstract landscape rendered in an ink wash style.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This combination of Western-style abstraction (the colored circles) with traditional Chinese ink painting techniques, often exploring cosmic or space-related themes, is the signature style of **Liu Guosong (刘国松)**. He is a key figure in the modernization of Chinese painting and is famous for this \"space\" series.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Liu Guosong.\n\n6.  **Work 6 (Middle Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A piece of highly refined calligraphy in regular script (楷书). Multiple red seals are present.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** The script is elegant, structured, and graceful. One of the red seals clearly reads \"子昂\" (Zǐ'áng), which is the style name of the great Yuan Dynasty master **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**. This work is his famous \"Colophon to the Dingwu Orchid Pavilion Preface,\" a masterpiece renowned for its revival of the classical Tang Dynasty style with his own elegant interpretation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Zhao Mengfu.\n\n7.  **Work 7 (Bottom Left):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A calligraphy piece in a flowing, graceful running-cursive script (行草书).\n    *   **Style Analysis:** The writing is elegant, confident, and has a scholarly air. The style is identifiable as that of the famous Ming Dynasty scholar, painter, and calligrapher **Tang Yin (唐寅)**, also known as Tang Bohu. This particular work is from his famous \"Poem on Falling Flowers\" (落花诗). His calligraphy is as celebrated as his paintings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Tang Yin.\n\n8.  **Work 8 (Bottom Middle):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A highly realistic oil portrait of a pensive young woman with dark hair, set against a background of dark green leaves.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This work is a prime example of Neoclassical Realism in China. The artist is **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a towering figure in modern Chinese oil painting. This specific painting is his iconic masterpiece from 1983, titled \"Tajik Bride\" (塔吉克新娘), praised for its fusion of European classical technique with a distinctly Chinese sense of reserved beauty and grace.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is Jin Shangyi.\n\n9.  **Work 9 (Bottom Right):**\n    *   **Visuals:** A painting of a beautiful woman in ornate, ethnic-style clothing and headdress. The style is \"gongbi\" (fine-line painting), characterized by meticulous detail and delicate color application.\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This exquisite and decorative style is the hallmark of the husband-and-wife artist duo **Wang Meifang (王美芳) and Zhao Guojing (赵国经)**. They are contemporary masters of the gongbi style, renowned for their depictions of beautiful women from Chinese history, mythology, and ethnic minorities. This work, \"Beauty of Kashgar,\" is a representative piece.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The authors are Wang Meifang & Zhao Guojing.\n\n**Final List of Authors:**\n\nFrom left to right, top to bottom:\n\n1.
