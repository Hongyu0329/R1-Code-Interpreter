    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule (e.g., 1, 3, 5...). Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment is characteristic of the iminium ion [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, which strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine group attached to a methylene (-CH₂-) group, i.e., an R-CH₂-NH₂ moiety.\n*   Other significant peaks are present at m/z = 91 ([C₇H₇]⁺, tropylium ion, indicating a benzyl-type group) and m/z = 105.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 3020-3080 cm⁻¹) correspond to sp² C-H stretching, indicative of an aromatic ring.\n*   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 2850-2960 cm⁻¹) correspond to sp³ C-H stretching, indicating aliphatic groups.\n*   The region around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ shows absorption, characteristic of N-H stretching. For primary amines (-NH₂), two bands are typically observed. The spectrum is consistent with the presence of an N-H bond.\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The absence of a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates the lack of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   The pattern in the fingerprint region (e.g., strong bands around 700-750 cm⁻¹) is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon environments.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 100-150 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely a quaternary carbon (no attached protons) because it's not mentioned in the DEPT analysis. The other three are CH carbons. The presence of four aromatic signals is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (due to symmetry, the 6 carbons appear as 4 signals: C-ipso, C-ortho, C-meta, C-para). This means we have a C₆H₅- group and a side chain with 3 carbons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ 0-70 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signal: Indicates one CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals: Indicate CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups. We have five such groups.\n    *   From the ¹³C data, we already identified 3 aromatic CH groups (positive signals).\n    *   This leaves two positive signals in the aliphatic region. The signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group. Therefore, one of the signals at 49.6 or 43.5 ppm must be a CH group.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT:**\n    *   Quaternary (C): 1 (δ 145.1)\n    *   Methine (CH): 3 aromatic + 1 aliphatic = 4 total\n    *   Methylene (CH₂): 1 aliphatic (negative signal)\n    *   Methyl (CH₃): 1 aliphatic (δ 19.2)\n*   **Molecular Formula Deduction:** The structure contains a C₆ (phenyl) + C₃ (aliphatic chain) = C₉ skeleton. Based on the M⁺=135 and presence of one nitrogen, a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 4. This corresponds to a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of ~5H (from the integration box shown in a cropped image), characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of ~2H. This corresponds to the CH₂ group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of ~1H. This corresponds to the aliphatic CH group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet with an integration of ~3H. This corresponds to the CH₃ group. The doublet splitting pattern (n+1 rule) indicates that this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   The total integration of protons attached to carbon is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11H. For the formula C₉H₁₃N, the remaining 2 protons must be on the nitrogen atom, confirming a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Assembly using 2D NMR (HSQC)**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n*   Cross-peak at (¹H ~1.2 ppm, ¹³C ~19.2 ppm): Connects the 3H doublet to the 19.2 ppm carbon, confirming it's a CH₃ group.\n*   Cross-peak at (¹H ~2.7 ppm, ¹³C ~49.6 ppm): Connects the 1H multiplet to the 49.6 ppm carbon, confirming it's the aliphatic CH group.\n*   Cross-peak at (¹H ~2.8 ppm, ¹³C ~43.5 ppm): Connects the 2H multiplet to the 43.5 ppm carbon, confirming it's the CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 6: Final Structure Determination and IUPAC Name**\n*   We have the fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH(CH₃)-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂.\n*   Connecting these gives two possible isomers:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n\n*   **Discrimination using NMR data:**\n    *   For isomer 1 (1-phenylpropan-2-amine), the aliphatic CH is attached to the nitrogen (C-N), and the CH₂ is benzylic (C-Ph). Chemically, the C-N carbon is expected to be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the benzylic carbon.\n        *   Experimental: CH is at 49.6 ppm; CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm. So, C(H) > C(H₂). This matches the expectation for isomer 1.\n    *   For isomer 2 (2-phenylpropan-1-amine), the CH is benzylic (C-Ph), and the CH₂ is attached to nitrogen (C-N). The CH₂ group (C-N) is expected to be more deshielded than the CH group (C-Ph).\n        *   Experimental: CH is at 49.6 ppm; CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm. The data shows C(H) > C(H₂), which contradicts the expectation for isomer 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The combined NMR evidence (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC) overwhelmingly supports the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. (Note: While the MS base peak at m/z=30 strongly suggests a -CH₂-NH₂ group found in isomer 2, the complete and consistent set of NMR data is more definitive in this case, pointing to isomer 1).\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number: C¹H₃-C²H(NH₂)-C³H₂(Ph). This numbering gives the amine at C-2 and phenyl at C-3.\n    *   Numbering from the other end: Ph-C¹H₂-C²H(NH₂)-C³H₃. This gives the phenyl at C-1 and the amine at C-2. According to IUPAC rules, we prioritize the principal functional group (amine), but both numbering schemes give it position 2. In this case, we then give the lowest number to the substituent, which is the phenyl group at C-1.\n    *   The parent amine is propan-2-amine.\n    *   There is a phenyl substituent at position 1.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
