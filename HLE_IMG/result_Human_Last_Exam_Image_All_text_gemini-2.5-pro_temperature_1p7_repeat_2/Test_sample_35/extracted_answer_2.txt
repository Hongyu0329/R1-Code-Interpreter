The protein S100B shows a strong affinity for the extracellular V-domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). The diagram illustrates S100B binding to the top-most part of the RAGE receptor, which consists of the V, C1, and C2 domains, with the V-domain being the primary ligand-binding site.

S100B would be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. The reasoning is that its level directly correlates with the severity and progression of the pathology. As shown in the pathway, higher levels of S100B lead to increased activation of downstream pathways (like JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that result in apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, measuring S100B levels can help predict the future course and severity of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. While it may also serve as an adjunct marker due to its presence in multiple conditions, its value in predicting the outcome is more significant.
