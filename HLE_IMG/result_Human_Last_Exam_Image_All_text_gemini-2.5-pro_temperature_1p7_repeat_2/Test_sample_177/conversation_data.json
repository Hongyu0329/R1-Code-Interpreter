    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n2.  **Definition of Car VMT:** Car VMT refers to the total miles traveled by all cars. The tables break this down into two categories: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". To find the total Car VMT, we must sum the VMT from both these categories.\n\n3.  **Irrelevant Information:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) relate to Person Miles Traveled (PMT), not Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). Since a carpool trip is a single vehicle trip regardless of the number of occupants, this data is not needed for the calculation.\n\n4.  **Proportional Calculation:** The problem can be solved without knowing the absolute total number of trips. We can calculate a \"proportional VMT\" for a representative sample of trips, and the percentages will hold true. This proportional VMT can be thought of as the average miles traveled per trip across all modes.\n\n5.  **Formula for VMT:** The VMT for each car category and distance segment is calculated as:\n    `VMT = (Share of Total Trips in distance segment) × (Mode Share of the car category) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n6.  **Formula for Percentage Reduction:** The final answer will be calculated using the standard formula:\n    `Percentage Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] × 100%`\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate a proportional Total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. This is done by summing the VMT contributions from each of the four distance segments.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Baseline Car VMT (from Table 1)**\n\nFor each distance category, we'll find the total car share and then calculate its VMT contribution.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (48% of total trips) × (53% car share) × (1 mile avg. distance) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (22% of total trips) × (81% car share) × (4 miles avg. distance) = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (14% of total trips) × (85% car share) × (7.5 miles avg. distance) = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (16% of total trips) × (89% car share) × (20 miles avg. distance) = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Proportional Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Proposed Car VMT (from Table 2)**\n\nNow we repeat the same calculation using the data from the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proportional Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nUsing the total proportional VMT values calculated above:\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100%\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.196%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
