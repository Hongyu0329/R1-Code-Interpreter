    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. Specifically, it is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group attached to the double bond.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material to track the changes.\n        *   Bicyclic core: This part consists of 6 carbon atoms, 5 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom (C6H5NO).\n        *   CF3 group: 1 carbon atom, 3 fluorine atoms (CF3).\n        *   PMB group: 8 carbon atoms, 9 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom (C8H9O).\n        *   Adding these up:\n            *   C: 6 + 1 + 8 = 15\n            *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n            *   F: 3\n            *   N: 1\n            *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction: CAN, ACN/H2O → Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reagent:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is a strong oxidizing agent.\n    *   **Reaction:** CAN is commonly used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **Transformation:** The N-PMB bond is cleaved. The PMB group is lost, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen, forming an N-H bond.\n    *   **Calculating the formula of Intermediate 1:**\n        *   Start with the starting material: C15H14F3NO2.\n        *   Subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O): C(15-8)H(14-9)F3NO(2-1) = C7H5F3NO.\n        *   Add one hydrogen atom to the nitrogen: C7H(5+1)F3NO = C7H6F3NO.\n        *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction: Pd/C, H2, MeOH → Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) is a standard catalyst system for catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   **Transformation:** The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring is hydrogenated. This means two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond. The lactam carbonyl and the CF3 group are stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Calculating the formula of Intermediate 2:**\n        *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n        *   Add two hydrogen atoms (from H2): C7H(6+2)F3NO = C7H8F3NO.\n        *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction: 4 N HCl, 70 °C → Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** Aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl) and heat (70 °C).\n    *   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. A lactam is a cyclic amide.\n    *   **Transformation:** The amide bond (C(O)-N) in the lactam ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The C=O carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2). This ring-opening reaction results in an amino acid with a cyclopentane backbone.\n    *   **Calculating the formula of the Final Product:** The molecular formula of the product is conventionally given for the neutral molecule, even though it exists as a salt in the acidic solution.\n        *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n        *   Add the atoms of one water molecule (H2O):\n            *   C: 7\n            *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n            *   F: 3\n            *   N: 1\n            *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   The molecular formula of the **Final Product** is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of the atom changes:**\n*   **Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Step 1:** - C8H9O (PMB removal) + H (to N) → **Intermediate 1:** C7H6F3NO\n*   **Step 2:** + H2 (Hydrogenation) → **Intermediate 2:** C7H8F3NO\n*   **Step 3:** + H2O (Hydrolysis) → **Product:** C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final product is 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid, which has the molecular formula C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
