    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The goal is to identify which of the four images (A, B, C, D) shows the atomic pattern of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. A view along a direction means we are looking at the projection of the atoms onto a plane perpendicular to that direction.\n\n2.  **Characterize the expected projection patterns for an FCC lattice along common directions:**\n    *   **View along [100]:** The projection plane is the (100) plane. An FCC unit cell has atoms at the corners and face centers. Projecting the conventional unit cell onto the (100) plane results in a pattern with atoms at the four corners of a square, at the center of each edge of the square, and at the very center of the square. This pattern has four-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **View along [111]:** The projection plane is the (111) plane. The atoms in an FCC lattice are arranged in a stacking sequence of close-packed hexagonal layers (A, B, C layers) perpendicular to the [111] direction. The projection, therefore, shows a superposition of these hexagonal layers, resulting in a pattern with six-fold (or three-fold) rotational symmetry.\n    *   **View along [110]:** The projection plane is the (110) plane. The atoms in the FCC lattice, when projected along this direction, form a **centered rectangular lattice**. The repeating unit of this pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom in the center. This pattern has two-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Analyze each image and match it with the expected patterns:**\n\n    *   **Image D:** The atoms are arranged in a highly symmetric square pattern. We can identify a unit square with atoms at its corners, at the midpoint of each side, and in the center. This pattern perfectly matches the expected projection for an **FCC lattice viewed along the [100] direction**.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms are arranged in a pattern with clear hexagonal or triangular ordering. For example, one can trace hexagons and triangles connecting the atoms. This pattern exhibits the characteristic symmetry of a projection along a close-packed direction. This corresponds to an **FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction**.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows two simple rectangular arrays of atoms, one behind the other and slightly offset. The projected pattern is the superposition of two simple rectangles. This does not match the standard projection patterns for FCC [100], [111], or [110]. The [110] projection requires the offset to create a *centered* rectangle, which is a specific arrangement not depicted here. So, A is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n    *   **Image C:** By elimination, this should be the correct answer. Let's verify its features. The pattern in C has a generally rectangular character but lacks the high symmetry of B and D. It has a two-fold rotational symmetry characteristic of a [110] view. While the exact positions are difficult to verify from the drawing due to perspective, the overall structure is consistent with a centered rectangular lattice, which can appear as zig-zag rows of atoms, a known feature of (110) surfaces. Compared to the other clear patterns, C is the only remaining plausible candidate for the [110] projection.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the process of elimination by identifying the patterns for other principal directions:\n    *   D is FCC [100].\n    *   B is FCC [111].\n    *   A does not represent a standard FCC projection.\n    *   Therefore, C represents the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
