    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Staff:** The music is written on a grand staff, which consists of a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff joined together. This is standard notation for piano music.\n\n2.  **Tempo and Meter:**\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking at the top left is a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (♩ = 80). This indicates a moderately paced tempo, often described as *Andante* or a walking pace.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, indicating four quarter-note beats per measure.\n\n3.  **Key Signature and Tonality:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are three sharps (F♯, C♯, G♯) in the key signature. This corresponds to the key of A major or its relative minor, F♯ minor.\n    *   **Tonality:** The first chord in the left hand is a low A octave, and the right-hand part in the fast sections (e.g., measure 3) is built around an A major arpeggio. This strongly suggests the piece is in A major.\n\n4.  **Dynamics and Articulation:**\n    *   The piece begins softly (*p*, for piano).\n    *   In measure 3, there is a sudden and dramatic shift to loud (*f*, for forte).\n    *   Other dynamics like *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte) appear, indicating a wide and expressive dynamic range.\n    *   The fast sections are composed almost entirely of sixteenth notes, requiring virtuosity and stamina.\n    *   The glissando-like figure at the end of measure 11 is another indicator of a virtuosic and showy piece.\n\n5.  **Texture and Style:**\n    *   The piece begins with a quiet, sparse texture which quickly erupts into a very dense and technically demanding section.\n    *   This \"calm before the storm\" opening followed by a driving, aggressive theme is a common trope in dramatic music.\n    *   The constant stream of sixteenth-note arpeggios and broken chords in both hands is a hallmark of highly virtuosic piano writing, reminiscent of Romantic composers but with a distinctly modern, rhythmic drive.\n    *   This epic and powerful style is extremely common in video game music, especially for battle themes or character themes of major antagonists.\n\n6.  **Identification:**\n    *   Considering the A major key, the dramatic contrasts, and the virtuosic, relentless rhythmic drive, this piece is characteristic of a piano arrangement of an epic orchestral track.\n    *   The melodic fragments and harmonic progressions are highly recognizable to fans of video game music.\n    *   This specific piece is the piano arrangement of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the iconic theme for the antagonist Sephiroth from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*. The original music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu. This particular arrangement is from the official \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\" album, known for its technical difficulty and faithful capture of the original's epic scale.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel (from Final Fantasy VII)>>>"
