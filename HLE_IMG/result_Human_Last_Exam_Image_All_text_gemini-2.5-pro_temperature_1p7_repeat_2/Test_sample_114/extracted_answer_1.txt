The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 stems from the cyclic nature of its starting material, N-acetyl-proline. This leads to the formation of a single, conformationally rigid Münchnone intermediate. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the crucial context for this explanation.

In Reactions 1 and 2, the acyclic starting material (N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine) forms a Münchnone that can undergo rapid valence tautomerism, likely via an acylamino ketene intermediate. The ¹³C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 demonstrates this by showing complete scrambling of the acetyl-methyl and alanine-methyl groups, indicating that they become effectively equivalent through this dynamic equilibrium. This scrambling means that even if the cycloaddition step itself is regioselective, the final positions of these two methyl groups in Product A cannot be controlled.

In contrast, for Reaction 3, the N-acetyl-proline starting material has its nitrogen and α-carbon locked within a rigid five-membered ring. This geometric constraint prevents the formation of the open-chain ketene intermediate and thus forbids the tautomerism and substituent scrambling seen in the acyclic case. The reaction proceeds through a single, static Münchnone structure. Consequently, the inherent regioselectivity of the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between this well-defined dipole and methyl propiolate is fully expressed, resulting in the formation of a single regioisomeric product, Product B. Therefore, the regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a direct result of the structural rigidity imposed by the proline ring, which prevents the intermediate equilibration that leads to a loss of regiocontrol in the acyclic system shown in Reactions 1 and 2.
