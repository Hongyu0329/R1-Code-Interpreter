    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. We need to identify all such centers in the molecule. Let's number the carbon atoms according to IUPAC nomenclature to provide an unambiguous assignment.\n\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** The molecule contains both an amino (-NH2) group and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. According to IUPAC rules, the amino group has higher priority than the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the molecule will be named as an amine.\n*   **Parent Chain:** We need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the carbon atom to which the -NH2 group is attached. In this molecule, the amino group is part of an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group. For naming primary amines of the type R-CH2-NH2, the chain is numbered starting from the -CH2- carbon as C1.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   Let's trace the longest chain starting from C1 (-CH2NH2).\n        *   C1: -CH2NH2\n        *   C2: The carbon with the methyl substituent.\n        *   C3: The carbon with the ethyl substituent.\n        *   C4: The carbon with the hydroxyl and methyl substituents.\n    *   Let's expand the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) to ensure we have the longest chain. The chain C1-C2-C3-C(of ethyl)-C(of ethyl) is a 5-carbon chain. The chain C1-C2-C3-C4-C(methyl on C4) is also a 5-carbon chain. According to IUPAC rules, when two chains have the same length, the one with the greater number of substituents is chosen as the parent chain.\n    *   Chain 1: C1-C2-C3-C4-C5(methyl on C4). Substituents are at C2(methyl) and C3(ethyl).\n    *   Chain 2: C1-C2-C3-C(ethyl)-C(ethyl). Substituents are at C2(methyl) and C3(-CH(OH)CH3 group).\n    *   The first choice gives the name: 3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylpentan-1-amine.\n*   **Chiral Centers:** Based on this numbering, the chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4, as each is bonded to four different groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n*   **Analysis of C4:**\n    *   Substituents: -OH, -CH3 (C5), -C3H(Et)..., -H.\n    *   Priorities:\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n        2.  -C3H(Et)... (Carbon connected to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH3 (Carbon connected to H, H, H)\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen, atomic number 1)\n\n*   **Analysis of C3:**\n    *   Substituents: -C4H(OH)..., -C2H(Me)..., -CH2CH3 (Ethyl), -H.\n    *   Priorities:\n        1.  -C4H(OH)... (Carbon connected to O, C, C)\n        2.  -C2H(Me)... (Carbon connected to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (Carbon connected to C, H, H)\n        4.  -H\n\n*   **Analysis of C2:**\n    *   Substituents: -C3H(Et)..., -CH3, -C1H2NH2, -H.\n    *   Priorities: Let's compare the carbon groups.\n        *   -C1H2NH2: Carbon is attached to (N, H, H).\n        *   -C3H(Et)...: Carbon is attached to (C, C, H).\n        *   -CH3: Carbon is attached to (H, H, H).\n        *   Nitrogen (atomic no. 7) has higher priority than Carbon (atomic no. 6).\n        *   Priorities:\n            1.  -C1H2NH2\n            2.  -C3H(Et)...\n            3.  -CH3\n            4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center.**\n\nWe assume a standard zig-zag chain representation where the backbone lies in the plane of the page, wedges point out (up), and dashes point in (down).\n\n*   **Configuration of C4:**\n    *   Positions: -OH (priority 1) is dash (back), -CH3(C5) (priority 3) is on the chain (in plane), -C3 (priority 2) is on the chain (in plane), and -H (priority 4) must be a wedge (front).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing forward, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 and reverse the result.\n    *   Path 1(back) -> 2(plane, right) -> 3(plane, left). This traces a clockwise (R) direction.\n    *   Since H is forward, we reverse the result. R becomes S.\n    *   **C4 is (S).**\n\n*   **Configuration of C3:**\n    *   Positions: Ethyl (priority 3) is a wedge (front). C4 (priority 1) and C2 (priority 2) are in the plane. Therefore, H (priority 4) must be a dash (back).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing back, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Path 1(left) -> 2(right) -> 3(front/up). This traces a counter-clockwise (S) direction.\n    *   **C3 is (S).**\n\n*   **Configuration of C2:**\n    *   Positions: -CH2NH2 (priority 1) is a wedge (front), -CH3 (priority 3) is a dash (back). C3 (priority 2) is in the plane, so H (priority 4) must also be in the plane.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we can rotate the molecule. Let's rotate around the vertical axis in the drawing by 90Â° so the H atom comes to the front.\n    *   Original view: Let C3 be left, H be right, -CH2NH2 be up, -CH3 be down.\n    *   Rotate so 'right' comes to 'front': H(4) becomes wedge(front), C3(2) becomes dash(back), -CH2NH2(1) becomes right(plane), -CH3(3) becomes left(plane).\n    *   Now, H(4) is in front, so we trace 1 -> 2 -> 3 and reverse.\n    *   Path 1(right) -> 2(back) -> 3(left). This is a clockwise (R) direction.\n    *   Reversing the result gives S.\n    *   **C2 is (S).**\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll three chiral centers have the S configuration. Based on the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylpentan-1-amine, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4S)>>>"
