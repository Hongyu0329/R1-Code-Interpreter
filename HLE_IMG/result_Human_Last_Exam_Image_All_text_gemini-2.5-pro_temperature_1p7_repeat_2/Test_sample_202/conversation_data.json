    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.** The rock is reddish-brown and is covered in small holes or cavities. This texture is known as vesicular. It appears rough and somewhat lightweight.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret Formation.** The vesicular texture is created by gas bubbles escaping from cooling lava. This means it is an extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock. The reddish color is due to the presence of iron-rich minerals that have oxidized (rusted).\n*   **Step 3: Identification.** Based on its high vesicularity, extrusive origin, and reddish color, specimen H is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.** This rock is composed of many smaller, sharp-edged, angular rock fragments of different colors and sizes. These fragments (called clasts) are cemented together by a finer-grained material (matrix).\n*   **Step 2: Interpret Formation.** A rock made of consolidated, angular fragments is known as a breccia. If the fragments are from a volcanic eruption (ash, lapilli, bombs), it is a volcanic or pyroclastic breccia. The angular nature of the clasts indicates the fragments did not travel far before being deposited and cemented.\n*   **Step 3: Identification.** The key feature is the composition of angular clasts. Specimen I is identified as a **Breccia** (most likely a volcanic breccia given the context).\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.** The rock is very light in color (white to light gray) and has an extremely porous, almost frothy, texture. It is filled with vesicles, similar to specimen H but more abundant. It looks very low density.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret Formation.** Like Scoria, this is an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava that cooled rapidly. Its light color indicates it has a felsic composition (high in silica). The extreme number of vesicles gives it a very low density, so much so that it can often float on water.\n*   **Step 3: Identification.** The combination of light color, highly vesicular (frothy) texture, and volcanic origin are the defining characteristics of **Pumice**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n*   **Step 1: Observe Physical Characteristics.** This rock is made of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This is known as a coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. It contains both light-colored and dark-colored minerals.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret Formation.** The large crystal size indicates that the rock cooled very slowly from magma deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing ample time for crystals to grow. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock. Rocks with exceptionally large crystals (often several centimeters in size) form in the late, water-rich stages of magma crystallization.\n*   **Step 3: Identification.** An intrusive igneous rock with very large crystals is known as a **Pegmatite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
