    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sex.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13 in Hymenoptera) than females (typically 12). In some species, male antennae are noticeably curled at the tips.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which affects the shape of the abdominal tip. The number of visible abdominal segments often differs, with males typically having one more visible segment than females.\n*   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have distinct facial markings, often yellow or white, on the clypeus (the area above the mouthparts), which are absent or reduced in females.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Structures (Scopae):** The question specifies taxa \"without scopae on their legs\". This is a key clue. It applies to:\n    *   Males of all bee species.\n    *   Wasps (which do not collect pollen for young).\n    *   Cleptoparasitic (\"cuckoo\") bees, whose females lay eggs in other bees' nests and do not have scopae.\n    *   Bees that carry pollen on a ventral scopa (under the abdomen) instead of on their legs (e.g., family Megachilidae).\n    *   Bees that carry pollen internally (e.g., family Hylaeidae).\n\n**Analysis of Paired Insects:**\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lack pollen-collecting scopae, fitting the question's premise.\n*   **A - Left:** The abdomen is distinctly conical and tapers to a sharp point. This is the characteristic shape of a female *Coelioxys* bee's abdomen, adapted for piercing the nest cell wall of its host to lay an egg.\n*   **A - Right:** The abdomen has a blunt tip with multiple prongs or spines. This complex terminal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female (F), Right is Male (M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae.\n*   **B - Left:** The most definitive feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled or hooked at the tip. This is a classic characteristic of male wasps in the family Vespidae.\n*   **B - Right:** The antennae are straight and appear slightly shorter and thicker. The face also has a pattern more typical of a female *Polistes*.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C:** These are two different types of bees.\n*   **C - Left:** This bee has extremely long antennae, a defining feature of male \"long-horned bees\" (tribe Eucrini, e.g., *Melissodes*). Additionally, it has a prominent yellow patch on its clypeus (face), another common trait for male bees. As a male, it lacks scopae.\n*   **C - Right:** This bee has much shorter antennae, indicating it is a female. While she is a bee, she fits the condition of having \"no scopae on their legs\". This is likely a bee from the family Megachilidae (leafcutter bees, mason bees, wool-carder bees), which have their pollen-collecting hairs (scopa) on the ventral (underside) of the abdomen, not on the legs. The bright yellow abdominal hair is also consistent with some species in this family, like wool-carder bees (*Anthidium*).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Summary of Answers:**\n*   Pair A: Female, Male (4)\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (3)\n*   Pair C: Male, Female (3)\n\nCombining these gives the final sequence.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
