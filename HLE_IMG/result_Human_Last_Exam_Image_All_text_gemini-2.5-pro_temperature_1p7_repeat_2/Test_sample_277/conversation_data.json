    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided information:** The user has submitted a question asking to identify the type of isomerism between molecules that are supposed to be shown in an image. However, the image provided is completely black, meaning no molecules are displayed.\n2.  **Understand the task:** The task is to determine the relationship between molecules. To do this, one must compare their molecular formulas, the connectivity of their atoms, and their three-dimensional arrangement.\n3.  **Identify the core problem:** The crucial information, which is the structure of the molecules, is missing. Without the molecular structures, it is impossible to perform the necessary comparison.\n4.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **(a) Conformers isomers:** We cannot check this without seeing if they are the same molecule differing only by bond rotation.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** We cannot check this without comparing their molecular formulas and atomic connectivity.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** We cannot check this without seeing the structures to compare them.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** We cannot check this without comparing their connectivity and 3D spatial arrangement.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since none of the specific relationships (a, b, c, d) can be verified due to the lack of information, the question cannot be answered in favor of any of them. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is (e).\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The primary point is to recognize that the image is blank and contains no data to analyze.\n*   One must not guess or assume what molecules might have been intended to be shown. The analysis must be based strictly on the information provided.\n*   The option \"None of these\" is the correct choice when the other options are demonstrably false or, as in this case, when there is insufficient information to confirm any of the other options.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between molecules. The image that should display these molecules is empty. Without the structures of the molecules, no comparison is possible. Therefore, we cannot classify them as conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers. This makes option (e) the only logical answer.\n\n<<<e>>>"
