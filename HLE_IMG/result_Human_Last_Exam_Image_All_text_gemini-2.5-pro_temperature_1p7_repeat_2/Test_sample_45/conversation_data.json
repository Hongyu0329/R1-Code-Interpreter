    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the \"rotational symmetry\" of the tiling. This means we need to find the highest number of times the pattern can be rotated around a central point within a full 360-degree turn and look identical to its starting position. This number is called the \"order\" of rotational symmetry. An n-fold rotational symmetry corresponds to the pattern looking the same after a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Tiling's Components and Structure**\nThe tiling is a complex, repeating pattern made of polygons of different shapes and colors:\n*   Blue hexagons\n*   Light yellow squares\n*   Orange rhombuses (four-sided figures with equal side lengths)\nThese shapes are not just randomly placed; they form larger, repeating motifs. The most prominent motifs are the large, circular, flower-like patterns, which we will call rosettes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Potential Center of Rotation**\nThe most obvious candidates for centers of rotation are the centers of the most symmetrical features in the pattern. Let's focus on the center of one of the prominent rosettes.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Symmetry of a Single Rosette**\nLet's analyze the structure of one of these rosettes:\n*   At the very center of the rosette, there is a blue polygon. By carefully counting its sides, we can see it is a **regular hexagon** (6 sides).\n*   Surrounding this central hexagon, there is a ring of other shapes. We can count 6 yellow \"boat-shaped\" tiles and 6 orange \"star-shaped\" tiles, arranged in an alternating fashion.\n*   The entire rosette, with its central hexagon and 6 sets of surrounding yellow and orange tiles, clearly has a repeating structure.\n\n**Step 5: Test for Rotational Symmetry**\nLet's test for 6-fold rotational symmetry by rotating the pattern around the center of the rosette.\n*   The required angle for 6-fold symmetry is 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.\n*   If we rotate the rosette by 60 degrees, the central hexagon rotates onto itself.\n*   Each of the 6 yellow tiles rotates into the exact position previously occupied by the next yellow tile.\n*   Similarly, each of the 6 orange tiles rotates into the exact position of the next orange tile.\n*   So, the rosette itself possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the Symmetry for the Entire Tiling**\nFor the entire tiling to have 6-fold symmetry, the pattern surrounding the chosen rosette must also map onto itself after a 60-degree rotation.\n*   Observe the arrangement of the rosettes. They are positioned relative to each other in a hexagonal pattern. If you pick any rosette, it is surrounded by 6 other identical rosettes.\n*   When we rotate the entire image by 60 degrees around the center of our chosen rosette, this central rosette maps onto itself.\n*   Crucially, each of the 6 surrounding rosettes is moved into the exact position of another surrounding rosette.\n*   The \"filler\" patterns between the rosettes (composed of other hexagons, squares, and rhombi) are also identical in each 60-degree sector. Therefore, they also map perfectly onto each other after the rotation.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nSince a 60-degree rotation about the center of a rosette leaves the entire tiling pattern unchanged, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry. While other centers with lower symmetry exist (e.g., 2-fold symmetry at the center of the squares), the question asks for *the* rotational symmetry of the tiling, which by convention is the highest order of symmetry present.\n\nThe rotational symmetry of the tiling is **6-fold**.\n\n<<<6>>>"
