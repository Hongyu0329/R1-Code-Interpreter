    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Tonality**\n*   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). This indicates the key is either Ab major or F minor.\n*   The first chord of the piece is F- (F minor). The piece also ends on an F chord (the last chord shown before the repeat is C7, the dominant, leading back to F-). This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of **F minor**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   Let's transcribe the first few bars of the melody:\n    *   Bar 1: The main note is C, the fifth of the F minor chord.\n    *   Bar 2: The main note is B natural.\n    *   Bar 3: The main note is Ab.\n    *   Bar 4: The melody moves from Db to B natural.\n*   This melodic sequence, C -> B -> Ab, consisting of long, sustained notes over a descending harmonic pattern, is highly characteristic. This melodic contour is a primary identifier for the tune.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   **A Section:** The progression begins: `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | ...`.\n    *   The movement from F- to E-7b5 in the first two bars is a very distinctive and famous harmonic device in jazz standards. This progression alone strongly points towards a specific song.\n*   **B Section (Bridge):** The bridge starts with a `D-7b5` chord, followed by `G7`. This is a ii-V progression that would typically resolve to C. The chart follows with `C7` and `F7`, setting up a ii-V-I progression into the key of Ab major (`Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab`). This modulation to the relative major key (Ab is the relative major of F minor) is a common feature in standards.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\n*   Combining the key (F minor), the signature melodic phrase (C, B, Ab), and the unique opening chord progression (`F-` to `E-7b5`), the piece is unmistakably the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n*   The provided sheet music is a lead sheet for this song, likely from a \"Real Book\" or similar collection used by jazz musicians. The chord changes are a common \"blowing\" (improvisation) version of the tune.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   The jazz standard \"Yesterdays\" was written for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\". The music was composed by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the melody and harmony, the jazz standard is \"Yesterdays\" by composer Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
