    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The x-axis represents time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to over 50. The major tick marks are at intervals of 10 seconds.\n*   The y-axis represents the electrode number, from 0 to 128.\n*   Each black dot signifies a spike (an electrical signal from a neuron) recorded by a specific electrode at a specific point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA synchronized burst is a period where many neurons fire at nearly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating a high level of activity across a large number of electrodes. We need to identify these events on the graph. By scanning the plot from left to right, we can clearly distinguish several such bursts from the lower background activity.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Timestamp of Each Burst**\nTo calculate the interval between bursts, we must assign a specific time to each one. A consistent method is to use the start time of the burst, which is the point where the widespread, dense firing begins.\nLet's estimate the start time for each visually identifiable burst:\n*   **Burst 1:** Starts at approximately **2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** Starts at approximately **12 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Starts at approximately **22 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** Starts exactly halfway between the 30s and 40s marks, at **35 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** Starts a little before the 50s mark, at approximately **48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: 2 s, 12 s, 22 s, 35 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the start of two consecutive bursts. We have 5 bursts, so we can calculate 4 intervals.\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 12 s - 2 s = **10 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 22 s - 12 s = **10 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 35 s - 22 s = **13 s**\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 48 s - 35 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nThe average IBI is the sum of all calculated intervals divided by the number of intervals.\n*   Sum of intervals = 10 s + 10 s + 13 s + 13 s = 46 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated value is 11.5. This number has three significant figures (1, 1, and 5).\n*   To round to two significant figures, we look at the third digit. Since it is 5, we round the preceding digit (the second '1') up.\n*   Rounding 11.5 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Consistency in identifying timestamps:** It's crucial to use the same feature of the burst (e.g., the start) for each measurement to ensure the intervals are calculated correctly.\n*   **Reading the graph accurately:** The estimations of timestamps are based on visual inspection of the axis ticks. While there's a small margin of error, the chosen values (2, 12, 22, 35, 48) are reasonable estimates based on the provided scale.\n*   **Significant figures:** Correctly applying the rules for significant figures is the final step to meet the question's requirement. In this case, rounding 11.5 to two significant figures results in 12.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Burst timestamps: [2, 12, 22, 35, 48] s\n*   Intervals: [10, 10, 13, 13] s\n*   Average: (10 + 10 + 13 + 13) / 4 = 11.5 s\n*   Rounded to two significant figures: 12 s\n\n<<<12>>>"
