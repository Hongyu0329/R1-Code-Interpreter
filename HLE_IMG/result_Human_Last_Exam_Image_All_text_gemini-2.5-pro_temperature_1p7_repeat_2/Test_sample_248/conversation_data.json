    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image content:** The image displays a typical scene from a rocky intertidal zone. We can observe several types of marine invertebrates attached to or crawling on a dark, wet rock. The most prominent organisms are:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, sessile crustaceans with volcano-shaped calcareous shells. These are acorn barnacles.\n    *   **Gastropods (Snails):** There are at least three different types of snails visible.\n        *   A relatively large, white snail with a conical shell. This appears to be a Dog Whelk, likely *Nucella lapillus*.\n        *   A second large snail, just above the white one, with a brownish, conical shell that has distinct fine, dark spiral lines.\n        *   Several smaller, dark-colored snails with ribbed, globular shells.\n\n2.  **Understand the question's requirement:** The question asks for the scientific name of a single species in the photograph whose presence would confirm the location as the Atlantic Coast, and not the Pacific Coast. This requires finding an \"indicator species\" â€“ an organism that lives in one location but not the other.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the candidate species for their geographic distribution:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** Many barnacle species are widespread or have visually similar counterparts on different coasts. For example, the common Atlantic *Semibalanus balanoides* can be hard to distinguish from the Pacific *Balanus glandula* from a photograph alone. Therefore, the barnacles are not a definitive indicator in this case.\n    *   **Dog Whelk (*Nucella* sp.):** The white snail is likely an Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. While this species is native and abundant in the North Atlantic, it has been introduced in a few locations on the Pacific Coast. This makes its presence a strong, but not absolutely definitive, indicator.\n    *   **The other snails:** Let's focus on the other gastropods. The brownish snail with fine spiral lines and the smaller dark snails are characteristic of periwinkles of the genus *Littorina*.\n\n4.  **Identify the definitive indicator species:** The snail with the brown, spirally-lined shell is a classic example of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   **Identification:** Its shape, size, and distinct color pattern are key features.\n    *   **Geographic Distribution:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic (European coasts). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and has since become one of the most common and recognizable intertidal snails from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland, USA.\n    *   **The key point:** This species is **not found** on the Pacific Coast of North America. Its presence in an intertidal community is therefore a definitive sign that the location is on a North Atlantic shore (either North American or European), and definitively *not* the Pacific.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Common Periwinkle is the organism that satisfies the conditions of the question. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n\n    *   **Organism:** The brownish snail with fine spiral lines.\n    *   **Identification:** Common Periwinkle.\n    *   **Scientific Name:** *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   **Distribution Check:** Present on Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe; absent from Pacific Coast of North America.\n    *   **Confirmation:** This species definitively indicates the photo was taken on an Atlantic, not a Pacific, coast.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
