    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Words of the Poem**\nThe poem is a collage made from cut-out words pasted onto an old book page. The visible pasted words are:\n- \"rules\"\n- \"and\"\n- \"lines,\"\n- \"an intricate spider's web\"\n- \"work\"\n\nIn addition to the pasted words, the original page has other text:\n- The title: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n- A page number: \"35\"\n- A plate number: \"Pl. 4\"\n\n**Step 2: Initial Analysis of the Pasted Words**\nIf we only consider the words pasted onto the page and arrange them in a plausible order, we might get a phrase like \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\". Let's count the syllables in this phrase:\n- rules: 1\n- and: 1\n- lines: 1\n- an: 1\n- intricate (in-tri-cate): 3\n- spider's (spi-der's): 2\n- web: 1\n- work: 1\nTotal syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Initial Analysis**\nLet's check the given options against our 11-syllable phrase which has an irregular rhythm.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** Poetry with no regular rhyme or meter. This fits the 11-syllable, rhythmically irregular phrase.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** Requires 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed (uS) pattern. Our poem has 11 syllables and does not fit the iambic pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A 12-syllable line, typically in iambic hexameter. This doesn't match the syllable count or meter.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A specific stanzaic form with lines of 11, 11, 11, and 5 syllables. The poem is not a four-line stanza.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line of about 6 syllables with a predominantly iambic rhythm. This does not match.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A single sentence of exactly 17 syllables, a form popularized by Allen Ginsberg. Our initial count is 11, not 17.\n\nBased on this first look, \"free verse\" seems like the most likely answer. However, the specificity of the \"American Sentence\" option suggests there might be a more complex interpretation.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate by Considering ALL Text on the Page**\nA collage or erasure poem can sometimes invite the reader to incorporate elements from the source material. Let's see if we can form a 17-syllable sentence by using all the textual elements on the page: the title, the numbers, and the pasted words.\n\nThe available elements are:\n- \"The First Step\"\n- \"35\" (read as \"thirty-five\")\n- \"4\" (from Pl. 4, read as \"four\")\n- \"rules\"\n- \"and\"\n- \"lines,\"\n- \"an intricate spider's web\"\n- \"work\"\n\nLet's try to arrange these elements into a grammatically coherent sentence and count the syllables. A possible reconstruction is:\n*\"The first step: thirty-five rules and four lines work an intricate spider's web.\"*\n\n**Step 5: Count the Syllables of the Reconstructed Sentence**\nLet's carefully count the syllables in this new sentence:\n- The (1)\n- first (1)\n- step (1)\n- thir-ty (2)\n- five (1)\n- rules (1)\n- and (1)\n- four (1)\n- lines (1)\n- work (1)\n- an (1)\n- in-tri-cate (3)\n- spi-der's (2)\n- web (1)\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe reconstructed sentence, which incorporates all textual elements on the page, forms a complete thought and has exactly 17 syllables. This precisely matches the definition of an American Sentence. The puzzle-like nature of the collage invites this kind of reconstructive reading. Therefore, the metric pattern the words follow is the American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
