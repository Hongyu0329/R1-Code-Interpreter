    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Kakuro Rules**\nThe objective is to find the two numbers in the top-most horizontal run of two white squares. According to the rules of Kakuro:\n*   Each white square must be filled with a digit from 1 to 9.\n*   Digits within a single \"run\" (a contiguous block of white squares in a line) must be unique.\n*   The sum of digits in a run must equal the clue number for that run.\n*   A clue is a number in a black square (or on the border in this stylized puzzle). It applies to the run of white squares either to its right (for horizontal runs) or below it (for vertical runs).\n\n**2. Label the Cells and Identify Key Runs**\nLet's label the cells in the top two rows to make the analysis clearer:\n*   Let the two top squares be `A` and `B`.\n*   Let the four squares in the second row be `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F` from left to right.\n\n**3. Identify Clues and Formulate Equations**\nBased on the visual layout, we can associate the numbers with their respective runs:\n*   **Horizontal Run 1 (H1):** The two top cells, `A` and `B`. The clue `17` is adjacent to this run.\n    *   `A + B = 17`\n*   **Horizontal Run 2 (H2):** The four cells in the second row, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F`. The clue `29` is adjacent to this run.\n    *   `C + D + E + F = 29`\n*   **Vertical Run starting at A (V_A):** The clue `15` is positioned to be the sum for the vertical run starting with `A`. A vertical run is terminated by a black square. Looking at the grid, the run starting with `A` consists of cell `A` and the cell directly below it, `D`, before being stopped by the central black square.\n    *   `A + D = 15`\n\n**4. Solve Using Logic and Deduction**\n\n*   **From H1 (`A + B = 17`):** Since digits must be unique within a run and between 1 and 9, the only possible pair of digits that sum to 17 is 8 and 9. So, `{A, B} = {8, 9}`. We have two possible cases:\n    1.  `A = 8` and `B = 9`\n    2.  `A = 9` and `B = 8`\n\n*   **From H2 (`C + D + E + F = 29`):** We need to find four unique digits from 1-9 that sum to 29. The highest possible sum for four unique digits is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30`. To get a sum of 29, we must use a set of digits that is one less in total value. The only combination of four unique digits from 1-9 that sums to 29 is `{5, 7, 8, 9}`. So, the cells `C`, `D`, `E`, `F` must contain these four numbers in some order.\n\n*   **Test the two cases for A and B using the V_A equation (`A + D = 15`):**\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume `A = 8` and `B = 9`.**\n        *   Using the `V_A` equation: `8 + D = 15`.\n        *   This gives `D = 7`.\n        *   Now we check if this is consistent with H2. The digits for H2 must be `{5, 7, 8, 9}`. Our value `D = 7` is in this set. Therefore, this case is possible.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume `A = 9` and `B = 8`.**\n        *   Using the `V_A` equation: `9 + D = 15`.\n        *   This gives `D = 6`.\n        *   Now we check if this is consistent with H2. The digits for H2 must be `{5, 7, 8, 9}`. Our value `D = 6` is **not** in this set. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe only possibility that doesn't lead to a contradiction is Case 1. This means the numbers in the top two white squares must be:\n*   `A = 8`\n*   `B = 9`\n\nThe two numbers present in the two top white squares are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9"
