    "This is a problem about identifying different RNA splice variants (species) from a set of Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) experiments. Each band on the gel represents an amplified DNA product corresponding to a specific mRNA transcript present in the samples. By analyzing the products from different primer combinations, we can deduce the number of unique splice species.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Tools:**\n    *   **Genome Map (A):** Shows the layout of genes (E1, L1, etc.) and primer binding sites.\n    *   **Primers:**\n        *   `E1F1`: A general forward primer located in an early exon common to many transcripts.\n        *   `E1F2` & `E1F3`: Special forward primers that only bind across a specific splice junction (`929^3465` and `929^3506`, respectively). They are diagnostic for these specific splicing events.\n        *   `E4R`, `E5R`, `L2R`, `L1R`: Reverse primers located in different downstream exons.\n    *   **RT-PCR Gels (B-I):** The results of the experiments. Each unique band or pattern of bands indicates a distinct splice species or a set of related species.\n\n2.  **Analyze Experiments using Splice-Specific Primers (E1F2, E1F3):** These primers give the most direct evidence for specific splice species.\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R) & Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** The `E1F2` primer detects transcripts with the `929^3465` splice. Both panels D and F show only a single band (551 bp and 972 bp, respectively). This indicates there is **one unique splice species** characterized by the `929^3465` splice. The different product sizes are just due to using different reverse primers (E5R vs. L2R) on the same transcript.\n        *   *Identified Species: 1*\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** The `E1F3` primer detects transcripts with the `929^3506` splice. This panel shows two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp). Since the same primers produced two different products, it means that after the `929^3506` splice, there are two different downstream splicing patterns. This identifies **two unique splice species**.\n        *   *Identified Species: 2*\n\n    *So far, from the splice-specific primers, we have identified 1 + 2 = 3 unique splice species.*\n\n3.  **Analyze Experiments using the General Primer (E1F1):** This primer can amplify any transcript containing its binding site, allowing us to find other splice variants that don't use the `929^3465` or `929^3506` splices.\n    *   **Panels B (E1F1/E4R), C (E1F1/E5R), and H/I (E1F1/L1R):** These panels consistently show a pair of bands whose sizes differ by 31 bp (B: 190/159 bp; C: 584/553 bp; H/I: 450/419 bp). This pattern indicates an alternative splicing event involving a 31 bp sequence. These two products represent **two distinct splice species**, one \"long form\" and one \"short form\". Importantly, since this 31 bp difference is not seen in the results from the specific primers (Panels D, F, G), these two species must use a different primary splice donor than the one at nt 929.\n        *   *Identified Species: 2*\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is a more sensitive amplification. In addition to the 450 bp and 419 bp bands, two new bands appear: band 3 (378 bp) and band 4 (187 bp). These represent two additional, less abundant transcripts that are amplified by the E1F1/L1R primers. Their unique sizes indicate they are **two new, distinct splice species**.\n        *   *Identified Species: 2*\n\n### Conclusion: Counting the Species\n\nBy consolidating the findings from all experiments, we can list the unique splice species identified:\n\n1.  One species defined by the `929^3465` splice (from Panels D & F).\n2.  One species (\"long\") defined by the `929^3506` splice (from Panel G, band 1).\n3.  One species (\"short\") defined by the `929^3506` splice (from Panel G, band 2).\n4.  One species (\"long\") showing the 31 bp alternative splice (from the main pair of bands in B, C, H, I).\n5.  One species (\"short\") lacking the 31 bp alternative splice (from the main pair of bands in B, C, H, I).\n6.  One species yielding the 378 bp product in Panel I.\n7.  One species yielding the 187 bp product in Panel I.\n\nCounting these distinct splice patterns, we find a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 splice species.\n\n<<<7>>>"
