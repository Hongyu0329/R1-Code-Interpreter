    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:**\n    *   Mass remaining after accounting for one nitrogen atom: 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   This mass must be due to carbon (C, atomic weight ≈ 12) and hydrogen (H, atomic weight ≈ 1).\n    *   Let's find the number of carbons: 121 / 12 ≈ 10.1. Let's try C = 9.\n    *   Mass of 9 carbons = 9 × 12 = 108.\n    *   Mass remaining for hydrogen = 121 - 108 = 13.\n    *   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment, [CH₂NH₂]⁺, is a classic result of alpha-cleavage in primary amines containing an ethylamine-like moiety (R-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) or similar structures. This strongly supports the presence of an amine.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible. This doublet is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region correspond to sp² C-H stretching, confirming the presence of an **aromatic ring**.\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Peaks here are due to sp³ C-H stretching, indicating an **aliphatic part** of the molecule.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂), a benzene ring, and an aliphatic chain. This is consistent with the findings from the MS analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** Seven distinct carbon signals are observed: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n    *   Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, having only 7 signals implies some symmetry, which is expected for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are in the aromatic region (100-160 ppm). A monosubstituted phenyl ring (C₆H₅-) has 6 carbons but shows 4 signals (ipso-C, ortho-C, meta-C, para-C) due to symmetry.\n    *   The signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region (< 100 ppm), corresponding to the 3 carbons of the C₃H₈ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. So, there is **one -CH₂- group**.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. There are **five C-H or C-H₃ groups**.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (like the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring) do not appear in DEPT-135.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT-135:**\n    *   The aromatic ring has 3 CH groups (ortho, meta, para) which give 3 positive DEPT signals.\n    *   The aliphatic chain must therefore contain one CH₂ (negative signal), one CH (positive signal), and one CH₃ (positive signal).\n    *   Total: 1 CH₂ (negative), and 3 (aromatic CH) + 1 (aliphatic CH) + 1 (CH₃) = 5 positive signals. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon (at 145.1 ppm) is absent from the DEPT spectrum, as expected.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This is characteristic of the 5 protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A 3H doublet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (δ ~2.7-3.1 ppm):** The remaining protons (13 total - 5 aromatic - 3 methyl = 5 protons) must be in this region. This includes the -CH group (1H), the -CH₂- group (2H), and the -NH₂ group (2H). The -NH₂ protons are often broad and may be difficult to see or integrate clearly. The CH and CH₂ protons would be multiplets due to coupling.\n*   **Proposed Structure Fragments:** We have a C₆H₅- group, a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, a -CH₃ group, and an -NH₂ group. Let's assemble them.\n    *   The -CH- and -CH₃ groups are adjacent (from the doublet/quartet logic, although the CH is a more complex multiplet).\n    *   This leads to two possible isomers for the C₉H₁₃N molecule:\n        1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine):** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n        2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   **Distinguishing Isomers with HSQC:** The HSQC spectrum correlates directly attached protons and carbons.\n    *   We have aliphatic carbons at δ 19.2, 43.5, and 49.6 ppm.\n    *   **Correlation 1:** The proton at ~1.2 ppm (the CH₃ doublet) correlates with the carbon at δ 19.2 ppm. This assigns the CH₃ group.\n    *   **Correlation 2:** The HSQC shows protons around δ 2.8 ppm correlate with the carbon at δ 43.5 ppm. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group.\n    *   **Correlation 3:** A proton signal further downfield (around δ 3.1 ppm) correlates with the carbon at δ 49.6 ppm. This corresponds to the -CH- group.\n*   **Assigning Shifts to Isomers:**\n    *   **For 1-phenylpropan-2-amine:**\n        *   Benzylic -CH₂-: Expected C shift ~45 ppm. Our value is δ 43.5 ppm. (Good match).\n        *   -CH(NH₂)-: Expected C shift ~50 ppm. Our value is δ 49.6 ppm. (Good match).\n    *   **For 2-phenylpropan-1-amine:**\n        *   Benzylic -CH(Ph)-: Expected C shift ~43 ppm. Our -CH- is at δ 49.6 ppm. (Poor match).\n        *   -CH₂-NH₂: Expected C shift ~50 ppm. Our -CH₂- is at δ 43.5 ppm. (Poor match).\n*   The chemical shift data, particularly from the ¹³C and HSQC spectra, strongly supports the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**Step 5: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n*   The confirmed structure is C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n*   **Parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine) is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   **Numbering:** The chain is numbered to give the amine functional group the lowest possible locant.\n    C₆H₅-CH₂(1) — CH(2)(NH₂) — CH₃(3)\n*   **Substituents:** There is a phenyl group on carbon 1.\n*   **Final Name:** The IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
