    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Object Identification:** The image shows a silver medallion with a suspension loop. It features two portraits in profile facing each other, a common theme in Roman imperial or aristocratic art, often referred to as a marriage or dynastic medallion.\n    2.  **Stylistic Analysis:** The artistic style is crucial for dating. The figures are not rendered with classical naturalism. Instead, they exhibit features of Late Roman art: large, wide-open eyes, stylized and patterned hair, and a somewhat rigid, frontal presentation even in profile. This style moved away from the individualized realism of the High Empire towards a more abstract and symbolic representation of power and status, which is characteristic of the 4th and 5th centuries A.D.\n    3.  **Artifact Context:** This specific medallion is a famous archaeological artifact. It is known as the \"double-portrait medallion\" and is part of the **Kaiseraugst Treasure**. This significant hoard of Late Roman silver was discovered in 1961 in Kaiseraugst, Switzerland (the ancient Roman fort of Augusta Raurica).\n    4.  **Dating the Hoard:** The dating of the entire Kaiseraugst Treasure is well-established by archaeologists. Based on the coins found within the hoard (the latest of which were minted by the usurper Magnentius) and the historical context of civil war in Gaul at the time, the treasure is believed to have been buried for safekeeping around **351/352 A.D.**\n    5.  **Identifying the Figures:** While scholarly debate exists, the figures on the medallion are most widely identified as the Emperor **Constantius II** (who reigned from 337 to 361 A.D.) and his wife, the Augusta **Eusebia**. This identification aligns perfectly with the mid-4th-century dating of the hoard.\n    6.  **Conclusion on Century:** Since the medallion was created before the hoard's burial date of c. 351/352 A.D., and likely during the reign of Constantius II, archaeologists firmly place it in the middle of the **4th century A.D.**\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Pay close attention to the artistic style; the lack of classical realism points to a later period.\n    *   Recognize the double-profile motif as typical of Late Roman imperial medallions.\n    *   Connect the specific artifact to its archaeological context (the Kaiseraugst Treasure), as this provides a firm basis for dating.\n    *   The dating is not just based on style but also on numismatic evidence (coins) from the same hoard, which is a very reliable method in archaeology.\n\nFinal Answer: The medallion is ascribed to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
