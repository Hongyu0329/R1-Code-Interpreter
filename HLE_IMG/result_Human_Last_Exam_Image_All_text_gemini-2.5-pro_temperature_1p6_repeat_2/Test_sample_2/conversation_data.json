    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure**\n    The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its execution flow.\n    -   `a`: The list or array of elements.\n    -   `n`: The size of the prefix of the array to consider (i.e., `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`).\n    -   **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is inherently sorted, and the function does nothing.\n    -   **Recursive Step** (when `n > 1`):\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The function first calls itself to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, this line compares the last element of the prefix (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last (`a[n-2]`). Since `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is its largest element.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix, they are swapped.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial part. If the swap occurred, the new element at `a[n-2]` (which was originally `a[n-1]`) might disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix. To fix this, the algorithm makes *another* full recursive call to sort the `a[0...n-2]` prefix again.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario**\n    To determine the worst-case time complexity, we need to find an input that maximizes the number of operations. The most expensive part of the algorithm is the second call to `sort(a, n - 1)`, which only happens if the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true.\n    The worst case will be when this `if` condition is met at every level of the recursion (for all `n` from the initial size down to 2).\n\n    Let's consider what makes the `if` condition true.\n    -   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` sorts the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n    -   The `if` statement then compares `a[n-1]` with `a[n-2]`.\n    -   An input array sorted in **reverse order** (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) is a good candidate for the worst case.\n    -   Let's trace `sort([3, 2, 1], 3)`:\n        -   `sort(a, 3)` calls `sort(a, 2)` on `[3, 2]`.\n        -   `sort(a, 2)` sorts `a[0]` (already done), then compares `a[1]` (2) and `a[0]` (3). Since `2 < 3`, it swaps them. The array becomes `[2, 3, 1]`. It then calls `sort(a, 1)` again. After `sort(a, 2)` completes, `a[0...1]` is sorted, and the whole array is `[2, 3, 1]`.\n        -   Back in `sort(a, 3)`, the first `sort(a, 2)` is done. Now it compares `a[2]` (1) and `a[1]` (3). Since `1 < 3`, it swaps them. The array becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n        -   Crucially, it now makes the second call: `sort(a, 2)` on `[2, 1]`. This will again perform a swap to sort this prefix, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.\n    -   In a reverse-sorted array, the smallest element is always at the end. After sorting the prefix, this smallest element will always be smaller than the largest element of the prefix, triggering the swap and the second recursive call. Therefore, the reverse-sorted array represents the worst-case input.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    -   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    -   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    -   In the worst case, the second call `sort(a, n - 1)` is always executed, taking another `T(n - 1)` time.\n\n    So, the recurrence relation for the worst case is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\n    The base case is `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` by repeated substitution:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n - 2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n - 3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   ... after `k` steps ...\n    -   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum of the geometric series `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is `(2^k - 1)`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    -   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    As `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `(d + c) * 2^(n-1)`. This is of the order `2^n`.\n    Therefore, the time complexity `T(n)` is `O(2^n)`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection**\n    The calculated worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`. This corresponds to answer choice E. The algorithm does terminate because the recursive calls are always on a smaller size `n-1`, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- A. O(n): Incorrect. This would be the best-case complexity (for an already sorted array).\n- B. O(n log n): Incorrect. This is typical for efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.\n- C. O(n^2): Incorrect. This is typical for simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort. This algorithm is significantly less efficient.\n- D. O(n^3): Incorrect. The complexity grows exponentially, not polynomially.\n- E. O(2^n): Correct. This matches our derived recurrence relation.\n- F. does not terminate: Incorrect. The problem size `n` strictly decreases with each recursive call.\n\nFinal conclusion remains `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
