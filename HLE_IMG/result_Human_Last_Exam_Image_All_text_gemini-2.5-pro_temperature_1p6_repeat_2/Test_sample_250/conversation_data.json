    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n1.  **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature has one flat (B♭), indicating the key could be F Major or D minor. The time signature is 4/4 common time. The first chord is F- (F minor), which strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n\n2.  **Melody Analysis:**\n    *   The melody in the first measure starts and holds a C (the 5th of F minor).\n    *   In the second measure, the melody moves down to a B♭ (the 4th of F minor).\n    *   In the third measure, it descends further to an A♭ (the minor 3rd of F minor).\n    *   This stepwise descent from the 5th (C -> B♭ -> A♭) is a very distinctive melodic opening.\n\n3.  **Chord Progression Analysis (A Section):**\n    *   The progression begins with `| F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | ... ` (Eø7 is E half-diminished 7, sometimes written as E-7b5).\n    *   This progression features a chromatic descending bass line (F -> E -> Eb). This specific harmonic movement is a signature characteristic of a particular jazz standard.\n\n4.  **Chord Progression Analysis (B Section / Bridge):**\n    *   The bridge starts on the 9th measure with a `| Dø7 | G7 |` progression. This is a ii-V progression leading towards a C chord.\n    *   The progression continues with `| C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab |`, which is a common pattern of sequential dominant chords and ii-V's used in many jazz bridges.\n\n5.  **Putting the Clues Together:**\n    *   The combination of the melody (descending C, B♭, A♭) and the distinctive chromatic chord progression in the A section (`F- | Eø7 | Eb-6`) uniquely identifies the tune.\n    *   These features are the hallmarks of the jazz standard **\"On a Misty Night\"**.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Composer:**\n    *   \"On a Misty Night\" was composed by the great bebop-era pianist, composer, and arranger **Tadd Dameron**. His compositions are known for their sophisticated harmonies and lyrical melodies, both of which are evident in this piece.\n\nTherefore, based on the melodic and harmonic analysis, the piece is \"On a Misty Night\" by Tadd Dameron.\n\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
