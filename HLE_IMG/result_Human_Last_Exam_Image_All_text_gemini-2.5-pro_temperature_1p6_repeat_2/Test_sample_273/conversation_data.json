    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and determine the main carbon chain for IUPAC naming.**\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereocenters (chiral carbons). A chiral carbon is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers.\n\nTo refer to these centers unambiguously, we must name the molecule according to IUPAC rules.\n1.  **Identify the principal functional group:** The molecule contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group and an amino (-NH2) group. The alcohol has higher priority than the amine, so the molecule is named as an alcohol derivative (suffix \"-ol\").\n2.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group:** The carbon atom attached to the -OH group must be part of the main chain. Let's label the carbons C2, C3, and C4 as the central carbons from left to right as depicted. C2 bears the -OH group.\n    *   The longest carbon chain that includes C2 is a 5-carbon chain. Let's trace it: CH3 (attached to C2) -> C2 -> C3 -> C4 -> CH3 (attached to C4).\n    *   Let's verify this is the best choice. A 5-carbon chain can also be traced through the ethyl group: CH3 (on C2) -> C2 -> C3 -> CH2(of ethyl) -> CH3(of ethyl).\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, when there is a tie in the length of the main chain, the chain with the greater number of substituents is chosen.\n        *   Chain 1 (through ethyl): pentan-2-ol with one complex substituent on C3: `3-[1-(aminomethyl)-1-methylethyl]pentan-2-ol`.\n        *   Chain 2 (through C4's methyl): pentan-2-ol with two simple substituents on C3 and C4: an ethyl group at C3 and an aminomethyl group at C4.\n    *   Chain 2 is preferred due to having more substituents.\n3.  **Number the main chain:** We number the 5-carbon chain to give the principal functional group (-OH) the lowest possible number. Numbering from the left gives the -OH group position 2. Numbering from the right would give it position 4. So, we number from left to right.\n    *   C1 is the methyl group attached to C2.\n    *   C2 is the carbon with the -OH group.\n    *   C3 is the carbon with the ethyl group.\n    *   C4 is the carbon with the other methyl group and the aminomethyl group.\n    *   C5 is the methyl group that is part of the main chain, attached to C4. Wait, the methyl on C4 is a substituent. So the chain does not end there.\n    *   Let's re-examine the connectivity and chain selection. The chain `Me(on C2)-C2-C3-C4-Me(on C4)` means C4 has two substituents: `-CH2NH2` and `-H`. This implies the methyl group on C4 is C5. The IUPAC name is `4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol`. The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n1.  **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):**\n    *   Groups attached: -OH, -C3, -CH3 (C1), -H (implied).\n    *   Priorities: 1: -OH (highest atomic number O) > 2: -C3 (C bonded to C,C,H) > 3: -CH3 (C bonded to H,H,H) > 4: -H.\n2.  **Determine spatial arrangement:**\n    *   The drawing for C2 is unconventional, showing both -OH and -CH3 with dashed bonds. This usually implies they are on the same side of a plane. For a tetrahedral carbon, if C2-C3 is in the plane, this forces the implied H to be wedged (pointing towards the viewer).\n3.  **Assign R/S:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (H, #4) is pointing towards the viewer. We trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. The resulting configuration (R or S) will be the reverse of what is observed.\n    *   Path: 1(-OH, back) → 2(-C3, plane right) → 3(-CH3, back). This describes a clockwise (CW) turn.\n    *   Since H is in the front, we reverse the result. CW would be R, so the configuration is **S**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n1.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Groups attached: -C2, -C4, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H (implied).\n    *   Priorities: We compare the chains starting from C3.\n        *   -C2: -CH(OH)CH3 (C bonded to O, C, H)\n        *   -C4: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C bonded to C, C, H)\n        *   -CH2CH3: (C bonded to C, H, H)\n        *   -C2 is highest priority due to the O atom. Comparing C4 and Ethyl, C4 is attached to two other carbons while the ethyl carbon is attached to one, so C4 > Ethyl.\n        *   Priority order: 1: -C2 > 2: -C4 > 3: -CH2CH3 > 4: -H.\n2.  **Determine spatial arrangement:**\n    *   The ethyl group is shown with a wedged bond (pointing forward). For a tetrahedral carbon in a zig-zag chain, this implies the H atom is on a dashed bond (pointing away).\n3.  **Assign R/S:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (H, #4) is pointing away. We can directly determine the configuration by tracing 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Path: 1(-C2, left) → 2(-C4, right) → 3(-CH2CH3, front). This is a clockwise (CW) direction.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration is **R**.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n1.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Groups attached: -C3, -CH3, -CH2NH2, -H (implied).\n    *   Priorities: Compare the atoms attached to the carbons of each group.\n        *   -CH2NH2: C is bonded to N, H, H.\n        *   -C3: C is bonded to C, C, H.\n        *   -CH3: C is bonded to H, H, H.\n        *   Nitrogen (N) has a higher atomic number than Carbon (C).\n        *   Priority order: 1: -CH2NH2 > 2: -C3 > 3: -CH3 > 4: -H.\n2.  **Determine spatial arrangement:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 is wedged (front), and -CH3 is dashed (back). This places the C3-C4 bond and the C4-H bond in the plane of the drawing.\n3.  **Assign R/S:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (H, #4) is in the plane. We can use the \"swap\" rule. Swap the group in the back (CH3, #3) with the H group (#4).\n    *   Now, H is in the back. We determine the configuration of the altered molecule.\n    *   Path: 1(-CH2NH2, front) → 2(-C3, left) → 3(-CH3, now in the plane). This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    *   The configuration for the altered molecule is S. Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration is **R**.\n\n**Final Answer**\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers in order of the carbon chain numbering, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>>"
