    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject, in sharp focus, while the background, consisting of more yellow flowers and green foliage, is blurred.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect**\n*   **Type of Animal:** It is clearly an insect, belonging to the class Insecta. It has a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), six legs, and two antennae.\n*   **Order:** The insect's wings appear to be hemelytra—hardened at the base and membranous at the tips—which is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is predominantly black with bright orange or reddish-orange markings.\n*   **Specific Markings:**\n    *   The head is black with an orange line behind the large compound eyes.\n    *   The thorax (specifically the pronotum, the area behind the head) is orange with a black line running down the center.\n    *   The wings are black and appear to be outlined in orange.\n*   **Body Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated and flattened dorsally (on top).\n*   **Antennae and Legs:** The antennae and legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification based on Characteristics**\nThe combination of these features—the \"true bug\" body plan and the specific black and orange-red markings (three stripes on the thorax/pronotum and outlined wings)—is highly characteristic of the boxelder bug.\n\n**Step 4: Considering Similar Species**\n*   **Milkweed Bugs (*Oncopeltus fasciatus* or *Lygaeus kalmii*):** These bugs are also black and orange/red but have a different pattern. They typically feature a prominent 'X' shape on their backs, which is absent in the insect pictured.\n*   **Other Scentless Plant Bugs (Family Rhopalidae):** While there are other members of this family, the specific pattern of three lines on the pronotum and outlined wings is the key identifier for the genus *Boisea*.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name**\nThe insect is identified as a boxelder bug. The most common species in North America, particularly in the eastern and central regions, is the Eastern Boxelder Bug. Its scientific name is *Boisea trivittata*. The name \"*trivittata*\" is Latin for \"three-striped,\" referring to the three distinct lines on the pronotum. The visual evidence in the photograph aligns perfectly with the description of *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n**Step 6: Contextual Clues**\nThe insect is on a yellow flower, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* species). While boxelder bugs primarily feed on the seeds of boxelder, maple, and ash trees, they are often found on various other plants, especially in late summer and fall when they aggregate before seeking overwintering sites. Their presence on goldenrod is common.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the distinct physical characteristics, particularly the black and orange coloration pattern, the insect is identified as a boxelder bug. The specific scientific name is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
