A is methyl 1-(4-acetamidobutyl)pyrrole-3-carboxylate.
B is methyl (Z)-2-(3-oxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizin-7-ylidene)acetate.
C is N-(1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)succinimide.

The structures are drawn below:
**Product A:**
A 5-membered pyrrole ring. The nitrogen atom (position 1) is attached to a `-(CH₂)₄-NHC(=O)CH₃` group. Position 3 of the pyrrole ring has a `_C(=O)OCH₃` group.

 

**Product B:**
A bicyclic structure made of two fused 5-membered rings sharing a nitrogen and an adjacent carbon (pyrrolizidine system). One ring is a lactam with the carbonyl at position 3. The other ring has an exocyclic double bond at position 7, `C=CH(COOCH₃)`, with Z stereochemistry.

 

**Product C:**
A succinimide ring (5-membered ring with two carbonyls at positions 2 and 5 flanking the nitrogen atom). The nitrogen of the succinimide is attached to the C2 position of a pyrrolidine ring. The nitrogen of this pyrrolidine ring is acetylated (`-C(=O)CH₃`).
