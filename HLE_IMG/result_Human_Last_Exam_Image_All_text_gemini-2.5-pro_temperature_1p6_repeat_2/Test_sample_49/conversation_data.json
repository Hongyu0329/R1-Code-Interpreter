    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit contains resistors and one capacitor. This configuration acts as a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency ($f_c$ or angular frequency $\\omega_c$) is the frequency at which the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum (DC) value. For a simple first-order RC filter, the angular cutoff frequency is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$, and $C$ is the capacitance. Our main task is to find this $R_{th}$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to determine the equivalent resistance looking into the terminals across which the capacitor is connected. These terminals are node $a_0$ and node $b_0$ (ground). To calculate Thevenin resistance, all independent sources must be turned off. The input signal `IN` at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so we turn it off by replacing it with a short circuit to ground. Therefore, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also connected to ground.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Circuit Diagram**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder network composed of resistors with resistance $r$. The ladder has two main rails, a top rail with nodes $c_1, c_2, c_3, \\dots$ and a bottom rail with nodes $d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots$. The nodes are labeled in a way that suggests a uniform, repeating structure.\n- The input is at node $c_0$.\n- The output is across capacitor $C$ connected to node $a_0$.\n- Node $a_0$ is connected to $d_1$, and $c_0$ is connected to $c_1$. This strongly suggests that $a_0$ is the node $d_0$ in a regular grid pattern, and the input is applied across the first \"rung\" of the ladder, between nodes $c_0$ and $d_0$.\n- For the ladder to be uniform, there must be a resistor $r$ connecting nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for all $n$, including $n=0$. Although not explicitly drawn, this resistor between $c_0$ and $a_0$ (i.e., $d_0$) is assumed to exist to maintain the regular structure implied by the labeling.\n\nUnder this interpretation, calculating $R_{th}$ is equivalent to finding the resistance between nodes $d_0$ and $c_0$ of the infinite ladder network.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $R_{th}$ using Nodal Analysis and Symmetry**\nWe need to find the resistance $R_{d0, c0}$. Let's apply a voltage $V$ across these two nodes. By symmetry, we can set $V_{d0} = V/2$ and $V_{c0} = -V/2$. A current $I$ will flow from the source. Then $R_{th} = V/I$.\nDue to the anti-symmetric voltage excitation ($V_d = -V_c$), the voltages on the two rails will be opposite at every stage: $V_{dn} = -V_{cn}$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equation for a generic node $c_n$ ($n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c(n+1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{dn}}{r} = 0$\nMultiplying by $r$ gives:\n$(V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)}) + (V_{cn} - V_{c(n+1)}) + (V_{cn} - V_{dn}) = 0$\nNow, substitute the symmetry condition $V_{dn} = -V_{cn}$:\n$3V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)} - V_{c(n+1)} - (-V_{cn}) = 0$\n$4V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)} - V_{c(n+1)} = 0$\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous difference equation for the voltages $V_{cn}$. We look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A \\cdot k^n$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$4A k^n - A k^{n-1} - A k^{n+1} = 0$\nDividing by $A k^{n-1}$ (for non-trivial solution):\n$4k - 1 - k^2 = 0 \\implies k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving the quadratic equation for $k$:\n$k = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$\nSince the ladder is infinite, voltages must decay as $n \\to \\infty$. We must choose the solution with $|k|<1$.\n$k = 2 - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.268$.\nSo, the voltage along the top rail decays as $V_{cn} = V_{c0} \\cdot k^n$. By symmetry, along the bottom rail, $V_{dn} = V_{d0} \\cdot k^n$.\n\nNow, we calculate the total current $I$ that flows out of node $d_0$. This current goes into the resistor connecting $d_0$ and $c_0$, and into the resistor connecting $d_0$ and $d_1$.\n$I = I_{d0 \\to c0} + I_{d0 \\to d1}$\n$I_{d0 \\to c0} = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{c0}}{r} = \\frac{V/2 - (-V/2)}{r} = \\frac{V}{r}$\n$I_{d0 \\to d1} = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{d1}}{r}$\nWe know $V_{d1} = V_{d0} \\cdot k = (V/2)k$.\n$I_{d0 \\to d1} = \\frac{V/2 - (V/2)k}{r} = \\frac{V(1-k)}{2r}$\n\nSo, the total current is:\n$I = \\frac{V}{r} + \\frac{V(1-k)}{2r} = \\frac{V}{r} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1-k}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V}{r} \\left( \\frac{2+1-k}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V(3-k)}{2r}$\n\nNow substitute the value of $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$I = \\frac{V(3 - (2-\\sqrt{3}))}{2r} = \\frac{V(1+\\sqrt{3})}{2r}$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V}{I}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V}{V(1+\\sqrt{3}) / (2r)} = \\frac{2r}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}-1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{2} = r(\\sqrt{3}-1)$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}-1)C}$\n\nThis expression gives the cutoff frequency in radians per second."
