    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the primary, easily visible difference between the sporophytes of two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte is the spore-producing structure in a moss, which typically consists of a capsule (containing spores), a seta (stalk), and a foot (that attaches to the main plant). The term \"at a glance\" implies a significant morphological feature, not a microscopic one.\n\n2.  **Examine the Etymology of the Names:** Often, botanical names provide clues.\n    *   *Grimmia montana*: \"montana\" means \"of the mountains,\" referring to its typical habitat. This name doesn't describe its morphology.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta*: \"curvi-\" means \"curved,\" and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. The name literally means \"curved stalk.\" This is a very strong hint.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sporophyte Structure of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta (Stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically short and straight.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held upright (erect) and is typically emergent (partially exposed) or just slightly exserted (fully exposed) above the surrounding leaves (perichaetial leaves).\n    *   **Appearance:** The overall look is of a small, cup-like capsule sitting directly on top of the moss cushion, facing upwards. The provided image shows sporophytes consistent with this description (upright capsules on very short, unseen setae).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Sporophyte Structure of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta (Stalk):** As its name suggests, the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is strongly curved, often in a swan-neck or S-shape (cygneous).\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** This pronounced curve in the seta causes the capsule to be bent over, nodding (cernuous), or even hanging downwards (pendulous). It does not stand erect.\n    *   **Appearance:** The capsule would appear to be turned to the side or hanging off the moss cushion, not sitting upright on top of it.\n\n5.  **Identify the Main Distinguishing Feature:**\n    *   Comparing the two, the most obvious and defining difference in the sporophyte is the **seta**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **straight**.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is **strongly curved**.\n    *   This fundamental difference in the seta's shape leads to a dramatic and easily observable difference in the orientation of the capsule.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While there might be other subtle differences in capsule shape or peristome teeth, the curvature of the seta is the most reliable and immediate feature for telling these two species apart when they have sporophytes.\n*   **Life Stage:** This distinction is only possible when mature sporophytes are present. Without them, identification relies on gametophyte characteristics, which can be more challenging.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** The difference in capsule orientation (upright vs. nodding/hanging) resulting from the seta's shape is a perfect example of a feature that can be seen \"at a glance\" without a microscope.\n*   **Image Confirmation:** The image provided shows erect, sessile-looking capsules, which is characteristic of the *Grimmia montana* type of sporophyte (with a straight, short seta), not the *Grimmia curviseta* type.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta that holds the capsule erect, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a long, strongly curved seta that causes the capsule to be nodding or pendulous.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect (upright) position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging downwards.>>>"
