The main difference is the seta (stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect (upright) position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging downwards.
