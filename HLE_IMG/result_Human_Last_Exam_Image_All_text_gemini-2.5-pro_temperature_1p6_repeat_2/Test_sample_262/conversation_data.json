    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the core structure of the complexes.** All four compounds are cationic octahedral Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structure: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ PF6-. The central metal is Iridium(III). They all have one ancillary bidentate ligand (N^N), which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The tert-butyl groups are bulky and mainly serve to improve solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions (aggregation quenching), but they don't significantly impact the core electronic properties or the bond strengths that determine stability. All complexes have a hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) counterion, which is non-coordinating and standard for such complexes.\n\n2.  **Identify the variable component.** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the two identical cyclometalating ligands (C^N ligands). These are all derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), where the Iridium atom is bonded to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring. The variation is in the fluorine substitution pattern on the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Understand the question.** The question asks which complexes are \"expected to show shorter lifetimes\". In the context of light-emitting devices like LECs, \"lifetime\" usually refers to the operational lifetime of the device, which is directly related to the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter molecule. Shorter lifetime implies lower stability. A less likely interpretation is the phosphorescence lifetime (the excited state lifetime), but questions about molecular stability are more common when comparing such structurally related compounds. We will proceed by assuming \"lifetime\" means operational stability.\n\n4.  **Relate ligand structure to complex stability.** The stability of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes is highly dependent on the strength of the Ir-C and Ir-N bonds and the overall rigidity of the complex. Chemical degradation often initiates at the weakest points of the molecule.\n    *   **General effect of fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Placing fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring makes the ligand more electron-poor. This has two main effects:\n        a)  **Electronic effect:** It lowers the energy of the orbitals of the ligand. This generally lowers the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) of the complex, making it more resistant to oxidation. It also strengthens the covalent Ir-C bond. Both effects typically lead to increased stability and thus *longer* operational lifetimes.\n        b)  **Steric effect:** The position of the fluorine atom matters greatly. While F is relatively small, placing it in a sterically crowded position can introduce strain, weakening the complex and making it more prone to degradation. This would lead to *shorter* lifetimes.\n\n5.  **Analyze the specific substitution patterns.** Let's number the carbons of the phenyl ring C1' to C6', with C1' being attached to the pyridine ring and the cyclometalating Ir-C bond at the C2' position (this is the standard coordination mode for ppy).\n    *   **Complex 2 (no Fluorine):** This is the baseline complex, [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+. It's a well-known stable green-emitting complex.\n    *   **Complex 1 (F at C4' and C5'):** According to the drawing, the fluorine atoms are at the 4- and 5-positions of the phenyl ring. These positions are *meta* and *para* to the Ir-C bond at C2'. Substituents at these positions do not cause significant steric hindrance. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the two fluorine atoms will stabilize the complex electronically. Therefore, Complex 1 is expected to be *more* stable than Complex 2 and have a longer lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 3 (F at C6'):** The fluorine atom is at the C6' position. This position is *ortho* to the C-C bond connecting the phenyl and pyridine rings. A substituent at this position causes significant steric repulsion with the pyridine ring. This steric clash can force a twist in the ligand, weakening the coordination to the iridium center and making the entire complex less stable. This destabilization is a well-documented phenomenon. Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to be *less* stable than Complex 2 and have a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4 (F at C4' and C6'):** This complex has one fluorine atom at a stabilizing *meta* position (C4') and one at a destabilizing *ortho* position (C6'). The destabilizing steric effect from the C6' fluorine atom is generally a dominant factor. The presence of this ortho-substituent will likely make the complex unstable, similar to Complex 3. Therefore, Complex 4 is also expected to have a shorter lifetime.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.** Based on the analysis of steric effects, the presence of a fluorine substituent at the C6' position of the phenylpyridine ligand is expected to decrease the stability of the complex and shorten its operational lifetime. Complexes [3] and [4] both feature this structural motif. Complexes [1] and [2] lack this destabilizing feature; in fact, the fluorination in [1] is expected to be stabilizing. Therefore, complexes [3] and [4] are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Complexes with shorter lifetimes are less stable.\n- Stability is affected by substituents on the ligands.\n- Fluorine at the ortho position (C6') on the phenyl ring causes steric hindrance, which destabilizes the complex.\n- Complex 3 has a fluorine at the C6' position.\n- Complex 4 has a fluorine at the C6' position.\n- Therefore, complexes [3] and [4] are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n- This corresponds to answer choice J.\n\n<<<J>>>"
