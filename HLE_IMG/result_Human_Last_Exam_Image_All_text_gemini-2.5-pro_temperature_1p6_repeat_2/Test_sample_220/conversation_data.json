    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell is a cube with atoms at all 8 corners and in the center of each of its 6 faces. The basis of an FCC lattice can be represented by four atoms per unit cell. If the corner is at (0, 0, 0), the face-centering atoms are at (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), and (0, a/2, a/2), where 'a' is the lattice constant.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe direction [110] in a cubic system corresponds to a vector pointing from the origin (0, 0, 0) to the point (a, a, 0). This is a face diagonal of the cube. When we \"view along\" this direction, we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern**\nTo find the pattern, we need to consider how the atoms in the FCC lattice project onto the plane perpendicular to [110]. This plane is the (110) crystallographic plane.\n\n*   The atomic planes perpendicular to the [110] direction are the (110) planes.\n*   In an FCC lattice, the stacking sequence of these (110) planes is an `ABAB...` type stacking.\n*   Let's consider the arrangement of atoms within these planes.\n    *   **Plane A:** The atoms form a rectangular lattice. The rectangle's sides are parallel to the [001] and [1-10] directions, with lengths `a` and `aâˆš2` respectively.\n    *   **Plane B:** The atoms in this plane also form an identical rectangular lattice. However, this plane is shifted relative to Plane A. The shift is exactly half the diagonal of the rectangle from Plane A.\n*   **Combined Projection:** When both the A and B planes are projected onto the viewing plane, the atoms from Plane B fall precisely into the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms from Plane A.\n*   **The resulting 2D pattern is a centered rectangular lattice.** This means the unit cell of the projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom in the center.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\nNow, we look for the image that displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms when projected onto the front plane. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along [100]. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image C:** The projected pattern of atoms is complex and does not form a simple or centered rectangular lattice. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image D:** This image shows two rectangular grids of atoms that are offset from each other, but the offset is not to the center. This pattern (a rectangular C-centered lattice) is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image B:** This image shows a set of atoms that form a rectangle in projection, and another atom located in the center of that rectangle. We can identify four atoms forming the corners of a rectangle (despite the perspective distortion) and a fifth atom clearly positioned in the middle. This arrangement matches the theoretical **centered rectangular pattern** for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, Image B is the only one that represents a centered rectangular lattice, which is the correct projection for an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
