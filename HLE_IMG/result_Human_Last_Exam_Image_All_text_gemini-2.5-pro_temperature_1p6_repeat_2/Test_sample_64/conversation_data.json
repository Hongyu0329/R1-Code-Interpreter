    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure.** The image displays three panels (L, M, N) showing micrographs of a filamentous, segmented organism. The segments are individual cells separated by cross-walls called septa. This morphology is characteristic of fungal hyphae.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the progression or variation across the panels.** The panels appear to show different stages or examples of a specific cellular event, highlighted by black arrowheads.\n    *   In panel **L**, the hypha is relatively straight. The arrowhead points to a septum between two cells. The cells have a regular, cylindrical shape.\n    *   In panel **M**, the hypha is slightly bent. At the septum indicated by the arrowhead, the cell is visibly swollen and bulging outwards. The normal cylindrical shape is being lost.\n    *   In panel **N**, the bending is more pronounced, and the swelling at the septal region (indicated by the arrowhead) is even more severe. The cell wall appears to be extremely thin and distended in the bulging area.\n\n*   **Step 3: Interpret the observed cellular changes.** The sequence from a normal cell shape (panel L) to a swollen, distorted shape (panels M and N) at a specific point (the septum) indicates a loss of cell wall integrity. In organisms like fungi that possess a rigid cell wall, this wall counteracts the high internal osmotic pressure (turgor). If the cell wall is weakened (due to genetic defects, enzymatic degradation, or chemical inhibitors), it can no longer withstand the internal pressure. This causes the cell to swell at the weak point and eventually burst or rupture.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the biological process.** The process of a cell bursting due to the breakdown of its outer membrane or wall is called **lysis**. In this specific case, it is the lysis of a fungal hyphal cell. The swelling or \"ballooning\" seen in panels M and N is a classic prelude to complete cell lysis. The lysis appears to be initiating at the septal region. Therefore, the process depicted is cell lysis, also known as hyphal bursting.\n\n<<<cell lysis (hyphal bursting)>>>"
