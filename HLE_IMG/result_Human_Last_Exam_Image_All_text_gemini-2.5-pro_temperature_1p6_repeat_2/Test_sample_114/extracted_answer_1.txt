The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a rigid, bicyclic münchnone intermediate. In this intermediate, the nitrogen atom (N3) and the α-carbon (C4) are locked together in a five-membered pyrrolidine ring. This rigidity prevents the intermediate from undergoing the reversible electrocyclic ring-opening and isomerization that is possible for the flexible, acyclic münchnone formed in Reactions 1 and 2.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are critical for this rationale. Reaction 2, the ¹³C-labeling experiment, demonstrates that the acyclic münchnone from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine undergoes an isomerization process that scrambles the C2 and C4 substituents prior to cycloaddition, leading to a loss of regiochemical memory of the label's origin. Reaction 1 shows that the subsequent cycloaddition is still selective, yielding a single product scaffold. Together, these results prove that the lack of flexibility in the proline-derived bicyclic intermediate is the reason it cannot access this scrambling pathway. Consequently, the cycloaddition in Reaction 3 proceeds via a single, electronically preferred pathway, resulting in the exclusive formation of one regioisomer, Product B.
