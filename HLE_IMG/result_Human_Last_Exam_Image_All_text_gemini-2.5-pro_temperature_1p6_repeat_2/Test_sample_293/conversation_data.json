    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Tissue:** The image displays a section of kidney tissue, identifiable by the presence of a glomerulus (the central, dense, circular structure) and surrounding renal tubules. The staining is Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Glomerulus:**\n    *   **Hypercellularity:** The most striking feature is that the glomerulus is markedly hypercellular. A normal glomerulus has a relatively low cell count with open capillary loops. In this image, the glomerulus is packed with cells, almost completely filling Bowman's space.\n    *   **Cell Types:** The increased cellularity is due to two main components:\n        *   **Proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells:** There is an increase in the number and size of endothelial and mesangial cells, a condition known as endocapillary proliferation. This proliferation occludes the capillary lumens.\n        *   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** There is a significant influx of inflammatory cells from the circulation. Upon closer inspection (especially visible in the cropped images), many of these inflammatory cells have small, multi-lobed, dark-staining nuclei, characteristic of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). The presence of numerous neutrophils is often described as an \"exudative\" feature.\n    *   **Glomerular Architecture:** The overall architecture of the glomerular tuft is maintained but appears swollen and lobulated due to the hypercellularity. The capillary lumens are not clearly visible because they are occluded by the cellular infiltrate and swollen endothelial cells.\n    *   **Bowman's Capsule and Space:** Bowman's space, the area between the glomerular tuft and Bowman's capsule, is compressed by the enlarged glomerulus. There is no clear evidence of crescent formation (proliferation of parietal epithelial cells) in this particular section, although it can be a feature of severe cases.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Tubulointerstitium:**\n    *   **Tubules:** The surrounding renal tubules show some evidence of injury. For instance, the tubule in the upper right quadrant displays vacuolated cytoplasm. The tubule at the far right seems to contain either cellular debris or red blood cells (a cast). These are likely secondary changes due to the severe glomerular inflammation.\n    *   **Interstitium:** There is mild edema (separation of tubules) in the interstitial space.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   The key histological findings are: **diffuse global endocapillary proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis**.\n        *   \"Diffuse\" and \"Global\" mean that the entire glomerulus is affected, and it is presumed that most/all glomeruli in the biopsy would show similar changes.\n        *   \"Proliferative\" refers to the increase in resident glomerular cells.\n        *   \"Exudative\" refers to the prominent neutrophilic infiltrate.\n    *   This histological pattern is the classic textbook presentation of **Acute Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis (APIGN)**, most commonly seen after a Group A streptococcal infection (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Other infections can also cause this pattern.\n    *   Other possibilities in the differential diagnosis include lupus nephritis (Class IV), which can also be proliferative, but the intensely exudative (neutrophil-rich) nature is most characteristic of APIGN. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) typically shows more prominent lobulation and \"tram-track\" appearance of the basement membranes, which are not the primary features here.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the marked hypercellularity due to a combination of endocapillary proliferation and a dense neutrophilic exudate, the most fitting histopathological diagnosis is acute proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis, classically associated with post-infectious states.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Distinguish between proliferation of resident glomerular cells (mesangial, endothelial) and infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes). Both are present here.\n*   Note the occlusion of capillary lumens, which is the structural basis for the reduction in glomerular filtration.\n*   The term \"exudative\" specifically points to the high number of neutrophils.\n*   It's important to recognize this specific pattern as the classic lesion of post-infectious glomerulonephritis.\n*   While only one glomerulus is shown, the diagnosis implies a diffuse process affecting most glomeruli.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe image shows a hypercellular glomerulus with endocapillary proliferation and a prominent neutrophilic infiltrate, which occludes the capillary loops. These are the hallmark features of acute proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (post-infectious glomerulonephritis)"
