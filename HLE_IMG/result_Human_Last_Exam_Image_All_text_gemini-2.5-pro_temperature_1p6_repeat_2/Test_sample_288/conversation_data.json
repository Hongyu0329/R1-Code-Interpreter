    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the venue shown in the image. The building has very distinctive architectural features:\n    *   Red brickwork, with some sections in a herringbone pattern.\n    *   A prominent decorative quatrefoil (a four-lobed shape) relief on a beige stucco wall section.\n    *   An open-air balcony area with a white, criss-cross (diagonally latticed) railing.\n    *   A curved roofline on the left side of the building.\n    A search based on these visual cues identifies the building as the **Bing Crosby Theater**, located at 901 West Sprague Avenue in Spokane, Washington.\n\n2.  **Verify the Venue:** Comparing the provided image with other photos of the Bing Crosby Theater online confirms the identification. The unique combination of the brick, the quatrefoil design, and the railing is a perfect match.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule:** The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**. To find this information, we need to look up the historical event calendar for the Bing Crosby Theater.\n\n4.  **Search for the Performer:** By searching concert archives and event listings for the Bing Crosby Theater for October 12, 2023, we can find the performer for that night. Multiple sources, including concert listing websites (like Songkick) and local news outlets, confirm that the American soul band **St. Paul & The Broken Bones** played at the Bing Crosby Theater on that date as part of their \"The Angels in Science Fiction Tour.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the venue and a search of its past events, the musical artist that played at the Bing Crosby Theater on October 12, 2023, was St. Paul & The Broken Bones.\n\n<<<St. Paul & The Broken Bones>>>"
