1. The music modulates to the key of B minor.
2. The home key is C# minor, whose relative major is E major. B is the dominant of E major. Instead of modulating to the expected relative major (E major), Beethoven modulates to the key of its dominant (B), but chromatically changes its quality to minor. This is a modulation to the key of the minor dominant of the relative major, a sophisticated choice that maintains the piece's somber character.
3. The B major chord in measure 10 is the dominant of the relative major (V/III). The B minor chord on the first beat of measure 11 is a direct chromatic alteration of this chord. Therefore, its complete Roman numeral is v/III (the minor dominant of the mediant).
