    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which typically indicates C major or its relative, A minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is `♪ = 80`, which translates to a moderate Andante tempo.\n\n2.  **Melodic and Harmonic Analysis (Measures 1-2):**\n    *   The piece begins quietly, marked `p` (piano).\n    *   The right hand plays a simple, stepwise melody: E-F-G-A-G-F-E-D. This melodic fragment has a chant-like quality.\n    *   The left hand plays a very sparse accompaniment, starting with a whole note C, then a G.\n    *   This opening melody is a version of the famous Gregorian chant \"Dies Irae\" (Day of Wrath). While the original chant has a different starting note and mode (Phrygian), Liszt has transposed and harmonized it here to fit into a new context. The \"Dies Irae\" is a common theme in Romantic music, often used to symbolize death or judgment.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Following Section (Measures 3 onwards):**\n    *   There is an abrupt and dramatic change in measure 3.\n    *   **Dynamics:** The dynamic marking shifts suddenly to `f` (forte).\n    *   **Texture:** The texture becomes much thicker and more complex. Both hands play rapid, continuous sixteenth notes.\n    *   **Technique:** The writing is highly virtuosic, featuring broken chords in the right hand and powerful broken octaves in the left hand. This kind of demanding piano writing is a hallmark of the Romantic era, particularly of composers known for their own phenomenal technique.\n\n4.  **Identifying Key Characteristics and Forming a Hypothesis:**\n    *   **Extreme Contrast:** The most striking feature is the dramatic contrast between the serene, simple, chant-like opening and the sudden explosion of virtuosic, almost violent, keyboard writing.\n    *   **\"Dies Irae\" Theme:** The use of the \"Dies Irae\" theme is a major clue.\n    *   **Virtuosity:** The technical demands are very high.\n    *   **Form:** The structure—a clear theme followed immediately by a complex development—suggests a \"Theme and Variations\" format.\n\n5.  **Synthesizing the Clues:**\n    *   A theme and variations for piano.\n    *   Based on the \"Dies Irae\" chant.\n    *   Extremely virtuosic and with dramatic contrasts.\n    *   These characteristics point overwhelmingly to one composer and one specific piece: Franz Liszt's **\"Totentanz\"** (Dance of Death). \"Totentanz\" is a paraphrased set of variations for piano and orchestra based on the \"Dies Irae\" chant. The excerpt provided is from a famous variation within the work where the theme is stated simply and then immediately developed in a powerful, percussive, and technically brilliant manner.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe music is from Franz Liszt's **Totentanz (Dance of Death)**.\n\n<<<Totentanz by Franz Liszt>>>"
