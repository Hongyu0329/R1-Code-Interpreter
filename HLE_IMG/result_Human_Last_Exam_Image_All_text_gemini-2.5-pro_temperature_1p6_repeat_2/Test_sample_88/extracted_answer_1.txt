Here are the structures for products A, B, and C.

**Product A:**
[Image of the chemical structure of Product A, which is the Michael addition product of methyl propiolate to the N5 atom of (octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)methanol. The structure shows the tricyclic core with a CH2OH group at position 6. A -(CH=CH-COOCH3) group is attached to the N5 nitrogen.]

**Product B:**
[Image of the chemical structure of Product B, which is a mixed anhydride. The structure shows the tricyclic core with a C=C double bond between C6 and C7. At the C6 position, there is a -CO-O-CO-CH3 group.]

**Product C:**
[Image of the chemical structure of Product C, which is an N-oxide of a methyl ester. The structure shows the saturated tricyclic core with a -COOCH3 group at position 6. There is an oxygen atom coordinated to the N5 nitrogen, indicated as N⁺-O⁻.]"]]]
