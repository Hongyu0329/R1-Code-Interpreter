    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the different types of organisms in the image.** The photograph displays a typical rocky intertidal community. We can clearly distinguish several types of invertebrates:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, sessile crustaceans with whitish-grey shells are attached to the dark rock. These are a common sight on rocky shores worldwide.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least three types of snails visible.\n        *   Two larger snails are in the center. One is light-colored and somewhat eroded, while the other has a distinct pattern of brownish spiral stripes on a lighter background.\n        *   Several smaller, dark-colored, more globose snails are scattered among the barnacles. These are likely a different species or juveniles of the larger species.\n    *   **Other encrusting organisms:** Tiny, light-colored specks are scattered on the rock, which could be very young barnacle \"spat\" or other encrusting invertebrates.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each organism as a potential geographic indicator.** The question asks for a species that *definitively* indicates the photo was taken on an Atlantic coast rather than a Pacific one. This requires identifying a species whose natural range is restricted to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n    *   **Barnacles:** While some barnacle species are specific to certain oceans (e.g., *Semibalanus balanoides* is a North Atlantic species), visually identifying barnacles to the species level from a photograph can be very difficult. Many species on different coasts look superficially similar. Therefore, the barnacles are not the most definitive indicator in this case.\n\n    *   **Small dark snails:** These appear to be periwinkles of some kind, possibly *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle) or juvenile *Littorina littorea*. While these are Atlantic species, the most distinctive and easily identifiable organism provides stronger evidence.\n\n    *   **Larger striped snail:** The snail in the upper center with clear brownish spiral bands is the most visually distinct organism. Its size, shape (solid shell, moderately pointed spire), and coloration are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**.\n\n3.  **Determine the scientific name and distribution of the Common Periwinkle.**\n    *   The scientific name for the Common Periwinkle is *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   Let's check its geographic distribution:\n        *   **Native Range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, found all along the coasts of Europe.\n        *   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and has since become extremely common and widespread, from Canada down to Maryland. It is a dominant member of the rocky intertidal community in this region.\n        *   **Pacific Coast Status:** While there have been reports of *Littorina littorea* being introduced to a few isolated locations on the Pacific coast of North America (like San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound), it has not established large, widespread populations and is not a characteristic or common member of the general Pacific rocky shore ecosystem.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.** The presence of a healthy, mature *Littorina littorea* within a typical rocky shore community is an extremely strong, definitive indicator that the photograph was taken on a coast of the Atlantic Ocean (either in its native European range or its introduced North American range). Its abundance and typical appearance in this photo strongly rule out the Pacific Coast, where it is either absent or a rare, localized introduced species. Therefore, *Littorina littorea* is the species that best answers the question.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
