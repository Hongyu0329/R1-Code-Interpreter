    "*   **Step 1: Understand the concept of rotational symmetry.**\n    Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern looks identical when rotated through a full 360-degree turn. The number of times it matches is called the \"order\" of the rotational symmetry. For example, a square has a 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90째, 180째, 270째, and 360째.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the tiling's components and structure.**\n    The tiling is composed of polygons of at least three different types:\n    1.  Large, dark blue, heptagonal-like shapes.\n    2.  Medium-sized, yellow, square-like shapes.\n    3.  Small, orange, hexagonal-like shapes.\n    These shapes are arranged in a complex, repeating pattern.\n\n*   **Step 3: Search for a center of rotation.**\n    We need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire image and have it look unchanged. Let's examine key features of the pattern as potential centers.\n\n*   **Step 4: Test potential centers of rotation.**\n    *   **Center of a yellow square:** If we pick the center of any yellow square and rotate the pattern, we can see that the square itself has 4-fold symmetry. However, we must check if the entire pattern around it also aligns. In this tiling, the shapes surrounding each square are arranged symmetrically, allowing for a 90-degree rotation to map the pattern onto itself. Thus, the pattern has centers of 4-fold rotation.\n    *   **Center of a blue heptagonal shape:** These blue shapes are located at the center of larger, star-like motifs. Let's count the number of \"points\" or repeating units that form one of these star-like motifs. We can see that around each central blue polygon, there are 7 orange polygons and 7 yellow squares arranged in a circular fashion.\n    *   **Focus on the star motif:** Let's choose the center of one of these star motifs as our potential center of rotation. If we rotate the pattern around this point, we can observe that each \"arm\" of the star (consisting of an orange and yellow shape extending outwards) will align with the position of the next arm. Since there are 7 such arms, a rotation of 360/7 degrees will map the pattern onto itself. This means the pattern has a center of 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the highest order of rotational symmetry.**\n    A pattern can have multiple centers of rotation with different orders. We have identified centers with 4-fold symmetry and centers with 7-fold symmetry. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotation that exists. In this case, the highest order is 7.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:** The most prominent features are the star-like clusters. By counting the repeating elements around the center of one such cluster, we find there are 7 of them. Rotating the pattern by 360/7 degrees around this center leaves the entire tiling unchanged. Therefore, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<7>>>"
