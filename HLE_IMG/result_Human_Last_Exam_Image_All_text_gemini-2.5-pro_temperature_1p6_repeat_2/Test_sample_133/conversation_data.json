    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster**\n*   The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion and its isotopes. In this spectrum, this cluster is observed around m/z 260-266.\n*   The most significant peaks in this cluster are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), m/z 262 (I=29.0%), and m/z 264 (I=12.9%).\n*   We need to determine the number of chlorine atoms by analyzing the isotopic pattern. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately ³⁵Cl : ³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1.\n    *   For 1 Cl: M, M+2 ratio is ~3:1.\n    *   For 2 Cl: M, M+2, M+4 ratio is ~9:6:1 (or ~1.5:1:0.17).\n    *   For 3 Cl: M, M+2, M+4 ratio is ~27:27:9:1 (or ~1:1:0.33).\n    *   For 4 Cl: M, M+2, M+4, M+6 ratio is ~81:108:54:12:1.\n*   Let's examine the ratio of the peaks at m/z 260, 262, and 264. The intensities are 34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9. The ratio is approximately 1 : 0.83 : 0.37.\n*   This pattern closely matches the theoretical ratio for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms** (~1:1:0.33).\n*   Therefore, the compound contains three chlorine atoms, and the nominal molecular mass (using the most abundant isotope, ³⁵Cl) is **260 u**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   The nominal molecular weight (M) is 260 u, and the molecule contains 3 chlorine atoms.\n*   The mass contribution from the three ³⁵Cl atoms is 3 × 35 = 105 u.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the CₐHᵦ part) is 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n*   We need to find a plausible hydrocarbon formula (CₐHᵦ) that has a mass of 155 u.\n    *   Let's try C₁₂: 12 × 12 = 144 u. This leaves 155 - 144 = 11 u for hydrogen. The formula would be C₁₂H₁₁.\n    *   This is a plausible formula.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern to Confirm the Structure**\n*   **Base Peak**: The base peak is the most intense peak at m/z 225 (I=100%). It is accompanied by a significant peak at m/z 227 (I=66.7%).\n    *   The intensity ratio is 100 : 66.7, which is approximately 3:2 or 1.5:1. This is the characteristic pattern for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms** (theoretical ratio 9:6 = 1.5:1).\n    *   Let's check the origin of this fragment. The difference in mass between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•).\n    *   Fragmentation: [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃]⁺• → [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ + Cl•. This is a very common fragmentation pathway and strongly supports our proposed molecular formula.\n\n*   **Key Fragment at m/z 141 and 143**:\n    *   There are two prominent peaks at m/z 141 (I=28.1%) and m/z 143 (I=27.8%). Their intensity ratio is nearly 1:1.\n    *   At first glance, this pattern is highly suggestive of a fragment containing one bromine atom. However, this contradicts the molecular ion analysis, which showed no evidence of bromine.\n    *   Let's consider an alternative explanation. A structure of the type R-CCl₃ often fragments by breaking the C-C bond, yielding an R⁺ cation and a CCl₃⁺ cation.\n    *   Let's assume our compound has the structure **(C₁₁H₁₁)-CCl₃**. The molecular formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃, which is correct.\n    *   The mass of the C₁₁H₁₁ radical is (11 × 12) + (11 × 1) = 132 + 11 = 143 u.\n    *   Cleavage of the C-C bond would produce the **[C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ cation at m/z 143**. This perfectly explains the peak at m/z 143.\n    *   The peak at m/z 141 can be explained by the loss of H₂ from the [C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ cation to form the very stable aromatic-like [C₁₁H₉]⁺ cation.\n    *   This hypothesis elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction of the \"bromine-like\" pattern. The near-equal intensity is coincidental.\n\n*   **Other Supporting Fragments**:\n    *   **[CCl₃]⁺ fragment**: A structure containing a -CCl₃ group should show a cluster of peaks for CCl₃⁺ at m/z 117, 119, 121, 123 (with ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). The table shows peaks at 117 (I=2.98), 119 (I=4.41), and 121 (I=2.06). While these peaks are not very intense and are surrounded by other large fragments (like m/z 118 and 120), their presence supports the -CCl₃ group hypothesis.\n    *   **[CCl]⁺ fragment**: The peak at m/z 47 (I=18.4%) with its isotope peak at m/z 49 (I=6.24%) has an intensity ratio of ~3:1. This corresponds to the [C³⁵Cl]⁺ fragment, further evidence for a highly chlorinated carbon atom.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The combined evidence strongly points to a structure of **(C₁₁H₁₁)-CCl₃**.\n*   We need to identify a plausible and common structure for the C₁₁H₁₁ group. A likely candidate would be a structure analogous to the pesticide DDT, which has a 1,1,1-trichloroethane core.\n*   Let's consider the structure **1-ethyl-3-(trichloromethyl)-1H-indene**.\n    *   The indene core is C₉H₈. Adding an ethyl group (C₂H₅) and a trichloromethyl group (CCl₃) and arranging them on the ring leads to various isomers. For example, 1-ethyl-3-(trichloromethyl)-1H-indene has the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. The indene structure provides the stability for the [C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ cation (as an ethylindenyl cation) seen at m/z 143.\n*   This is a plausible systematic name that fits all the derived structural features.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe compound has the molecular formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. The fragmentation pattern strongly suggests a structure containing a trichloromethyl group (-CCl₃) attached to a C₁₁H₁₁ moiety. A plausible structure is an isomer of ethyl(trichloromethyl)indene. The systematic IUPAC name for one such isomer is provided.\n\n**IUPAC Name**: 1-ethyl-3-(trichloromethyl)-1H-indene\n\n<<<1-ethyl-3-(trichloromethyl)-1H-indene>>>"
