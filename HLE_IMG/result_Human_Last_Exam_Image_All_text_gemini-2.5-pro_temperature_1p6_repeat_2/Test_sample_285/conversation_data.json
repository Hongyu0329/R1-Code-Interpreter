    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept**: The question is about the **Delaunay triangulation** and its defining characteristic, the **empty circle property**. A triangulation of a set of points P has the empty circle property if for every triangle in the triangulation, the circumcircle of that triangle (the unique circle that passes through all three of its vertices) does not contain any other point from P in its interior. We need to find which of the four figures (A, B, C, D) shows a triangulation that violates this rule.\n\n2.  **Examine each figure**: We will check each of the four options to see if we can find a triangle whose circumcircle contains another point from the set. The set of points (the black dots) is the same in all four figures: seven points, with five forming the vertices of a convex pentagon and two located in the interior.\n\n3.  **Analyze Figure A**: The triangles in this figure appear reasonably well-proportioned. While some triangles are not perfectly equilateral, none of them are extremely \"thin\" or \"skinny\". Visually inspecting a few circumcircles is difficult without drawing tools, but there is no obvious triangle whose circumcircle clearly contains another point. For example, the top central triangle formed by the top vertex and the two inner points is acute, so its circumcircle will be relatively small and is unlikely to contain any other vertices. We can tentatively say this might be a valid Delaunay triangulation, or if it violates the property, the violation is subtle.\n\n4.  **Analyze Figure B**: This triangulation is composed of \"fat\" triangles, which have angles that are relatively far from 0 or 180 degrees. This is a strong visual indicator of a Delaunay triangulation, as the Delaunay algorithm tends to maximize the minimum angle of the triangles. It is highly likely that this triangulation *satisfies* the empty circle property.\n\n5.  **Analyze Figure D**: This figure is not a valid triangulation. A triangulation must be a **planar graph**, which means its edges cannot cross each other. In figure D, we can clearly see several edges crossing in the center of the figure. Since it is not a proper triangulation, it cannot be a Delaunay triangulation. However, the question asks which \"triangulation\" violates the property, and this is fundamentally not a triangulation. Among the choices, C presents a more direct violation of the empty circle property itself, rather than failing the definition of a triangulation altogether.\n\n6.  **Analyze Figure C**: This figure contains several very \"thin\" triangles (also called \"slivers\"). Let's focus on the triangle on the far left. Its vertices are the top-left vertex of the pentagon, the bottom-left vertex of the pentagon, and the left interior point.\n    *   Let's call these vertices V1, V2, and V3. These three points are almost collinear (they lie almost on a straight line).\n    *   The circumcircle of a triangle with nearly collinear vertices is always extremely large. Imagine trying to draw a circle through three points that are almost in a line; the circle's radius has to be huge to accommodate the slight curve.\n    *   This huge circumcircle will definitely expand to cover a large area of the figure, and in doing so, it will contain other points of the set in its interior (for example, the other interior point, and the top vertex of the pentagon are clearly inside where this circle would be).\n    *   Because we have found at least one triangle in Figure C whose circumcircle contains another point, Figure C violates the empty circle property. This violation is very clear and unambiguous.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Figure A is plausible, with no obvious violation.\n    *   Figure B is the most likely candidate for the actual Delaunay triangulation.\n    *   Figure D is not a valid triangulation because its edges cross.\n    *   Figure C contains a textbook example of a non-Delaunay feature: a \"sliver\" triangle whose circumcircle is enormous and contains other points. Therefore, Figure C is the triangulation that violates the empty circle property.\n\n<<<C>>>"
