    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue and the image:**\n    *   The image depicts an awards ceremony. A man with a beard is receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man.\n    *   The date given is June 20, 2019. This points towards a specific, verifiable event.\n    *   A search for major award ceremonies around that date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019.\n    *   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. On that night, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the league's most valuable player, among other awards. The man presenting is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n    *   So, the picture shows Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards. This is the first \"X Y\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:**\n    *   \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This is a historical and chemical reference. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the 18th and 19th centuries to process fur into felt for making hats.\n    *   The workers in this trade, known as \"hatters,\" were exposed to mercury vapor, which caused severe neurological damage, including tremors and psychosis.\n    *   This condition gave rise to the well-known idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   Therefore, the \"X Y\" that has ceased to be used is the profession of a \"Mad Hatter\" who was literally driven mad by mercury.\n\n3.  **Connect the two clues:**\n    *   We have established that the second \"X Y\" is \"Mad Hatter\".\n    *   The puzzle states that the \"X Y\" in the picture and the mercury-related \"X Y\" share the same name.\n    *   We need to find a way to describe what's in the picture as a \"Mad Hatter.\"\n    *   Nikita Kucherov, the player pictured, had an exceptionally brilliant 2018-19 season. His skill level was so high that it could be described using superlatives like \"insane\" or \"mad.\"\n    *   In hockey, a player who scores three goals in a single game achieves a \"hat trick,\" which links him directly to the concept of \"hats.\"\n    *   Combining these two ideas, Nikita Kucherov can be described metaphorically as a \"Mad Hatter\": \"Mad\" for his incredible talent and \"Hatter\" for his connection to hat tricks.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The \"X Y\" pictured is Nikita Kucherov, who can be metaphorically called a **Mad Hatter**.\n    *   The \"other X Y\" is the historical **Mad Hatter**, a hat maker who suffered from mercury poisoning, a practice that has ceased.\n    *   The term \"Mad Hatter\" perfectly links both clues.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
