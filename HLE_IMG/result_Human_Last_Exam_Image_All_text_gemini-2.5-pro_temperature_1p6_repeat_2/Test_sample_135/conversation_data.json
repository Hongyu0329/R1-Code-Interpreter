    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's subject and composition.** The image shows a circular relief sculpture, also known as a tondo or roundel. The scene depicted is a religious one: a priest is administering a sacrament to a group of kneeling figures, starting with a child. Given the context of a priest at an altar giving something to be consumed, this is the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist (or Holy Communion).\n2.  **Examine the inscription.** Below the circular scene, there is a small plaque with text. The visible words are \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be interpreted as \"Sacrament of the Altar\" (from the Latin *Sacramentum* and Old French/Italian *autel/altare* for altar), which confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n3.  **Identify the artistic style and medium.** The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The medium, a high-relief sculpture with what appears to be a light-colored, possibly white, glaze, is a signature technique of the della Robbia family workshop from Florence. This workshop was famous for its glazed terracotta sculptures.\n4.  **Attribute the work to a specific artist.** The della Robbia workshop was active for several generations. The founder was Luca della Robbia, followed by his nephew Andrea della Robbia, and then Andrea's sons, most notably Giovanni della Robbia. The style of this particular roundel—with its slightly crowded composition and detailed narrative—is most consistent with the work of Giovanni della Robbia.\n5.  **Verify the specific artwork.** A search for works by Giovanni della Robbia depicting the sacraments leads to the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments,\" also known as the Fontanellato Altarpiece, created around 1514. This altarpiece consists of multiple panels and roundels, each showing one of the seven sacraments. The image provided is a precise match for the roundel representing the Eucharist from this specific altarpiece.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing the Artist:** While the glazed terracotta style is a hallmark of the della Robbia family, specific stylistic traits help attribute this piece to Giovanni. His work is often considered more complex and less serene than that of his predecessors, Luca and Andrea, which is visible in the busy composition here.\n*   **Reading the Inscription:** The mixed-language inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a key clue that directly points to the subject matter, \"The Sacrament of the Altar.\"\n*   **Identifying the Artwork:** Recognizing that this is a single part of a larger work (an altarpiece dedicated to all seven sacraments) is crucial for a complete and accurate identification.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the author of this relief is Giovanni della Robbia.\n\n<<<Giovanni della Robbia>>>"
