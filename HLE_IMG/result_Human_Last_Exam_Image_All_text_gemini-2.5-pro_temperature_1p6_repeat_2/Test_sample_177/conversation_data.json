    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** To calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by changing from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** The total miles traveled by vehicles. For this problem, it refers specifically to cars.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** To find the total VMT, we need to consider the proportion of trips in each distance category, the average distance of those trips, and the percentage of those trips made by car.\n*   **Car Modes:** There are two car modes listed: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". For VMT calculations, a trip by either mode is counted as one vehicle trip. Therefore, we must sum the mode shares of these two categories to get the total car mode share.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) are used for calculating Person Miles Traveled (PMT), not Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). This information should be ignored for this question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\nTo compare the two scenarios, we will calculate a VMT index, which is proportional to the total VMT. The formula for the VMT index is:\n`VMT Index = Σ [ (Share of total trips)ᵢ * (Average trip distance)ᵢ * (Total car mode share)ᵢ ]`\nwhere `i` represents each of the four distance categories.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\n1.  **VMT from 0-3 miles trips:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (or 0.48)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53% (or 0.53)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.48 * 1 * 0.53 = 0.2544`\n\n2.  **VMT from 3-5 miles trips:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (or 0.22)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.22 * 4 * 0.81 = 0.7128`\n\n3.  **VMT from 5-10 miles trips:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (or 0.14)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.14 * 7.5 * 0.85 = 0.8925`\n\n4.  **VMT from 10+ miles trips:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (or 0.16)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.16 * 20 * 0.89 = 2.848`\n\n5.  **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.848 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\nThe 'share of total trips' and 'Average trip distance' remain the same. Only the mode shares change.\n\n1.  **VMT from 0-3 miles trips:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.48 * 1 * 0.03 = 0.0144`\n\n2.  **VMT from 3-5 miles trips:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.22 * 4 * 0.27 = 0.2376`\n\n3.  **VMT from 5-10 miles trips:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.14 * 7.5 * 0.41 = 0.4305`\n\n4.  **VMT from 10+ miles trips:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n    *   VMT contribution = `0.16 * 20 * 0.49 = 1.568`\n\n5.  **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.568 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100%`\n\n*   `Percentage Reduction = ((VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline) * 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction = ((4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077) * 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction = 0.52195... * 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction ≈ 52.2%`\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
