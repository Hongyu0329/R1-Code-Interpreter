The result should be interpreted as negative or invalid. Although a Ct value of 30.8 was generated (which is below the assay cut-off of 40 cycles), the amplification curve lacks the characteristic sigmoidal shape required for a valid positive result. The slow, linear increase in fluorescence suggests that the signal is an artifact (like background drift or non-specific amplification) rather than true, specific amplification of the target DNA. Therefore, the result cannot be trusted as a positive.
