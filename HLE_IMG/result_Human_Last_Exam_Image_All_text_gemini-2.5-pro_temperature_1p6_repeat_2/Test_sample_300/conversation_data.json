    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks:\n\n**Row 1: Top**\n\n1.  **Artwork (Top-Left):** This is a Chinese ink and color painting depicting women from an ethnic minority group. The style features dynamic brushwork capturing movement and character, a hallmark of the artist **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**. His signature and seal are also typically placed in the upper right, and the style is unmistakably his.\n2.  **Artwork (Top-Middle):** This is a Chinese ink sketch of a landscape, likely a mountainside village. The style is characterized by its use of expressive, abstract, and structural lines to define forms, which is a signature technique of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He was known for his \"xie sheng\" (sketches from life) that broke down complex scenes into their linear essence.\n3.  **Artwork (Top-Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a powerful and fluid cursive script. The characters are from the poem \"Snow - to the tune of Qin Yuan Chun\" by Mao Zedong. The bold, uninhibited calligraphic style is that of the author himself, **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n\n**Row 2: Middle**\n\n4.  **Artwork (Middle-Left):** This is another example of cursive Chinese calligraphy. The elegant yet strong script is characteristic of the renowned 20th-century calligrapher **Yu Youren (于右任)**, who was a master of the cursive script.\n5.  **Artwork (Center):** This is a realist oil painting depicting a young woman in a white shirt, holding a sketchbook and pen, standing before a traditional painting. This is a very famous work of Chinese contemporary realism titled \"Girl Before a Still Life\" (静物前的姑娘) by the artist **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**.\n6.  **Artwork (Middle-Right):** This work is an ink and color painting of a woman with an elaborate hairstyle, possibly from an ethnic minority, surrounded by sparrows. The stylized, elongated face, melancholic expression, and fusion of Western modernism with Chinese ink painting techniques are iconic features of the artist **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**.\n\n**Row 3: Bottom**\n\n7.  **Artwork (Bottom-Left):** This is a colorful painting of a rural scene featuring loofah gourds hanging from a trellis, laundry, and chickens. The vibrant color palette, strong sense of design, folk-art inspiration, and use of calligraphic lines are all hallmarks of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, who frequently depicted scenes from his homeland.\n8.  **Artwork (Bottom-Middle):** This is a Chinese landscape painting (shanshui) of a dramatic river gorge with boats. The monumental composition, the use of dense, layered ink to create dark and heavy mountain forms, and the small, contrasting colored boats are characteristic of the master **Li Keran (李可染)**, famous for his depictions of the Yangtze River and other iconic Chinese landscapes.\n9.  **Artwork (Bottom-Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The simplicity of the composition, combined with the masterful, lively, and calligraphic brushstrokes that perfectly capture the essence and vitality of the creature, is the signature style of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, who was famous for his paintings of shrimp, crabs, and other small creatures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors of the works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Yu Youren, Yang Feiyun, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
