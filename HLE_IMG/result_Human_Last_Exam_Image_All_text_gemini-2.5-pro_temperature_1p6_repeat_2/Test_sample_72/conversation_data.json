    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is an aromatic compound.\n*   **Reactant 2:** The structure shown is cyclobutene (C₄H₆). Note: there appears to be a typo in the problem as the formula of cyclobutene is C₄H₆, not C₄H₄ as depicted in one of the crops showing it as a generic cycloalkene. We will proceed assuming the structure, cyclobutene, is the intended reactant.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` (light energy). This suggests that photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are likely to occur.\n*   **Problem Statement:** The question explicitly states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Product and Identify Inconsistencies**\n*   Let's analyze the molecular formula of the reactants and the product.\n    *   Reactants: C₆F₆ + C₄H₆. The expected product should have the formula C₁₀H₆F₆.\n    *   Product Drawn: Let's count the atoms in the drawn product structure. It is a linearly fused tricyclic system. It has 8 carbon atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 6 fluorine atoms. The formula is C₈H₄F₆.\n*   There is a clear mismatch between the molecular formula of the reactants (C₁₀H₆F₆) and the product (C₈H₄F₆). This indicates that the drawing of the product is incorrect for the given reactants, or one of the reactants is drawn incorrectly. Given the ambiguity, we should focus on the most chemically plausible reaction pathway for the stated reactants under the given conditions, as suggested by the hint of \"two pericyclic reactions\".\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Plausible Two-Step Pericyclic Reaction Mechanism**\nThe photochemistry of benzene and its derivatives is well-studied. A common photochemical reaction of benzene is its isomerization to valence isomers like Dewar benzene, prismane, or benzvalene. The most straightforward pathway that involves two pericyclic reactions starting from hexafluorobenzene is the Dewar benzene pathway.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Photochemical Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\n    *   The first step is the photochemical conversion of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   C₆F₆ (hexafluorobenzene) --(hν)--> C₆F₆ (hexafluoro-Dewar benzene)\n    *   This reaction is a classic example of a **valence isomerization**. It is a pericyclic reaction because it involves a concerted reorganization of electrons in a cyclic transition state.\n    *   From a mechanistic standpoint, this isomerization can be classified as an **intramolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition**, where two double bonds of the benzene ring (at the 1,4-positions) react with each other. This is a photochemically allowed process according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Photochemical Cycloaddition with Cyclobutene**\n    *   The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, is a strained molecule containing two double bonds. It is much more reactive than hexafluorobenzene.\n    *   This intermediate reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene, which is an alkene.\n    *   The most common photochemical reaction between two alkene systems is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** to form a four-membered ring.\n    *   C₆F₆ (hexafluoro-Dewar benzene) + C₄H₆ (cyclobutene) --(hν)--> C₁₀H₆F₆ (tricyclic adduct)\n    *   This reaction is an **intermolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition**. It is also a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Types of Pericyclic Reactions**\nBased on the most plausible mechanism for the reaction of hexafluorobenzene with an olefin under photochemical conditions, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n\n1.  A **valence isomerization** (specifically, an intramolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition).\n2.  An **intermolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n\nTherefore, the two kinds of pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are a valence isomerization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A valence isomerization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
