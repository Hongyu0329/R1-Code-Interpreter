    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Careful Observation:**\n    *   **Color:** Reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is full of small, visible holes, giving it a porous or spongy appearance. This is known as a vesicular texture. The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible.\n*   **Geological Interpretation:**\n    *   The vesicular texture indicates that the rock formed from lava that cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface, trapping escaping gas bubbles. This makes it an extrusive igneous rock.\n    *   The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron, which is common in mafic to intermediate lava.\n*   **Identification:** A highly vesicular, reddish-brown extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Careful Observation:**\n    *   **Composition:** This rock is clearly composed of many different smaller pieces, or clasts, cemented together. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Clast Shape:** The fragments are noticeably sharp and angular, not rounded.\n    *   **Clast and Matrix Type:** The clasts are varied in color and type, and are embedded in a finer-grained matrix. The overall appearance suggests volcanic rock fragments held within a matrix of volcanic ash.\n*   **Geological Interpretation:**\n    *   A rock made of cemented angular fragments is called a breccia.\n    *   When the fragments are products of a volcanic eruption (e.g., pieces of lava, older rock shattered by eruption) and are cemented by volcanic ash (tuff), the rock is a type of pyroclastic rock.\n*   **Identification:** Based on the angular, volcanic-looking fragments in an ash-like matrix, this rock is identified as a **Volcanic Breccia**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Careful Observation:**\n    *   **Color:** Very light, ranging from white to light gray.\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, this rock is highly vesicular. However, the pores seem finer and more numerous, giving it a frothy and glassy appearance. It appears to be very low in density.\n*   **Geological Interpretation:**\n    *   This is also an extrusive igneous rock formed from a rapid cooling of lava thick with gas.\n    *   The very light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n    *   The extremely high porosity and low density are characteristic of lava froth that solidified.\n*   **Identification:** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Careful Observation:**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed entirely of large, interlocked mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained, or phaneritic, texture. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n    *   **Composition:** A mix of minerals is visible. There are large, blocky, light-colored crystals (likely feldspar), and some darker minerals interspersed.\n*   **Geological Interpretation:**\n    *   The phaneritic texture indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals time to grow. This makes it an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   A rock with exceptionally large crystals (often defined as larger than 1 cm) is given a special textural name.\n*   **Identification:** A very coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock is identified as a **Pegmatite**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
