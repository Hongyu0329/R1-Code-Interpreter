The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A** is methyl 2-methyl-5-(2-hydroxy-pyrrolidin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylate. It is formed via the m√ºnchnone cycloaddition pathway followed by hydration of the imine group.

**Product B** is a tricyclic product, 10-carboxy-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrimidin-4-one. It is formed via the decarboxylative cycloaddition pathway followed by intramolecular cyclization and oxidation.

**Product C** is N-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, the N-acetylated derivative of the starting material.

A summary of the structures:
*   **Structure A:** A tetrahydropyrrolizine core with methyl, methoxycarbonyl, and 2-hydroxy-pyrrolidin-2-yl substituents.
*   **Structure B:** A complex, fused tricyclic lactam structure containing a carboxylic acid group.
*   **Structure C:** The starting material with an acetyl group on the pyrrolidine nitrogen.
