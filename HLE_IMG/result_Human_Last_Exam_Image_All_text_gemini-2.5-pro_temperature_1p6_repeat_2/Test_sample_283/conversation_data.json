    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country based on the Google Trends graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph's Axes and General Pattern**\n*   The x-axis represents time, from December 2019 to beyond May 2023.\n*   The y-axis represents relative search interest, with 100 being the peak popularity.\n*   There are three lines: red, blue, and yellow, each representing a different historic event.\n*   All three lines exhibit recurring peaks at approximately the same time each year. This strongly suggests that the \"historic events\" are annual commemorations or national holidays.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Red Line**\n*   **Observation:** The red line shows a significant, broad peak every year around late December and early January.\n*   **Interpretation:** This timing corresponds to New Year's celebrations. In many countries, this is a major holiday. This pattern is particularly pronounced in Russia, where New Year's Day (Novy God) is the biggest and most important holiday of the year, often celebrated more widely than Christmas.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Blue Line**\n*   **Observation:** The blue line has a consistent, smaller peak in early May of each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n*   **Interpretation:** This timing points directly to Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II. While many European countries mark VE Day on May 8th, Russia and many other former Soviet republics celebrate Victory Day on May 9th with massive parades and national pride. This is a very strong clue pointing towards Russia.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Yellow Line**\n*   **Observation:** The yellow line shows very sharp, distinct peaks at two different times of the year. One peak occurs in late February, and another, often higher, peak occurs in late June. There is an exceptionally high peak (reaching 100) after May 2023, which would align with the late June timing.\n*   **Interpretation:** We need to find two annual historic commemorations in the same country that fall in late February and late June. Considering Russia as our leading candidate:\n    *   **Late February:** February 23rd is \"Defender of the Fatherland Day\" in Russia. It's a major public holiday with strong historical and military significance, celebrating the armed forces.\n    *   **Late June:** June 22nd is the \"Day of Remembrance and Sorrow\" in Russia. This solemn day marks the anniversary of the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), which initiated what is known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War.\n*   The fact that there are annual search peaks on *both* of these dates for the same search term (likely a term related to military history or the Great Patriotic War) provides very strong confirmation.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   The combination of recurring search interest for these specific events is unique.\n    *   A major peak for New Year's celebrations (Red Line).\n    *   A consistent peak for Victory Day on May 9th (Blue Line).\n    *   Dual peaks for military/historical events on February 23rd (Defender of the Fatherland Day) and June 22nd (Day of Remembrance and Sorrow) (Yellow Line).\n*   This specific collection of commemorated historical dates points conclusively to a single country. A historian would immediately recognize this pattern as being characteristic of the modern Russian Federation's national calendar and historical consciousness.\n\nTherefore, the country is Russia.\n\n<<<Russia>>>"
