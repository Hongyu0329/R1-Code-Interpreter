    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements of the Icon:**\n    *   **Subject:** The icon portrays an elderly male figure with a long, pointed, white or light-colored beard and a bald or balding head with hair on the sides.\n    *   **Halo:** The figure has a gold-leaf halo around his head, signifying that he is a saint in the Christian tradition.\n    *   **Attire:** He is wearing dark, simple monastic robes, specifically a purple or deep red outer garment over a blue inner one. This indicates he is a monastic saint, an ascetic, or a Church Father who lived a monastic life.\n    *   **Attribute:** The saint is holding a large, unrolled scroll in his left hand. The scroll contains text written in a Cyrillic alphabet, specifically Church Slavonic, which is characteristic of Orthodox icons, particularly in Slavic countries. He holds another object, possibly the other end of the scroll or a separate, smaller scroll, in his right hand. The scroll signifies his role as a teacher, writer, or a figure known for his wisdom and spiritual teachings.\n\n2.  **Examine the Inscriptions:**\n    *   **Saint's Name:** In Orthodox iconography, the saint is almost always identified by an inscription near the halo. Looking closely at the crop images (especially crop_1_1 and crop_1_2), we can see faint text to the left and right of the halo.\n    *   To the left of the halo (viewer's left), one can discern Cyrillic letters that appear to spell out \"СЬIМЕѠНЪ\", which transliterates to \"SYMEON\" or Simeon.\n    *   **Text on the Scroll:** The text on the scroll is written in Church Slavonic. While a full translation is not necessary to identify the saint, its presence reinforces the idea that this is a teacher or a figure whose words were recorded.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Saint Anthony:** Saint Anthony the Great is a foundational figure of monasticism. He is depicted as an old monk with a long beard. However, the name inscription does not match \"Anthony\".\n    *   **B. Saint Macarius:** Similar to St. Anthony, he is a key Desert Father, depicted as an old monk. Again, the name does not match.\n    *   **C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov:** A later Russian saint, his iconography is typically different (more hunched, often with an ax or a bear). The name does not match.\n    *   **D. Moses the Prophet:** Moses is an Old Testament prophet. While he is depicted with a beard, his primary attribute is the Tablets of the Law (stone tablets), not a scroll. Also, he is usually depicted in Old Testament-style clothing, which can differ from these monastic robes. The name does not match.\n    *   **E. Saint Varlaam:** There are several saints named Varlaam. The most famous Russian one is Varlaam of Khutyn. While he is a monastic saint, the inscription points to Simeon.\n    *   **F. Saint Simeon Stylites:** The name \"Simeon\" (СЬIМЕѠНЪ) clearly matches the faint inscription on the icon. Saint Simeon Stylites (\"the pillar-dweller\") was a 5th-century Syrian ascetic saint who lived for 37 years on a small platform on top of a pillar. He is venerated as a monastic saint and depicted as an old man with a long beard, consistent with the image. Although he is most famously depicted *on* his pillar, standing portraits like this are also common within larger series of monastic saints in church decoration. This specific fresco is known to be from the Dečani Monastery in Kosovo and depicts St. Simeon Stylites.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of the visual depiction as a venerable monastic elder and, most importantly, the readable part of the inscription \"Simeon\" identifies the figure as Saint Simeon. Among the given options, the only one containing the name Simeon is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
