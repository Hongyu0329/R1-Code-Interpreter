    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Description**\n\n*   **\"illusion\"**: The phenomenon is a perceptual illusion, meaning there is a discrepancy between the physical stimulus and what is perceived.\n*   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D line drawing can be perceived in two different stable 3D orientations. This comparison suggests that the phenomenon in question involves the brain actively interpreting an ambiguous or incomplete stimulus, rather than passively receiving information. Perception is an active, constructive process.\n*   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This points to a fundamental mechanism of our sensory systems that operates automatically to make sense of the world. It suggests a form of \"filling-in\" or \"completion\" where the brain makes assumptions to create a coherent perception.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Image**\n\nThe image consists of two plots, which are common representations of sound.\n\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform)**: This shows the amplitude of a sound wave over time.\n    *   On the left, we see a clean, regular sine wave, which corresponds to a pure tone.\n    *   In the middle section, the regular wave is interrupted and replaced by a more complex, irregular, and seemingly random waveform. This represents a burst of noise.\n    *   On the right, the clean sine wave resumes.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The physical sound consists of a pure tone, followed by a burst of noise, followed by the same pure tone. The tone is *not* present during the noise.\n\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram)**: This shows the frequency content of the sound over time. Time is on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and intensity is shown by color (darker blue is more intense).\n    *   On the left and right, there is a single, sharp horizontal line. This confirms the presence of a pure tone with a single, constant frequency.\n    *   In the middle, this horizontal line disappears completely. Simultaneously, a vertical bar of color appears, spanning a wide range of frequencies. This confirms that the tone was physically removed and replaced by a broadband noise burst.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The spectrogram provides a clear visual confirmation of the physical stimulus: a tone is interrupted by noise.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Text and Image Analysis**\n\n*   We have a physical stimulus where a tone is stopped, replaced by noise, and then started again.\n*   The text describes an illusion involving the brain's \"unconscious perceptual ability\" to create a coherent perception from incomplete data.\n*   When this auditory stimulus is presented to a listener, the \"common perceptual ability\" is to perceive the tone as *continuous*, as if it were playing \"behind\" the burst of noise. The brain effectively \"fills in the gap\" where the tone was physically absent. It infers that the tone must have continued but was simply masked by the louder noise.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Phenomenon's Name**\n\n*   This specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceptually \"restored\" or perceived as continuous through an interrupting sound, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n*   It is a form of **perceptual restoration**, a broader term for when the brain fills in missing sensory information. The analogy to the Necker cube holds because in both cases, the brain is not a passive receiver but an active interpreter, constructing a perception that is more stable and plausible than the raw sensory input would suggest.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
