Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image. The white, fuzzy sphere on the twig is an insect gall, most likely an oak gall created by a gall wasp. The insect that caused this gall laid its egg inside the plant tissue of the oak twig. The gall then formed around the developing larva, providing it with food and shelter. The adult wasp that will eventually emerge from this gall will lay its eggs in the tissues (such as buds, leaves, or stems) of other oak trees.
