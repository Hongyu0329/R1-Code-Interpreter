    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify each mineral specimen based on its physical properties.**\n\n*   **Specimen A:** This is a dark green to black, stubby, prismatic crystal. It exhibits cleavage planes. Its crystal habit is characteristic of the pyroxene group of minerals, such as augite.\n*   **Specimen B:** This specimen is light green and has a platy or foliated appearance, easily separating into thin, flexible sheets. This perfect basal cleavage is the defining characteristic of the mica group or other sheet silicates like chlorite.\n*   **Specimen C:** This is an aggregate of small, glassy, olive-green crystals with a granular texture. This color and habit are classic for olivine.\n*   **Specimen D:** This is a translucent, brownish, glassy crystal with a hexagonal-like prism shape and conchoidal fracture patterns visible on its surfaces. These are characteristic properties of quartz, specifically the smoky quartz variety.\n\n**Step 2: Classify each identified mineral according to its silicate structure.**\n\nThe classification of silicate minerals is based on how the silica tetrahedra (a silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms, [SiO₄]⁴⁻) are linked together. This is known as the degree of polymerization.\n\n*   **Specimen C (Olivine):** Olivine belongs to the **nesosilicates**. In this structure, the silica tetrahedra are isolated and not linked to each other. They are bonded together by metal cations (like magnesium and iron). This is the simplest silicate structure.\n*   **Specimen A (Pyroxene):** Pyroxenes belong to the **inosilicates (single-chain)**. In this structure, each tetrahedron shares two of its oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra, forming a long single chain.\n*   **Specimen B (Mica/Chlorite):** Micas and chlorites belong to the **phyllosilicates (sheet silicates)**. In this structure, each tetrahedron shares three of its oxygen atoms with its neighbors, forming continuous two-dimensional sheets.\n*   **Specimen D (Quartz):** Quartz belongs to the **tectosilicates (framework silicates)**. In this structure, every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a complex three-dimensional framework. This is the most polymerized and most complex silicate structure.\n\n**Step 3: Order the specimens based on increasing complexity of their silicate structure.**\n\nThe complexity increases with the degree of polymerization (the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron).\n\n1.  **Least Complex:** Isolated tetrahedra (Nesosilicates). No shared oxygens between tetrahedra.\n    *   Specimen **C** (Olivine)\n2.  **More Complex:** Single-chain tetrahedra (Inosilicates). Each tetrahedron shares 2 oxygens.\n    *   Specimen **A** (Pyroxene)\n3.  **Even More Complex:** Sheet tetrahedra (Phyllosilicates). Each tetrahedron shares 3 oxygens.\n    *   Specimen **B** (Mica/Chlorite)\n4.  **Most Complex:** Framework tetrahedra (Tectosilicates). Each tetrahedron shares 4 oxygens.\n    *   Specimen **D** (Quartz)\n\n**Final Order:**\n\nThe order from least complex to most complex silicate structure is: Olivine -> Pyroxene -> Mica -> Quartz.\nThis corresponds to the specimen order: **C, A, B, D**.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
