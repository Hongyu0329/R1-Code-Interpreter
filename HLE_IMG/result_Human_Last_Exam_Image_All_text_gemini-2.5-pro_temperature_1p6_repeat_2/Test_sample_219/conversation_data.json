    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph and the task.**\nThe graph provided is a raster plot showing neuronal activity. The y-axis represents 128 different electrodes, and the x-axis represents time in seconds. Each black dot represents a spike (firing) of a neuron at a particular electrode. The task is to identify \"synchronized bursts,\" which are periods of high, coordinated firing across many electrodes, and then calculate the average time interval between these bursts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the synchronized bursts and their timestamps.**\nSynchronized bursts appear as dense vertical bands on the plot, indicating that many electrodes are firing in a short time window. We can identify five such bursts. To calculate the interval between them, we will estimate the central time point of each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** Occurs at the beginning of the recording. The center of this burst is at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** A very distinct burst is centered around **t₂ = 13 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The next burst is clearly centered at **t₃ = 23 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A subsequent burst is centered around **t₄ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final visible burst is centered around **t₅ = 47 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the five identified bursts are approximately 2 s, 13 s, 23 s, 35 s, and 47 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, so we can calculate four intervals.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (between Burst 2 and 1):** IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 13 s - 2 s = 11 s.\n*   **Interval 2 (between Burst 3 and 2):** IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 23 s - 13 s = 10 s.\n*   **Interval 3 (between Burst 4 and 3):** IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 35 s - 23 s = 12 s.\n*   **Interval 4 (between Burst 5 and 4):** IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 47 s - 35 s = 12 s.\n\nThe calculated intervals are 11 s, 10 s, 12 s, and 12 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.**\nTo find the average, we sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of intervals = 11 + 10 + 12 + 12 = 45 s.\n*   Number of intervals = 4.\n*   Average IBI = 45 s / 4 = 11.25 s.\n\n**Step 5: Round the answer to two significant figures.**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.25 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1. The third digit is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n*   Rounding 11.25 to two significant figures gives **11 s**.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 13 s, 23 s, 35 s, and 47 s. The average inter-burst interval is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
