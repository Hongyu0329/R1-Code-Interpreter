    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Let's break down its structure to count the atoms.\n*   **Core structure:** It is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-3-one system. This framework contains 6 carbons, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen, and has a C=C double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is attached to the double bond.\n    *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom. PMB is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n*   **Counting the atoms:**\n    *   **PMB group (C8H9O):** 1 carbon in CH2, 6 carbons in the benzene ring, 1 carbon in the OCH3 group (total 8 C). 2 hydrogens in CH2, 4 hydrogens on the ring, 3 hydrogens in OCH3 (total 9 H). 1 oxygen in OCH3.\n    *   **Rest of the molecule (C7H5F3NO):** Let's count the atoms in the bicyclic part with the CF3 group.\n        *   Carbons: 6 in the bicyclic ring + 1 in the CF3 group = 7 C.\n        *   Hydrogens on the ring: There are hydrogens at the two bridgeheads (C1, C4), one on the double bond (C6), and two on the C7 bridge. That's 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 H.\n        *   Fluorine: 3 F in the CF3 group.\n        *   Nitrogen: 1 N.\n        *   Oxygen: 1 O in the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** Summing the two parts (C8H9O + C7H5F3NO):\n        *   C: 8 + 7 = 15\n        *   H: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Formula: **C15H14F3NO2**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a chemical oxidant commonly used to deprotect PMB ethers and amines. In this case, it oxidatively cleaves the PMB group from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group (-C8H9O) is removed and replaced by a single hydrogen atom (H) on the nitrogen, forming a secondary lactam (N-H).\n*   **Change in formula:** We subtract the atoms of the PMB group and add one hydrogen atom. Net change: -C8H8O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Formula: **C7H6F3NO**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas is used to reduce double and triple bonds.\n*   **Transformation:** The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring of Intermediate 1 is reduced to a single bond (C-C). This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the double bond. Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) and CF3 group are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in formula:** We add H2.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   Formula: **C7H8F3NO**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Intermediate 2 is a lactam, which is a cyclic amide.\n*   **Transformation:** The amide bond within the lactam ring is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). This reaction opens the ring, converting the amide into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2).\n*   **Change in formula:** The net reaction is the addition of one molecule of water to Intermediate 2.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Final Formula: **C7H10F3NO2**\n    *   (Note: Although the product exists as an ammonium salt in the acidic solution, the molecular formula is conventionally written for the neutral form.)\n\nFinal check: The product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid. Let's verify the atom count for such a structure. The structure is an amino-trifluoromethyl-cyclopentane carboxylic acid.\n*   Carbons: 5 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CF3 = 7 C.\n*   Hydrogens: Let's assume the basic structure is C5H10. We replace H atoms with substituents. The structure has two CH2 groups and three CH groups in the ring, for a total of 7 H on the ring. The substituents -COOH, -NH2 add another 1+2=3 H. Total H is 7+3=10 H.\n*   Fluorines: 3 F.\n*   Nitrogen: 1 N.\n*   Oxygens: 2 O in the -COOH group.\nThe count matches the formula derived from the reaction steps.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
