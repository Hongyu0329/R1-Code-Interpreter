    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the musical measure provided.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the time signature of the musical measure shown. The time signature defines the number of beats in a measure and which note value constitutes one beat. Since the time signature is not explicitly written at the beginning of the staff (which is common after the first line of music), we must deduce it by adding up the rhythmic values of the notes within the measure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Bottom Staff (Left Hand)**\nThe easiest way to determine the time signature is often to look at the simpler part. In this case, the bottom staff (bass clef) is much simpler than the top staff.\n*   The bottom staff contains a single chord.\n*   The notehead for this chord is a hollow oval without a stem. This is the notation for a **whole note**.\n*   A whole note lasts for the entire duration of a measure in common time signatures.\n*   A whole note is equivalent in duration to four **quarter notes**.\n*   Therefore, the measure must contain four quarter notes' worth of time.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Top Staff (Right Hand) for Confirmation**\nAlthough the left hand provides a clear answer, we can confirm it by analyzing the more complex right-hand part. The notes in the right hand are grouped by beams, which helps to visualize the beats.\n*   **Beat 1:** We see a sixteenth-note chord, a sixteenth rest, another sixteenth-note chord, and another sixteenth rest. The total duration is (1/16 + 1/16) + (1/16 + 1/16) = 4/16, which simplifies to **1/4 note** (one quarter note).\n*   **Beat 2:** This beat has the exact same rhythmic pattern as Beat 1: a sixteenth chord, a sixteenth rest, a sixteenth chord, and a sixteenth rest. This also adds up to a **1/4 note**.\n*   **Beat 3:** This group consists of four sixteenth-note chords beamed together. The total duration is 4 * (1/16) = 4/16, which simplifies to a **1/4 note**.\n*   **Beat 4:** This is another group of four sixteenth-note chords beamed together, also adding up to a **1/4 note**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Rhythmic Analysis**\n*   The analysis of the bottom staff shows a total duration of one whole note, which is equal to four quarter notes.\n*   The analysis of the top staff shows four distinct beats, each lasting for one quarter note, for a total of four quarter notes.\n*   Both staves are consistent and show that the measure contains a total duration of four quarter notes.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Time Signature**\nA time signature with four beats per measure where the quarter note gets the beat is written as **4/4**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Answer Choices**\n*   A. 2/4 (two quarter notes per measure) - Incorrect.\n*   B. 3/4 (three quarter notes per measure) - Incorrect.\n*   C. 4/4 (four quarter notes per measure) - **Correct**.\n*   D. 3/8 (three eighth notes per measure) - Incorrect.\n*   E. 9/8 (nine eighth notes per measure) - Incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay attention to the type of notes (whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth) and rests.\n*   Use the beaming of the notes as a guide to group them into beats.\n*   When a measure has multiple staves (like in piano music), the total duration of notes in each staff for that measure must be the same.\n*   Always start with the simplest part to analyze first, as it can provide the answer more quickly and with less room for error. In this case, the whole note in the left hand was the clearest indicator.\n\n<<<C>>>"
