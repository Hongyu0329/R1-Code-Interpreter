**Product A:**
A saturated pyrrolizidine ring system (two fused 5-membered rings sharing a nitrogen atom). A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) is attached to the newly formed ring. The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with a group derived from the original amidine substituent by tautomerization and acetylation. Specifically, the substituent is a 2-(1-acetyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-ylidene) group.

**Product B:**
An aromatic pyrrolizine ring system (two fused 5-membered rings, one of which is a pyrrole, sharing a nitrogen atom). A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) is attached to the pyrrole ring. The bridgehead nitrogen atom is substituted with a 2-(1-oxido-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl) group, which is the N-oxide of the original cyclic amidine substituent.

**Product C:**
The mixed anhydride of the starting material. The structure is 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of the starting material has been converted to a mixed anhydride group (-C(=O)O-C(=O)CH3).
