    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Measure and Key Signature**\nFirst, we locate measure 30 in the score. It is the third measure in the second system of the provided image, highlighted by a circle. The first movement of the sonata is in the key of C minor. The key signature for C minor is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). The passage is part of the *Allegro* section, which is firmly established in C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes and Chord in Measure 30**\nWe need to collect all the pitches present in measure 30 to identify the chord.\n*   **Right Hand:** Plays a sixteenth-note arpeggio consisting of the notes D, G♯, B, and F.\n*   **Left Hand:** Plays a chord on the first beat (and repeats it) consisting of the notes G♯ and D.\n\nCombining all the notes from both hands, we get the pitch collection: **G♯, B, D, F**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Chord Quality**\nTo determine the chord quality, we stack the notes in thirds, starting from G♯ as the root:\n*   G♯ to B is a minor third.\n*   G♯ to D is a diminished fifth.\n*   G♯ to F is a diminished seventh.\nThis is a **G-sharp diminished seventh chord**, written as **G♯°7**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Harmonic Context**\nTo find the correct Roman numeral, we must understand the chord's function. This requires looking at the chord that follows it in measure 31.\n*   **Measure 31:** The right hand plays a G major triad (G-B-D), and the left hand plays a G octave. This is a **G major chord**.\n*   **Function of G major in C minor:** The G major chord is built on the fifth scale degree of C and is the **dominant** chord. Its Roman numeral is **V**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Relationship and Roman Numeral**\nThe G♯°7 chord in measure 30 resolves to the G major chord (V) in measure 31. We need to determine the functional relationship between them.\n*   Standard secondary dominants or leading-tone chords that resolve to V (G major) would be V/V (a D7 chord) or vii°7/V (an F♯°7 chord). The G♯°7 chord is neither of these.\n*   Instead, we analyze the voice leading and shared notes between the two chords:\n    *   The root of the G♯°7 chord, **G♯**, resolves down by a chromatic half-step to **G**, the root of the V chord.\n    *   The notes **B** and **D** are present in both chords. They are **common tones**.\n    *   The final note, **F**, resolves down to **E♭** (the third of the tonic chord) in measure 32.\n\nA diminished seventh chord that embellishes a following major or minor triad, whose root is a chromatic half-step above the root of the chord of resolution, and which shares notes with that chord, is called a **common-tone diminished seventh chord**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe G♯°7 chord in measure 30 functions as a common-tone diminished seventh chord that embellishes the following dominant (V) chord. The standard Roman numeral notation for this is **ct°⁷/V**.\n\n<<<ct°⁷/V>>>"
