    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the biological sexes for each pair of insects. The identification relies on common sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae, often with one more segment than females (13 vs. 12). In some groups, the tips of male antennae are curled or hooked.\n*   **Abdomen Tip:** A female's abdomen ends in a stinger (a modified ovipositor), making it appear more pointed. A male's abdomen is often blunter or may have visible claspers or unique spines.\n*   **Facial Markings:** Males in many species have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** Females (of non-parasitic bees) have specialized structures for carrying pollen, either dense hairs on the hind legs (scopae) or under the abdomen. The question specifies these taxa lack scopae on their legs. Males do not collect pollen.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\nThese bees are likely *Coelioxys*, commonly known as cuckoo-leaf-cutter bees. They are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As parasites, females do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The most telling feature is the abdomen, which tapers to a very sharp, cone-like point. This sharply pointed abdomen is characteristic of a **female** *Coelioxys*, used to pierce the host's nest cells to lay an egg.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen of this insect is not pointed. Instead, it terminates in multiple small spines or prongs. This multi-toothed abdominal tip is a defining characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\nThese are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they do not have scopae for collecting pollen.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The antennae appear relatively short and straight. The tip of the abdomen is visibly pointed, consistent with the presence of a stinger. These are features of a **female** paper wasp (a worker or a queen).\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The most definitive feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic trait of a **male** *Polistes* wasp. The abdomen also appears blunter than the insect on the left.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\nThese bees belong to a group that exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. They are likely long-horned bees (Tribe Eucerini) or leafcutter bees (Family Megachilidae). In either case, the sexing features are clear. Females in the Megachilidae family carry pollen on their abdomens, not their legs, which fits the prompt's description.\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that extend far back over its body. It also has a prominent pale yellow/white patch on its face (the clypeus). Both extremely long antennae and pale facial markings are characteristic features of a **male** in this group.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for its size. Its face is dark, lacking the pale patch seen on the male. These features, in contrast to the male, identify it as a **female**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair B: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair C: M, F -> **3**\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
