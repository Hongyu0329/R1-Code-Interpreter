    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the overall structure of the cation.**\nThe image shows a large coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) ion. The Iridium ion is coordinated by multiple ligands to form a six-coordinate, octahedral complex. The overall charge is +1.\nBased on common structures in iridium coordination chemistry, this complex can be identified as being composed of three distinct ligands:\n1.  A bidentate cyclometalating ligand made of rings A and B (a substituted phenylpyridine, or \"ppy\" type), which binds to Ir through the nitrogen of ring B and carbon C6 of ring A.\n2.  A second, similar bidentate cyclometalating ligand made of rings C and D.\n3.  A bidentate ligand made of rings E and F (a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine, or \"bpy\" type), which binds through the two nitrogen atoms.\nThis gives a structure of the type `[Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+`. The various phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) are substituents on these three main ligands.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the phenyl rings in the structure.**\nA phenyl ring is a C₆H₅ group (or substituted version). From the diagram, we can distinguish between phenyl rings (all-carbon aromatic rings) and pyridyl rings (aromatic rings containing a nitrogen atom).\n*   **Phenyl rings:** A, C, G, H, J, K, L.\n*   **Pyridyl rings:** B, D, E, F.\nThe question asks which of the phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 3: Define \"free rotation\".**\nFree rotation can occur around a single (sigma) bond. However, this rotation can be restricted or prevented by two main factors in a molecule like this:\n1.  **Being part of a rigid, chelating structure:** If a ring is part of a ligand that binds to the metal at two or more points (chelation), its position and orientation are locked.\n2.  **Steric Hindrance:** If bulky groups are positioned close to the rotating bond, they can physically block the rotation. This is particularly important for groups in the *ortho* position (adjacent to the connecting bond).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the rotational freedom of each phenyl ring.**\n\n*   **Rings A and C:** These are the phenyl parts of the two cyclometalating ppy-type ligands. Ring A is bound to the iridium via the C6-Ir bond and is also connected to ring B, which is also bound to the iridium. Ring C is similarly locked. Because they are part of a rigid chelate ring system, **rings A and C cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These are pendant phenyl rings. Let's determine their points of attachment. They are drawn very close to the C5 position of rings A and C, respectively. The C5 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the C6 position where the iridium is attached. A phenyl group at this position would be extremely close to the bulky metal center and the other ligands coordinated to it. This would cause severe steric hindrance. Therefore, **rings K and L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** Ring H is attached to C4 of phenyl ring A. Ring J is attached to C4 of phenyl ring C. Let's look at the neighbors of the bond connecting H to A. The C3 position of ring A is substituted with the entire pyridyl ring B. This means ring H has a very bulky pyridyl group in its *ortho* position. Rotation of biaryl systems is known to be highly hindered by bulky ortho substituents. The same logic applies to ring J, which has the pyridyl ring D as an ortho substituent. Due to this significant steric hindrance from a large ortho group, **rings H and J cannot rotate freely.** Their rotation would have a very high energy barrier.\n\n*   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to C6 of the pyridyl ring F. Ring F is part of the bipyridine ligand. Let's examine the local environment of the rotating bond. The neighbors to C6 on ring F are the nitrogen atom at position 1 (N1) and the C-H group at position 5 (C5). An in-ring nitrogen atom is not a very bulky ortho substituent (its lone pair of electrons creates less steric repulsion than a C-H bond). The C5-H group is also small. Therefore, the *intrinsic* barrier for rotation of ring G is low, similar to that in 2-phenylpyridine. While there is general crowding around the metal center (extrinsic hindrance), the lack of a large, specific ortho-substituent makes ring G the most likely candidate for free rotation compared to H, J, K, and L, which all face severe, direct steric clashes.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nBased on the analysis of steric hindrance, particularly from ortho substituents:\n*   A, C: Locked by chelation.\n*   K, L: Locked by extreme steric hindrance (ortho to metalation site).\n*   H, J: Locked by a large ortho pyridyl group.\n*   G: Has the least steric hindrance locally, with no bulky ortho substituents, making it the most likely to rotate freely.\n\nTherefore, the only phenyl ring that can be considered to rotate freely is G.\n\n<<<K>>>"
