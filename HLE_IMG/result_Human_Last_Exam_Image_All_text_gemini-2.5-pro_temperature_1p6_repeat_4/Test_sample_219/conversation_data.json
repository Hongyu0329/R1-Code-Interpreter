    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided raster plot.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, a common way to visualize neuronal activity.\n*   The **x-axis** represents **Time in seconds (s)**, ranging from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, ranging from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a different recording site (neuron or small group of neurons).\n*   Each **black dot** represents a neuronal firing event (an action potential or \"spike\").\n*   A **\"synchronized burst\"** is a period where many neurons across different electrodes fire in a coordinated and intense manner. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands on the plot.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nWe need to carefully inspect the graph to find the temporal center of each distinct synchronized burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** There is a clear, dense burst of activity occurring before the 10-second mark. It appears to be centered at approximately **4 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 2:** Another distinct burst occurs between 10 and 20 seconds. Its center is located right at the midpoint, which is **15 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A less intense, but still clearly synchronized, burst occurs between 20 and 30 seconds. It seems to be centered slightly before the 25-second mark, at approximately **24 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A very strong and prolonged burst is visible between 30 and 40 seconds. Its center appears to be just past the midpoint (35 s), at approximately **36 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 5:** A final burst is seen at the end of the recording, just before the 50-second mark. It is centered at approximately **49 seconds**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the five identified bursts are approximately: 4 s, 15 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, so we can calculate four intervals.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 15 s - 4 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 24 s - 15 s = **9 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nNow, we calculate the average of the four intervals.\n\n*   Sum of intervals = 11 s + 9 s + 12 s + 13 s = 45 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of intervals) / (Number of intervals) = 45 s / 4 = 11.25 s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.25 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n*   The next digit is '2', which is less than 5, so we do not round up the preceding digit.\n*   Therefore, the average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is **11 s**.\n\n<<<11>>>"
