    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the constitutional structure.**\nFirst, we need to correctly interpret the given skeletal structure. The zig-zag line represents the main carbon chain. The vertices and ends of lines are carbon atoms unless another atomic symbol is written. Wedged bonds come out of the page, and dashed bonds go into the page.\n\nLet's trace the structure and identify the chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). We will number the carbons according to IUPAC nomenclature rules for unambiguous identification. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH) as it has higher priority than the amine (-NH2). We number the longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon such that the C-OH gets the lowest possible number.\n\nThe longest chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is a 5-carbon chain. Let's number it from left to right to give the -OH group the number 2.\n- **C1**: The methyl group on the far left.\n- **C2**: The first chiral center, bonded to the C1-methyl group, an -OH group, a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the chain (C3).\n- **C3**: The second chiral center, bonded to C2, C4, an ethyl group, and a hydrogen atom (implied).\n- **C4**: The third chiral center, bonded to C3, a methyl group, a hydrogen atom (implied), and a -CH2NH2 group (at C5).\n- **C5**: The carbon atom of the -CH2NH2 group.\n\nThis numbering gives the IUPAC name **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4. We will now determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of these centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C2.**\n- **Substituents on C2**:\n    1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the rest of the chain, attached at C3)\n    3.  -CH3 (the methyl group at C1)\n    4.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n- **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  -OH (Priority 1: Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)... (Priority 2: Carbon attached to other carbons)\n    3.  -CH3 (Priority 3: Carbon attached only to hydrogens)\n    4.  -H (Priority 4: Hydrogen, Z=1)\n- **Determine Stereochemistry**:\n    - The drawing shows the bond to -OH as dashed (going in) and the bond to the -CH3 group as wedged (coming out).\n    - The C2-C3 bond is in the plane of the paper. For a tetrahedral carbon, the fourth substituent (-H) must also be in the plane of the paper.\n    - To assign R/S, we position the molecule so the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) is pointing away from the viewer. A convenient method is to swap the lowest priority group with the group that is already pointing away.\n    - Currently, no group is pointing directly away. Let's swap the H (priority 4) with the OH (priority 1), which is on a dashed bond.\n    - In the *new*, swapped arrangement, H is dashed (away). The OH group is now in the plane. The C3 group is in the plane, and the CH3 group is wedged (forward).\n    - Now, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 in this swapped molecule: -OH (1, plane) → C3-chain (2, plane) → -CH3 (3, wedge/front).\n    - This path (left → right → front) describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    - So, the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    - Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite. Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C3.**\n- **Substituents on C3**:\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (the group at C2)\n    2.  -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the group at C4)\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    4.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n- **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  -C2H(OH)CH3 (Priority 1: The carbon C2 is bonded to an oxygen).\n    2.  -C4H(Me)CH2NH2 (Priority 2: The carbon C4 is bonded to two carbons, while the ethyl carbon is bonded to one carbon).\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (Priority 3)\n    4.  -H (Priority 4)\n- **Determine Stereochemistry**:\n    - The drawing shows the bond to the ethyl group as wedged (out). This implies the bond to the implied hydrogen (-H) is dashed (in).\n    - Since the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration by tracing the path from 1 to 2 to 3.\n    - Path: C2-group (1, up-left) → C4-group (2, down-right) → Ethyl group (3, front/wedge).\n    - This path describes a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    - Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C4.**\n- **Substituents on C4**:\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl group, attached at C5)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)C2H(OH)CH3 (the rest of the chain, attached at C3)\n    3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n    4.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n- **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (Priority 1: The carbon C5 is bonded to a nitrogen, Z=7, which is higher than carbon, Z=6).\n    2.  -C3H(Et)... (Priority 2: Carbon bonded to other carbons).\n    3.  -CH3 (Priority 3: Carbon bonded only to hydrogens).\n    4.  -H (Priority 4).\n- **Determine Stereochemistry**:\n    - The drawing shows the bond to the -CH3 group as dashed (in). This implies the bond to the implied hydrogen (-H) is wedged (out).\n    - The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing towards the viewer. We trace the path 1→2→3 and then reverse the result.\n    - Path: C5(-CH2NH2)-group (1, down-right) → C3-group (2, up-left) → -CH3 group (3, back/dash).\n    - This path describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    - Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment. CCW normally means S, so the configuration is **R**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results.**\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are:\n- C2 is R\n- C3 is R\n- C4 is R\n\nSo, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
