    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Image Analysis:** The image shows a younger man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man on a stage. They are dressed in formal suits. This is clearly an awards ceremony.\n*   **Identifying the Event and People:** A search for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, combined with the appearance of the individuals and the trophy, leads to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n    *   The younger man is Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n    *   The older man is Gary Bettman, the Commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n    *   On that night, Kucherov won several major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), which is the trophy seen in the picture.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The context is professional ice hockey. The person pictured is a famous hockey player. Therefore, \"X Y\" must be a term strongly associated with hockey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Analysis:** This clue points to a historical or industrial process that involved mercury compounds (salts) and is now obsolete because of health risks.\n*   **Connecting to Mercury Toxicity:** The most famous historical case of industrial mercury poisoning is among felt hat makers. The process, called \"carroting,\" used mercuric nitrate to separate fur from the skin and mat the fibers together to make felt. Workers, known as \"hatters,\" often suffered from neurological damage (a condition called erethism), leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\" This \"trick\" of the trade is no longer used.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need a two-word phrase, \"X Y\", that connects the world of hockey (from Step 1) with the historical use of mercury in hat-making (from Step 2).\n*   The term that perfectly bridges this gap is \"Hat Trick\".\n*   **Hockey Connection:** In hockey (and other sports), a \"hat trick\" is a celebrated achievement where a single player scores three goals in one game. The player pictured, Nikita Kucherov, is a prolific goal scorer famous for achieving this feat. The term is central to the sport being celebrated in the image.\n*   **Mercury/Hat-making Connection:** The term \"hat trick\" is believed to have originated in the sport of cricket, where a bowler who took three consecutive wickets was rewarded with a new hat. The \"trick\" of making these hats involved the toxic mercury process. Therefore, the \"hatter's trick\" (a method for making hats) that used mercury has ceased, fitting the second clue perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"X Y\" refers to \"Hat Trick\". It is represented in the picture by the context of hockey excellence, and its other meaning relates to the obsolete, toxic process of hat-making with mercury salts.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
