Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The most prominent evidence is the large, white, fuzzy object on the twig, which is an insect gall. A gall is a structure created by the plant in response to an insect laying its eggs. In this case, a female insect, likely a gall wasp, laid her egg(s) **inside the twig**. The gall then grew around the larva to provide food and shelter. The image also shows a separate cluster of insect eggs laid on the **surface of one of the leaves**.
