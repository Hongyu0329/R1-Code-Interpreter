    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the organisms in the image:** The photograph shows a typical rocky intertidal zone community. We can clearly identify several types of organisms:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, white-and-brown crustaceans are attached to the rock surface. These are acorn barnacles.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two distinct types of snails.\n        *   Two larger snails with conical shells. The upper one has a brownish shell with faint spiral stripes. The lower one is whiter and appears more worn.\n        *   At least two smaller, dark snails with more pronounced ridges on their shells.\n    *   **Other organisms:** Tiny, grayish dots are scattered on the rock, which are likely very young barnacles (spat) or another type of small snail.\n\n2.  **Identify the species to determine geographic location:** The question asks for a species that is found on the Atlantic coast but *not* the Pacific coast. This requires identifying the organisms to the species level and then checking their known geographical distribution.\n\n3.  **Identify the large snail:** The larger, striped snail is the most conspicuous and identifiable gastropod. Its shape—a solid, conical shell with a relatively high spire—and faint spiral banding are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**. The scientific name for this species is ***Littorina littorea***.\n\n4.  **Check the distribution of *Littorina littorea***: This species is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (i.e., Europe). It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the 19th century and has since become one of the most common and widespread intertidal snails from Canada to Maryland. Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not found on the Pacific Coast** of North America.\n\n5.  **Evaluate other species as potential indicators:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** The barnacles in the photo resemble the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is also native to the North Atlantic and not the Pacific. So, it would also be a valid indicator.\n    *   **Other Snails:** The smaller dark snails could be Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*), and the lower large snail could be a Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*). Both of these are also primarily Atlantic species.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the definitive species:** While several species in the photo are likely restricted to the Atlantic, the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is clearly visible, easily identifiable from its distinct morphology, and its distribution is well-documented as being exclusive to the Atlantic Ocean (in the context of the Americas). Its presence is therefore a definitive indicator that the photograph was taken on an Atlantic, rather than a Pacific, coast.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between similar species:** It's important to be confident in the species identification. The shell shape of the common periwinkle is quite distinctive compared to Pacific coast look-alikes.\n*   **Introduced vs. Native ranges:** *Littorina littorea* is introduced to North America, but its established range is entirely within the Atlantic. The question doesn't specify native species, only a species that indicates the location.\n*   **Clarity of the image:** The top snail is clear enough for a confident identification of *Littorina littorea*. The other organisms, while likely also Atlantic-specific, might be slightly more ambiguous to identify with 100% certainty from this photo alone. Thus, *Littorina littorea* is the strongest candidate for a definitive answer.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
