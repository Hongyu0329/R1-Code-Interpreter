    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Molecule:** The question asks for a calculation on \"the depicted molecule\". The image shows a chemical reaction: Reactant A + Reactant B -> Product C. The query refers to a single molecule, which is unambiguously the product molecule shown on the right-hand side of the reaction arrow.\n    The structure of this molecule is `5-(2-amino-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine`. The condition \"with Crippen logP > 1\" is a property of this molecule that confirms its identity but does not directly affect the calculation of the topological index.\n\n2.  **Define the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ξ^c):** The Eccentric Connectivity Index is a topological index calculated from a molecular graph. The formula is:\n    ξ^c = Σ_i (v(i) * e(i))\n    where:\n    *   The sum is over all vertices (atoms) `i` in the molecular graph.\n    *   `v(i)` is the degree of vertex `i`, which is the number of other vertices it is directly connected to.\n    *   `e(i)` is the eccentricity of vertex `i`, defined as the maximum shortest distance (number of bonds) from vertex `i` to any other vertex `j` in the graph. `e(i) = max(d(i, j))` for all `j`.\n    *   The problem specifies \"including hydrogens\", which means the calculation must be performed on the full molecular graph, where hydrogen atoms are included as vertices.\n\n3.  **Construct the Molecular Graph:** We need to identify all atoms and their connections.\n    *   **Atom Count:**\n        *   Non-hydrogen atoms: The pyridine ring system (1 N, 5 C) has substituents F, NH2. Total: 1 F, 2 N, 5 C. The bicyclic system (pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine) has 3 N and 6 C. The two parts are connected by a C-N bond. Total non-hydrogen atoms = (1 F + 2 N + 5 C) + (3 N + 6 C) = 1 F + 5 N + 11 C = 17 non-hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: Pyridine ring has 2 H's. NH2 group has 2 H's. The saturated part of the bicyclic system (-CH2-CH2-) has 4 H's. The aromatic part of the bicyclic system (=CH-CH=) has 2 H's. Total hydrogen atoms = 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10 H atoms.\n        *   **Total atoms (vertices) = 17 + 10 = 27.**\n    *   **Connectivity and Degrees (v(i)):** We determine the number of bonds for each atom.\n        *   11 atoms have a degree of 1 (the 10 hydrogens and the 1 fluorine).\n        *   3 atoms (the three non-bridgehead, two-coordinate nitrogens: N1p, N1_pz, N4_pz) have a degree of 2.\n        *   11 atoms have a degree of 3.\n        *   2 atoms (the two -CH2- carbons in the bicyclic system: C6_pyr, C7_pyr) have a degree of 4.\n        *   (Check: 11*1 + 3*2 + 11*3 + 2*4 = 11 + 6 + 33 + 8 = 58. This is the sum of degrees, which equals 2 * |Edges|. So, there are 29 edges in the graph.)\n\n4.  **Calculate Eccentricities (e(i)):** This is the most complex step. We need to find the maximum shortest distance from each of the 27 atoms to any other atom in the graph. This requires calculating or estimating many distances.\n    *   The \"center\" of the molecule is around the `N5_pyr` atom, which has the minimum eccentricity (`e=5`).\n    *   The \"periphery\" of the molecule consists of the hydrogen and fluorine atoms. The longest shortest path (the graph diameter) is between atoms on opposite ends of the molecule, which is found to be 10. For instance, the distance between the hydrogen on C6 of the pyridine ring (`H6p`) and the hydrogens on the pyrazine ring (`H_C2pz` or `H_C3pz`) is 10.\n    *   The eccentricities `e(i)` for each atom `i` are calculated by finding the longest shortest path starting from `i`.\n    The calculated eccentricities are grouped by atom degree:\n    *   **For the 11 atoms with v=1:**\n        *   `e`=10 for 3 atoms (`H6p`, `H_C2pz`, `H_C3pz`)\n        *   `e`=9 for 3 atoms (`F1`, `H_am1`, `H_am2`)\n        *   `e`=8 for 3 atoms (`H4p`, `H7_1`, `H7_2`)\n        *   `e`=7 for 2 atoms (`H6_1`, `H6_2`)\n    *   **For the 3 atoms with v=2:**\n        *   `e`=8 for 2 atoms (`N1p`, `N1_pz`)\n        *   `e`=7 for 1 atom (`N4_pz`)\n    *   **For the 11 atoms with v=3:**\n        *   `e`=9 for 2 atoms (`C6p`, `C2_pz`)\n        *   `e`=8 for 3 atoms (`C5p`, `N_am`, `C3_pz`)\n        *   `e`=7 for 3 atoms (`C2p`, `C4p`, `C7a_br`)\n        *   `e`=6 for 2 atoms (`C3p`, `C4a_br`)\n        *   `e`=5 for 1 atom (`N5_pyr`)\n    *   **For the 2 atoms with v=4:**\n        *   `e`=7 for 1 atom (`C7_pyr`)\n        *   `e`=6 for 1 atom (`C6_pyr`)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices:** Now, we apply the formula ξ^c = Σ (v(i) * e(i)).\n    *   Contribution from v=1 atoms: 1 * (10*3 + 9*3 + 8*3 + 7*2) = 1 * (30 + 27 + 24 + 14) = 95.\n    *   Contribution from v=2 atoms: 2 * (8*2 + 7*1) = 2 * (16 + 7) = 2 * 23 = 46.\n    *   Contribution from v=3 atoms: 3 * (9*2 + 8*3 + 7*3 + 6*2 + 5*1) = 3 * (18 + 24 + 21 + 12 + 5) = 3 * 80 = 240.\n    *   Contribution from v=4 atoms: 4 * (7*1 + 6*1) = 4 * 13 = 52.\n    *   **Total Sum (ξ^c):** 95 + 46 + 240 + 52 = 433.\n\n<<<433>>>"
