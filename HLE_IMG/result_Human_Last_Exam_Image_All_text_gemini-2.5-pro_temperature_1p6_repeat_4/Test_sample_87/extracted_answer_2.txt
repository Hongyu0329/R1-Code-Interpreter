The structures of the three products are:
**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A is the [3+2] cycloaddition product formed from the azomethine ylide (generated by decarboxylation of the N-acetylated starting material C) and methyl propiolate. The structure is a dihydropyrrolizine derivative.

*Structure depicted*: a schematic of methyl 4-acetyl-3-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3-dihydropyrrolizine-1-carboxylate. A 5,5-fused ring system (pyrrolizine core) with an acetyl group on the nitrogen. On one ring, a double bond, a methoxycarbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. On the other ring, a hydrogen and the (4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl) group.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
C is the N-acetylated starting material.

*Structure depicted*: A pyrrolidine ring with an acetyl group on the nitrogen. At C2, there is a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a 4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl substituent.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
B is a complex cyclization product. It is likely a tricyclic lactam formed from an intramolecular reaction cascade.

*Structure depicted*: a fused tricyclic system resulting from cyclization involving the proline part, the acetyl group and the pyrroline ring. This structure is a plausible candidate matching the molecular formula and high degree of unsaturation.
