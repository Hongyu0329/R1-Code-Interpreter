    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the question:** The goal is to identify which of the four images (A, B, C, or D) shows the atomic arrangement of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. The images are 3D representations of a small volume of the crystal, and we are looking at them as a 2D projection onto the plane of the image (the X-Z plane).\n\n2.  **Characterize the FCC [110] projection:**\n    *   A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of its 6 faces.\n    *   The [110] direction in a cubic system is the direction along a face diagonal.\n    *   When we view a crystal lattice along a specific direction, we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction.\n    *   It is a well-established result in crystallography that the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction forms a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   This means the repeating unit of the 2D projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom at its exact center.\n\n3.  **Analyze each image by projecting the atoms onto the X-Z plane:** We will examine the coordinates of the atoms in each image to see if their projection onto the X-Z plane (ignoring the y-coordinate, which represents depth) matches the centered rectangular pattern.\n\n    *   **Image A:**\n        *   Let's identify the projected (x, z) coordinates of the atoms. We have atoms near `x=1.5` and `x=4`. We have atoms near `z=6.5`, `z=9`, and `z=12.5`.\n        *   We can identify four atoms forming a rectangle in the projection: `(1.5, 6.5)`, `(4, 6.5)`, `(1.5, 12.5)`, and `(4, 12.5)`.\n        *   The center of this rectangle would be at `x = (1.5+4)/2 = 2.75` and `z = (6.5+12.5)/2 = 9.5`.\n        *   However, the other two atoms are located at `(1.5, 9)` and `(4, 9)`, which are on the vertical edges of the rectangle, not at its center. This pattern (a rectangle with atoms on the center of two opposite sides) is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along [110], not FCC. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:**\n        *   Projecting the atoms onto the X-Z plane gives points at approximately: `(1, 3)`, `(9, 3)`, `(5, 5)`, `(3, 7)`, `(7, 7)`, `(1, 9)`, and `(9, 9)`.\n        *   We can see a rectangle formed by the points `(1, 3)`, `(9, 3)`, `(1, 9)`, and `(9, 9)`.\n        *   The center of this rectangle is at `x = (1+9)/2 = 5` and `z = (3+9)/2 = 6`.\n        *   There is no atom at the center `(5, 6)`. The atom at `(5,5)` is close, but the overall pattern does not clearly represent a centered rectangle. Thus, B is unlikely to be correct.\n\n    *   **Image C:**\n        *   The projected atoms form two distinct rectangular grids that are offset from each other. For example, one rectangle could be defined by `(1,7), (7,7), (1,14), (7,14)`. Another by `(4,12), (10,12), (4,18), (10,18)`.\n        *   Neither of these rectangles has an atom at its center. This pattern does not match the centered rectangular lattice of an FCC [110] view. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image D:**\n        *   Let's identify the projected (x, z) coordinates.\n        *   We can clearly identify a group of five atoms that form a centered rectangle. The four corner atoms are at approximately: `(1, 6.5)`, `(5, 6.5)`, `(1, 12.5)`, and `(5, 12.5)`.\n        *   Let's calculate the center of this rectangle: `x = (1+5)/2 = 3`, `z = (6.5+12.5)/2 = 9.5`.\n        *   There is an atom located exactly at this center position `(3, 9.5)`.\n        *   This arrangement perfectly matches the definition of a centered rectangular lattice unit cell. The other atoms visible in image D belong to adjacent repeating units of this pattern.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Image D is the only one that displays the characteristic centered rectangular pattern of an FCC crystal lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
