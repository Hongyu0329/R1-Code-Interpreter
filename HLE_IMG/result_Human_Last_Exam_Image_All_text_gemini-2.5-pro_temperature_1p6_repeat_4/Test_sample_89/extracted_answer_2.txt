The structures of the three products are:

**Product A**: A substituted tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyridine, specifically methyl 2-(3-acetamidopropyl)-1,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxylate. Its structure consists of a five-membered pyrrole ring fused to a six-membered tetrahydropyridine ring, with a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. The pyrrole ring is substituted with a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃) and a 3-acetamidopropyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂NHCOCH₃).
 

**Product B**: Succinimide. This is a five-membered ring containing an imide functional group (-CO-NH-CO-). Its structure is a saturated five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen atom.
 

**Product C**: Succinimide. According to the reaction description, product C is identical to product B.
