    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). \"Shorter lifetime\" in this context refers to lower operational stability, meaning the device using these emitters would degrade faster.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III) is the central metal ion in all four complexes.\n    *   **Counterion:** PF6- is the counterion for all four, a non-coordinating anion.\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** This is the bidentate neutral ligand. In all four complexes, it is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (`dtbpy`). Since this ligand is identical in all complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their stability. The bulky tert-butyl groups are generally added to improve solubility and reduce intermolecular quenching, which are beneficial for performance.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** These are the bidentate, monoanionic cyclometalating ligands. The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of these C^N ligands.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligands are two unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) ligands. There are no fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 2:** This is a heteroleptic complex with respect to the C^N ligands. It has one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) ligand and one 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`F2ppy`) ligand.\n        *   **Complex 1:** This is a homoleptic complex with two 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`F2ppy`) ligands. Each ligand has two fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 4:** This is a homoleptic complex with two heavily fluorinated ligands, specifically 2-(2',4',5'-trifluorophenyl)pyridine (`F3ppy`). Each ligand has three fluorine atoms.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime (Stability):** The operational lifetime of an LEC is primarily determined by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter complex. A common degradation pathway for cyclometalated iridium complexes involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, which is often the weakest point in the molecule.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Introducing fluorine atoms onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand has several beneficial effects on stability:\n        1.  **Bond Strengthening:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing atom. By withdrawing electron density from the phenyl ring, it strengthens the covalent Ir-C bond, making it more resistant to cleavage.\n        2.  **Increased Oxidation Potential:** The electron-withdrawing effect lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is typically located on the iridium and the phenyl ring. A lower HOMO energy means the complex is more difficult to oxidize, making it more stable against oxidative degradation during device operation.\n        3.  **Steric Protection:** Fluorine atoms placed at the ortho-position (the 2'-position, adjacent to the Ir-C bond) provide steric hindrance. This \"shields\" the reactive Ir-C bond from attack by external species like water, which can be a source of degradation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate and Rank the Complexes:** Based on the principles above, stability increases with the degree of fluorination of the C^N ligands.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Contains two `ppy` ligands. It has zero fluorine atoms. The Ir-C bonds are the weakest and have no steric protection from fluorine. This complex is expected to be the *least stable* and have the *shortest lifetime*.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Contains one `ppy` ligand and one `F2ppy` ligand. It has one \"weak link\" â€“ the `ppy` ligand with its weaker, unshielded Ir-C bond. Therefore, it is expected to be more stable than Complex 3 but less stable than complexes where all C^N ligands are fluorinated. It will have a relatively *short lifetime*.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Contains two `F2ppy` ligands. Both Ir-C bonds are strengthened and sterically shielded by the fluorine atoms. This complex is expected to be significantly more stable than complexes 2 and 3, leading to a *longer lifetime*.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Contains two `F3ppy` ligands. This is the most heavily fluorinated complex. The combination of electronic stabilization and steric protection is maximized, making this complex the *most stable* and predicting the *longest lifetime*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are those that are less stable due to a lack of fluorination on their C^N ligands. These are the complexes that contain the unsubstituted `ppy` ligand.\n    *   Complex [3] has two `ppy` ligands.\n    *   Complex [2] has one `ppy` ligand.\n    *   Therefore, Complexes [2] and [3] are the ones expected to have shorter lifetimes compared to [1] and [4].\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer:** The question asks for the complexes with shorter lifetimes. Our analysis identifies Complex [2] and Complex [3]. The answer choice corresponding to this pair is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
