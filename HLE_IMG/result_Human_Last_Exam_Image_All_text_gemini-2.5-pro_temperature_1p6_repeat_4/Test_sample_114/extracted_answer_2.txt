The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of the Münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. The fused five-membered ring creates a sterically hindered environment that directs the incoming methyl propiolate to add in a specific orientation, leading to a single regioisomeric product.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial to this rationale by providing a contrasting case. Reaction 1 shows that the cycloaddition itself is also regioselective for the acyclic system, producing a single product (Product A). However, Reaction 2's isotope labeling experiment reveals that the acyclic Münchnone intermediate undergoes a rearrangement that scrambles the positions of its C2 and C4 methyl groups. This scrambling is possible because the precursor is conformationally flexible and the C2/C4 substituents are sterically similar (both methyl groups). This rearrangement is not possible for the rigid proline-derived intermediate in Reaction 3. Therefore, the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of its conformational rigidity, which prevents the kind of substituent scrambling observed with the flexible system and enforces a single, sterically-controlled reaction pathway.
