    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the question and identify key information.**\n    *   The subject is a **sequence of erasure poems**. Erasure poetry creates new text by removing words from an existing source.\n    *   The image provided represents the **third line** of a poem.\n    *   This poem is described as being in a **four-line stanza**.\n    *   A different, final poem in the same sequence contains the words **'nacreous wavers'**.\n    *   The goal is to identify the **poetic form**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the clue 'nacreous wavers'.**\n    *   Poetic forms are often defined by patterns, especially syllable counts. Let's count the syllables in this phrase.\n    *   \"na-cre-ous\" has 3 syllables.\n    *   \"wa-vers\" has 2 syllables.\n    *   The total syllable count for this phrase is 3 + 2 = 5 syllables.\n    *   This suggests that the poetic form involves lines of 5 syllables. The most famous poetic form with 5-syllable lines is the haiku.\n\n*   **Step 3: Test the haiku hypothesis.**\n    *   A traditional haiku follows a three-line structure with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5.\n    *   The question states the image represents the **third line**. According to the haiku form, this line should have 5 syllables.\n    *   Let's examine the words in the image: \"ghostly\", \"velum\", \"form\", \"like a\", \"dance\". Since this is an erasure poem, the poet selects words to form the line. We need to find a combination that makes sense and has 5 syllables.\n    *   Let's try: \"ghostly\" (2) + \"velum\" (2) + \"dance\" (1).\n    *   This selection, \"ghostly velum dance,\" forms a coherent poetic phrase and has a total of 5 syllables.\n    *   This result aligns perfectly with the requirement for the third line of a haiku.\n\n*   **Step 4: Address the \"four-line stanza\" information.**\n    *   This appears to contradict the three-line structure of a haiku. However, let's look at the entire image again.\n    *   At the top of the image, there is a title: \"THE OTHER CLOUDS\".\n    *   It is common practice to present a haiku with a title. If the stanza is considered as the complete text unit presented on the page, it would consist of the title plus the three lines of the poem.\n        *   Line 1: Title (\"THE OTHER CLOUDS\")\n        *   Line 2: The first line of the haiku (5 syllables, not shown)\n        *   Line 3: The second line of the haiku (7 syllables, not shown)\n        *   Line 4: The third line of the haiku (5 syllables, represented by \"ghostly velum dance\")\n    *   When viewed this way, the poem can be described as being part of a \"four-line stanza\" or four-part text block. This interpretation reconciles all the information given in the prompt.\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize and conclude.**\n    *   The evidence from the syllable count of 'nacreous wavers' (5 syllables) and the constructible 5-syllable third line from the image (\"ghostly velum dance\") strongly points to the 5-7-5 structure of a haiku. The \"four-line stanza\" mentioned in the question is best explained by the inclusion of a title along with the three lines of the poem. Therefore, the poetic form is a haiku.\n\n<<<Haiku>>>"
