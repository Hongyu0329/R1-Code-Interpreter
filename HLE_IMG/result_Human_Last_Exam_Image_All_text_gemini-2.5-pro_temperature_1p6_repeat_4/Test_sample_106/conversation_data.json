    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the starting material and product skeletons.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (SM):** The molecule is a C30 pentacyclic triterpene alcohol. By carefully examining the placement of the methyl groups, we can identify its structural family. It has methyl groups at the C-4 (gem-dimethyl), C-8, C-10, and C-14 positions on the main A/B/C/D ring system. The side group on the E ring is an isopropyl group. This methyl pattern (specifically the methyl at C-8) and the isopropyl group is characteristic of the Ursane or Lupane family of triterpenoids. The chemical formula is C30H52O.\n*   **Product (P):** The product is an alkene with the chemical formula C30H50, consistent with the loss of one molecule of water (H2O) from the starting material. The structure shown is olean-13(18)-ene, also known as δ-amyrin. This is a common thermodynamic product from acid-catalyzed rearrangements of many triterpenes. This molecule belongs to the Oleanane family.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction type.**\n\n*   The reaction is an acid-catalyzed (cat. HCl, 110 °C) dehydration of an alcohol. The conditions suggest that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and will favor the most thermodynamically stable product.\n*   The problem statement explicitly mentions \"[1,2] shifts,\" confirming that a Wagner-Meerwein type of rearrangement is occurring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rearrangement mechanism and track the substituents.**\n\n*   The overall transformation is from an Ursane-type skeleton to an Oleanane-type skeleton with a double bond.\n*   The key to solving this problem is to compare the backbone structures of the Ursane and Oleanane families. The A, B, C, and D rings of both Ursane and Oleanane skeletons have an identical methyl group substitution pattern. They both have methyls at C-8, C-10, and C-14.\n*   The rearrangement mentioned (\"a number of [1,2] shifts\") primarily involves the transformation of the E-ring from the Ursane/Lupane type to the Oleanane type, and the cascade of shifts required to move the initial carbocation (formed at C-3) to the position required for the final elimination step.\n*   Since the methyl substitution pattern on the A-D ring backbone is the same in the starting material family and the product family, the methyl groups at positions C-8, C-10, and C-14 do not get shuffled around as they would in, for example, a Friedelane rearrangement. They remain in their original positions.\n*   The final step is the formation of the stable, tetrasubstituted C-13=C-18 double bond. This typically occurs from a C-13 carbocation intermediate, followed by the elimination of a proton from the adjacent C-18. This elimination step does not affect the substituents at C-8, C-10, or C-14.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the identity of each substituent (V, W, X, Y, Z).**\n\nWe will now identify the substituent at each numbered position in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (V):** This position is one of the two methyl groups at C-4. The gem-dimethyl group at C-4 is not involved in the rearrangement. Therefore, **1 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (W):** This is the substituent at the A/B ring junction, on C-10. Both the Ursane (SM) and Oleanane (P) skeletons have a methyl group at this position. Therefore, **2 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 3 (X):** This is the substituent at the B/C ring junction, on C-8. Both the Ursane (SM) and Oleanane (P) skeletons have a methyl group at this position. Therefore, **3 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (Y):** This is the substituent at the C/D ring junction, on C-14. Both the Ursane (SM) and Oleanane (P) skeletons have a methyl group at this position. Therefore, **4 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 5 (Z):** This position is on C-12. In the starting material, C-12 is a methylene group (-CH2-). This carbon is adjacent to the newly formed double bond but does not participate in the elimination. It remains a -CH2- group in the product. The substituents on it are two hydrogen atoms. Therefore, **5 = H**.\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the substituents are:\n1 = CH3\n2 = CH3\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
