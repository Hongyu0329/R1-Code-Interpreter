    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n1.  **Structure of the Starting Material:** The starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Let's first determine its molecular formula. A careful examination of the connectivity suggests it is a derivative of a 3-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system.\n    *   The bicyclic core has 6 carbons and 1 nitrogen: C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7 and N3.\n    *   There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position.\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on the double bond, let's say at C6.\n    *   There is a para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) on the nitrogen atom (N3). The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n2.  **Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:** Let's count the atoms.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the bicyclic core + 1 in the CF3 group + 8 in the PMB group (1 in -CH2-, 6 in the benzene ring, 1 in -OCH3) = 15 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 5 in the core (H at C1, C4, C5 and 2H at C7) + 9 in the PMB group (2 in -CH2-, 4 on the ring, 3 in -OCH3) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 in the CF3 group.\n    *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 in the ring (N3).\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 in the carbonyl group (C=O) + 1 in the PMB group (-OCH3) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n3.  **Reaction 1: Deprotection of the PMB group.**\n    *   The reagent is CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n    *   CAN is a common oxidizing agent used for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines.\n    *   This reaction removes the PMB group from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added.\n    *   Change in formula: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1 = -C8, -H8, -O1.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3NO(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2: Hydrogenation.**\n    *   Intermediate 1 reacts with hydrogen gas (H2) over a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring (between C5 and C6) will be reduced to a single bond. The lactam carbonyl group (C=O) is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   The reaction involves the addition of one molecule of H2 across the double bond.\n    *   Change in formula: +H2.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 3: Hydrolysis.**\n    *   Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (in this case, a cyclic amide or lactam).\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction breaks the amide bond (the C2-N3 bond) by adding a molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   The C2 carbonyl group is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The N3 nitrogen atom is converted into an amine group (-NH2).\n    *   This cleavage opens the bicyclic ring system, resulting in a substituted cyclopentane ring carrying a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, and a trifluoromethyl group.\n    *   Change in formula: +H2O.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet's verify the formula by counting the atoms in the structure of the final product, which is a 3-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n*   **Carbons:** 5 in the cyclopentane ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CF3 = 7 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens:** 7 on the cyclopentane ring + 1 in -COOH + 2 in -NH2 = 10 hydrogens.\n*   **Fluorines:** 3 in -CF3.\n*   **Nitrogens:** 1 in -NH2.\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 in -COOH.\nThe formula C7H10F3NO2 is confirmed.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
