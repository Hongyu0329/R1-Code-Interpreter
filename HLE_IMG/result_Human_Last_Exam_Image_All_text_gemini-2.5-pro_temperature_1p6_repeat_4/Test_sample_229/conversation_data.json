    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Initial Musical Observations:**\n    *   **Tempo and Meter:** The time signature is 4/4. The tempo marking \"Med.\" (Medium) along with a metronome mark of \"♩ = 128\" indicates a moderately fast, lively pace.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is complex and virtuosic, characterized by rapid runs of sixteenth notes, arpeggios, and syncopation. This suggests the piece is an instrumental feature that demands technical skill. The feel is upbeat and energetic.\n    *   **Harmony (Chords):** The piece uses jazz-style chord symbols (e.g., C, E7, F, C-, G7). The progression, such as the opening `C | E7 | F`, is common in both early jazz and various Latin American musical styles. It functions as a I chord, followed by the dominant of the vi chord (E7 is V of A minor), leading to the IV chord (F). This creates strong harmonic movement.\n    *   **Structure:** The use of repeat signs, a Segno symbol (`D.S.` indicated by the text `TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA`), and a Coda are all standard elements of arrangement in jazz and popular music forms.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Musical Style:**\n    *   The combination of a fast tempo, continuous rapid-fire sixteenth-note melodies, and jazzy harmonies points strongly towards a specific genre.\n    *   The feel is not quite swing in the American big band sense, nor is it a ballad or blues.\n    *   The energetic, almost frantic, nature of the melodic runs is highly characteristic of the Brazilian musical style known as **Choro**. Choro is an instrumental genre known for its virtuosity, counterpoint, and syncopation, often described as \"Brazilian ragtime.\" When adapted by jazz musicians, it is categorized as **Latin Jazz**.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Song and Origin:**\n    *   Given the Choro/Latin Jazz style, we can look for famous pieces that fit this description. The most iconic and widely known piece in this style, famous for its bird-like, rapid melody, is **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**.\n    *   \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal,\" and the music is famously onomatopoeic, imitating the frenetic pecking of a sparrow. The virtuosic sixteenth-note passages seen throughout this sheet music are a signature of this song.\n    *   While the very first melodic phrase on this handwritten sheet might differ slightly from some standard published versions, this is common. The document is a lead sheet, likely a personal transcription for a performance, and musicians often create their own introductions or melodic variations. The overall character, structure, and subsequent musical figures are a definitive match for \"Tico-Tico no Fubá.\"\n    *   The composer of \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" is Zequinha de Abreu, who was from **Brazil**. The song was written in 1917 and became an international hit, notably after being featured in the Walt Disney film *Saludos Amigos* and being performed by artists like Carmen Miranda.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Handwritten Score:** This is a handwritten manuscript, not a formal publication. This allows for personal interpretation, abbreviations, and potential minor inaccuracies in notation, which is important when comparing it to a standard score.\n*   **Arrangement:** This is an arrangement for what appears to be a jazz combo. The chord choices and structure are tailored for that context.\n*   **Melodic Variation:** It's crucial not to be misled by small differences in the opening notes. The overall feel, tempo, rhythmic density, and signature runs are more reliable indicators for identifying a well-known tune from a transcription like this.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the musical elements—the fast tempo, virtuosic sixteenth-note runs characteristic of the Choro style, and its global recognition as a Latin Jazz standard—the song is identifiable.\n\n*   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n*   **Musical Style:** Choro / Latin Jazz\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<**Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá, **Musical Style:** Choro / Latin Jazz, **Country of Origin:** Brazil>>>"
