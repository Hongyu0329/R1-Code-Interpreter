The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-type immunoglobulin (V) domain** of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE).

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. This is because its level of expression directly correlates with the severity of the pathology. As shown in the diagram, the binding of S100B to its receptor initiates downstream signaling cascades (such as NF-ÎºB and JNK/JUN) that lead to key pathological events, including neuroinflammation, apoptosis (neuronal loss), and neurodegeneration. Therefore, a higher level of S100B would indicate a more aggressive disease state and predict a worse clinical outcome, which is the function of a prognostic marker.
