    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the provided image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\n*   **Central Figure:** The main subject is a four-legged creature that is white or light blue. It has a single, prominent horn on its forehead. This identifies the creature as a unicorn.\n*   **Appearance and Style:** The unicorn appears ethereal, almost like a ghost or a spirit. Its body is somewhat transparent and has a soft glow. It is depicted in a dynamic running or galloping pose. The art style is painterly and illustrative.\n*   **Background and surroundings:** The unicorn is in a dark, shadowy setting, which looks like a forest at night. To the right of the unicorn, there is what appears to be a column or the trunk of a large tree, illuminated by a warm, yellowish light, creating a strong contrast with the dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate hypotheses based on the visual clues.**\n*   The combination of a unicorn and a dark forest is a common trope in fantasy literature.\n*   The specific ghostly appearance of the unicorn is a key detail. This suggests a scene where a unicorn might be in distress, injured, or magical in nature.\n*   The art style is very recognizable and is similar to that used for the covers of a major fantasy series. The depiction of the unicorn strongly brings to mind the unicorn scene in the Forbidden Forest from the *Harry Potter* series.\n\n**Step 3: Test the hypothesis.**\n*   Let's investigate the covers of the *Harry Potter* books, specifically the first book, where a unicorn plays a significant role. The title of the first book is *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (in the UK) or *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (in the US).\n*   The original US editions of the Harry Potter series were famously illustrated by Mary GrandPré. Her artwork often wrapped around the entire dust jacket (front cover, spine, and back cover).\n*   By searching for the full dust jacket art of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* by Mary GrandPré, we can look for the unicorn.\n*   The front cover of the US edition features Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised. The back cover, however, depicts Ron and Hermione looking on while in the background, partially hidden by a tree, is a ghostly white unicorn running through the Forbidden Forest.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the match.**\n*   Comparing the provided image fragment with the artwork on the back cover of the US edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* reveals a perfect match.\n*   The ghostly, running unicorn, the dark forest setting, and the edge of the large, illuminated tree trunk all correspond exactly to a cropped section of Mary GrandPré's illustration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fragment is from the back cover of the US edition of the first Harry Potter book.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
