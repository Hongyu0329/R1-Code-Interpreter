    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] * 100%\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). VMT measures the distance traveled by the vehicle itself. Therefore, we sum the miles from both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" to get the total car VMT. The average carpool occupancy data is not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Weighted Calculation:** Total VMT is calculated by considering the proportion of trips in each distance bracket, the average distance for that bracket, and the share of car trips within that bracket.\n3.  **Proportional Calculation:** Since the initial data is in percentages, we can calculate a value that is proportional to the total VMT for each scenario. Let this be \"VMT Index\". The base number of total trips will cancel out when we calculate the percentage reduction.\n    *   VMT Index per bracket = (Share of total trips) × (Average trip distance) × (Car Mode Share)\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Calculate the VMT Index for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nFirst, for each distance bracket, we find the total mode share for cars by adding the shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". Then we calculate the VMT Index for each bracket.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53% (or 0.53)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 (trip share) × 1 (avg distance) × 0.53 (car share) = **0.2544**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 (trip share) × 4 (avg distance) × 0.81 (car share) = **0.7128**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 (trip share) × 7.5 (avg distance) × 0.85 (car share) = **0.8925**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 (trip share) × 20 (avg distance) × 0.89 (car share) = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    `0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Calculate the VMT Index for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 (trip share) × 1 (avg distance) × 0.03 (car share) = **0.0144**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 (trip share) × 4 (avg distance) × 0.27 (car share) = **0.2376**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 (trip share) × 7.5 (avg distance) × 0.41 (car share) = **0.4305**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 (trip share) × 20 (avg distance) × 0.49 (car share) = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    `0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n---\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nNow we use the total VMT index values for the Baseline and Proposed scenarios to find the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **Baseline VMT Index:** 4.7077\n*   **Proposed VMT Index:** 2.2505\n*   **Reduction Amount:** `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(Reduction Amount / Baseline VMT Index) × 100%`\n    *   `= (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%`\n    *   `= 0.52195... × 100%`\n    *   `≈ 52.2%`\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
