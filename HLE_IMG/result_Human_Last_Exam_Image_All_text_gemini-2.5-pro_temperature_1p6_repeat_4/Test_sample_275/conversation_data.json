    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to identify and count all unique splice species of mRNA based on the provided RT-PCR results. A \"splice species\" refers to a distinct mature mRNA molecule, which can differ by its combination of exons (splicing pattern) and/or its polyadenylation site.\n\n2.  **Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Technique:** Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detects and amplifies specific mRNA transcripts.\n    *   **Genome Map (Panel A):** Shows gene locations (E6, E1, L1, etc.), primer binding sites (e.g., E1F1, L1R), and two different polyadenylation sites: an early site (AE) and a late site (AL).\n    *   **Primers:** Different primer pairs are used to amplify different regions. Some primers are designed to be specific for certain splice junctions (E1F2 for `929^3465`, E1F3 for `929^3506`).\n    *   **Gel Electrophoresis (Panels B-I):** The results show PCR products as bands on a gel. Multiple bands in a single lane for a given primer pair indicate the presence of multiple splice variants.\n\n3.  **Analysis of \"Early\" Transcripts (polyadenylated at AE):**\n    RT-PCR reactions using reverse primers E4R, E5R, and L2R will detect transcripts that extend at least to the L2 region. These are primarily transcripts that terminate at the early polyadenylation site (AE), as these primers are located upstream of the late site (AL).\n\n    *   **Panels B (E1F1/E4R) & C (E1F1/E5R):** Both experiments show two bands (labeled 1 and 2). This indicates the presence of two distinct splice species in this region. The size difference between band 1 and band 2 is 31 bp (190-159 bp in B; 584-553 bp in C), suggesting an alternative splicing event involving a 31 bp exon. Let's name these **Species 1** and **Species 2**.\n    *   **Panels D (E1F2/E5R) & F (E1F2/L2R):** These use the forward primer E1F2, which specifically recognizes the `929^3465` splice junction. Both panels show only one band, corresponding in size to the lower band (Species 2) from panels B and C. This confirms that **Species 2** contains the `929^3465` splice. Species 1 must therefore have a different splice pattern.\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This uses primer E1F3, specific for the `929^3506` splice junction. This reveals two new bands. This means there are two more distinct splice species that both share the `929^3506` splice but differ somewhere else. Let's call them **Species 3** (upper band, 1003 bp) and **Species 4** (lower band, 931 bp).\n\n    *Summary for Early Transcripts:* We have identified 4 distinct splice species that are polyadenylated at the early site: Species 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n4.  **Analysis of \"Late\" Transcripts (polyadenylated at AL):**\n    The RT-PCR in panels H and I uses the reverse primer L1R, which is located in the L1 gene, downstream of the AL site. Therefore, these reactions specifically amplify transcripts that use the late polyadenylation signal.\n\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This high-cycle PCR shows the full complexity of late transcripts, revealing four distinct bands.\n        *   **Bands 1 (450 bp) and 2 (419 bp):** The 31 bp size difference mirrors the difference between Species 1 and Species 2. This indicates that these are the late-polyadenylated versions of those same splice patterns. Band 2 is **Species 2L** (late version of Species 2), and Band 1 contains **Species 1L** (late version of Species 1). (2 species identified).\n        *   **Band 3 (378 bp):** This band is 41 bp smaller than band 2 (419 - 378 = 41 bp). The genomic distance between splice site `3465` (in Species 2) and `3506` (in Species 3 & 4) is 41 nucleotides. This indicates that Band 3 is a late version of a transcript with the `929^3506` splice. Specifically, it corresponds to the smaller of the two species from panel G, making it **Species 4L**. (A 3rd late species).\n        *   **Deconvolution of Band 1 (450 bp):** We need to find the late version of Species 3. In panel G, Species 3 (1003 bp) is 72 bp larger than Species 4 (931 bp). Therefore, its late version (Species 3L) should be 72 bp larger than Species 4L (378 bp). Calculation: 378 bp + 72 bp = 450 bp. This is the exact size of Band 1. This means Band 1 is composed of two different splice species that co-migrate: Species 1L and **Species 3L**. Since Species 3L has a different splice pattern from Species 1L, it is a distinct species. (A 4th late species).\n        *   **Band 4 (187 bp):** This represents a new, highly spliced transcript that was not detected in the other reactions. This is a fifth distinct late splice species, **Species 5L**.\n\n    *Summary for Late Transcripts:* We have identified 5 distinct splice species that are polyadenylated at the late site: Species 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, and 5L.\n\n5.  **Final Tally:**\n    To find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species identified from both early and late transcripts.\n    *   Number of early species = 4\n    *   Number of late species = 5\n    *   Total number of distinct splice species = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
