    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Analyze the format and reading order:** The object is a square Chinese seal. The characters are carved in an ancient style known as seal script (篆书, zhuanshu). For a four-character seal like this, the standard reading order is from top to bottom, starting with the rightmost column and then moving to the left column.\n\n2.  **Identify the character in the top-right position:** This character is 「壽」 (shòu). It is a highly stylized character, but its key components are recognizable. It means \"longevity\" or \"life.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the character in the bottom-right position:** This character is 「疆」 (jiāng). The radical on the left is clearly a bow (弓, gōng), which is the key feature of this character. It means \"border,\" \"boundary,\" or \"realm.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the character in the top-left position:** This character is 「無」 (wú). This is a common and recognizable form of this character in seal script. It means \"without,\" \"no,\" or \"-less.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the character in the bottom-left position:** This character is 「量」 (liàng). It means \"measure\" or \"quantity.\"\n\n6.  **Combine the characters and interpret the phrase:** Reading in the correct order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left), the characters are 壽、疆、無、量. This forms the four-character phrase 「壽疆無量」 (shòu jiāng wú liàng). This is an auspicious phrase meaning \"May your lifespan (realm of longevity) be immeasurable,\" a wish for a very long life.\n\n7.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   The traditional character 壽 is simplified to 寿.\n    *   The traditional character 疆 is the same in simplified Chinese.\n    *   The traditional character 無 is simplified to 无.\n    *   The traditional character 量 is the same in simplified Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the content on the seal in simplified Chinese is \"寿疆无量\".\n\n<<<寿疆无量>>>"
