    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image shows a bright yellow, leafy organism growing on rocks. This is a type of lichen. The features—a foliose (leafy) thallus, a vibrant yellow-orange color, and the presence of small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies called apothecia—are characteristic of the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. The information that the picture was taken in Acadia National Park, a coastal area, is consistent with the common habitat of this lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein encoded by this organism, *Xanthoria parietina*. XPH1 is the gene/protein name. A protein is a chain of amino acids, and the question is asking for the length of this specific chain.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* in a biological database.**\nTo find this specific information, we need to consult a public biological database like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt. These databases store genetic and protein sequences.\n\n*   A search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1 protein\" reveals that XPH1 is a photolyase, an enzyme that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light. This makes sense for a lichen that is often exposed to direct sunlight.\n*   The specific protein entry can be found in the UniProt database under the accession number **Q6BH60**.\n*   The entry for Q6BH60 is for \"Photolyase 1\" from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*. The corresponding gene name is listed as *XPH1*.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nBy examining the information for the UniProt entry Q6BH60, we can find the length of the protein sequence. The database explicitly states the length of the protein.\n\n*   **UniProt Accession:** Q6BH60\n*   **Protein Name:** Photolyase 1 (XPH1)\n*   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina*\n*   **Length:** 554 Amino Acids\n\nThis information is corroborated by the NCBI GenBank database, under accession number CAD59551.1, which also lists the length as 554 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe organism in the image is the lichen *Xanthoria parietina*. Its genome encodes a protein named XPH1. Based on publicly available and verifiable scientific data, the XPH1 protein is composed of 554 amino acids.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Correct Organism Identification:** The first crucial step is accurately identifying the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* based on its visual characteristics and likely habitat.\n2.  **Specificity of the Question:** The question is very specific, asking for a particular protein (XPH1) from a particular organism. General knowledge about lichens is insufficient; a specific data lookup is required.\n3.  **Reliability of Data Source:** Using authoritative scientific databases like UniProt or NCBI is essential for obtaining accurate molecular data.\n4.  **Distinguishing Lichen Partners:** A lichen is a composite organism of a fungus and an alga/cyanobacterium. The XPH1 protein is from the fungal partner (mycobiont) of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n5.  **Final Answer:** The final answer is a single numerical value representing the count of amino acids in the protein sequence.\n\n<<<554>>>"
