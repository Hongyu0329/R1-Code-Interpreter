    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided image.**\n    The image provided is a completely black rectangle. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, names, or any other information depicted in the image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the question.**\n    The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". The phrase \"molecules mentioned above\" refers to the content of the image.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the question to the image.**\n    Since the image is blank, there are no \"molecules mentioned above\" to analyze or compare. The question is based on a false premise that molecules are shown.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the available information.**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** Conformers are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. To determine this, we would need to see at least two structures. Since no structures are given, this cannot be the answer.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. To determine this, we need to compare the molecular formulas and the connections between atoms in two or more molecules. Since no molecules are given, this cannot be the answer.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** This would mean that any depicted structures are actually the same molecule, possibly shown from different perspectives. To determine this, we need to see the structures. Since no structures are given, this cannot be the answer.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms. This is a broad category that includes conformers, enantiomers, and diastereomers. Again, we need to see the structures to make this determination. Since no structures are given, this cannot be the answer.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** Since it is impossible to classify a relationship between non-existent molecules, none of the specific classifications (a, b, c, d) can be selected. The question is unanswerable with the provided information. Therefore, \"None of these\" is the only logical choice.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n    The question cannot be answered because the required information (the molecular structures) is missing from the image. Consequently, none of the specific isomeric relationships apply.\n\n<<<E>>>"
