    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. An emission spectrum is produced when atoms of a specific element are energized (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them). The energized electrons jump to higher energy levels and then fall back to lower ones, emitting photons of light at specific, discrete wavelengths. These specific wavelengths appear as bright, colored lines against a dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nThe pattern of these spectral lines—their colors (which correspond to wavelengths) and their relative positions and intensities—is a unique \"fingerprint\" for each chemical element. We need to analyze this fingerprint. Let's observe the prominent lines in the provided spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelengths):\n\n*   **Red Region:** There is a very bright and distinct red line, along with a few other fainter ones nearby.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a strong, prominent yellow line.\n*   **Green Region:** There are several lines, with one being particularly bright.\n*   **Blue-Green (Cyan) Region:** A noticeable, bright line is visible.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in this region, including a few that are quite bright.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Spectrum with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, we compare this observed pattern with the known emission spectra of common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is much simpler, consisting of only four prominent lines: a red line (656 nm), a blue-green line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is far more complex, so it cannot be hydrogen.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its bright reddish-orange glow. Its spectrum is dominated by a large number of very strong lines in the red and orange parts of the spectrum. The spectrum in the image has very strong lines in the blue and green regions as well, which is not characteristic of neon.\n*   **Sodium:** Sodium has a famously dominant feature: a very strong, closely spaced pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow part of the spectrum (~589 nm). While the given spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines across the spectrum, which is not typical for pure sodium.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum for Helium is known to have several strong lines spread across the entire visible spectrum. Its most prominent lines are approximately:\n    *   A strong red line (~668 nm)\n    *   A strong yellow line (~588 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~502 nm)\n    *   A bright cyan (blue-green) line (~492 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-violet line (~447 nm)\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe pattern of prominent lines observed in the image—a strong red, a strong yellow, a bright green, a cyan, and several blue-violet lines—is a perfect match for the well-documented emission spectrum of the element **Helium**.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
