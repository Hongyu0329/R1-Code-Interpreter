**Product A:**
A tricyclic system with the structure: a pyrrolidine ring is fused to a dihydropyridinone ring, and the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring is part of a pyrrolidine ring. The full IUPAC name would be complex, but its formation incorporates the starting material, an acetyl group, and a methyl propiolate-derived fragment.
 

**Product B:**
A tricyclic lactone formed via intramolecular cyclization after Michael addition.
 

**Product C:**
The mixed anhydride of the starting material and acetic acid.
