    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the plant.**\n    The plant in the image has several distinctive features. The most prominent characteristic is the leaf pattern. The leaves are dark green and are covered with a striking, dense network of white or pale cream-colored veins. This pattern is known as reticulate venation. The leaves are simple, elliptical in shape, and appear to be arranged in opposite pairs or whorls along the stem. The overall impression is of a shrubby plant.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the plant.**\n    The unique white, net-like venation is a strong clue for identification. While some common houseplants like *Fittonia* (Nerve Plant) have colored veins, their growth habit is typically low and spreading, and the leaves are often broader and rounder. The plant in the image appears more upright and shrub-like. A search for plants with \"white net veins\" or \"reticulated leaves\" leads to a few candidates. One very strong match is a species of *Ruellia* known to be from a specific island. This plant is often sold in the horticultural trade as *Ruellia sp. 'Socotra'*. The appearance in the photograph, including the leaf shape, color, stem, and the incredibly intricate white network on the leaves, is a perfect match for this plant.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the plant's native origin.**\n    The name *Ruellia sp. 'Socotra'* itself provides the answer. This plant is endemic to the island of Socotra. Endemic means that it is found exclusively in that specific geographic location in the wild.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the question.**\n    The question asks for the name of the island to which this plant was endemic. Based on the identification of the plant as the *Ruellia* species from Socotra, the island is Socotra.\n\n<<<Socotra>>>"
