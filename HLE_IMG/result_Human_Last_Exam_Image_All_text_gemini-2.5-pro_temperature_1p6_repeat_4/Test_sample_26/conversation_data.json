    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement, to determine the correct Roman numeral.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Measure:** The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find measure 28 and count two measures forward to locate measure 30, which is also highlighted by a circle in the image.\n\n2.  **Identify the Global Key:** Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, \"Pathetique,\" is in the key of **C minor**. The key signature for C minor is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This is our home key, or tonic (i).\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:** To analyze the chord, we must identify all the notes being played in both the right and left hands.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on the note **F♯**.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a broken arpeggio. The notes, in ascending order, are **F♯, A, C, E♭**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Chord:** Combining all the notes from both hands gives us the pitches **F♯, A, C, and E♭**. This spelling forms an **F-sharp fully diminished seventh chord** (F♯°7). A diminished seventh chord is a stack of minor thirds (F♯ to A is a minor third, A to C is a minor third, C to E♭ is a minor third).\n\n5.  **Determine the Chord's Function (Harmonic Analysis):** Roman numeral analysis describes a chord's function within a key. We need to see where this F♯°7 chord is going or \"resolving\" to.\n    *   **Look at the following measure (m. 31):** The harmony in measure 31 consists of a **G major chord**. The left hand plays a G octave, and the right hand plays arpeggios on the notes G, B♮, and D.\n    *   **Analyze the relationship:** The F♯°7 chord in measure 30 resolves to the G major chord in measure 31. The F♯ in the F♯°7 chord is the **leading tone** to G (it's a half step below G).\n    *   A chord built on the leading tone that resolves to the tonic of a key is called a **leading-tone chord**. In this case, the F♯°7 is functioning as the leading-tone chord for the key of G. A leading-tone fully diminished seventh chord is represented by the Roman numeral **vii°7**.\n\n6.  **Apply Secondary Dominant Theory:** The F♯°7 chord is not native to the home key of C minor. It is \"borrowed\" from the key of G minor/major to strongly lead to the G major chord. This is a common technique called using a **secondary dominant** or **secondary leading-tone chord**.\n    *   First, determine the Roman numeral for the chord of resolution (G major) in the home key (C minor). G is the fifth scale degree of C minor, so a G major chord is the **dominant**, represented by the Roman numeral **V**.\n    *   Since the F♯°7 chord is functioning as the vii°7 *of the dominant chord (V)*, we write this using a slash notation.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final Roman Numeral:**\n    *   **Chord type:** leading-tone fully diminished seventh (vii°7).\n    *   **Target chord's function:** Dominant (V).\n    *   **Combined notation:** **vii°7/V**. This is read as \"seven-diminished-seven of five.\" It indicates a leading-tone diminished seventh chord that temporarily tonicizes the dominant key area.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Key Signature vs. Accidentals:** Always pay attention to accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals) within a measure, as they are crucial for identifying the correct chord, especially during modulation or tonicization. Here, the F♯ is the key indicator.\n*   **Context is Key:** Analyzing a single chord in isolation can be misleading. Looking at the preceding and, more importantly, the succeeding chords is essential for understanding its function. The resolution to G major in measure 31 is the critical piece of information.\n*   **Chord Inversion:** In this measure, the F♯ is in the bass, making the chord in root position. The Roman numeral does not change, but understanding the bass note confirms the root of the chord.\n*   **Understanding Secondary Functions:** Recognizing that a chord doesn't fit diatonically into the home key often points to a secondary or \"applied\" function. The F♯ is not in the C minor scale, signaling a function related to a different key center.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
