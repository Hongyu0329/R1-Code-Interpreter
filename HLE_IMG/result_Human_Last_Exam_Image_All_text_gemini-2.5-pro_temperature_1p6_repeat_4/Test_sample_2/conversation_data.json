    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm designed to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its operation for `n > 1`:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the prefix of the array, `a[0...n-2]`. After this call returns, we can assume `a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then compares the last element, `a[n-1]`, with the largest element of the now-sorted prefix, `a[n-2]`.\n    *   If `a[n-1]` is indeed smaller, it means this element is out of order and needs to be placed within the sorted prefix.\n    *   `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: The algorithm swaps these two elements. Now, the original `a[n-1]` is at position `n-2`, and the prefix `a[0...n-2]` is likely no longer sorted.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the disrupted prefix, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to `sort` the prefix `a[0...n-2]` again. This will correctly place the newly introduced element.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` represent the time complexity of the `sort(a, n)` function.\n    *   The operations inside the function (the `if` statement and the `swap`) take constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)`.\n    *   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens and contributes `T(n - 1)` to the complexity.\n    *   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` only happens if the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true. This call also contributes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   Therefore, the recurrence relation can be written as:\n        *   **Best Case** (the condition is always false): `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n        *   **Worst Case** (the condition is always true): `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    We need to find an input array that makes the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` true for every step of the recursion (from `n` down to `2`).\n    *   Consider a **reverse-sorted array**, such as `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    *   Let's trace `sort(a, n)` on this input.\n        1.  The first `sort(a, n - 1)` is called. It will sort the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` into `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The array will become `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n        2.  The condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is checked. This becomes `1 < n`, which is true (for `n>1`).\n        3.  The `swap` occurs, and the second `sort(a, n-1)` is called.\n    *   This pattern shows that for a reverse-sorted array, the `if` condition will be met at every level of the recursion. Therefore, a reverse-sorted array represents the worst-case input.\n\n4.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    The worst-case recurrence relation is `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`, where `c` is a constant. This is a classic recurrence.\n    *   Let's expand it:\n        *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n        *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n        *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c`\n    *   After `k` steps, we get: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n    *   The recursion stops at the base case, `T(1)`, which takes constant time. This happens when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n    *   Substituting `k = n - 1`: `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    *   Since `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the dominating term is `2^(n-1)`.\n    *   Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is simplified to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Recursive Structure:** The presence of two recursive calls within the same function block is a strong hint for potential exponential complexity, especially when both calls operate on nearly the same problem size (`n-1`). This structure is famously seen in the solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm does terminate. In each recursive call, the size of the problem `n` is reduced by 1. Eventually, `n` will reach the base case (`n <= 1`), and the recursion will unwind.\n*   **Best Case vs. Worst Case:** It's important to distinguish between the best and worst cases. For an already sorted array, the algorithm is much faster (`O(n)`) because the second recursive call is never made. The question specifically asks for the **worst-case** complexity.\n*   **Correctness vs. Efficiency:** While the algorithm does correctly sort the array, its method of re-sorting the entire prefix from scratch after every potential insertion is extremely inefficient, leading to the exponential time complexity.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This matches option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
