    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Medium and Style:** The image displays a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame (a tondo or roundel). The smooth, glossy finish, combined with the white and possibly subtly colored figures, is characteristic of glazed terracotta, a technique famously perfected by the della Robbia family workshop during the Italian Renaissance. The figures are rendered with grace, gentle expressions, and idealized features, which are hallmarks of this artistic style.\n\n2.  **Identify the Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a Christian sacrament. A priest, standing at an altar with a candle, is administering the Eucharist (the host) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground and what appear to be monks or friars.\n\n3.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, within a cartouche, there is a visible inscription. Although partially obscured, the words \"SACRAMENT\" and \"DE L'AVTEL\" can be discerned. \"Sacrement de l'autel\" is French for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which directly confirms the subject as the Eucharist. The use of French suggests a commission for a patron or location in France.\n\n4.  **Connect the Clues:**\n    *   **Style:** Italian Renaissance, della Robbia workshop.\n    *   **Medium:** Glazed terracotta.\n    *   **Subject:** Sacrament of the Altar (Eucharist).\n    *   **Inscription:** French.\n\n5.  **Research and Attribution:** Combining these clues points strongly to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525), a leading member of the Florentine della Robbia workshop. He created a major work known as the \"Retable du Sacrement de l'autel\" (Altarpiece of the Sacrament of the Altar). This altarpiece was commissioned for a church in Perpignan, France, which explains the French inscription. The image provided is a well-known detail from the predella (the lower panel) of this very altarpiece, specifically the roundel representing the Eucharist. The altarpiece is now housed in the Church of Saint-Jacques in Perpignan.\n\nTherefore, based on the distinctive style, the medium, the subject matter, and the specific inscription, the author of this work is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
