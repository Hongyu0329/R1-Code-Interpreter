    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall reaction:** The reaction shows hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) reacting with a cyclobutene derivative (let's assume cyclobutene, C₄H₆, for simplicity, although the drawing is ambiguous about the number of hydrogens) under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a complex tricyclic product.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the transformation based on the hint:** The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. This implies the overall transformation is a two-step process, likely involving an unstable intermediate.\n\n3.  **Propose the first pericyclic reaction:** A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to Dewar benzene. In this case, hexafluorobenzene would isomerize to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   This reaction involves the rearrangement of π electrons within a single molecule to form a new σ bond and a new ring system.\n    *   Specifically, a 1,3-diene fragment within one of the Kekulé structures of the benzene ring (a 4π-electron system) undergoes a ring-closing reaction.\n    *   A pericyclic reaction involving the cyclization of a single conjugated π-system is called an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the photochemical electrocyclization of a 4n π-electron system (where n=1) is an allowed process.\n    *   Therefore, the first reaction is a **photochemical electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n4.  **Propose the second pericyclic reaction:** The intermediate formed, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is a strained diene. It then reacts with the other starting material, cyclobutene.\n    *   Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene has two C=C double bonds (2π-electron systems). Cyclobutene has one C=C double bond (another 2π-electron system).\n    *   A common photochemical reaction between two molecules containing π bonds is a cycloaddition, where a new ring is formed.\n    *   Here, one of the π bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the π bond of cyclobutene. This involves the 2 π-electrons from each molecule.\n    *   This type of reaction, which forms a new ring by combining two π systems, is called a **cycloaddition reaction**.\n    *   Specifically, since it involves a 2π-electron system and another 2π-electron system, it is classified as a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n5.  **Verify the final product:** The product of a [2+2] cycloaddition between hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene would be a tricyclic system composed of three fused four-membered rings. Tracing the connectivity and the positions of the fluorine and hydrogen atoms shows that this proposed reaction sequence correctly predicts the structure of the final product given in the image. The unreacted double bond from the Dewar benzene intermediate remains, and the stereochemistry of the substituents on the cyclobutene is preserved.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Photochemical conditions (hv):** This is key. Pericyclic reaction rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical reactions.\n*   **Two-step process:** The reaction is not a single-step concerted process. Recognizing the need for an intermediate (Dewar benzene) is crucial.\n*   **Valence Isomerization:** The isomerization of benzene to Dewar benzene is a classic example of a photochemical electrocyclic reaction.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** The reaction between two alkene-like components to form a cyclobutane ring is a classic [2+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Ambiguity in drawing:** The drawing of cyclobutene and the product might be simplified, showing only some hydrogens. This does not affect the classification of the reaction types, which depends on the changes in the carbon skeleton and π-systems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe transformation involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** where hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to its Dewar valence isomer.\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition reaction** where the Dewar benzene intermediate reacts with cyclobutene to form the final tricyclic product.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction>>>"
