    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most obvious, \"at a glance\" difference between the sporophytes of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses is the structure responsible for producing spores and typically consists of a capsule (containing spores) and a seta (the stalk holding the capsule).\n\n2.  **Examine the Names:** Often, botanical names provide clues. The name *Grimmia curviseta* is particularly informative. In Latin, *curvus* means \"curved\" and *seta* refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. This name directly suggests that a key feature of this species is a curved seta.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***:\n    *   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically very short and, most importantly, **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect (upright) and is typically emergent, meaning it pokes out just above the tips of the surrounding leaves (perichaetial leaves).\n    *   **Visual Appearance:** When you look at a patch of fertile *G. montana*, you see small, upright capsules nestled among the leafy cushions.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***:\n    *   **Seta:** As its name implies, the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is distinctly **curved or arcuate**. It is strongly bent, often like a hook or arch.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** The pronounced curve in the seta causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or pendulous (hanging down). It is often oriented below the level of the perichaetial leaves.\n    *   **Visual Appearance:** When you look at a patch of fertile *G. curviseta*, the capsules appear to be hiding or hanging below the leaves due to the curved stalk.\n\n5.  **Identify the Main Difference:** Comparing the two, the most striking and immediately visible difference in the sporophyte is the **shape and orientation of the seta**.\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: Straight seta, erect capsule.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Curved (arcuate) seta, nodding or hanging capsule.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   This distinguishing feature is only present when the mosses have produced mature sporophytes. Without sporophytes, these species must be distinguished by other, more subtle microscopic features of their leaves (gametophyte).\n*   The term \"at a glance\" implies a feature visible to the naked eye or with a simple hand lens, which the seta curvature certainly is.\n*   While there might be other minor differences in capsule shape or size, the orientation of the capsule due to the seta's shape is the primary and most reliable field character for separating them.\n*   The provided image shows moss with what appear to be erect, sessile or very short-stalked capsules, which is consistent with the appearance of *Grimmia montana*, not *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, resulting in an erect, upright capsule. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved (arcuate), causing the capsule to be nodding or to hang down.>>>"
