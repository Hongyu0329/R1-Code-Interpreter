    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation of the Artwork.**\n    The image is a photograph of a painted ancient Greek vase. The style is red-figure, where figures are left in the natural red color of the clay against a black painted background, with details painted on in black lines. The scene depicted is a dramatic, mythological event involving a chariot.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analysis of the Figures and Composition.**\n    1.  **Chariot and Occupants:** There is a two-wheeled chariot moving from right to left. Inside are two main figures.\n        *   The **driver** is a male figure on the left, wearing a decorated, possibly Phrygian-style, cap and a patterned sleeved garment. This type of attire in Greek art often signifies a non-Greek, typically an \"oriental\" or eastern origin (like Anatolian or Trojan). He is holding the reins.\n        *   The **passenger** beside him is rendered in added white paint. In Greek vase painting, white paint was conventionally used for female flesh. This figure is therefore a woman. She is looking back over her shoulder.\n    2.  **Falling Figure:** Below the chariot and to the right, a nude male figure is depicted in a contorted pose, lying on the ground. His body is twisted, with his head down and arms outstretched, clearly indicating a fall, crash, or moment of death. This is the figure \"leaving the chariot\" in the sense of being thrown from one or being killed in a chariot-related incident.\n    3.  **Other Elements:** A white horse is partially visible pulling the chariot. Above the scene, a large white wing is visible, suggesting the presence of a winged being, such as Eros (Love), Nike (Victory), or a winged horse/chariot.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identification of the Mythological Scene.**\n    The combination of a male driver, a female passenger in a chariot, and a falling/dying male figure strongly points to a specific Greek myth: **the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus.**\n    *   **The Story:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would challenge any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. Possessing divine horses from his father, Ares, Oenomaus would always win and kill the suitor. Pelops, a prince from Lydia (an Anatolian kingdom, which explains the \"oriental\" dress), challenges Oenomaus. Pelops wins through divine aid (winged horses from Poseidon) or by sabotage (bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the linchpins of Oenomaus's chariot with wax ones). During the race, Oenomaus's chariot crashes, and he is killed.\n    *   **Matching the Scene to the Myth:**\n        *   The driver in \"oriental\" attire is **Pelops**.\n        *   The female passenger looking back is **Hippodamia**, the prize of the race and Oenomaus's daughter.\n        *   The nude man falling to his death is **King Oenomaus**. His nudity emphasizes the pathos of his defeat and death.\n        *   The winged figure (whose wing is visible) is likely Nike (Victory) crowning Pelops or Eros (Love) signifying the love between Pelops and Hippodamia that motivated the race.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answering the Specific Question.**\n    The question asks to identify \"the figure leaving the chariot.\" This refers to the man on the ground who has fallen from his own chariot (which has crashed off-scene) or is being run down by Pelops' chariot. This figure is King Oenomaus.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the iconographic evidence and the narrative of Greek mythology, the figure falling/dying on the ground, and thus \"leaving the chariot\" in a violent manner, is Oenomaus.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
