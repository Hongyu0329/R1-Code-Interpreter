    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key**\n*   The title of the piece is \"Fantasy in D minor\".\n*   The key signature shows one flat (B♭).\n*   These two pieces of information confirm that the overall key of the piece is D minor. The tonic chord (i) is D minor (D-F-A).\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Identify the Notes**\n*   The circled passage is in measure 8, starting on the second beat.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes played on beat 2 are A and C♯. The C♯ is indicated by the sharp sign (♯) next to the C.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes played on beat 2 are E♭ and D. The E♭ is indicated by the flat sign (♭) next to the E.\n*   Combining the notes that sound simultaneously at the beginning of beat 2, we get the chord A-C♯-E♭. The D that follows is a quick sixteenth note and acts as a non-chord tone (a passing tone between E♭ and the implied C♯ of the continuing harmony). The essential harmony of the beat is defined by the A-C♯-E♭ triad.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord's Function within the Key of D Minor**\n*   The key is D minor. The scale degrees are D(1), E(2), F(3), G(4), A(5), B♭(6), C(7).\n*   In minor keys, the 7th degree is often raised to create a \"leading tone\" which pulls strongly to the tonic. In D minor, the raised 7th is C♯.\n*   The root of our chord is A. 'A' is the 5th scale degree of D minor, which is the dominant.\n*   The chord contains C♯, the leading tone. A chord built on the dominant (5th degree) that includes the leading tone has a dominant function.\n*   Therefore, the chord's function is dominant, and its Roman numeral will be based on the numeral for the dominant, which is V.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Chord Quality and Determine the Specific Roman Numeral**\n*   A standard dominant chord (V) in D minor is an A major triad (A-C♯-E).\n*   The chord in the score is A-C♯-E♭.\n*   Comparing the two, we see that the 5th of the chord has been chromatically altered—it has been lowered from E to E♭.\n*   This is known as an \"altered dominant\" chord. The purpose of lowering the 5th is to increase dissonance and the drive to resolve to the tonic chord.\n*   The Roman numeral for a dominant function chord is V. A capital 'V' is used in a minor key to signify that the chord is built with the raised leading tone (making it a major or, in this case, altered-major chord), which is standard practice for dominant chords. While more specific notation like V(♭5) exists in advanced analysis, the fundamental and most widely understood Roman numeral for this functional harmony is simply V. It's an altered V chord.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Key:** Must correctly identify the key as D minor to understand scale degrees and chord functions.\n*   **Accidentals:** Pay close attention to the C♯ and E♭ accidentals within the measure, as they are crucial for identifying the specific notes of the chord.\n*   **Function over Form:** The chord A-C#-E♭ is not a standard major, minor, or diminished triad. However, in Roman numeral analysis, the *function* of the chord is paramount. Its root on the dominant (A) and inclusion of the leading tone (C♯) make its function unequivocally dominant.\n*   **Non-Chord Tones:** Recognize that the D in the right hand is a melodic passing note and not part of the underlying harmony of the beat.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chord is an altered dominant chord. Its root is on the fifth degree of the scale, and it functions to lead to the tonic.\n\n<<<V>>>"
