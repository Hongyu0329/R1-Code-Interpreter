    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to find the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern can be rotated around a central point (by less than a full 360° turn) and still look identical to its original position. The number of such positions is called the \"order\" of the rotational symmetry. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°. The question asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry present anywhere in the infinite tiling represented by the patch.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Basic Shapes (Tiles) in the Pattern**\nThe tiling is composed of three distinct geometric shapes:\n1.  **Hexagons:** Dark blue, regular hexagons (6 sides).\n2.  **Squares:** Light yellow squares (4 sides).\n3.  **Rhombi:** Orange rhombi (4-sided parallelograms with sides of equal length).\n\n**Step 3: Look for Centers of Rotation**\nA center of rotation is a point in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire tiling and have it map perfectly onto itself. We should examine different characteristic points in the tiling, such as the centers of the tiles or the vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n**Step 4: Test Different Points for Rotational Symmetry**\nLet's analyze potential centers of rotation and determine the order of symmetry at each point.\n\n*   **Point A: The center of a blue hexagon.**\n    *   A single regular hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after every 60° rotation).\n    *   However, in this tiling, we must also consider its surroundings. Each blue hexagon is surrounded by an alternating sequence of three yellow squares and three orange rhombi.\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 60° (1/6th of a turn) around the hexagon's center, a yellow square would land in the position of an orange rhombus, and a rhombus would land in a square's position. Since the shapes are different, the pattern does not match. So, there is no 6-fold symmetry here.\n    *   If we rotate by 120° (1/3rd of a turn), each yellow square moves to the position of another yellow square, and each orange rhombus moves to the position of another orange rhombus. The pattern matches. This happens 3 times in a full 360° rotation. Therefore, the center of a blue hexagon is a point of **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Point B: The center of a yellow square.**\n    *   A single square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (looks the same every 90°).\n    *   In the tiling, a yellow square is bordered by blue hexagons on two opposite sides and by orange rhombi on the other two opposite sides.\n    *   If we rotate by 90° (1/4th of a turn), the sides touching hexagons would move to where the sides touching rhombi were. The pattern does not match.\n    *   If we rotate by 180° (1/2 of a turn), the opposite sides match up correctly (hexagon-side maps to hexagon-side, rhombus-side maps to rhombus-side). The pattern is preserved. This is a **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Point C: The vertex where six orange rhombi meet.**\n    *   This is the most prominent feature, creating a 6-pointed star effect. Let's look at the point at the very center of one of these stars.\n    *   At this point, the acute-angle vertices of six identical orange rhombi meet.\n    *   Let's try rotating the entire pattern by 360°/6 = 60° around this point.\n    *   Each orange rhombus in the central cluster will rotate into the exact position of its neighbor. The cluster of six rhombi is unchanged.\n    *   Looking further out, each of these rhombi is adjacent to a yellow square and two blue hexagons. A 60° rotation maps the entire surrounding arrangement of squares and hexagons perfectly onto itself.\n    *   Since a rotation of 60° leaves the entire tiling unchanged, this point is a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Rotational Symmetry of the Tiling**\nThe tiling has multiple centers of rotation with different orders (2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold). When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a periodic tiling, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry found anywhere in the pattern. In this case, the highest order we found is 6.\n\nTherefore, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
