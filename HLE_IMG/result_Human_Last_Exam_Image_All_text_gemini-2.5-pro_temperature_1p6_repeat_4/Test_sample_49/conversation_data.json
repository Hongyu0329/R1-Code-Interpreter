    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The cutoff frequency, typically denoted as $f_c$ (in Hz) or $\\omega_c$ (in rad/s), for an RC circuit is determined by the time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$. The formula for the angular cutoff frequency is $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau = 1/(R_{th}C)$. The task is to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$ at node $a_0$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground (`b_0`). We do this by deactivating all independent sources in the circuit. The input `IN` is an independent source, so we ground its terminal, node $c_0$.\n\n**3. Circuit Analysis for $R_{th}$**\nWith node $c_0$ grounded, we look for the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. Let's trace the path:\n- From node $a_0$, the current goes through a resistor `r` to node $d_1$.\n- From node $d_1$, it goes through the network between `d_1` and `c_1`.\n- From node `c_1`, it goes through a resistor `r` to node $c_0$, which is ground.\n\nThe total Thevenin resistance is the sum of resistances in this series path:\n$R_{th} = r_{a_0 \\to d_1} + R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} + r_{c_1 \\to c_0}$\n$R_{th} = r + R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} + r$\nwhere $R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)}$ is the equivalent resistance between nodes $d_1$ and $c_1$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equivalent Resistance between $d_1$ and $c_1$ ($R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)}$)**\nThe network connected between nodes $d_1$ and $c_1$ consists of two parts in parallel:\n1.  The horizontal \"rung\" resistor `r` connecting $c_1$ and $d_1$ directly.\n2.  The rest of the infinite ladder network extending to the right from the terminals $(c_1, d_1)$.\n\nLet's call the input impedance of the infinite ladder looking to the right from $(c_1, d_1)$ as $Z_{in}$. Then,\n$R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} = r \\parallel Z_{in}$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Input Impedance of the Infinite Ladder ($Z_{in}$)**\nThe ladder starting from $(c_1, d_1)$ consists of a series section (resistor `r` from $c_1$ to $c_2$ and resistor `r` from $d_1$ to $d_2$) followed by the rest of the ladder seen from $(c_2, d_2)$.\nThe total series resistance for a signal traversing the loop is $r+r=2r$.\nThe network at $(c_2, d_2)$ is composed of the rung resistor `r` in parallel with the input impedance of the ladder from that point onwards ($Z_{in}$ again, due to the infinite nature of the ladder).\nSo, we can write a recursive equation for $Z_{in}$:\n$Z_{in} = (\\text{series part}) + (\\text{load})$\n$Z_{in} = 2r + (r \\parallel Z_{in})$\n$Z_{in} = 2r + \\frac{r \\cdot Z_{in}}{r + Z_{in}}$\n\nTo solve for $Z_{in}$, we multiply the equation by $(r + Z_{in})$:\n$Z_{in}(r + Z_{in}) = 2r(r + Z_{in}) + r Z_{in}$\n$rZ_{in} + Z_{in}^2 = 2r^2 + 2rZ_{in} + rZ_{in}$\n$Z_{in}^2 - 2rZ_{in} - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $Z_{in}$:\n$Z_{in} = \\frac{-(-2r) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2(1)}$\n$Z_{in} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\nSince resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$Z_{in} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**6. Back to Calculating $R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)}$**\nNow we can find the equivalent resistance between $d_1$ and $c_1$:\n$R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} = r \\parallel Z_{in} = r \\parallel r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n$R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} = \\frac{r \\cdot r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{r + r(1 + \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{r^2(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{r(1 + 1 + \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} = \\frac{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{r(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{3} - 3)}{4 - 3} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**7. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nNow we substitute this back into our expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{eq, (d_1, c_1)} + r$\n$R_{th} = r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) + r$\n$R_{th} = 2r + r\\sqrt{3} - r = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**8. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nSubstituting our value for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which can be interpreted as either $\\omega_c$ or $f_c$. The expression for $\\omega_c$ is more fundamental in circuit theory.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the angular cutoff frequency.\n\n<<<1/(rC(1 + sqrt(3)))>>>"
