    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Class of the Compound:** The question identifies the compound as an alkaloid. Alkaloids are naturally occurring organic compounds characterized by the presence of at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. The structure shown contains two nitrogen atoms incorporated into a complex, multi-ring system, which is consistent with the definition of an alkaloid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Functional Groups:** The structure contains two tertiary amine groups and one carbonyl group (C=O). The carbonyl group is part of a cyclic amide, which is known as a lactam.\n    *   **Ring System:** The molecule is polycyclic, meaning it has multiple fused rings. Let's count the number of rings and their sizes.\n        *   There are four fused rings in total, making it a tetracyclic compound.\n        *   By counting the atoms in each ring, we can determine their size. All four rings are six-membered rings.\n    *   **Core Skeleton:** The overall structure, with two nitrogen atoms bridging four six-membered rings, is characteristic of a group of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids. The parent hydrocarbon skeleton (without the carbonyl group) is called sparteine. The presence of the carbonyl group makes this an oxo-derivative of sparteine.\n\n3.  **Compare with Known Alkaloids:** We will compare the given structure to common alkaloids with similar frameworks, particularly those found in lupin plants (lupin alkaloids).\n    *   **Sparteine:** Has the same tetracyclic core but lacks the C=O group.\n    *   **Matrine:** This is another tetracyclic alkaloid with the same chemical formula (C15H24N2O). However, the ring system of matrine consists of three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring. The compound in the image has four six-membered rings. Thus, it is not matrine.\n    *   **Cytisine / Anagyrine:** These alkaloids contain aromatic (pyridone) rings, which are absent in the given structure.\n    *   **Lupanine:** This is a major lupin alkaloid. Its structure is a tetracyclic system composed of four six-membered rings, two nitrogen atoms, and one lactam group. The connectivity of the atoms in the structure of lupanine perfectly matches the compound shown in the image.\n\n4.  **Consider Stereochemistry:** The drawing uses wedges and dashes to indicate a specific three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms (stereochemistry). Natural products typically exist as a single, specific stereoisomer. The structure shown is the standard representation of the most common natural isomer, (+)-lupanine. For general identification, the common name \"Lupanine\" is used to refer to this specific molecular structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the functional groups, the tetracyclic 6/6/6/6 ring system, and comparison with known alkaloid structures, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
