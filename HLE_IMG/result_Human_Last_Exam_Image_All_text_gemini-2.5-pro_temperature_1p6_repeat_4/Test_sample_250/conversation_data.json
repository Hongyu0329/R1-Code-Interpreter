    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or F minor.\n    *   The first chord shown is F- (F minor), and the piece ends on an F chord. This strongly suggests the tune is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time, which is standard for many jazz tunes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The melody begins on the note C, which is the 5th of the F minor scale.\n    *   The first four notes in the first measure are C, F, G, A♭. This melodic contour is very distinctive. In solfege, relative to the F minor tonic, this would be Sol-Do-Re-Me♭.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   The chord progression is a key identifier for jazz standards. Let's transcribe the chords from the lead sheet:\n        *   **A Section:** `| F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 | C7 | F- | 1. C7 :|| 2. C7 | F- |`\n        *   **B Section (Bridge):** `| D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |`\n        *   **Final A Section:** `| F | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭ | G7 | C7 | F |`\n    *   The descending bass line in the first few measures (F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭) over minor-quality chords is a very recognizable harmonic device.\n\n4.  **Identify the Song and Composer:**\n    *   The combination of the initial melodic phrase (C-F-G-A♭ over F minor) and the characteristic descending chord progression (`F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | ...`) uniquely points to the jazz standard **\"Alone Together\"**.\n    *   A quick search confirms that the standard progression for \"Alone Together\" (often played in D minor) is `Dm | C#m7b5 | Cm6 |...`, which is a transposition of the progression seen here.\n    *   The composer of \"Alone Together\" is **Arthur Schwartz**, with lyrics written by Howard Dietz. The song was written for the 1932 Broadway revue *Flying Colors*.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key:** While the tune is often played in D minor, being able to recognize it in other keys (like F minor here) is crucial.\n*   **Chord Spellings:** Jazz lead sheets can have variations. For example, `E-7♭5` is also known as `E half-diminished`. `E♭-6` is an E♭ minor sixth chord. These specific voicings are part of the song's character.\n*   **Melody is Key:** Even without the chords, the opening melodic phrase is a strong identifier for this particular standard.\n*   **Form:** Recognizing the 32-bar AABA structure helps in navigating the piece and confirms its identity as a classic standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the melody, chord progression, and form, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Alone Together\" composed by Arthur Schwartz.\n\n<<<Title: Alone Together, Composer: Arthur Schwartz>>>"
