    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"Illusion\"**: The phenomenon is a perceptual illusion, where what is perceived differs from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: This is a crucial hint. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D line drawing can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. The brain flips between these two equally plausible interpretations. This suggests the phenomenon in question also involves the brain actively interpreting an ambiguous stimulus, creating a perception that goes beyond the raw sensory input.\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This indicates the illusion makes us aware of a fundamental way our brain processes information all the time without us noticing. This ability is related to filling in missing information or inferring continuity based on context.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Image:** The image shows two representations of a sound over time.\n    *   **Top: Spectrogram**: This graph plots frequency (vertical axis) against time (horizontal axis), with intensity shown by the color. We can see a strong, continuous horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a single, constant frequency. In the middle of the timeline, this tone is physically interrupted and replaced by a vertical smudge. This smudge represents a short burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, i.e., noise (like static or a cough). After the noise, the pure tone resumes.\n    *   **Bottom: Waveform**: This graph plots the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It shows a regular, periodic sine wave (the pure tone), which is then interrupted by a complex, irregular, non-periodic section (the noise), followed by the resumption of the sine wave.\n    *   **Conclusion from Image**: The physical stimulus is a pure tone that stops, is replaced by a burst of noise, and then starts again.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Text and Image Analysis:**\n    *   We have a sound stimulus where a tone is verifiably absent for a short period, and that gap is filled with noise.\n    *   The illusion described occurs when a person listens to this sound. The vast majority of people do not perceive a tone that stops and restarts. Instead, they perceive the tone as *continuing uninterrupted* \"behind\" the burst of noise.\n    *   This is a classic auditory illusion. The brain, following Gestalt principles of continuity, assumes it is more probable that a continuous tone was temporarily masked by noise than that the tone coincidentally stopped just as the noise began and started again just as it ended.\n    *   The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, demonstrating the \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" mentioned in the prompt. This active process of constructing a complete perception from incomplete data is analogous to how the brain constructs a 3D cube from the ambiguous lines of the Necker Cube.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name of the Phenomenon:**\n    *   This specific illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuous through an interruption, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n    *   A very famous specific example of this is the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**, discovered by Richard Warren. In his experiments, a phoneme (a basic sound unit of speech) was deleted from a recorded word and replaced by a cough or a burst of static. Listeners reported hearing the complete word and were often unable to even identify which phoneme had been replaced, perceiving the cough as an additional, overlapping sound.\n    *   Since the stimulus shown in the image is a simple tone rather than speech, the more general and accurate term is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinction from Visual Illusions**: While compared to the Necker Cube, this is an *auditory* illusion, not a visual one.\n*   **The Role of the Interrupter**: The illusion is strongest when the interrupting sound (the noise) has the spectral characteristics that could plausibly mask the original sound. If the interruption were silence, the gap would be clearly perceived.\n*   **Underlying Principle**: The illusion is a powerful demonstration of top-down processing in perception, where the brain uses context and prior expectations (e.g., that sounds tend to be continuous) to interpret sensory input. It's an example of the Gestalt principle of **continuity**.\n*   **The Necker Cube Analogy**: The analogy refers to the constructive nature of perception, not necessarily to the \"bistable\" (two-state) nature. While one could argue you can consciously *try* to hear the gap, the continuous perception is overwhelmingly dominant, unlike the Necker Cube where both orientations are roughly equally likely to be perceived.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the name of the phenomenon is identified.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
