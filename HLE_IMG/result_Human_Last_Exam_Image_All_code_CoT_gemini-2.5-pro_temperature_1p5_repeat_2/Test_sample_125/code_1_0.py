# Part 3: Final assembly (2 steps)
# Step 8: Suzuki coupling
# Step 9: Oxidative cyclization

# The total number of steps is the sum of all individual reaction steps.
# In a synthesis plan, you count every transformation. Even if some parts
# can be done in parallel, they still represent distinct steps in the process.
# So, we sum the steps to make both precursors and the final assembly steps.
