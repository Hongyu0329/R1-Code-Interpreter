    "My analysis of the image leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Examine the Sequence:** The images labeled L, M, and N represent a time-lapse sequence showing a change in a filamentous biological structure, most likely a fungal hypha.\n2.  **Observe the Change:** In image L, the hypha appears normal and turgid. The arrowhead points to a septum (a cross-wall). In image M, a bulge begins to form at this exact spot. By image N, the bulge is much more pronounced, and the entire hypha has bent and appears to be collapsing at this weak point.\n3.  **Interpret the Process:** The bulging is caused by the internal turgor pressure of the cell pushing against a weakened area of the cell wall. The progressive swelling and eventual rupture or collapse of the cell is a process known as **lysis**. Since this is occurring in a hypha, the specific term is **hyphal lysis**. This is often a result of osmotic stress or cell wall damage.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides an explanation for the biological process shown in the image.\n  The image shows a time sequence (L, M, N) of a fungal hypha.\n  L: A normal hypha.\n  M: A bulge appears at a weak point near a septum (indicated by the arrow).\n  N: The bulge enlarges, and the hypha collapses at that point.\n  This bursting due to internal pressure is called lysis.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"The process depicted in the image is hyphal lysis.\"\n  explanation = \"This is the rupture and breakdown of a fungal hypha. The sequence shows a weak point in the cell wall (indicated by arrowheads) swelling due to high internal turgor pressure, which ultimately leads to the collapse and bursting of the cell.\"\n  \n  print(f\"{process_name} {explanation}\")\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<The process depicted in the image is hyphal lysis.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
