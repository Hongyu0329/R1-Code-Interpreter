  This function provides an explanation for the biological process shown in the image.
  The image shows a time sequence (L, M, N) of a fungal hypha.
  L: A normal hypha.
  M: A bulge appears at a weak point near a septum (indicated by the arrow).
  N: The bulge enlarges, and the hypha collapses at that point.
  This bursting due to internal pressure is called lysis.
