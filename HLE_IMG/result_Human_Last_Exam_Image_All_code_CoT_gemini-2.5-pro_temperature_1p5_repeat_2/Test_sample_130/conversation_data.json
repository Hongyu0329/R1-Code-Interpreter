    "The image provided shows the emission spectrum of an element. To identify the element, we can compare the pattern of spectral lines in the image to the known spectra of different elements.\n\n**Analysis of the Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Color Range:** The spectrum spans the visible range from blue/violet on the left to red on the right.\n2.  **Key Features:** The most prominent and recognizable feature is a very bright, closely spaced pair of lines (a \"doublet\") in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum. There are also several other lines in the green, blue, and red regions.\n3.  **Identification:** This strong yellow doublet is the characteristic signature of the element Sodium (Na). These lines are known as the Sodium D-lines and occur at wavelengths of approximately 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm.\n\nThe following Python code will present the prominent spectral lines of several common elements and identify the one that matches the pattern seen in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its known spectral lines to an observed spectrum.\n    The observed spectrum has a characteristic bright yellow doublet.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Database of prominent visible spectral lines for some elements (wavelengths in nm)\n    spectral_data = {\n        \"Hydrogen\": [410.2, 434.0, 486.1, 656.3],\n        \"Helium\": [447.1, 492.2, 501.6, 587.6, 667.8],\n        \"Sodium\": [497.9, 514.9, 568.8, 589.0, 589.6, 615.4],\n        \"Mercury\": [404.7, 435.8, 546.1, 577.0, 579.1]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the provided emission spectrum...\")\n    print(\"The most distinctive feature is a very strong doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow region of the spectrum.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's compare this observation with the known spectral lines of a few elements:\\n\")\n\n    # The characteristic feature we are looking for is the yellow doublet around 589 nm.\n    target_wavelength_1 = 589.0\n    target_wavelength_2 = 589.6\n    identified_element = None\n\n    for element, lines in spectral_data.items():\n        print(f\"- {element}: {lines}\")\n        # Check if the element has the characteristic sodium D-lines\n        if target_wavelength_1 in lines and target_wavelength_2 in lines:\n            identified_element = element\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    if identified_element:\n        print(f\"The spectrum with a strong yellow doublet at {target_wavelength_1} nm and {target_wavelength_2} nm is characteristic of {identified_element}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not identify the element from the available data.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_element_from_spectrum()\n\n```\n<<<Sodium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
