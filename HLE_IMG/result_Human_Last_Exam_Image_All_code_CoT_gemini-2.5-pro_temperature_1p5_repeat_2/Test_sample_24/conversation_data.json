    "This image displays a well-known Heegaard diagram of genus 3. A Heegaard diagram represents a 3-dimensional manifold by splitting it into two handlebodies (doughnuts with multiple holes) glued along their boundary surfaces. The red (α) and blue (β) curves on the surface show how this gluing is performed.\n\nThe manifold represented by this specific diagram, which is based on the 1-skeleton of an octahedron, is the **Seifert-Weber space**. This is a celebrated example of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, meaning it has a geometry of constant negative curvature.\n\nTo confirm this identification and learn more about the manifold's properties, we can compute its first homology group, H₁(M, ℤ), which is the abelianization of its fundamental group, π₁(M). A known presentation for the fundamental group of the Seifert-Weber space comes from its construction by gluing the faces of a dodecahedron. This presentation has 5 generators (g₁, ..., g₅) and 5 relators. By abelianizing these relators, we obtain a system of linear equations whose integer solutions characterize the homology group. The matrix for this system can be analyzed using the Smith Normal Form. The diagonal entries of the resulting matrix reveal the structure of the homology group.\n\nThe Python code below uses the `sympy` library to construct the relation matrix and compute its Smith Normal Form, thereby identifying the first homology group of the Seifert-Weber space.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef identify_manifold_from_heegaard():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the 3-manifold from its Heegaard diagram by analyzing the\n    homology group derived from a known presentation of its fundamental group.\n    \n    The diagram represents the Seifert-Weber space.
