    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the total current in the circuit, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit Structure**: The circuit has a voltage source (V2) connected to two parallel branches.\n2.  **Analyze the Left Branch**: The left branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω). A wire connects the positive terminal directly to the node between R2 and R3. This wire creates a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2, meaning no current will flow through them. Thus, the only effective resistance in this branch is R3 (9 Ω).\n3.  **Analyze the Right Branch**: The right branch consists of resistors R8 (100 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω) connected in series. The total resistance of this branch is the sum of the individual resistances: R_right = R8 + R7 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n4.  **Calculate Individual Branch Currents**: Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), we can find the current in each branch:\n    *   `I_left = V2 / R3`\n    *   `I_right = V2 / R_right`\n5.  **Calculate Total Current**: The total current flowing from the source is the sum of the currents in the two parallel branches, according to Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n    *   `I_total = I_left + I_right`\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the values into the equation to find the total current.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup stdout and stderr\nstdout_backup = sys.stdout\nstderr_backup = sys.stderr\n# Redirect stdout and stderr to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = sys.stderr = io.StringIO()\n\n# Define the component values\nV2 = 1.0  # Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Ohms (short-circuited)\nR2 = 7.0  # Ohms (short-circuited)\nR3 = 9.0  # Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Ohms\n\n# --- Circuit Analysis & Calculation ---\n\n# Left branch analysis: R1 and R2 are shorted, so the current is determined by R3.\nI_left = V2 / R3\n\n# Right branch analysis: R7 and R8 are in series.\nR_right = R7 + R8\nI_right = V2 / R_right\n\n# Total current is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\nI_total = I_left + I_right\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n# Restore stdout and stderr\nsys.stdout = stdout_backup\nsys.stderr = stderr_backup\n\n# The final equation prints each number explicitly as requested.\nprint(\"To find the total current, we sum the currents of the two parallel branches.\")\nprint(\"The left branch resistance is R3 due to a short circuit across R1 and R2.\")\nprint(\"The right branch resistance is the sum of R7 and R8 in series.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Current = (V2 / R3) + (V2 / (R7 + R8))\")\nprint(f\"Total Current = ({V2} V / {R3} Ω) + ({V2} V / ({R7} Ω + {R8} Ω))\")\nprint(f\"Total Current = {I_left:.4f} A + {I_right:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"Total Current = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n\n# The final numerical answer in the required format\nfinal_answer_val = f\"<<<{I_total:.4f}>>>\"\n```"
