# The task is to identify the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.
# Based on analysis of the runic inscription style (horizontal bands)
# and transliteration of the runes, the stone is identified.

# Step 1: Identify the runestone's province and number.
# The runes and style match the Tystberga runestone in Södermanland, Sweden.
# "Sö" is the abbreviation for Södermanland.
province_code = "Sö"
# The catalog number for this stone is 173.
stone_number = 173

# Step 2: Combine the parts to form the full ID.
runestone_id = f"{province_code} {stone_number}"

# Step 3: Print the result clearly.
print(f"The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image is the Tystberga runestone.")
print(f"Its official catalog ID is composed of a province code '{province_code}' and a number.")
print(f"The final ID is {province_code} {stone_number}.")
