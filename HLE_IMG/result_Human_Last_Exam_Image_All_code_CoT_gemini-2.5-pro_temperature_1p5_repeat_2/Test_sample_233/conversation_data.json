    "My plan to identify the runestone ID is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Runes and Style**: I will carefully examine the runes in the provided image. The style of the inscription, with runes arranged in distinct horizontal bands separated by lines, is a major clue. The runes themselves are of the Younger Futhark alphabet, specifically the short-twig variant, which was common in Sweden during the Viking Age.\n2.  **Transliterate Key Phrases**: I will transliterate key sections of the text from the runes into Latin letters. This will provide searchable text fragments.\n    *   **Top Row**: The visible runes at the end of the top row can be transliterated as `...hruþmar` (`ᚼ ᚱ ᚢ ᚦ ᛘ ᛅ ᚱ`), which corresponds to the Old Norse name *Hróðmarr*.\n    *   **Middle Row**: This row clearly reads `faþur sin` (`ᚠ ᛅ ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ × ᛋ ᛁ ᚾ`), meaning \"their father\".\n    *   **Bottom Row**: This row starts with `...furu trikila...` (`ᚠ ᚢ ᚱ ᚢ × ᛏ ᚱ ᛁ ᚴ ᛁ ᛚ ᛅ`), part of the phrase `foru drængila`, meaning \"they travelled valiantly\".\n3.  **Search and Identify**: Using the combination of the distinctive horizontal style and the transliterated phrases (\"Hróðmarr\", \"faður sin\", \"foru drængila\"), I will search for a matching Ingvar runestone. This combination points directly to the **Tystberga Runestone**.\n4.  **Confirm the ID**: The Tystberga Runestone is catalogued in the *Sveriges runinskrifter* (Swedish Runic Inscriptions) project with the designation **Sö 173**, where \"Sö\" stands for the province of Södermanland.\n5.  **Generate Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that declares the components of this ID and prints the final answer. The script will explicitly output the number 173 as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n# Based on analysis of the runic inscription style (horizontal bands)\n# and transliteration of the runes, the stone is identified.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the runestone's province and number.\n# The runes and style match the Tystberga runestone in Södermanland, Sweden.\n# \"Sö\" is the abbreviation for Södermanland.\nprovince_code = \"Sö\"\n# The catalog number for this stone is 173.\nstone_number = 173\n\n# Step 2: Combine the parts to form the full ID.\nrunestone_id = f\"{province_code} {stone_number}\"\n\n# Step 3: Print the result clearly.\nprint(f\"The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image is the Tystberga runestone.\")\nprint(f\"Its official catalog ID is composed of a province code '{province_code}' and a number.\")\nprint(f\"The final ID is {province_code} {stone_number}.\")\n```\n<<<Sö 173>>>"
