    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly porous, with many visible holes (vesicles). This texture is characteristic of scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock is a breccia. Given the context of other volcanic rocks, it's likely a volcanic breccia.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored (white to light grey) and extremely porous with very fine vesicles. It appears lightweight. This is a classic example of pumice, another extrusive igneous rock that cooled so quickly from frothy lava that it's often buoyant.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock consists of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. The presence of large light-colored and dark crystals is typical of a pegmatite, which is an intrusive igneous rock known for its exceptionally large crystals.\n5.  **Code Generation:** I will write a Python script to store these identifications in a dictionary and then print them out in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A vesicular (holey) extrusive igneous rock. The reddish color is due to iron oxidation.',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia - A rock composed of angular fragments of volcanic rock cemented together.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A very light-colored, extremely porous (vesicular) volcanic rock formed during explosive eruptions.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - An intrusive igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals, indicating slow cooling deep underground.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen_id, description in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen_id}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
