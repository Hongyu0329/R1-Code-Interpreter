# The task is to identify the same bird from a set of images.
# By carefully comparing the unique scalloped feather pattern on the back of the target bird
# with all the options, we can find the matching individual.

# 1. Analyze the target image: The bird has a distinct scalloped pattern on its back.
#    The feathers have dark centers and light edges. The arrangement of these feathers,
#    especially on the upper back, is a key identifier.

# 2. Compare with options A-I:
#    - Images A, D, F, H, and I can be ruled out due to significant differences
#      in lighting, color, or pose.
#    - Images B, C, E, and G are strong contenders as they share a similar pose and pattern.

# 3. Detailed analysis of contenders:
#    - Upon close inspection of the feather pattern on the upper back (mantle), image G
#      shows an identical arrangement to the target image. The specific "flow" and clustering
#      of the scalloped feathers are a perfect match.
#    - The other options (B, C, E) have very similar patterns but show subtle differences
#      that distinguish them from the target bird.

# 4. Conclusion: Image G is the correct match.

# The following code will print the final answer.
correct_image = "G"
print(f"The image showing the same bird as the target is: {correct_image}")
