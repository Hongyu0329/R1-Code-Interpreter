    "My analysis of the image reveals a scene from Greek mythology painted on an Apulian red-figure vase. The scene involves multiple figures in and around a chariot.\n\n1.  **Scene Identification**: The collection of figures—a winged driver, a central figure ascending, an accompanying helmeted figure, and a fallen foe on the ground—is characteristic of the \"Apotheosis of Herakles.\" This depicts the hero Herakles (or Hercules) being escorted to Mount Olympus to become a god after his mortal death.\n\n2.  **Figure Identification**:\n    *   The winged figure driving the chariot is **Nike**, the goddess of Victory.\n    *   The helmeted figure also in the chariot is **Athena**, Herakles' divine patron.\n    *   The figure on the ground is a defeated enemy, likely **Cycnus**.\n    *   Therefore, the central figure who is shown ascending or \"leaving\" the chariot for the heavens is the hero **Herakles**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to formally state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_vase_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the main figure in the provided image of a Greek vase painting.\n    The scene is recognized as the Apotheosis of Herakles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The figure the user is asking about is the one ascending from the chariot.\n    ascending_figure = \"Herakles\"\n    roman_name = \"Hercules\"\n    \n    # Explain the identification based on the mythological context.\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot is the hero {ascending_figure} (known to the Romans as {roman_name}).\")\n    print(\"The scene depicted on the vase is his apotheosis, which is his ascent to Mount Olympus to join the gods.\")\n    print(\"He is being driven by the winged goddess Nike (Victory) and accompanied by his patron, the goddess Athena.\")\n\nidentify_vase_figure()\n```\n<<<Herakles>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
