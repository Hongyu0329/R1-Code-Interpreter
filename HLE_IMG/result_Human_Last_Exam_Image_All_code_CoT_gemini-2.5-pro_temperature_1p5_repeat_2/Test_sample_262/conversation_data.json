    "The user wants to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes are expected to have the shortest operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** I will examine the molecular structures of the four complexes. They are all cationic Iridium(III) complexes with two cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands (C^N) and one bidentate 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand (N^N). The key difference between them is the number and position of fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** The operational lifetime of these emitters is directly related to their chemical and electrochemical stability. A major strategy for enhancing the stability of such complexes is the fluorination of the C^N ligands.\n3.  **Apply Chemical Principles:** Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups. This fluorination leads to:\n    *   **Electronic Stabilization:** Lowering the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which makes the complex more difficult to oxidize. Oxidative degradation is a primary failure mode in these devices.\n    *   **Increased Bond Strength:** Strengthening the C-Ir and C-F bonds, making the complex more robust against chemical degradation pathways.\n    *   Therefore, a higher degree of fluorination generally correlates with higher stability and a longer device lifetime. Conversely, complexes with less fluorination are expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.\n4.  **Compare the Complexes:** I will count the number of fluorine atoms on the C^N ligands for each complex.\n    *   **Complex 1 & 2:** Have two fluorine atoms per C^N ligand (di-fluorinated).\n    *   **Complex 3 & 4:** Have only one fluorine atom per C^N ligand (mono-fluorinated).\n5.  **Draw Conclusion:** Based on the principle that less fluorination leads to lower stability, Complexes 3 and 4 are predicted to have shorter lifetimes compared to the more heavily fluorinated Complexes 1 and 2.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the numbers of the identified complexes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_lifetimes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chemical structures of four iridium complexes to predict which\n    will have shorter operational lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the key feature of each complex: the number of fluorine atoms on each cyclometalating ligand.\n    complex_features = {\n        1: 2,  # di-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand\n        2: 2,  # di-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand\n        3: 1,  # mono-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand\n        4: 1   # mono-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Iridium Complex Stability and Lifetime ---\")\n    print(\"\\nThe operational lifetime of an emitter in an LEC is largely determined by its chemical stability.\")\n    print(\"\\nA key factor for the stability of these iridium complexes is the fluorination of the phenylpyridine ligands.\")\n    print(\"\\nPrinciple: Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing.
