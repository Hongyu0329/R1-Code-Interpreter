    1.  The image shows a moss with a creeping, mat-forming habit.
    2.  The most distinctive feature is the appearance of the shoots, which look like braided cords or caterpillars.
    3.  This appearance is created by the small, sickle-shaped (falcate) leaves that are all turned in the same direction (secund).
    4.  This combination of features is characteristic of the genus Hypnum.
