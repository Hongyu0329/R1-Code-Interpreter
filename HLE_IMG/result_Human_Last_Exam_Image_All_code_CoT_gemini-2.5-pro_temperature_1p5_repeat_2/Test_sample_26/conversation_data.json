    "Here is my plan to solve this music theory problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is in C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** I will find measure 30 on the provided sheet music. It is the third measure on the second system.\n3.  **Analyze the Notes in Measure 30:** I will identify the notes played by both the right and left hands to determine the underlying chord.\n    *   **Left Hand:** The notes are G, B (natural), and D. This forms a G major triad.\n    *   **Right Hand:** The notes are a melodic figure (F♯, G, A♯, B). These notes are non-chord tones or tones that embellish the underlying harmony. The F# acts as a leading tone to the root G, and the A# is a chromatic passing tone to B.\n4.  **Determine the Chord's Function:** The fundamental chord is G major. In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G. A major triad built on the fifth degree is the dominant chord.\n5.  **Assign the Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a major dominant chord is a capital `V`.\n6.  **Create the Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print out this analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_roman_numeral_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st mvt.\n    and prints the corresponding Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    key_signature = \"C minor\"\n    measure_number = 30\n\n    # Notes in measure 30\n    left_hand_notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\"]\n    right_hand_notes = [\"F-sharp\", \"G\", \"A-sharp\", \"B-natural\"]\n    underlying_chord = \"G Major\"\n\n    # Analysis\n    root_of_chord = \"G\"\n    key_tonic = \"C\"\n    scale_degree = 5  # G is the 5th degree of the C minor scale\n\n    # In Roman numeral analysis, a major chord on the dominant (5th degree) is 'V'\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st mvt., measure {measure_number}:\")\n    print(f\"1. The key is {key_signature}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The notes in the left hand are {', '.join(left_hand_notes)}, forming a {underlying_chord} chord.\")\n    print(f\"3. In the key of {key_signature}, the note '{root_of_chord}' is the {scale_degree}th scale degree (the dominant).\")\n    print(f\"4. A major chord built on the dominant is represented by the Roman numeral '{roman_numeral}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct Roman numeral for measure {measure_number} is: {roman_numeral}\")\n\nget_roman_numeral_analysis()\n```\n<<<V>>>"
