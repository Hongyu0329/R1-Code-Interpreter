    "This is an identification task. My plan is to:\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure provided in the image. The molecule is a polycyclic organic compound containing nitrogen atoms, which identifies it as an alkaloid.\n2.  Specifically, it has a tetracyclic (four-ring) system. Two of the rings form a quinolizidine skeleton, which is common in lupin alkaloids.\n3.  A carbonyl group (C=O) is present as part of a six-membered lactam ring.\n4.  By comparing this specific structure, including the stereochemistry indicated by the wedged and dashed bonds, with a database of known alkaloids, I can identify it. The structure perfectly matches the alkaloid Lupanine.\n5.  I will then write a simple python script to print the name of the compound as requested.\n\n```python\n# The chemical structure provided is that of the alkaloid Lupanine.\n# This script will print the name of the compound.\n\ncompound_name = \"Lupanine\"\nprint(compound_name)\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
