        "S100B should be considered a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here's why:\n"
        "1. Direct Link to Pathology: The diagram clearly shows that the binding of S100B to RAGE directly initiates "
        "downstream signaling cascades (such as JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead to key pathological outcomes: apoptosis (cell death), "
        "production of proinflammatory cytokines, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.\n"
        "2. Correlation with Disease Severity: A prognostic marker's level correlates with the future course or severity of a disease. "
        "Since higher levels of S100B would lead to increased activation of these damaging pathways, measuring S100B concentration "
        "can provide a strong indication of the intensity of the disease process and thus predict a patient's prognosis. "
        "Elevated S100B levels would suggest a more aggressive disease course and a poorer outcome.\n"
        "An adjunct marker merely assists in diagnosis, but S100B's role goes beyond this by providing insight into the activity and progression of the neurological disorder."
