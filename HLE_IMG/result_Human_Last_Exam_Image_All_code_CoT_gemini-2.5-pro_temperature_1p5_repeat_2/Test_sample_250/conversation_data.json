    "This is a music theory and identification task. I will analyze the provided sheet music to determine the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Melody:** The first measure contains a very distinct melodic phrase: three repeated notes (C) followed by a half-step down to A♭ (from the key signature). This C-C-C-A♭ phrase over an F minor chord is highly recognizable.\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The piece is in the key of F minor. I will examine the chord changes in both the \"A\" section and the \"B\" section (bridge) to confirm the tune's identity.\n    *   The \"A\" section begins with a chromatic descending bass line implied by the chords: F- (bass F), E-7b5 (bass E), Eb-6 (bass Eb), Dbmaj7 (bass Db).\n    *   The \"B\" section features a sequence of ii-V and dominant chords (`D-7b5`, `G7`, `C7`, `F7`, `Bb-7`, `Eb7`, `Ab`), which is a common pattern in standard jazz bridges.\n3.  **Identify the Tune:** Based on the iconic opening melody and the characteristic chord progression, the tune is \"Nica's Dream\".\n4.  **Identify the Composer:** \"Nica's Dream\" was composed by the jazz pianist Horace Silver.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the identified title and composer as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_jazz_standard_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the jazz standard from its musical characteristics and prints the title and composer.\n    \n    The identification is based on:\n    1. The iconic opening melodic phrase (C-C-C-Ab over an F minor chord).\n    2. The chromatic descending harmony in the A section.\n    3. The ii-V based progression in the bridge.\n    \n    These elements are defining features of \"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nfind_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
