    This function identifies the jazz standard from its musical characteristics and prints the title and composer.
    
    The identification is based on:
    1. The iconic opening melodic phrase (C-C-C-Ab over an F minor chord).
    2. The chromatic descending harmony in the A section.
    3. The ii-V based progression in the bridge.
    
    These elements are defining features of "Nica's Dream" by Horace Silver.
