def find_possible_rules():
    """
    Based on a step-by-step analysis of the first three rows of the automaton,
    we found that two rules could have produced this initial segment of the pattern.
    The rest of the pattern in the image contains contradictions, meaning no single
    rule can generate the entire image.
    
    The determined rule bits are:
    - (111) -> 0  (bit 7)
    - (110) -> 1  (bit 6)
    - (101) -> ?  (bit 5 is undetermined by the first 3 rows)
    - (100) -> 1  (bit 4)
    - (011) -> 1  (bit 3)
    - (010) -> 1  (bit 2)
    - (001) -> 1  (bit 1)
    - (000) -> 0  (bit 0)
    
    This gives the binary pattern: 01?11110
    
    If the unknown bit is 0, the rule is 01011110, which is 94.
    If the unknown bit is 1, the rule is 01111110, which is 126.
