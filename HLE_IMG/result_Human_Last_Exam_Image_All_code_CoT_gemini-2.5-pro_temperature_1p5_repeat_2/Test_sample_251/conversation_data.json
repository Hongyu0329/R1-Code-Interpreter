    "My plan is to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip by following these steps:\n1.  **Determine the time calibration:** The ECG paper speed is provided as 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG consists of small 1 mm squares. Therefore, the time represented by one small horizontal square can be calculated.\n2.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** I will visually inspect the entire ECG strip to find the largest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes). There is a significant pause on the fourth strip, which appears to be the longest interval.\n3.  **Measure the interval:** I will count the number of small horizontal squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define this longest interval.\n4.  **Calculate the duration:** I will multiply the number of small squares counted in the previous step by the time per small square to get the total duration of the interval in seconds.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\nBased on my visual analysis, the longest R-R interval is in the fourth strip. I've counted that this interval spans approximately 56 small squares.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the ECG paper speed in mm/sec.\n# 2. Define the width of a small square in mm.\n# 3.
