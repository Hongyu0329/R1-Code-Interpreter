    This function identifies the product based on the clues provided.
    The advertisement shown is for Bovril, but the clues in the prompt
    point to a different product.

    Clue 1: Helped workers overcome limitations during WWII in Britain.
             This points to fortifying foods like Bovril or Marmite.
    Clue 2: Has a French-derived name. Bovril's name is Latin-based.
             Marmite's name comes from the French word for a cooking pot.

    Therefore, the product is Marmite.
