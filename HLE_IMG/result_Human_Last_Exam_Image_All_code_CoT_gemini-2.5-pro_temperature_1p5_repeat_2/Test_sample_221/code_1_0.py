# Parameters for the Goldberg Polyhedron identified from the image
# m > n is given as a hint
m = 4
n = 2

# All Goldberg polyhedra have 12 pentagonal faces.
P = 12

# The number of hexagonal faces H is calculated using the triangulation number T.
# T = m^2 + m*n + n^2
T = m**2 + m*n + n**2

# H = 10 * (T - 1)
H = 10 * (T - 1)

# The problem asks for the answer in the format m,n,H,P
# Let's print the values for clarity first
print(f"The identified parameters are m = {m}, n = {n}.")
print(f"The number of pentagonal faces is P = {P}.")
print(f"The triangulation number is T = {m}^2 + {m}*{n} + {n}^2 = {T}.")
print(f"The number of hexagonal faces is H = 10 * ({T} - 1) = {H}.")

# Now, print the final answer in the required format.
print("\nFinal Answer Format: m,n,H,P")
print(f"{m},{n},{H},{P}")
