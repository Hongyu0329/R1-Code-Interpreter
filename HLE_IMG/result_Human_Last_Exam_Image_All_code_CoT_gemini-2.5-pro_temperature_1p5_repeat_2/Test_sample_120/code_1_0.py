print("\n--- Part 2: Effect on Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI) ---")

print("Theoretical background:")
print("The nematic liquid crystal phase is stabilized by the parallel alignment of molecules. Adding a bulky lateral group, like a methyl group, increases the molecule's width and introduces steric hindrance. This makes it harder for molecules to pack closely, thereby disrupting and destabilizing the ordered nematic phase.")

print("\nPrediction:")
print("Because the methyl group disrupts the ordered nematic phase, the system will require less thermal energy to transition to the disordered isotropic liquid. Therefore, the nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI) is expected to decrease.")
