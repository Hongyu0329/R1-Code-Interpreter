The main difference is the seta (stalk of the sporophyte). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, which holds the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and strongly curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards.
