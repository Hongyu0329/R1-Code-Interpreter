    "Here is my plan to answer your question. First, I will identify the key morphological features of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* based on established botanical knowledge. The names themselves provide clues: *curviseta* suggests a curved seta (stalk). I will then compare these features to determine the most significant visual difference that allows for identification \"at a glance\". Finally, I will present this explanation in a clear format using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main difference lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n    \n    # Description for Grimmia montana\n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    seta1 = \"short and straight\"\n    capsule_orientation1 = \"erect and typically immersed among the leaves\"\n\n    # Description for Grimmia curviseta\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    seta2 = \"distinctly curved or S-shaped (cygneous)\"\n    capsule_orientation2 = \"nodding or hanging down, often exserted beyond the leaves\"\n\n    print(f\"The main distinguishing feature in the sporophyte between {species1} and {species2} is the seta (the stalk holding the spore capsule).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. In {species1}:\")\n    print(f\"   - The seta is {seta1}.\")\n    print(f\"   - This results in the capsule being held {capsule_orientation1}, as seen in the provided image.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"2. In {species2}:\")\n    print(f\"   - The seta is {seta2}.\")\n    print(f\"   - This causes the capsule to be {capsule_orientation2}.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"This difference in the seta's curvature and the resulting capsule orientation is the most reliable feature to distinguish the two species at a glance.\")\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the seta (stalk of the sporophyte). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, which holds the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and strongly curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards.>>>"
