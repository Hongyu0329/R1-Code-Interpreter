    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:** I will carefully count the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms in the initial reactant molecule shown in the image. The molecule is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1 (Formation of Intermediate 1):** The reaction with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is a standard method for removing the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. I will calculate the change in atomic composition by subtracting the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and adding one hydrogen atom to the nitrogen.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2 (Formation of Intermediate 2):** The reaction with Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. I will update the molecular formula accordingly.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3 (Formation of the Final Product):** The reaction with strong acid (4 N HCl) and heat causes the hydrolysis of the lactam (the cyclic amide). This reaction breaks the amide bond by adding one molecule of water (H2O), opening the ring to form a carboxylic acid and an amine. I will add the atoms of water to the formula of Intermediate 2 to find the final product's molecular formula.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that starts with the molecular formula of the initial reactant and sequentially applies the atomic changes for each reaction step, printing the formula of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product through a three-step synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 0: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Bicyclic core (C6H5F3NO skeleton): 6 C, 5 H, 3 F, 1 N, 1 O\n    # PMB group (p-methoxybenzyl, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3): 8 C, 9 H, 1 O\n    # Total Starting Material: C(6+8) H(5+9) F3 N1 O(1+1) = C14H14F3NO2\n    formula = {'C': 14, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the molecular formula:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Starting Material Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group with CAN.\n    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed and replaced with a single Hydrogen atom on the Nitrogen.\n    # Net change: -8 C, -8 H, -1 O.\n    formula['C'] -= 8\n    formula['H'] -= 9\n    formula['O'] -= 1\n    formula['H'] += 1  # Add H to the nitrogen\n    \n    print(f\"Reaction 1 (CAN, ACN/H2O): PMB group removal.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Hydrogenation of the C=C double bond with Pd/C, H2.\n    # This adds two Hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    \n    print(f\"Reaction 2 (Pd/C, H2): Hydrogenation of the alkene.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) with HCl.\n    # This adds one molecule of water (H2O), breaking the C-N amide bond.\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    formula['O'] += 1\n    \n    print(f\"Reaction 3 (4 N HCl, 70 C): Lactam hydrolysis.\")\n    final_formula_str = f\"C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}\"\n    \n    # Format the final formula, omitting 1s for N and F3 instead of F3.\n    final_formula_str_formatted = f\"C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}NO{formula['O']}\"\n\n    print(f\"Final Product Formula: {final_formula_str_formatted}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n\n```\n<<<C6H10F3NO2>>>"
