    "Here is my thinking process to solve the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃.**\n    *   This is a classic **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** reaction.\n    *   The electrophile, the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂CO⁺), is generated from the reaction of propanoyl chloride with the Lewis acid AlCl₃.\n    *   The benzene ring attacks this electrophile to form a ketone.\n    *   **Intermediate-1** is **propiophenone** (also named 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Propiophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃.**\n    *   This is an **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**.\n    *   The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) already on the ring is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2** is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one + H₂/Pd.**\n    *   This is a **Catalytic Hydrogenation**.\n    *   The H₂/Pd reagent is a powerful reducing agent. It is commonly used to reduce benzylic ketones (a ketone attached to a benzene ring) completely down to an alkane (C=O becomes CH₂).\n    *   Additionally, H₂/Pd can also perform hydrogenolysis on aryl halides, cleaving the carbon-halogen bond and replacing the halogen with a hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, both the ketone group and the bromo group are reduced.\n    *   **Intermediate-3** is **propylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Propylbenzene + NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄.**\n    *   This is a **Radical Halogenation**, specifically a **Wohl-Ziegler reaction**.\n    *   NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a reagent used for selective bromination at the allylic or **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of an alkyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   (PhCO₂)₂, benzoyl peroxide, is a radical initiator that starts the reaction.\n    *   The reaction substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group with a bromine atom because the resulting benzylic radical is the most stable (stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring).\n    *   The **Final Product** is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that walks through these steps and prints the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in a multi-step organic synthesis\n    to identify the name of the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reaction Sequence Analysis ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    step1_desc = \"Step 1 involves the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3.\"\n    intermediate1_name = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(step1_desc)\n    print(\"Intermediate-1 is: {}\\n\".format(intermediate1_name))\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    step2_desc = \"Step 2 is the bromination of propiophenone using Br2/FeBr3. The acyl group is a meta-director.\"\n    intermediate2_name = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(step2_desc)\n    print(\"Intermediate-2 is: {}\\n\".format(intermediate2_name))\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\n    step3_desc = \"Step 3 is the catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd.
