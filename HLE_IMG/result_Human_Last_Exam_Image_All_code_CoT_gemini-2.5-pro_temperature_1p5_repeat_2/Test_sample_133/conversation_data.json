    "Here is my plan to identify the compound from the mass spectrum:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion Region**: I will examine the peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to determine the molecular weight and to look for characteristic isotopic patterns. The pattern of peaks can reveal the presence of elements like chlorine or bromine.\n2.  **Identify Key Fragments**: I will analyze the most intense peaks (especially the base peak, which has 100% relative intensity) and the fragments lost from the molecular ion to create them. The mass differences will correspond to neutral losses (e.g., Cl, H2O, CO, CH3).\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**: Using the molecular weight and the elemental information from isotopic patterns (like the presence of chlorine), I will deduce a plausible molecular formula for the compound. The \"Rule of Thirteen\" can be a useful starting point, and the formula will be refined based on all available data. I will also calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get clues about the presence of rings or double bonds.\n4.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**: Based on the molecular formula, DBE, and the fragmentation pattern (how the molecule breaks apart), I will propose a chemical structure. Finally, I will provide the systematic IUPAC name for this proposed structure.\n\nI will now execute the plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    Prints the step-by-step analysis and the final IUPAC name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the provided table and graph\n    # Molecular Ion (M+) region analysis\n    mz_260 = 260\n    intensity_260 = 34.8\n    mz_262 = 262\n    intensity_262 = 29.0\n    mz_264 = 264\n    intensity_264 = 12.9\n    \n    # Base Peak analysis\n    base_peak_mz = 225\n    base_peak_intensity = 100\n    m_plus_2_fragment_mz = 227\n    m_plus_2_fragment_intensity = 66.7\n\n    atomic_mass_cl = 35\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze Isotopic Patterns and Fragments\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Analysis of the base peak cluster\n    fragment_isotope_ratio = base_peak_intensity / m_plus_2_fragment_intensity\n    # Theoretical ratio for 2 Chlorine atoms (A/A+2) for a fragment is approx. 3:2 or 1.5\n    # Precise ratio: (0.758)^2 / (2 * 0.758 * 0.242) = 0.5745 / 0.3668 = 1.566\n    print(f\"The base peak is at m/z = {base_peak_mz}.\")\n    print(f\"There is a corresponding peak at m/z = {m_plus_2_fragment_mz} with intensity {m_plus_2_fragment_intensity}%.\")\n    print(f\"The intensity ratio of the fragment peaks at {base_peak_mz} and {m_plus_2_fragment_mz} is {base_peak_intensity:.1f} / {m_plus_2_fragment_intensity:.1f} = {fragment_isotope_ratio:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"This ratio is characteristic of a fragment containing two chlorine atoms.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the Molecular Ion (M+)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    # Finding the molecular ion by adding the lost fragment to the base peak\n    mass_lost = mz_260 - base_peak_mz\n    print(f\"A prominent peak cluster is observed around m/z = {mz_260}-{mz_264}.\")\n    print(f\"The mass difference between the peak at m/z = {mz_260} and the base peak at m/z = {base_peak_mz} is {mz_260} - {base_peak_mz} = {mass_lost}.\")\n    print(f\"This mass loss of {mass_lost} corresponds to a chlorine atom (Cl).\")\n    print(f\"This suggests the molecular ion M+ is at m/z = {mz_260} and the molecule contains three chlorine atoms.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n    mass_of_3_cl = 3 * atomic_mass_cl\n    mass_of_ch_part = mz_260 - mass_of_3_cl\n    num_carbons = mass_of_ch_part // 12\n    num_hydrogens = mass_of_ch_part % 12\n    \n    print(f\"Assuming the molecular ion (with all 35Cl isotopes) is at m/z = {mz_260}:\")\n    print(f\"The mass contribution from three chlorine atoms is 3 * {atomic_mass_cl} = {mass_of_3_cl}.\")\n    print(f\"The mass of the rest of the molecule (CxHy) is {mz_260} - {mass_of_3_cl} = {mass_of_ch_part}.\")\n    print(f\"Using the Rule of Thirteen, we can determine the formula of this part: {mass_of_ch_part} / 12 = {num_carbons} with a remainder of {num_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a formula of C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the overall molecular formula is C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}Cl3.\")\n    \n    # Fragmentation Pathway\n    mz_190 = 190\n    mz_155 = 155\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Confirm with Fragmentation Pathway\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The proposed formula C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}Cl3 explains the major fragmentation pathway:\")\n    print(f\"  m/z {mz_260} ([C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}Cl3]+) -> loss of Cl\")\n    print(f\"  m/z {base_peak_mz} ([C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}Cl2]+) -> loss of Cl\")\n    print(f\"  m/z {mz_190} ([C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}Cl]+) -> loss of Cl\")\n    print(f\"  m/z {mz_155} ([C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}]+)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Propose Structure and IUPAC Name\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n    # This spectrum is characteristic of the pesticide Perthane, though the name is sometimes used for different structures.\n    # The systematic analysis points to C12H11Cl3.\n    # A specific isomer that fits this data and fragmentation pattern is a diphenylethane derivative.\n    # However, finding the exact isomer is challenging.
