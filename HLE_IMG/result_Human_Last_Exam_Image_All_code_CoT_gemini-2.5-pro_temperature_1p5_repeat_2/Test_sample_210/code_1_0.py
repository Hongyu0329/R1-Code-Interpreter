    This function identifies the matching nyala.

    Steps for identification:
    1.  Observe the key features of the 'Target' nyala, such as horn shape, stripe patterns, and especially the unique pattern of white spots on its flank.
    2.  The Target has a distinct cluster of spots on its rear flank: a small triangle of three spots with a single spot below them.
    3.  Compare this specific spot pattern with the nyalas in options A through F.
    4.  Nyala 'B' is the only individual that shares this exact, unique spot pattern.
    5.  Other features, like the horn shape and the white dorsal crest, are also consistent between the Target and nyala 'B'.
    6.  Therefore, 'B' is the correct answer.
    """
