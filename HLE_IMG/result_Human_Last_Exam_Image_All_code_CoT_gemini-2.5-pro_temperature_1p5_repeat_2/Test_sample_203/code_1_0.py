# The three purple polygons in the figure are identical copies of a single shape.
# This shape is a specific non-convex decagon (10-sided polygon) built from 10 equilateral triangles, known as a chiral deca-polyiamond.

# The Heesch number of a shape is the maximum number of layers of congruent copies that can surround it.
# A key property is that if a shape can tile the plane, its Heesch number is infinite.

# This particular deca-polyiamond is known in geometry to be a shape that tiles the plane.
# The tilings it forms are aperiodic, but it does cover the plane completely.

# Therefore, by definition, the Heesch number for this polygon is infinity.
# Since all three polygons in the figure are the same, they all have the same Heesch number.

heesch_number = "$\\infty$"

# The problem asks for the Heesch number for each of the three polygons.
# We will print the answer for all three, separated by commas.
