    "My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Visually Identify Bursts:** I will inspect the provided raster plot to locate the distinct, vertical bands of high firing activity. These represent synchronized network bursts.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** For each identified burst, I will estimate the timestamp corresponding to the center of the activity from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final result will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step, including the final equation, for clarity.\n\nBased on my visual analysis of the plot, I have identified four major synchronized bursts at the following approximate timestamps: 2.5 s, 16.5 s, 34.5 s, and 47.5 s. I will now use these values in the Python script to calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the timestamps of the synchronized bursts identified from the graph.\n# These are the approximate centers of the dense vertical firing bands.\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 16.5, 34.5, 47.5]\nprint(f\"Identified synchronized burst timestamps: {burst_timestamps} s\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), which are the differences\n# between consecutive timestamps.\nintervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the inter-burst intervals (IBIs):\")\nfor i, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]:.1f} s - {burst_timestamps[i]:.1f} s = {interval:.1f} s\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average of these intervals.\naverage_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n# Step 4: Display the final calculation and the result rounded to two significant figures.\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\ninterval_sum_str = \" + \".join([f\"{i:.1f}\" for i in intervals])\nprint(f\"Average IBI = ({interval_sum_str}) s / {len(intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average IBI = {np.sum(intervals):.1f} s / {len(intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average IBI = {average_interval:.3f} s\")\n\n# The result 15.0 has three significant figures. To two significant figures, it is 15.\n# We use the 'g' format specifier to handle this correctly.\nfinal_answer = f\"{average_interval:.2g}\"\nprint(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
