    print("----------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The spectrum displays several distinct signals. The most informative are:")
    print(" - A triplet at 1.1 ppm and a quartet at 2.7 ppm. This combination is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).")
    print(" - A broad singlet at 8.8 ppm, characteristic of an amide N-H proton.")
    print(" - A sharp singlet at 2.3 ppm, corresponding to an aromatic methyl group.")
    print("\nStep 2: Elimination of incorrect candidates.")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("Candidates A-G and B-G contain dimethylamino groups (-N(CH3)2), not diethylamino groups.")
    print("They would not produce the ethyl group's triplet and quartet signals. Thus, A-G and B-G are eliminated.")
    print("\nStep 3: Differentiation between the remaining candidates C-L and D-L.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Both C-L and D-L contain the ethyl groups and the amide N-H consistent with the spectrum.")
    print("The key difference is the number of methyl groups on the aromatic ring:")
    print(" - Structure C-L has one aromatic methyl group (3H).")
    print(" - Structure D-L has two aromatic methyl groups (6H).")
    print("We must check the integration of the aromatic methyl singlet at 2.3 ppm to decide.")
    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion based on integration.")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("Let's use the triplet at 1.1 ppm as our reference integral. It corresponds to the two methyls of the diethylamino group, N(CH2-CH3)2, so its integral value is 6H.")
    print("The final comparison is:")
    print("Integral of Triplet (at 1.1 ppm) = 6H")
    print("The integral of the Singlet (at 2.3 ppm) in the spectrum is clearly smaller than the triplet, estimated to be about half. This is consistent with 3H.")
    print("Prediction for C-L: Integral = 3H")
    print("Prediction for D-L: Integral = 6H")
    print("The experimental data matches the prediction for C-L.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: The structure that fully matches the spectrum is C-L.")
