    "Based on the visual evidence, the image depicts a biological process occurring in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus. Here is a step-by-step analysis of what is happening across the panels:\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel L:** This panel shows a straight, multi-cellular filament, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha. An arrowhead points to a specific location on a subapical cell (a cell behind the tip cell).\n2.  **Analyze Panel M:** This panel shows a later stage. At the exact spot indicated by the arrowhead in the previous panel, a distinct swelling or bud has formed, pushing out from the side of the hypha. The main filament is beginning to curve.\n3.  **Analyze Panel N:** In this final stage, the swelling has elongated significantly, forming a new hyphal branch. This new branch growth has caused the main filament to bend sharply.\n\n**Conclusion:** The sequence from L to N clearly illustrates the process of **hyphal branching**, a fundamental mechanism for growth and colonization in fungi. A new branch is initiated from the side of an existing hypha, develops, and elongates.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the provided image series (L, M, N) and describes the depicted biological process.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_description = (\n      \"The image displays the process of hyphal branching in a filamentous fungus.\\n\\n\"\n      \"The sequence of images (L, M, N) shows a time-lapse of this event:\\n\"\n      \"1. In image L, a location on a subapical cell of a hypha is indicated by an arrowhead.\\n\"\n      \"2. In image M, a small outgrowth or bud emerges from this location.\\n\"\n      \"3. In image N, this outgrowth has elongated into a new, distinct branch, causing the original filament to bend.\"\n  )\n  print(process_description)\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted in the image is hyphal branching in a fungus.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
