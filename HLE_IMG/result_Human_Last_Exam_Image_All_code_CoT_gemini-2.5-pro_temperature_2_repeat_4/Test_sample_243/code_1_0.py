    Solves the riddle about the plant's endemic island.
    
    The plant in the image appears to be Ficus deltoidea, which is widespread
    in Southeast Asia. However, the question "was endemic to" strongly suggests
    it refers to a plant that is famously extinct from a single island. The
    most prominent example is the Saint Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica),
    which was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.
    This function will print the name of that island.
