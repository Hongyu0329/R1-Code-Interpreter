    "The plant shown in the image is a variety of *Ficus deltoidea*, commonly known as the Mistletoe Fig. This species is native to a broad region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and other islands, so it is not endemic to a single specific island.\n\nHowever, the question's specific phrasing, \"...was endemic to,\" suggests it is referring to a plant that is now extinct or has had its conservation status change. The most famous example of a plant that was endemic to a single island and has since gone extinct is the Saint Helena Olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). It's likely the question refers to this plant, even though the image provided is of a different species. The Saint Helena Olive was found only on the island of Saint Helena, with the last living individual dying in 2003.\n\nBased on this deduction, the code below will print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle about the plant's endemic island.\n    \n    The plant in the image appears to be Ficus deltoidea, which is widespread\n    in Southeast Asia. However, the question \"was endemic to\" strongly suggests\n    it refers to a plant that is famously extinct from a single island. The\n    most prominent example is the Saint Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica),\n    which was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.\n    This function will print the name of that island.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Name of the island where the famously extinct Saint Helena Olive was endemic.\n    island = \"Saint Helena\"\n    \n    print(island)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
