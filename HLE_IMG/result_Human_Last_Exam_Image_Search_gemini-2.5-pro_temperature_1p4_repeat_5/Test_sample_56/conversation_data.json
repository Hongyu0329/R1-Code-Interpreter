    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe painting is titled \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Holes in the Memory.\" It is a well-known work by the Swiss surrealist painter.\n\nDominique Appia (1926-2017) was a Geneva-based artist known for his dreamlike and imaginative scenes. His paintings often juxtapose familiar elements in surreal ways, such as a cathedral turning into a railway station or the sea flooding a room from a doorway, as seen in this piece. Appia's work frequently explores the themes of the four elements: air, water, fire, and earth. Although his style is often compared to Salvador Dalí's, Appia has a unique and distinct artistic voice.\n\nAn interesting detail in \"Entre les trous de la mémoire\" is the depiction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in a framed picture on the wall. The frame is tilted in such a way that the tower itself appears perfectly straight, a witty and surrealist touch by the artist.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
