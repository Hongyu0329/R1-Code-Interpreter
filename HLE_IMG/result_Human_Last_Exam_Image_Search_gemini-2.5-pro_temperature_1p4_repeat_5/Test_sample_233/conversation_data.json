    "Based on the analysis of the runic inscription visible in the image fragment, the runestone can be identified. The key features are the distinct grid-like layout of the runes and the partial transcription of the text.\n\nVisible in the image are parts of at least three lines of text, which can be transcribed from Younger Futhark runes as:\n*   `...þurþr...`\n*   `...sata...`\n*   `...iftiR...` (a common word meaning \"in memory of\")\n\nA search for Ingvar runestones with these characteristics points to the **Sö 281** runestone. The full inscription of this stone contains these fragments. This runestone is one of the 26 memorials raised for those who died during Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland (the lands of the Saracens).\n\nThe Sö 281 stone is fragmented and is now immured in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. The image in the query is a close-up of a portion of this runestone's inscription.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
