    "Based on the organisms visible in the photograph, the species that definitively indicates the location is on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle, whose scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key indicators in the image:\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** **(Common Periwinkle)**: The snail with the prominent, striped, conical shell is the Common Periwinkle. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coast (Europe) and was introduced to the northwestern Atlantic coast (North America) in the 19th century. It is now abundant on the Atlantic shores of North America but is not established on the Pacific Coast. Its presence is therefore a strong sign of an Atlantic location.\n\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** **(Atlantic Dog Whelk)**: The smoother, whitish snail is likely the Atlantic Dog Whelk. This predatory snail is common on rocky shores on both sides of the North Atlantic but is absent from the Pacific Ocean. The shell color of *Nucella lapillus* can be quite variable, and white is a common form.\n\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** **(Northern Rock Barnacle)**: The abundant barnacles covering the rock are characteristic of the Northern Rock Barnacle. While this species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, its co-occurrence with *Littorina littorea* and *Nucella lapillus* strongly supports an Atlantic setting.\n\nBoth *Littorina littorea* and *Nucella lapillus* are exclusive to the Atlantic. However, the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is easily identified by its distinct shape and markings in the photograph, making it a clear indicator.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
