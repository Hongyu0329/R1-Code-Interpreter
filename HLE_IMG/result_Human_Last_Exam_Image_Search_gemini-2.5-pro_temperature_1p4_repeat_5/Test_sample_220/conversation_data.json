    "To identify the correct pattern, we must know the characteristic projection of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice when viewed along the crystallographic direction.\n\n1.  **FCC Structure:** In an FCC lattice, atoms are located at each corner of a cube and in the center of each of the six faces.\n2.  ** Projection:** When viewing this structure along the direction, the atoms project onto a 2D plane. The resulting repeating pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means that if you define a rectangular unit cell using atoms at the corners, there will also be an atom in the geometric center of that rectangle.\n\nNow let's analyze the provided images based on this known pattern:\n\n*   **Image A:** This pattern shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but not in the centers. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image B:** This pattern displays a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This is the characteristic view of an FCC (or BCC) lattice viewed along the direction, which is the close-packed direction in an FCC structure.\n*   **Image C:** This pattern shows a rectangular arrangement of atoms where, in addition to the corner points, there are atoms in the center of the rectangular cells. If you outline a rectangle using four of the atoms as corners, you can find another atom in the center of this rectangle. This matches the description of a centered rectangular pattern, which is the correct projection for an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image D:** This pattern shows a rectangular (or square) grid with atoms at the corners and one in the body center. This is the characteristic projection of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the direction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pattern in Image C is the one that indicates a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
