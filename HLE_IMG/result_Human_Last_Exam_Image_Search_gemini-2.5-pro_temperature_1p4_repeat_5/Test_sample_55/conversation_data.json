    "The notes circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a C-sharp diminished seventh chord. In the key of D minor, the Roman numeral for this chord is **vii°7**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The key is D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The notes played in the circled portion are C-sharp and E in the left hand (bass clef), and G and B-flat in the right hand (treble clef).\n*   **Chord Identification:** Together, these notes (C♯, E, G, B♭) form a C-sharp diminished seventh chord.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of D minor, C-sharp is the leading tone (the seventh scale degree). A diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone is represented by the Roman numeral vii°7. This chord has a strong tendency to resolve to the tonic (D minor).\n\n<<<vii°7>>>"
