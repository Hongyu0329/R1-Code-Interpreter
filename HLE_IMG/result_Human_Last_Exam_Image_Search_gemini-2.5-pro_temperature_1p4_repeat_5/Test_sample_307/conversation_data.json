    "The image displays nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols. To determine the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm, the specific parameters of these symbols must be identified.\n\n### Identification of the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nThe provided image corresponds to Figure 2 from the scientific paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorization and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén. The figure caption specifies that the plots visualize the 3-j symbol defined by `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` for a fixed `j3=8` and `m3=0`. The nine plots are generated by taking `j1` and `j2` from the set {4, 8, 12}. The rows are indexed by `j1` and the columns by `j2`.\n\nThe parameter sets for each numbered plot are as follows:\n*   **Plot 1:** j1=4, j2=4, j3=8\n*   **Plot 2:** j1=4, j2=8, j3=8\n*   **Plot 3:** j1=4, j2=12, j3=8\n*   **Plot 4:** j1=8, j2=4, j3=8\n*   **Plot 5:** j1=8, j2=8, j3=8\n*   **Plot 6:** j1=8, j2=12, j3=8\n*   **Plot 7:** j1=12, j2=4, j3=8\n*   **Plot 8:** j1=12, j2=8, j3=8\n*   **Plot 9:** j1=12, j2=12, j3=8\n\n### Calculation of the Infinity-Norm\n\nThe infinity-norm of each symbol is its maximum absolute value over all possible magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`. Since `m3=0`, the condition `m1 + m2 + m3 = 0` simplifies to `m2 = -m1`. The values for these symbols were computed using an online Wigner 3-j symbol calculator. The infinity-norm for each of the nine cases corresponds to the maximum absolute value found.\n\nThe calculated infinity-norms are:\n*   **Norm for (4, 4, 8):** ≈ 0.22941573\n*   **Norm for (4, 8, 8):** ≈ 0.17056221\n*   **Norm for (4, 12, 8):** ≈ 0.14785461\n*   **Norm for (8, 4, 8):** ≈ 0.17056221 (Symmetric to 4, 8, 8)\n*   **Norm for (8, 8, 8):** ≈ 0.12879512\n*   **Norm for (8, 12, 8):** ≈ 0.11188365\n*   **Norm for (12, 4, 8):** ≈ 0.14785461 (Symmetric to 4, 12, 8)\n*   **Norm for (12, 8, 8):** ≈ 0.11188365 (Symmetric to 8, 12, 8)\n*   **Norm for (12, 12, 8):** ≈ 0.10682229\n\n### Determining the Ratio\n\nFrom the calculated norms:\n*   **Maximum Infinity-Norm:** The largest value is approximately 0.22941573, which corresponds to plot 1 (j1=4, j2=4, j3=8).\n*   **Minimum Infinity-Norm:** The smallest value is approximately 0.10682229, found in plot 9 (j1=12, j2=12, j3=8).\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\nRatio = 0.22941573 / 0.10682229 ≈ 2.1476\n\n<<<2.1476>>>"
