    "Based on the analysis of the provided reaction scheme, the molecular formula of the final product can be determined by following the two consecutive reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing dimethoxyethane (DME). This type of reaction, involving a 2-aminoheterocycle and an α-halo-β-ketoester, is known to produce a fused heterocyclic system. Specifically, it leads to the formation of a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine skeleton. The reaction proceeds through an initial nucleophilic substitution where the amino group of the thiazole displaces the chloride, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. The resulting intermediate is ethyl 7-methyl-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate.\n\nThe molecular formula for this intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₃S) is calculated by combining the reactants (C₃H₄N₂S and C₆H₉ClO₃) and subtracting the elements of the leaving groups (HCl and H₂O).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the amidation of the ethyl ester intermediate. The reaction uses trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) to facilitate the reaction between the ethyl ester and benzylamine. In this process, the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nTo determine the molecular formula of the final product, we perform an atom count based on this transformation:\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₃S\n*   **Remove Ethoxy Group (-OC₂H₅):** Subtract C₂, H₅, O₁\n*   **Add Benzylamino Group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅):** Add C₇, H₈, N₁\n*   **Net Change:** +5 Carbon, +3 Hydrogen, +1 Nitrogen, -1 Oxygen\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon:** 9 + 5 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 3 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen:** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen:** 3 - 1 = 2\n*   **Sulfur:** 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃O₂S.\n\n<<<C14H13N3O2S>>>"
