    "Based on a visual analysis and search of protein structure databases, the protein shown in the image is the **Human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UBE2K)** in complex with ubiquitin.\n\nThis enzyme, also known as Huntingtin-interacting protein 2 (HIP-2), is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a critical process for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. The structure depicted shows the E2-25K enzyme (in dark blue) bound to a ubiquitin molecule (the smaller, light blue peptide). This interaction is crucial for the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains, which can lead to proteasomal inhibition and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity associated with diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nThe specific structural representation corresponds to entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), such as 3K9P, which details the crystal structure of the human E2-25K/ubiquitin complex. The enzyme itself is composed of a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain.\n\n<<<Human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UBE2K)>>>"
