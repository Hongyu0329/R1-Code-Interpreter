    "The figure leaving the chariot is **Hippodamia**, and the scene depicted on this Attic red-figure pelike is the mythical chariot race between her suitor Pelops and her father, King Oinomaos.\n\nThis specific vessel is attributed to the Triptolemos Painter and is housed at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland (accession number 48.209).\n\nThe key elements of the myth illustrated on the vase are:\n*   **The Charioteer:** The figure driving the chariot is Pelops. He sought to win the hand of Hippodamia.\n*   **The Figure Leaving the Chariot:** This is Hippodamia, daughter of King Oinomaos. According to the myth, her father had killed numerous previous suitors after defeating them in a chariot race, as a prophecy foretold he would be killed by his son-in-law.\n*   **The Fallen Figure:** The man on the ground is King Oinomaos, who has just been defeated and killed. The wheels of his chariot came off during the race, leading to his death. In some versions, this was due to sabotage arranged by Pelops with the king's own charioteer, Myrtilus.\n*   **The Winged Figure:** The winged figure is Nike, the goddess of victory, who is shown crowning the victor, Pelops.\n\nThis story was a foundational myth for the ancient Olympic Games, which were sometimes said to have been established by Pelops to celebrate his victory. The dramatic chariot race between Pelops and Oinomaos was a popular subject in Greek art, famously appearing on the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
