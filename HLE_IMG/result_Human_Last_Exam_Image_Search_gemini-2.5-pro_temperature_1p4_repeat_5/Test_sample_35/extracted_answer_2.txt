The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an adjunct marker and, more powerfully, as a prognostic marker for neurological disorders. Its lack of specificity prevents it from being a sole diagnostic tool, but its direct correlation with pathogenic cascades leading to neurodegeneration and cell death makes it highly valuable for predicting disease outcomes.
