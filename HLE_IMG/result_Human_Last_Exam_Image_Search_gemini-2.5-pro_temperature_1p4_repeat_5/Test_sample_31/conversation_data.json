    "The knot depicted in the image is the cinquefoil knot, also known by the notation 5_1. This knot is a member of the torus knot family, specifically the T(5,2) torus knot.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is a value derived from a branch of mathematics known as Khovanov homology. This integer invariant provides a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the knot's signature.\n\nFor the 5_1 knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is -4.\n\n<<<âˆ’4>>>"
