    "### Final Analysis and Conclusion\n\nThe detailed analysis of all the provided spectra (MS, IR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC) points towards a molecular formula of C9H13N with four degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe breakdown of the spectroscopic data is as follows:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z 135 suggests a molecular weight of 135 g/mol. Applying the nitrogen rule (odd molecular weight implies an odd number of nitrogen atoms) and calculating the degrees of unsaturation for the most plausible formula, C9H13N, gives a value of 4, indicating an aromatic ring.\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows absorptions characteristic of aromatic C-H stretching (>3000 cm⁻¹), aliphatic C-H stretching (<3000 cm⁻¹), and aromatic C=C stretching (~1600, 1450 cm⁻¹). There are also signals in the N-H stretching region (~3300-3400 cm⁻¹).\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectroscopy:** Seven distinct carbon signals are observed.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Four signals at δ 145.1 (quaternary C), 128.5 (CH), 127.3 (CH), and 126.3 (CH) ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl group where the ortho and meta carbons are nearly equivalent or overlapping.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Three signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment confirms the presence of one CH₂ group (negative signal), and five positive signals corresponding to CH and CH₃ groups. Combined with the ¹³C data, we can assign the signal at 43.5 ppm as the CH₂ group. The signals at 19.2 ppm (a methyl group) and 49.6 ppm (a methine group), along with the three aromatic CH carbons, account for the five positive signals. The signal at 145.1 ppm is absent, confirming it is a quaternary carbon.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A multiplet at ~7.2 ppm integrating to 5 protons confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.8 ppm integrating to 1 proton (-CH-).\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.7 ppm integrating to 2 protons (-CH₂-).\n    *   A doublet at ~1.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons (-CH₃).\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbons:\n    *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at 2.7 ppm (CH₂) correlates with ¹³C at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at 2.8 ppm (CH) correlates with ¹³C at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   Aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n*   **Structure Assembly:** The fragments identified are a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), a methyl group (-CH₃), and an amino group (-NH₂), which accounts for the complete molecular formula of C9H13N. The splitting pattern of the methyl group (a doublet) indicates it is attached to the methine carbon. The chemical shifts of the benzylic protons and carbons support the connection of the methylene group to the phenyl ring.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure Phenyl-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃. The IUPAC name for this compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. This structure and its spectral data are consistent with literature values for amphetamine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
