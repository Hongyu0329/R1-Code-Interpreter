    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata is V7.\n\nThe \"Pathétique\" sonata is in the key of C minor. An analysis of the notes in measure 30 reveals the chord G-B♮-D-F. This chord functions as the dominant seventh (V7) of the home key.\n\nIn the key of C minor, the dominant chord is built on the fifth scale degree, which is G. While the natural minor scale would produce a G minor chord (G-B♭-D), composers frequently raise the seventh degree of the minor scale (B♭ to B♮) to create a \"leading tone,\" which resolves more strongly to the tonic. This alteration changes the dominant chord from minor to major (G-B♮-D). The chord in measure 30 includes this raised leading tone (B♮) and adds the minor seventh (F), forming a G dominant seventh chord, or G7. Harmonic analyses refer to this passage as featuring broken V chords that establish the key of C minor.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
