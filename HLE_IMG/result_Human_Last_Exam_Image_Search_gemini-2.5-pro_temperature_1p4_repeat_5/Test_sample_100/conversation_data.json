    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must analyze the reaction sequence step by step.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. It has a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Core bicyclic lactam with CF3 group (C7H5F3NO)\n        *   PMB group (p-CH3O-C6H4-CH2-) (C8H9O)\n        *   Combining these gives the starting material's formula: **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **First Reaction (Intermediate 1):** The starting material is treated with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN). CAN is a common oxidizing agent used to remove the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. This reaction replaces the PMB group (C8H9O) with a single hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Change in Formula:** -(C8H9O) + H = -C8H8O\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3NO(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Second Reaction (Intermediate 2):** Intermediate 1 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** +H2\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Third Reaction (Product):** Intermediate 2 is treated with strong acid (4 N HCl) at an elevated temperature. These are standard conditions for the hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond within the bicyclic system is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). This opens the ring to form a molecule containing both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Change in Formula:** +H2O\n    *   **Formula of the Product:** C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid with the molecular formula C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
