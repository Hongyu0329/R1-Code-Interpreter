    "Based on my analysis and the information gathered, I will proceed to determine the sexes for each pair.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left (A1) has a distinctively long, pointed, conical abdomen. This is a key characteristic of female *Coelioxys* bees, which use this specialized shape to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. The insect on the right (A2) is likely a female *Triepeolus*, another type of cuckoo bee. In *Triepeolus*, one way to differentiate sexes can be eye color, with males often having paler eyes, but this is not clear in the photo. However, the overall robust body shape is more typical of a female. Both bees are types of cuckoo bees, which lack scopae because they are kleptoparasites. Therefore, this pair is Female, Female. This corresponds to option **2**.\n\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** These appear to be *Polistes* paper wasps. In many *Polistes* species, a reliable way to distinguish the sexes is by the antennae. Males often have antennae with curled or hooked tips, while females' antennae are straight. The wasp on the right (B2) clearly shows curled antennal tips, identifying it as a male. The wasp on the left (B1) does not show this feature, has a more robust abdomen typical of a female, and is therefore likely a female. Thus, this pair is Female, Male. This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** These bees resemble long-horned bees, likely from the tribe Eucerini (e.g., genus *Melissodes*). In this group, sexual dimorphism is often pronounced. Males, like the one on the left (C1), are known for having much longer antennae than females and frequently have a yellow or pale patch on their clypeus (the \"face plate\"). The bee on the right (C2) lacks the exceptionally long antennae and has a dark face, along with a broader abdomen, which are characteristic traits of a female in this group. Therefore, this pair is Male, Female. This corresponds to option **3**.\n\nCombining these observations, the final answer is 2, 4, 3.\n\n<<<2, 4, 3>>>"
