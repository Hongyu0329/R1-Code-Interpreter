    "Based on the visual evidence in the photograph, this image was taken in Port Townsend, Washington.\n\nThe key features leading to this conclusion are the dark sand beach, the forested coastline, the sunset over the water, and the presence of a chain-link fence bordering the beach. These elements are characteristic of North Beach Park in Port Townsend. This park is known for its beautiful sunsets and its walking access to Glass Beach. The presence of a bonfire in the image is also consistent with activities sometimes permitted at local beaches.\n\n<<<Port Townsend>>>"
