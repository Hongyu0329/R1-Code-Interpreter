    "The product advertised in Britain during World War II with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" was Tampax.\n\nThis product, with a name derived from the French word \"tampon\" (meaning a plug or stopper), was promoted to the massive new female workforce. The advertisement suggested that by using internal sanitary protection, women could overcome the \"inherent limitations\" of menstruation that might otherwise interrupt their vital work in factories supporting the war effort. The 1942 ad campaign portrayed the use of this product as a contribution to the war, framing it as a tool for women's freedom and resilience.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
