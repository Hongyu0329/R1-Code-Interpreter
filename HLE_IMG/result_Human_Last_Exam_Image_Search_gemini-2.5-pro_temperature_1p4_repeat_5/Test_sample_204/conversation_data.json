    "Based on the visual evidence and knowledge of mineralogy, the specimens are identified and ordered below by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine** This mineral's olive-green color and granular habit are characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra ([SiO₄]⁴⁻) bonded by metal ions. This represents the simplest silicate structure.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite)** This specimen is a dark, stubby prismatic crystal. This form is typical of pyroxenes, a group of single-chain inosilicates. In this structure, tetrahedra link to form long single chains by sharing two oxygen atoms each, with a silicon-to-oxygen ratio of 1:3. This chain structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica (likely a green variety like Fuchsite or Chlorite)** The perfectly flat and flaky nature of this specimen is the defining characteristic of mica group minerals. Micas are phyllosilicates, or sheet silicates, where tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms to form extensive two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure represents a higher degree of polymerization and complexity than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz** This transparent, hexagonally-shaped crystal with a glassy luster is identifiable as quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate. In this structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and polymerized of the silicate structures.\n\nThe order of the specimens according to increasing silicate structure complexity is from isolated tetrahedra, to single chains, to sheets, to a full framework.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
