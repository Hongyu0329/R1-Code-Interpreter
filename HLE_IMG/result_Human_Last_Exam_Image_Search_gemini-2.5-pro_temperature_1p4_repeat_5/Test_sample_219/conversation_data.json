    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval are determined as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of Synchronized Bursts**\n\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense, vertical collections of points, indicating that many electrodes are firing at nearly the same time. The approximate timestamps for the center of each major burst are:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~2.5 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~15.5 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~26.5 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~37.5 s\n*   **Burst 5:** ~49.5 s\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI)**\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between consecutive bursts.\n*   **Interval 1 (Burst 1 to 2):** 15.5 s - 2.5 s = 13.0 s\n*   **Interval 2 (Burst 2 to 3):** 26.5 s - 15.5 s = 11.0 s\n*   **Interval 3 (Burst 3 to 4):** 37.5 s - 26.5 s = 11.0 s\n*   **Interval 4 (Burst 4 to 5):** 49.5 s - 37.5 s = 12.0 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval**\n\nThe average IBI is calculated by summing the individual intervals and dividing by the number of intervals.\n*   **Sum of intervals:** 13.0 s + 11.0 s + 11.0 s + 12.0 s = 47.0 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 47.0 s / 4 = 11.75 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives an average inter-burst interval of 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12 s>>>"
