    "Here are the identifications of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock. The red color is due to the oxidation of iron during the volcanic eruption.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia** This specimen is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture identifies it as a breccia. Given that the fragments appear to be of volcanic origin, it is likely a volcanic breccia, which can form from explosive eruptions or from the breaking up of lava flows.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This is a light-colored, highly porous or \"frothy\" vesicular rock. Pumice is an extrusive igneous rock formed from a rapid cooling of lava. Its low density, a result of a high concentration of vesicles, often allows it to float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks that form from the slow crystallization of magma, allowing large crystals to grow. The specimen shows a variety of minerals, consistent with the typical composition of pegmatite which often includes feldspar, quartz, and other minerals.\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
