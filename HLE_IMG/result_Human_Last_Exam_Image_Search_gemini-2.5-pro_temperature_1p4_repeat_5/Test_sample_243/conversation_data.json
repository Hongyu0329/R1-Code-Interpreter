    "The plant in the image is the Three Kings kaikōmako (*Pennantia baylisiana*).\n\nThis species is endemic to the Great Island (Manawatāwhi) in the Three Kings Islands group of New Zealand. This location is approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) northwest of Cape Reinga.\n\nRemarkably, only one tree has ever been found in the wild. Discovered in 1945 by botanist Geoff Baylis, this single female tree grows on a steep, rocky slope and has been called \"the world's loneliest tree\". Conservation efforts, including propagation from cuttings and inducing self-pollination, have led to the cultivation of new plants to prevent the species' extinction.\n\n<<<Great Island (Manawatāwhi)>>>"
