    "The image depicts the process of **septal pore plugging** in filamentous fungi. Specifically, it shows the action of **Woronin bodies** sealing a septal pore in response to hyphal damage.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process as seen in the panels L, M, and N:\n\n*   **Structure:** The images show hyphae, which are the long, branching filamentous structures of a fungus. These hyphae are divided into compartments by cross-walls called septa. A small pore within each septum allows for cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent compartments.\n*   **Panel L:** This panel shows an intact hyphal segment with a clear septal pore (indicated by the arrowhead). On either side of the septum, dense, spherical organelles known as Woronin bodies are visible. These organelles are typically tethered near the septal pore in healthy, undamaged hyphae.\n*   **Panels M and N:** These panels illustrate the response to hyphal wounding. When a hypha is damaged, the cytoplasm begins to leak out. To prevent catastrophic loss of cytoplasm from the entire mycelial network, the fungus rapidly plugs the septal pores. The arrowheads in M and N point to a Woronin body that has moved to block the septal pore. This plugging action effectively seals off the damaged compartment from the rest of the hypha. The process is very rapid and can be consolidated by the deposition of new material to form a permanent seal.\n\nIn essence, Woronin bodies function as emergency plugs to maintain the integrity of the fungal colony when individual hyphae are injured. This is a crucial survival mechanism for filamentous ascomycete fungi.\n\n<<<The process depicted is septal pore plugging by a Woronin body in a filamentous fungus.>>>"
