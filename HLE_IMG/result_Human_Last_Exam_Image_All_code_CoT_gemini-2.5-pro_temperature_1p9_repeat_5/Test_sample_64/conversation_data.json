    "Based on my analysis of the image sequence, the process being depicted is the formation of a lateral branch in a filamentous organism. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what is happening:\n\n1.  **Analyze Image L:** This panel shows a section of a filament composed of multiple cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The filament is relatively straight. An arrowhead points to a specific subapical cell (a cell below the tip cell).\n2.  **Analyze Image M:** This panel shows the same filament at a later time. The cell previously indicated by the arrowhead has begun to bulge outwards on one side. This marks the initiation of a new growth point.\n3.  **Analyze Image N:** In this final panel, the bulge seen in M has elongated and is clearly forming a new side branch, growing at an angle to the main filament.\n\nThis sequence from L to N illustrates the cellular process of **lateral branch initiation and formation**, a common method of growth and creating complex structures in filamentous organisms like fungi and algae.\n\nHere is a Python script to print the description of this process.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Describes the biological process shown in the images.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Lateral branch formation\"\n  \n  # Step-by-step description based on the panels L, M, and N.\n  step_L = \"Panel L shows a cell within a filament before branching begins.\"\n  step_M = \"Panel M shows the same cell starting to form a bulge on its side, which is the initial step of branch formation.\"\n  step_N = \"Panel N shows the bulge has grown and elongated into a new, young lateral branch.\"\n  \n  conclusion = f\"The sequence of images (L, M, N) depicts the process of {process_name} in a filamentous organism.\"\n  \n  print(conclusion)\n  print(\"\\nStep-by-step breakdown:\")\n  print(f\"1. {step_L}\")\n  print(f\"2. {step_M}\")\n  print(f\"3. {step_N}\")\n\n# Run the function to describe the process\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<Lateral branch formation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
