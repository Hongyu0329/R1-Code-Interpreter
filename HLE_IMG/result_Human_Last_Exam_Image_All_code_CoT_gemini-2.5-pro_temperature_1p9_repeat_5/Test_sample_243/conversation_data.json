    "My approach to solving this problem involves two main steps. First, I will identify the plant shown in the image. Second, I will research the native habitat of the identified plant to determine the island or region to which it is endemic.\n\n**Step 1: Plant Identification**\nThe image displays a shrub with dark green, elliptical leaves. The most distinguishing feature is the prominent, pale green or white network of veins (reticulation) that covers the leaf surface. This distinctive pattern is characteristic of the plant species *Coprosma reticulata*.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Endemic Location**\nAfter identifying the plant as *Coprosma reticulata*, I researched its origin. Botanical sources confirm that *Coprosma reticulata* is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae that is endemic to New Zealand. It is found throughout both the North Island and the South Island. Since the question asks for the name of the \"island\" and the plant is native to the island country of New Zealand, that will be my answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the name of the location.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the plant and its endemic location.\n    The plant is identified as Coprosma reticulata.\n    This species is endemic to the island nation of New Zealand.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the island nation where the plant is endemic\n    location = \"New Zealand\"\n    print(location)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<New Zealand>>>"
