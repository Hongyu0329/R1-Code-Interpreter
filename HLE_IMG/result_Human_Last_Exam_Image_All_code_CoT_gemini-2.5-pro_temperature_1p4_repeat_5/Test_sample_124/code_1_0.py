# Define the values from the circuit diagram
V2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts
R1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms
# R8 is short-circuited by the wire connecting the positive terminal to the node between R7 and R8.
# Therefore, no current flows through R8, and it can be ignored in the calculation.

# The complex wiring of the R1-R2-R3 branch results in all three resistors
# being connected in parallel across the voltage source V2.
# Similarly, R7 is also in parallel, while R8 is shorted.
# Therefore, the total current is the sum of the currents through R1, R2, R3, and R7.

# Calculate the current through each resistor
I1 = V2 / R1
I2 = V2 / R2
I3 = V2 / R3
I7 = V2 / R7

# Calculate the total current
total_current = I1 + I2 + I3 + I7

# Print the final equation with each number included
print("The total current (I_total) is the sum of the currents through the parallel branches:")
