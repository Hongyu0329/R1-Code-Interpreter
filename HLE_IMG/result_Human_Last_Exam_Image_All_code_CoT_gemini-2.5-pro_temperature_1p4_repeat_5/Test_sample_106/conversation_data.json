    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. This type of reaction is known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, or more specifically, a backbone rearrangement in terpenoid chemistry. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the transformations to determine the final substituents:\n\n1.  **Protonation and Water Loss:** The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid catalyst (HCl). The resulting -OH2+ is an excellent leaving group, which departs to form a secondary carbocation at its original position (C-3).\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of [1,2]-shifts (migration of a group from an adjacent carbon) to form more stable carbocations, propagating the positive charge across the carbon skeleton.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH3) from the adjacent quaternary carbon migrates to the carbocation center. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation and moves the positive charge.\n    *   **Subsequent Shifts:** A sequence of [1,2]-hydride (H) and [1,2]-methyl (CH3) shifts continues, moving the positive charge through the ring system. Each shift aims to generate a more stable carbocation (tertiary > secondary).\n    *   **Tracing the specific shifts:** Based on the standard backbone rearrangement pathway that leads to the given product (an olean-13(18)-ene skeleton), we can track the group migrations:\n        1.  H from C-5 migrates to C-4.\n        2.  CH3 from C-10 migrates to C-5.\n        3.  H from C-9 migrates to C-10.\n        4.  CH3 from C-8 migrates to C-9.\n        5.  CH3 from C-14 migrates to C-8.\n        6.  H from C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge is now at C-13.\n3.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton (H+) is eliminated from an adjacent carbon (C-18) to form a stable, trisubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, yielding the final product and regenerating the acid catalyst.\n\nBy tracking which groups stayed and which groups moved, we can identify the substituents at the numbered positions in the final product:\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** This carbon retains one of its original methyl groups. **1 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** The original methyl group migrated away and was replaced by a hydrogen. **2 = H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-5):** The original hydrogen migrated away and was replaced by a methyl group from C-10. **3 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** The original methyl group migrated away and was replaced by a methyl group from C-14. **4 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** The original methyl group migrated away and was replaced by a hydrogen. **5 = H**.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final determined structure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n    after the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of the given triterpenoid.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the required format\n    for position, substituent in substituents.items():\n        print(f\"{position} = {substituent}\", end=\"\")\n        if position < 5:\n            print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print()\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
