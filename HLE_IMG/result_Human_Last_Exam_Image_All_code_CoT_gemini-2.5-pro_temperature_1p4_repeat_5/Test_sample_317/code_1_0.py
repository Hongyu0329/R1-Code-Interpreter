# Step 1: Determine k
# The equation for x3' is x3' = -5*x3 - c*x1*x2 + Re.
# On average, the system might balance around <x3> ≈ Re/5.
# Re = 50*k, so <x3> ≈ 10*k.
# In the plots (e.g., Sim 1, plot h), x3 oscillates around a value in the high teens (approx. 16-17).
# If k=1, <x3>≈10 (too low).
# If k=2, <x3>≈20 (plausible, as the attractor's center might not be the fixed point).
# If k=3, <x3>≈30 (too high).
# Thus, k=2 is the most likely integer value.
k = 2

# Step 2: Identify the plot axes
# The horizontal axes of plots f, g, h, i are a permutation of x1, x2, x3, x4.
# In Sim 1, plot f has a horizontal axis range of [15, 18.5]. This matches the expected range of x3 from Step 1.
# So, the horizontal axis of plot 'f' corresponds to x3.
plot_x3 = 'f'

# To distinguish x1, x2, and x4, we look at their damping coefficients:
# x1': -2x1 (damping=2)
# x2': -9x2 (damping=9)
# x4': -5x4 (damping=5)
# We expect amplitudes: Amp(x2) < Amp(x4) < Amp(x1).
# In Sim 2, the horizontal axis widths are very different:
# H_i width ≈ 8
# H_g width ≈ 12
# H_h width ≈ 30
# Matching widths to expected amplitudes:
# H_i (smallest width) -> x2
# H_g (middle width) -> x4
# H_h (largest width) -> x1
plot_x1 = 'h'
plot_x2 = 'i'
plot_x4 = 'g'

# Step 3: Identify the parameter changes
# Simulation 1 is the baseline with initial parameters.
param_1 = '0'

# Simulation 2: The attractor is much larger, indicating an increase in a parameter.
# The butterfly shape related to x3 (plots h and i) is greatly expanded.
# This points to a change in the (x2, x3) subsystem, likely from the parameter 'c' in the x3' equation.
# An increase in 'c' would cause this instability.
param_2 = 'C'

# Simulation 4: The attractor shrinks significantly, and x3 becomes very stable in a narrow range.
# This points to a decrease in a parameter.
# The stabilization of x3 strongly suggests that the nonlinear term in the x3' equation was weakened by decreasing 'c'.
param_4 = 'c'

# Simulation 3: The most dramatic change is that x5 flips from negative values (Sim 1, 2, 4) to positive values.
# This points to a fundamental change in the (x4, x5) subsystem, governed by 'd' and 'e'.
# The attractor is larger, suggesting a parameter increase (D or E).
# A change in 'e' directly affects the x5' equation, making it the most likely cause for the sign flip in x5.
param_3 = 'E'

# Step 4: Assemble the final string
answer_string = str(k) + plot_x1 + plot_x2 + plot_x3 + plot_x4 + param_1 + param_2 + param_3 + param_4
