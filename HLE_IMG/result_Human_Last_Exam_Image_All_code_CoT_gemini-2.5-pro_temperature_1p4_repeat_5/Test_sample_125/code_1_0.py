# Plan:
# The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to synthesize a C40 molecule
# from C12 and C7 building blocks.
# Based on stoichiometric analysis, the backbone of the target molecule is formed from:
# 1 molecule of 2-acetylnaphthalene (C12)
# 2 molecules of benzaldehyde (C7)
# 2 molecules of 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene (C7)
# Total carbons = 1*12 + 2*7 + 2*7 = 12 + 14 + 14 = 40.
# The "number of steps" is interpreted as the total number of building block molecules required.
# The equation for the number of steps is the sum of these molecules.

num_acetylnaphthalene = 1
num_benzaldehyde = 2
num_difluorobenzene = 2

total_steps = num_acetylnaphthalene + num_benzaldehyde + num_difluorobenzene
