    "This image is a famous depiction on an Apulian red-figure oinochoe (wine jug), attributed to the Policoro Painter, dating to around 400 BCE. To identify the figure, we must analyze the mythological scene.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Observe the central figure:** The main figure is driving a chariot. They wear elaborate, patterned clothing and a Phrygian cap, which in Greek art was often used to signify a person from the East (Anatolia, Persia, or the Black Sea region).\n2.  **Analyze the context:** The chariot is being pulled by a winged creature (part of a winged serpent is visible on the left), suggesting it's a magical or divine vehicle. Below the chariot lies the body of a dead young man.\n3.  **Identify the myth:** This combination of elements—a powerful female figure from the East, a magical flying chariot, and a dead child—is the iconic representation of the myth of **Medea**. The scene shows her escape from Corinth after taking revenge on her husband Jason by murdering their two sons. The chariot was a gift from her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n4.  **Answer the question:** The figure driving the chariot and thus leaving the scene of her crime is Medea. The body on the ground is one of her murdered sons. Therefore, Medea is the figure leaving in the chariot.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the main figure in the provided image based on mythological iconography.\n  \n  The scene depicts:\n  1. A figure in a Phrygian cap (signifying an Eastern origin) driving a chariot.\n  2. The chariot is being pulled by winged serpents (a gift from the sun god Helios).\n  3.
