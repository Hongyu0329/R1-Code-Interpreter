# 1. Define the properties of the original function's second derivative, f''(x),

# Vertical Asymptote of f(x) is at x=4. f''(x) will also have a VA there.

# f(x) has a slant asymptote, so its second derivative f''(x) must approach 0 at infinity.
ha_f_double_prime = 0

# To the left of x=4, f(x) is concave down, so f''(x) < 0.
# To the right of x=4, f(x) is concave up, so f''(x) > 0.
# This means f''(x) goes from -infinity to +infinity across its VA.

# 2. Define the transformation parameters for g(x) = A * f''(B*x - C) + D
# Our function is y = -0.5 * f''(3x - 2) + 1
A = -0.5
B = 3
C = 2  # The transformation is of the form f(B(x-C/B)), so 3x-2 = 3(x-2/3). Or simply solve 3x-2=va.
D = 1

# 3. Calculate the properties of the transformed function g(x).

# The new vertical asymptote is found by solving B*x - C = va_f_double_prime
# Or more simply, set the argument of f'' to its original asymptote.
# 3 * x - 2 = 4
new_va = (va_f_double_prime + C) / B

# The new horizontal asymptote is calculated by applying the vertical transformations to the old one.
new_ha = A * ha_f_double_prime + D
