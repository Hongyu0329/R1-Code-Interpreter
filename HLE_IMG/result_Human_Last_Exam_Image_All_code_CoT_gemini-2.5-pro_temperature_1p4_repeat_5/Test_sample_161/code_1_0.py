    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the provided
    chemical reaction scheme.

    The reaction involves the formation of a 2-aminoimidazole derivative from an
    alpha-bromoketone. This is a cyclocondensation reaction.
    By comparing the structure of the alpha-bromoketone starting material and the
    final imidazole product, we can deduce the structure of the second reactant.

    - Starting Material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    - Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-carboxylate

    The alpha-bromoketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.
    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment. Based on the substituents
    in the product (a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2), the reactant is a
    Boc-protected guanidine.
