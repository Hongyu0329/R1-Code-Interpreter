    This function analyzes the features of the target nyala and compares them to the options.

    1.  Target Analysis: The target nyala has a unique pattern of stripes and spots.
        A particularly distinguishing feature is a small, distinct cluster of white spots on its rear flank.
        The shape and curve of its horns are also key identifiers.

    2.  Comparison with Options:
        - A is a younger male.
        - C, D, E, and F have different spot patterns, horn shapes, or are obscured.
        - B shows a nyala with an identical horn shape and, most convincingly, the exact same cluster of white spots on the rear flank as the target individual.

    3.  Conclusion: Image B shows the same nyala as the target image.
