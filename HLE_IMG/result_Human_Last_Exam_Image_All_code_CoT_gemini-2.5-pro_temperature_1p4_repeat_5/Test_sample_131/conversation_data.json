    "To identify the alkaloid compound, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The image displays a complex, polycyclic organic molecule. I will examine its key features: the ring system, the functional groups, and the stereochemistry.\n2.  **Identify the core skeleton:** The molecule has a tetracyclic (four-ring) framework containing two nitrogen atoms. This framework is known as the matrine skeleton.\n3.  **Identify the functional group:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) on one of the six-membered rings, specifically adjacent to a nitrogen atom. This makes the ring a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n4.  **Name the compound:** The matrine skeleton with this additional oxygen atom (forming a lactam) is known as Oxymatrine.\n5.  **Generate code:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the name \"Oxymatrine\" in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid shown in the image and prints its common name.\n    The structure is a matrine-type alkaloid. The presence of the ketone (C=O)\n    group, forming a lactam, identifies it as Oxymatrine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Oxymatrine\"\n    print(f\"The chemical name of the provided alkaloid is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_compound()\n```\n<<<Oxymatrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
