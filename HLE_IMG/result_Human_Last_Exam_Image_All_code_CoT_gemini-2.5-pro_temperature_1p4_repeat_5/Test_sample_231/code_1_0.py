    # Step 1: Deducing the structure of A, B, and C
    # Reaction 1: Formation of A
    # 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene reacts with PhLi to form a lithiated intermediate.
    # Three equivalents of this intermediate react with one equivalent of diethyl carbonate
    # to form a complex triphenylmethyl-type structure which cyclizes into a xanthylium salt.
    # Compound A is 1,3,6,8-tetramethoxy-9-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)xanthylium cation.

    # Reaction 2: Formation of B
    # Compound A reacts with diethylamine. The most activated methoxy group for nucleophilic
    # aromatic substitution is the one at the para-position (C4) of the phenyl ring at C9.
    # So, the 4-methoxy group is replaced by a diethylamino group.
    # Compound B is 9-(4-(diethylamino)-2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1,3,6,8-tetramethoxyxanthylium cation.

    # Reaction 3: Formation of C
    # Compound B is reacted with LiI at 170 C. These are classic conditions for cleaving
    # aryl methyl ethers (demethylation). With 10 equivalents of LiI, all six remaining
    # methoxy groups (four on the xanthylium core and two on the C9-substituent) are
    # converted to hydroxyl groups.
    # Therefore, Compound C is 9-(4-(diethylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxyxanthylium cation.

    # Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of C
    # The structure has:
    # - A diethylamino group: N(C2H5)2 -> C4 H10 N
    # - A dihydroxyphenyl ring substituent with the NEt2 group: C6 H2 (OH)2 (NEt2) -> C10 H14 N O2
    # - A tetrahydroxyxanthylium core: C13 H4 (OH)4 O -> C13 H8 O5
    # The bond between the substituent and the core removes one H from each.
    # Formula = (C10 H13 N O2) + (C13 H7 O5) = C23 H20 N O7.
    # Let's recount the hydrogens on the final structure.
    # C-H bonds: 2 on the substituent ring, 4 on the xanthylium rings = 6H.
    # N-C-H bonds: 10H on the two ethyl groups.
    # O-H bonds: 2 on the substituent ring, 4 on the xanthylium rings = 6H.
    # Total H = 6 + 10 + 6 = 22H.
    # Total C = 6(subst. ring) + 4(Et) + 13(xanthene core) = 23C.
    # Total O = 2(subst.) + 4(xanthene) + 1(ether bridge) = 7O.
    # Total N = 1N.
    # Formula of the cation is [C23 H22 N O7]+.
