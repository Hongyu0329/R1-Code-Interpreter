    "Here is my plan to solve this biological identification task.\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** I will identify the sex of each individual based on the morphology of the abdomen. Female cuckoo bees (*Coelioxys*) have a distinctly pointed, conical abdomen for laying eggs in host nests. Males have a blunter abdomen, often with spines or prongs at the tip.\n    *   The bee on the left (A-left) has a sharply pointed abdomen, characteristic of a female.\n    *   The bee on the right (A-right) has a blunter abdomen with visible terminal prongs, characteristic of a male.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Paper Wasps):** I will differentiate the sexes based on antennal morphology. In many wasps, males have longer, often curled antennae compared to the shorter, straighter antennae of females.\n    *   The wasp on the left (B-left) has antennae that are noticeably curled at the tips, which is a classic male trait in this group (*Polistes*).\n    *   The wasp on the right (B-right) has shorter, straighter antennae, typical of a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** I will use two key features: antennal length and facial coloration. Male long-horned bees (*Melissodes* or similar) are named for their conspicuously long antennae. They also often have a yellow or pale patch on their clypeus (the lower part of the face), which females lack.\n    *   The bee on the left (C-left) has very long antennae that extend well past its head and a bright yellow clypeus. This is definitively a male.\n    *   The bee on the right (C-right) has much shorter antennae, and its face appears dark. This is a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n4.  **Compile and Format the Final Answer:** I will combine the indices for A, B, and C into a single comma-separated string as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sex identification puzzle based on morphological traits.\n\n    The options are:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (e.g., Coelioxys)\n    # The left bee has a sharply pointed abdomen, which is a female ovipositor.\n    # The right bee has a blunter abdomen with prongs, characteristic of a male.\n    # Conclusion: Female, Male (F, M)\n    answer_A = 4\n\n    # Pair B: Paper Wasps (Polistes)\n    # The left wasp has long, curled antennae, which is a male characteristic.\n    # The right wasp has shorter, straight antennae, characteristic of a female.\n    # Conclusion: Male, Female (M, F)\n    answer_B = 3\n\n    # Pair C: Long-horned Bees (e.g., Melissodes)\n    # The left bee has very long antennae and a yellow face patch (clypeus), which are male traits.\n    # The right bee has short antennae and a dark face, characteristic of a female.\n    # Conclusion: Male, Female (M, F)\n    answer_C = 3\n\n    # Format the final answer as requested\n    final_answer = f\"{answer_A},{answer_B},{answer_C}\"\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<4,3,3>>>"
