def solve_tiling_periods():

    Calculates the period of tiling for four shapes on a hexagonal grid.

    The "period" is interpreted as the area of the shape. The area is measured in
    units of the smallest equilateral triangle of the grid (formed by a hexagon's
    center and two adjacent vertices). The area of this unit triangle is set to 1.
    Therefore, the area of a full hexagon is 6 units.

    The calculation for each case is based on geometric decomposition of the shape.
