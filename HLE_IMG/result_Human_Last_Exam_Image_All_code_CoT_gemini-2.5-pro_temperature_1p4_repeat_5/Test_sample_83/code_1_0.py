# The user wants to identify the carbon atom that becomes a carbonyl group in the product of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.

# 1. Identify the reaction type: The reaction shown is the oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol with PCC, which is known as the Babler-Dauben oxidation.
# 2. Understand the mechanism: This reaction involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of an intermediate chromate ester.
# 3. Trace the atoms: In the reactant, the key system is the tertiary allylic alcohol group, specifically involving the hydroxyl group on C7 and the adjacent double bond between C1 and C2.
#    - Reactant system: (HO)-C7-C1=C2
# 4. Predict the product: The rearrangement results in the transposition of the alcohol and the double bond.
#    - Product system: (O=)C1-C2=C7
#    - The oxygen atom from the original hydroxyl group forms a new double bond with the carbon atom C1.
#    - The original double bond moves to be between C2 and C7.
# 5. Conclusion: The carbonyl group (C=O) is formed on carbon atom C1.
