    "Based on the visual evidence, my plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will examine the key features of the organism growing on the tree bark. The organism is black, has a very fine, thread-like (filamentous) structure, and grows in an interconnected, net-like pattern directly on the bark.\n2.  **Identify the organism type:** This morphology is not typical for mosses or most common lichens. Its unique web-like appearance is characteristic of a specific type of lichen known as a filamentous lichen.\n3.  **Determine the genus:** By comparing the visual characteristics to known genera, the distinctive black, web-like thallus strongly points to the genus *Cystocoleus*. This lichen is formed by dark-pigmented fungal hyphae that wrap around filaments of a green alga, creating the net-like appearance.\n4.  **Generate code:** As requested, I will provide a Python script that states and prints the identified genus.\n\n```python\n# The epiphyte in the image has a very distinctive morphology.\n# It forms a black, web-like or net-like mat on the tree's bark.\n# This growth form is characteristic of a filamentous lichen.\n# After comparing the visual features with known lichens, the genus is identified.\n\n# The genus is known for its thallus consisting of dark-pigmented fungal hyphae\n# that form a web around filaments of a Trentepohlia green alga.\n\ngenus_name = \"Cystocoleus\"\n\nprint(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species in the image is: {genus_name}\")\n```\n<<<Cystocoleus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
