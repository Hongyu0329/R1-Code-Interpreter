    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first identify the chemical structure of the starting molecule provided in the reaction scheme. By examining its components (the bicyclic core, the PMB protecting group, the trifluoromethyl group, and the lactam functional group), I will count the number of atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen) to determine its molecular formula.\n2.  **Follow the Reaction Pathway**: I will analyze each of the three reaction steps to understand how the molecule is transformed.\n    *   **Step 1 (CAN)**: This step involves the removal of the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group from the nitrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the number of atoms resulting from this deprotection.\n    *   **Step 2 (Pd/C, H₂)**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation step, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond. I will account for the addition of two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Step 3 (HCl, heat)**: This step involves the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). This reaction opens the ring by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). I will calculate the atomic changes for this step.\n3.  **Calculate the Final Formula**: Starting with the molecular formula of the initial reactant, I will apply the atomic changes from each of the three steps sequentially to calculate the final molecular formula of the product.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements the step-by-step calculation. The script will start with the atom counts of the starting material and modify them according to each reaction. Finally, it will print the resulting counts for each element and the final molecular formula of the product, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the molecular formula of the final product in the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Its formula is C15H14F3NO2.\n    atoms = {\n        'C': 15,\n        'H': 14,\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 2\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Account for Reaction 1 (CAN deprotection).\n    # This reaction removes the PMB group (C8H9O) and adds an H atom to the nitrogen.\n    # Net change: remove C8H8O.\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 8\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    # Intermediate 1 formula: C7H6F3NO\n\n    # Step 3: Account for Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation).\n    # Pd/C, H2 reduces the C=C double bond, adding two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    # Intermediate 2 formula: C7H8F3NO\n\n    # Step 4: Account for Reaction 3 (Lactam Hydrolysis).\n    # Acid hydrolysis with 4 N HCl cleaves the lactam by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n    # Final product formula: C7H10F3NO2\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final atom counts and the molecular formula.\n    # Following the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    c = atoms['C']\n    h = atoms['H']\n    f = atoms['F']\n    n = atoms['N']\n    o = atoms['O']\n\n    print(\"Final atom counts for the product:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {c}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {h}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {f}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {o}\")\n\n    # Construct the molecular formula string according to chemical conventions (Hill system).\n    # C, then H, then other elements alphabetically.\n    # For a single atom of an element (like Nitrogen here), the number '1' is typically omitted.\n    formula = f\"C{c}H{h}F{f}NO{o}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is: {formula}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
