    "To solve this, I will first identify each mineral specimen based on its physical properties shown in the images. Then, I will determine the class of silicate structure for each mineral. Finally, I will arrange them in order from the simplest silicate structure (isolated tetrahedra) to the most complex (framework silicates).\n\n1.  **Identify Specimens:**\n    *   **A:** A dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This habit is characteristic of the pyroxene group.\n    *   **B:** A green mineral with a flaky, sheet-like appearance due to its perfect basal cleavage. This is typical of the mica group.\n    *   **C:** A mass of small, olive-green, granular crystals. This is a classic presentation of olivine.\n    *   **D:** A translucent, brownish, well-formed crystal with a glassy luster, showing hints of a hexagonal shape. This is a variety of quartz (smoky quartz).\n\n2.  **Determine Silicate Structure:**\n    *   **Olivine (C):** Nesosilicate (isolated SiO₄ tetrahedra).\n    *   **Pyroxene (A):** Inosilicate (single chains of SiO₄ tetrahedra).\n    *   **Mica (B):** Phyllosilicate (sheets of SiO₄ tetrahedra).\n    *   **Quartz (D):** Tectosilicate (a 3D framework of SiO₄ tetrahedra).\n\n3.  **Order by Increasing Complexity:** The complexity of the silicate structure increases with the number of oxygen atoms shared between the SiO₄ tetrahedra.\n    *   **Nesosilicates (0 shared oxygens):** Olivine (C)\n    *   **Inosilicates - Single Chain (2 shared oxygens):** Pyroxene (A)\n    *   **Phyllosilicates (3 shared oxygens):** Mica (B)\n    *   **Tectosilicates (4 shared oxygens):** Quartz (D)\n\nTherefore, the correct order is C, A, B, D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the specimens with their identification, silicate class, and complexity level.\n    # Complexity is ranked from 1 (least complex) to 4 (most complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'id': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'id': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'id': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the specimens based on their complexity level.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 3: Print the results in order.\n    print(\"Ordering specimens by increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    \n    order_list = []\n    for spec in sorted_specimens:\n        print(f\"Specimen {spec['id']}: {spec['mineral']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Silicate Structure: {spec['structure']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Complexity arises from how SiO4 tetrahedra are linked. {spec['structure']}s are more complex than the previous and less complex than the next.\")\n        order_list.append(spec['id'])\n        \n    final_order = \", \".join(order_list)\n    print(f\"\\nThe final order of increasing complexity is: {final_order}\")\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
