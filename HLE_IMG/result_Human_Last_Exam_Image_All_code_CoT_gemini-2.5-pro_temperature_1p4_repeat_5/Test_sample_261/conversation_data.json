    "This image fragment is a detail from a famous book cover. My plan is to identify the key features in the image and use them to determine the book's title.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a silvery, ethereal unicorn with a golden horn. It appears to be in motion within a dark, wooded or shadowy area. To the right, there is a portion of a stone-like frame or pillar.\n2.  **Identify the source:** The art style and subject matter—a unicorn in a dark forest—are very distinctive and strongly associated with a key scene from the first book in the Harry Potter series. The illustration is a perfect match for a detail on the original U.S. cover art for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, illustrated by Mary GrandPré. The unicorn is depicted in a small vignette on the left side of that cover.\n3.  **Construct the code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the identified book title.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book title based on the provided image fragment.\n    The image shows a silvery unicorn in a dark forest, a detail from the\n    original US cover of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\".\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"\n    print(title)\n\nfind_book_title()\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
