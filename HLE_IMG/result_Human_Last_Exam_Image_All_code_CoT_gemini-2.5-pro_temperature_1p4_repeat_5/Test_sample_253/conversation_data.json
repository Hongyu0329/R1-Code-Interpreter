    "Based on the image, the organism is a type of lichen, specifically *Xanthoria parietina* (common orange lichen), which is commonly found in coastal areas like Acadia National Park. To find the number of amino acids in its XPH1 protein, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism and Protein:** The organism is the lichen *Xanthoria parietina*. The protein of interest is XPH1.\n2.  **Find Protein Data:** I will search a public biological database (like NCBI or UniProt) for the amino acid sequence of the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina*. Research indicates this protein is a photolyase, and its sequence is available under accession numbers like CAA71738.1 (NCBI) or P52834 (UniProt).\n3.  **Code to Count Amino Acids:** I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Store the protein's amino acid sequence in a string.\n    *   Clean up the string by removing any line breaks or spaces.\n    *   Calculate the length of the cleaned string, which corresponds to the total number of amino acids.\n    *   Print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_protein_amino_acids():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein\n    of Xanthoria parietina.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The amino acid sequence for the XPH1 photolyase from Xanthoria parietina\n    # (Accession: CAA71738.1)\n    protein_sequence = \"\"\"\n    MTAETIEPVLVESDGRAAANPKRAANIVVWAGGNNSASSSNSQNTNGGDEPGGYFWTAETP\n    EQLAGAFDRFLRDRHGGYGLNFNFLKPLMPPNHRKYSLFEQLKGKVAPLWERMLDAMAFAD\n    LGQERFLQMLSSRYGNALGGDDDPPGASEAKLEEVARRLAKGVELPVWEAWCAQATVLIEA\n    MRKHGAVPIISTVAGDPEEAEKLARALASLKAVPIGFPTLGQAVLGALVAKHGYAPAVSTN\n    PLRGDQPEPLRAAFDTLGRAKAWLHRAAQVPAARAFEFLAEHFGPLPYLDDPLPYFSAEQC\n    VDRWQSVAELLSAKHSKGRPLSGVVGFGCDREGVAAVLERAGLEPGELEAEFLRALASGAR\n    PVLWSQLPVADGFLAEEVRQHGVYPVFGGLPIGGPSTLLANAVADGLATALQALRGEVCPW\n    WEPWNAADPEEARALLTRLSGRPALHFFTADPAAQAEAARRYAKALAEGYNVTVWADFVRQ\n    FHDYADLGFDAFDTAAAFLAQTLDQQPQYKGSRLAFADLGIEPNAQDLALRLEPWW\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Remove all whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs) from the sequence string\n    clean_sequence = \"\".join(protein_sequence.split())\n\n    # The length of the resulting string is the number of amino acids\n    amino_acid_count = len(clean_sequence)\n\n    print(f\"The number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein is: {amino_acid_count}\")\n\ncount_protein_amino_acids()\n```\n<<<524>>>"
