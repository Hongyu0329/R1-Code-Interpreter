    "My plan is to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n1.  **Analyze ECG Parameters**: The ECG strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG paper consists of small squares (1 mm) and large squares (5 mm).\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square**: At 25 mm/sec, each 1 mm small square represents 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds. Each 5 mm large square represents 5 * 0.04 = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, I will locate the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the prominent peaks of the QRS complex). This pause is most noticeable on the fourth row of the tracing.\n4.  **Measure the Interval**: I will count the number of small squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define this longest interval. The interval spans approximately 4 large squares and 1 small square, which totals (4 * 5) + 1 = 21 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Duration**: Finally, I will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of a single small square to get the R-R interval in seconds.\n\nI will now generate Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function is based on the standard parameters of an ECG recording.\n    The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n    The time for one small square (1 mm) is calculated from the paper speed.\n    The longest R-R interval is measured by counting the number of small squares\n    between the two R-waves that are furthest apart.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # ECG paper speed in mm/sec\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n    \n    # Duration of one small square (1 mm) in seconds\n    small_square_duration_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n    \n    # By visual inspection, the longest R-R interval is measured.\n    # It spans approximately 4 large squares and 1 small square.\n    # Number of small squares in a large square = 5\n    # Total small squares = (4 * 5) + 1 = 21\n    num_small_squares = 21\n    \n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\n    rr_interval_seconds = num_small_squares * small_square_duration_sec\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the calculation\n    print(\"To find the longest R-R interval in seconds:\")\n    print(f\"1.
