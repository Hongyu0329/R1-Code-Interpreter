    "This is a three-step organic synthesis. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Amine Protection**\n*   **Starting Material:** The synthesis begins with (S)-Tryptophan, an amino acid.\n*   **Reagents:** `CbzCl` (Benzyl chloroformate) and `NaOH` (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The amino group (-NH2) of tryptophan is more nucleophilic than the deprotonated carboxylate (-COO‚Åª) in basic conditions. It attacks the CbzCl, protecting the amine with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Hydroxamic Acid Formation**\n*   **Reagents:** `EDC`, `HOBt`, `Et3N` are used for amide coupling. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is coupled with `HCl.H2NO-Bn` (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. This specific product is a protected hydroxamic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** An N-Cbz protected tryptophan with its carboxylic acid converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate (`-CO-NH-O-Bn`).\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** `10% Pd/C` and `H2` gas.\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    1.  The `Cbz` group is cleaved from the nitrogen, regenerating the free amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The `benzyl` group is cleaved from the oxygen of the hydroxamate, leaving a hydroxamic acid (-CO-NH-OH).\n*   **Product:** The final molecule has the tryptophan backbone, a free alpha-amino group, and a hydroxamic acid group instead of a carboxylic acid. The chemical name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. This compound is a well-known matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, and its common name is **Batimastat**.\n\nThe following Python code outlines these steps and provides the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_synthesis_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the final product of a three-step chemical synthesis starting from (S)-Tryptophan.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the molecules and steps\n    starting_material = \"(S)-Tryptophan\"\n    \n    # Step 1: N-protection of the amino group\n    reagents_step1 = \"CbzCl, NaOH\"\n    reaction_step1 = \"The amino group of Tryptophan is protected with a Carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamic acid\n    reagents_step2 = \"EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn)\"\n    reaction_step2 = \"The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"Cbz-protected tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\"\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenation to remove protecting groups\n    reagents_step3 = \"10% Pd/C, H2\"\n    reaction_step3 = \"Both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups are removed by hydrogenation.\"\n    final_product_systematic_name = \"(S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide\"\n    final_product_common_name = \"Batimastat\"\n\n    # Print the summary\n    print(\"--- Synthesis Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: Starting with {starting_material}, reacting with {reagents_step1}.\")\n    print(f\"         {reaction_step1}\")\n    print(f\"         This forms Intermediate 1: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Intermediate 1 reacts with {reagents_step2}.\")\n    print(f\"         {reaction_step2}\")\n    print(f\"         This forms Intermediate 2: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Intermediate 2 reacts with {reagents_step3}.\")\n    print(f\"         {reaction_step3}\")\n    print(f\"         This forms the final product.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Final Product ---\")\n    print(f\"The final product of the synthesis is known as:\")\n    print(final_product_common_name)\n\n# Run the identification process\nidentify_synthesis_product()\n```\n<<<Batimastat>>>"
