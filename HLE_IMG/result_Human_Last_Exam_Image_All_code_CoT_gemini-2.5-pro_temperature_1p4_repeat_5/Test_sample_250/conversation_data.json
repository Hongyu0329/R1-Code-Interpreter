    "Based on a detailed analysis of the melody and chord progression provided in the sheet music, the piece can be identified.\n\n**Analysis Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The sheet music presents a distinct chord progression. The most characteristic part is the A section, which begins with a chromatic descent of chords: `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 ...`. This type of chromatic movement is a hallmark of certain bebop and post-bop composers.\n2.  **Identify the A Section:** This specific descending progression is strongly associated with the jazz standard \"On a Misty Night\". When transposed to the key of F minor (as it appears in the sheet music), the chords of \"On a Misty Night\" are `Fm | Em7b5 | Ebm7 | Dm7b5 | Dbmaj7...`. The chords in the provided image (`F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`, `Dbmaj7`) are a virtually identical match. The `Eb-6` chord is a common voicing substitute for `Ebm7`.\n3.  **Analyze the Bridge:** The bridge section starts with the chords `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 ...`. While the melodic contour differs from the most common version of \"On a Misty Night,\" the underlying harmony and the overall form are consistent with it, albeit with some reharmonization, which is common in jazz performance and transcription.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the key features in the A section's harmony points conclusively to a single tune.\n\nThe jazz standard is **\"On a Misty Night\"** composed by **Tadd Dameron**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the title and composer of the provided jazz standard\n    and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"On a Misty Night\"\n    composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
