    "To find the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** I will first analyze the provided image to identify the specific knot. I'll count its crossings and observe its structure. The knot has 6 crossings and is alternating (the strand goes over, then under, then over, etc.). This identifies it as the **6₁ knot**, commonly known as the **Stevedore knot**.\n\n2.  **Relate Rasmussen Invariant to Knot Signature:** For the class of alternating knots, there is a direct relationship between the Rasmussen s-invariant and another important knot invariant, the knot signature (σ). The theorem states that for an alternating knot K, its Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to its signature: `s(K) = σ(K)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Signature:** The signature of the 6₁ knot is a well-established value in knot theory. The signature `σ(6₁)` is -2.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Using the formula from step 2 and the value from step 3, I can conclude that the Rasmussen invariant `s(6₁)` is also -2.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this deduction and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_knot_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the knot\n    knot_name = \"6_1\"\n    common_name = \"Stevedore knot\"\n    is_alternating = True\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: Identifying the knot.\")\n    print(f\"The knot diagram shows an alternating knot with 6 crossings.\")\n    print(f\"This is known as the {knot_name} knot, or the {common_name}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem for alternating knots\n    print(\"Step 2: Using the properties of alternating knots.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant, s(K), is equal to its signature, σ(K).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: s(K) = σ(K)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Provide the known signature of the 6_1 knot\n    signature_value = -2\n    print(f\"Step 3: Finding the signature of the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(f\"The signature for the {knot_name} knot is a known value.\")\n    print(f\"σ({knot_name}) = {signature_value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate and state the Rasmussen invariant\n    rasmussen_invariant = signature_value\n    print(f\"Step 4: Calculating the Rasmussen invariant.\")\n    print(f\"Using the formula, we substitute the signature value:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = σ({knot_name})\")\n    \n    # Final equation with the number printed\n    final_equation = f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\nsolve_knot_invariant()\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
