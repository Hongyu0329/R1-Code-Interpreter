def analyze_complex_lifetimes():
    """
    Analyzes the expected lifetimes of four Iridium complexes based on their structure.

    The stability and operational lifetime of these emitters in Light-Emitting
    Electrochemical Cells (LECs) are strongly influenced by the substituents on the
    cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligands.

    Key principles:
    1. Fluorination: The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms strengthens
       the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, increasing the complex's stability and lifetime.
    2. Steric Protection: A fluorine atom at the ortho-position (the carbon next
       to the Ir-C bond) provides a steric shield, protecting the bond from chemical
       attack. This effect is critical for high stability.

    Based on these principles, we can classify the complexes:
    - Complexes with an ortho-fluorine (1 and 3) are sterically protected and highly stable.
    - Complexes without an ortho-fluorine (2 and 4) lack this crucial steric
      protection and are therefore expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.
