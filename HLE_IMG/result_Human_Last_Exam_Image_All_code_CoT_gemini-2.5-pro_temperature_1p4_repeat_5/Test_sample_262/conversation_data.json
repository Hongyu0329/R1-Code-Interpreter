    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants to identify which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n\n2.  **Examine the Chemical Structures:**\n    *   All four complexes share the same core structure: a central Iridium (Ir) atom, one 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) ligand, and two identical cyclometalating phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. The entire complex is a cation with a PF₆⁻ counterion.\n    *   The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution on the phenyl ring of the ppy ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Two fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring, at the 2' (ortho to the Ir-C bond) and 4' (para to the Ir-C bond) positions. This is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 2:** One fluorine atom on each phenyl ring, at the 4' (para) position. This is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 3:** One fluorine atom on each phenyl ring, at the 2' (ortho) position. This is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 4:** No fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings. This is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime:**\n    *   The lifetime of these emitters in LECs is directly related to their chemical and photophysical stability under electrical bias. A primary degradation pathway involves the breaking of the bonds within the complex.\n    *   The Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand is often the most vulnerable point in these types of complexes.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group. This withdrawal of electron density from the phenyl ring strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the complex more resistant to degradation and thus increasing its operational lifetime. Based on this, Complex 4, which has no fluorine substituents, will be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorine Position:** The position of the fluorine atom is also crucial.\n        *   **Electronic Effect:** Both ortho and para fluorine atoms have strong electron-withdrawing effects, strengthening the Ir-C bond.\n        *   **Steric Effect:** A fluorine atom at the *ortho* position (like in Complex 1 and Complex 3) provides a significant steric shield. It physically blocks the approach of other molecules (like water or other nucleophiles) that could attack and break the Ir-C bond. This steric protection is a key strategy for designing highly stable emitters.\n    *   **Comparing the Complexes:**\n        *   **Complex 1 (ortho-F, para-F):** Most stable due to maximum electronic stabilization and steric protection. Expected to have the *longest* lifetime.\n        *   **Complex 3 (ortho-F only):** Very stable due to strong electronic stabilization and steric protection from the ortho-F. Expected to have a long lifetime, probably second only to Complex 1.\n        *   **Complex 2 (para-F only):** More stable than Complex 4 due to the electronic effect of the para-F. However, it lacks the crucial steric protection at the ortho position, making it more vulnerable to degradation than Complexes 1 and 3. Expected to have a *shorter* lifetime than 1 and 3.\n        *   **Complex 4 (no F):** Least stable. It has neither electronic stabilization from fluorine nor steric protection. Expected to have the *shortest* lifetime.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes.\" Based on the analysis, the complexes lacking the steric protection of an ortho-fluorine substituent are significantly less stable. This group consists of Complex 2 and Complex 4. Therefore, these two are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n5.  **Plan the Code:** To fulfill the user's request, I will write a Python script that programmatically applies this chemical reasoning.\n    *   Define a data structure (a list of dictionaries) to represent each complex and its relevant features (specifically, the presence or absence of an ortho-fluorine).\n    *   Iterate through the list of complexes.\n    *   For each complex, check if it lacks the `ortho_F` feature.\n    *   Collect the numbers of the complexes that meet this condition (i.e., those with shorter expected lifetimes).\n    *   Print a clear explanation of the reasoning, followed by the identified complex numbers.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_lifetimes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the expected lifetimes of four Iridium complexes based on their structure.\n\n    The stability and operational lifetime of these emitters in Light-Emitting\n    Electrochemical Cells (LECs) are strongly influenced by the substituents on the\n    cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligands.\n\n    Key principles:\n    1. Fluorination: The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms strengthens\n       the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, increasing the complex's stability and lifetime.\n    2. Steric Protection: A fluorine atom at the ortho-position (the carbon next\n       to the Ir-C bond) provides a steric shield, protecting the bond from chemical\n       attack. This effect is critical for high stability.\n\n    Based on these principles, we can classify the complexes:\n    - Complexes with an ortho-fluorine (1 and 3) are sterically protected and highly stable.\n    - Complexes without an ortho-fluorine (2 and 4) lack this crucial steric\n      protection and are therefore expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    complexes = [\n        {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Complex 1\", \"ortho_fluorine\": True, \"other_fluorine\": True},\n        {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Complex 2\", \"ortho_fluorine\": False, \"other_fluorine\": True},\n        {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Complex 3\", \"ortho_fluorine\": True, \"other_fluorine\": False},\n        {\"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Complex 4\", \"ortho_fluorine\": False, \"other_fluorine\": False},\n    ]\n\n    shorter_lifetime_complexes = []\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of complex stability and lifetime:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Principle: The lifetime of these Iridium complexes is strongly dependent on the stability of the Ir-C bond.\")\n    print(\"Rule 1: Electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine (F) strengthen the Ir-C bond, increasing stability.\")\n    print(\"Rule 2: A fluorine atom at the ortho-position provides crucial steric protection, significantly enhancing stability.\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying these rules to the complexes:\")\n\n    for complex in complexes:\n        if not complex[\"ortho_fluorine\"]:\n            shorter_lifetime_complexes.append(complex[\"id\"])\n            stability = \"Lower (shorter lifetime)\"\n            reason = \"Lacks steric protection from an ortho-fluorine.\"\n        else:\n            stability = \"Higher (longer lifetime)\"\n            reason = \"Has steric protection from an ortho-fluorine.\"\n        print(f\"- {complex['name']} (ID: {complex['id']}): Expected Stability = {stability}.
