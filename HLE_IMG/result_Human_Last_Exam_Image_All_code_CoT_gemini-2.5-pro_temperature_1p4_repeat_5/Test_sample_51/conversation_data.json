    "This word is a medieval Greek scribal corruption of a very common Classical Greek word.\n\nA character-by-character transcription of the word as written is:\n*   **μ** (mu)\n*   **θ** (theta)\n*   **ἄ** (alpha with a smooth breathing mark and an acute accent)\n*   **λ** (lambda)\n*   **ου** (a ligature for omicron-upsilon)\n*   **ν** (nu)\n\nSo, the literal transcription is **μθἄλουν**.\n\nHowever, this is not a real Greek word, and the accentuation is impossible under classical rules (an acute accent cannot be on the third-to-last syllable if the last syllable is long, as `-ουν` is).\n\nThis is understood by paleographers to be a corruption of the extremely common adverb **μᾶλλον** (mâllon), which means \"more\" or \"rather\". The spelling in the manuscript arose from a series of common scribal errors: a graphical confusion creating the `θ`, the writing of a single `λ` for a double `λλ` (haplography), the confusion of `ο` and `ου`, and an incorrect accent.\n\n<<<The word is `μθἄλουν`, a scribal corruption of `μᾶλλον`, meaning \"more\" or \"rather\".>>>"
