Here are four possibilities for how the dimerization of 3-oxidopyrylium can be described in terms of [mπ+nπ]:

Possibility 1: [6π + 4π] cycloaddition. One molecule acts as a 6π triene system and the other as a 4π diene system.
Possibility 2: [4π + 2π] cycloaddition. One molecule acts as a 4π diene (or 1,3-dipole) system and the other as a 2π alkene system.
Possibility 3: [8π + 2π] cycloaddition. One molecule utilizes an 8π electron system, reacting with a 2π alkene system from the second molecule.
Possibility 4: [4π + 4π] cycloaddition. Both molecules react as 4π components (e.g., one as a diene and the other as a 1,3-dipole).
