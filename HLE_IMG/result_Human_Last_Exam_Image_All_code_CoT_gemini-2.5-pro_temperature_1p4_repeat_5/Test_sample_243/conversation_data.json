    "This plant is the Saint Helena Olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). It was a critically endangered plant, endemic to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, the last known tree in the wild died in 1994, and the last cultivated individual died in 2003, rendering the species extinct. The photograph was likely taken at a botanical garden like Kew Gardens, where preserved material might have been grown.\n\nI will write a Python script to print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef get_endemic_island():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the name of the island\n  to which the Saint Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica) was endemic.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The plant shown is Nesiota elliptica, the Saint Helena Olive.\n  # This species was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.\n  island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n  print(f\"The plant, Nesiota elliptica, was endemic to the island of: {island_name}\")\n\nget_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
