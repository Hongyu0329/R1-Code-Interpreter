# The problem asks to identify a two-word phrase "X Y" based on a visual clue and a riddle.

# Step 1: Analyze the visual clue and context.
# The image shows a handshake at an awards ceremony on June 20, 2019.
# The person receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov.
# That night, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP award).
# The key action is the "shake" (handshake).
# The key award is the "Hart" Trophy.

# Step 2: Analyze the riddle.
# The phrase "almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts" refers to
# the historical use of mercury in making felt hats. This caused a neurological
# condition in hat makers, which was characterized by tremors and known as the "Hatter's Shakes".

# Step 3: Connect the clues with a single phrase.
# The phrase "Hatter's Shake" connects both parts of the problem.
# - For the picture: It's a pun. A "shake" (handshake) involving the "Hatter"
#   (the winner of the "Hart" Trophy, where "Hart" sounds like "Hat").
# - For the riddle: "Hatter's Shake" is the name of the historical medical condition.

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
x = "Hatter's"
y = "Shake"
print(f"The X Y is: {x} {y}")
