    "Here is my thinking process for solving this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Prompt:** I need to find a two-word phrase, \"X Y\", that fits two distinct clues.\n    *   **Clue 1 (Visual/Contextual):** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony, with one presenting a trophy to the other. A key visual element is the handshake between them. By identifying the recipient as hockey player Nikita Kucherov and the date, I can pinpoint the event as the 2019 NHL Awards. On that night, Kucherov won three major awards, most notably the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP).\n    *   **Clue 2 (Riddle):** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This clue points directly to the historical use of mercury nitrate in the felt-making industry for hats. This process was famously toxic, causing a neurological disorder in hat makers known as \"mad hatter disease\" or, more specifically, the \"hatter's shakes\" (referring to the tremors).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:** The challenge is to find a single phrase \"X Y\" that links the hockey awards ceremony to the mercury poisoning riddle.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:**\n    *   The riddle strongly suggests the answer is related to hat-making. The term \"Hatter's Shake\" is a perfect fit for the riddle part of the clue.\n    *   Now, I need to see if \"Hatter's Shake\" fits the first clue.\n    *   The image clearly shows a hand**shake**. This matches the second word, \"Shake\".\n    *   For the first word, \"Hatter's,\" I need to find a link. Nikita Kucherov won the **Hart** Trophy. The word \"Hart\" sounds just like \"Hat\". Therefore, the person winning the \"Hart\" trophy can be playfully called the \"Hatter\" in the context of this puzzle.\n    *   Putting it together: The picture shows a **Hatter's** (the Hart trophy winner's) **Shake** (handshake).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The phrase \"Hatter's Shake\" works for both clues through a clever pun. It describes the action in the picture (the handshake of the \"Hart\" winner) and the historical medical condition related to mercury in hat making.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify a two-word phrase \"X Y\" based on a visual clue and a riddle.\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the visual clue and context.\n# The image shows a handshake at an awards ceremony on June 20, 2019.\n# The person receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n# That night, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP award).\n# The key action is the \"shake\" (handshake).\n# The key award is the \"Hart\" Trophy.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the riddle.\n# The phrase \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts\" refers to\n# the historical use of mercury in making felt hats. This caused a neurological\n# condition in hat makers, which was characterized by tremors and known as the \"Hatter's Shakes\".\n\n# Step 3: Connect the clues with a single phrase.\n# The phrase \"Hatter's Shake\" connects both parts of the problem.\n# - For the picture: It's a pun. A \"shake\" (handshake) involving the \"Hatter\"\n#   (the winner of the \"Hart\" Trophy, where \"Hart\" sounds like \"Hat\").\n# - For the riddle: \"Hatter's Shake\" is the name of the historical medical condition.\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer.\nx = \"Hatter's\"\ny = \"Shake\"\nprint(f\"The X Y is: {x} {y}\")\n\n```\n<<<Hatter's Shake>>>"
