    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will carefully examine the provided raster plot to visually identify the time points where synchronized bursts of neuronal activity occur. These bursts are characterized by dense, vertical columns of firing events across a large number of electrodes.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals:** I will calculate the time difference (interval) between each consecutive pair of identified bursts.\n3.  **Compute the Average:** I will then calculate the average of all the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final result will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements these steps, printing out the identified timestamps, the calculated intervals, the full equation for the average, and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 1. Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# By visual inspection, the bursts are centered at these approximate times in seconds.\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 12.0, 18.0, 25.0, 36.0, 47.0]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# 2. Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n# This is done by finding the difference between each timestamp and the one before it.\ninter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s):\")\nfor i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n    print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} - {burst_timestamps[i]} = {inter_burst_intervals[i]:.1f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# 3. Calculate the average of these intervals.\naverage_interval = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\nsum_of_intervals = np.sum(inter_burst_intervals)\nnumber_of_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# 4. Print the final calculation and the result rounded to two significant figures.\nequation_numerator = ' + '.join([f\"{i:.1f}\" for i in inter_burst_intervals])\nprint(\"Final Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Average Interval = ({equation_numerator}) / {number_of_intervals}\")\nprint(f\"Average Interval = {sum_of_intervals:.1f} / {number_of_intervals}\")\n\n# The '{:.2g}' format specifier rounds a number to the specified number of significant figures.\nprint(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {average_interval:.2g} s.\")\n\n```\n<<<8.9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
