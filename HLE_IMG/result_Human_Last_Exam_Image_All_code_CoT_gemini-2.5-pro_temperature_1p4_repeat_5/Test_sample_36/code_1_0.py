    # to make strategic, data-driven decisions. It helps answer "What is happening?".
    # This is highly applicable to the structured pipeline shown.

    # Usefulness: Captures the tacit (unspoken) knowledge of skilled employees
    # (e.g., best negotiation tactics, effective sales script delivery) and makes it
    # explicit (e.g., updated scripts, manuals) for the whole company to use.
    # This is highly applicable for scaling the skills of top salespeople.

    # KM model for managing the sales process itself.
