    "Based on the visual evidence from the image sequence, the process depicted is a fundamental aspect of fungal growth. I will provide a Python script to describe this process step-by-step.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will analyze the three panels (L, M, N) which show a time-lapse of a microscopic, filamentous structure.\n2.  I will identify the structure as a fungal hypha, which is composed of cells separated by septa.\n3.  I will describe the changes occurring from panel L to N: the initial state, the formation of a bulge, and the development of a new branch from that bulge.\n4.  Finally, I will conclude by naming the biological process.\n5.  I will encapsulate this description within a Python script that uses the `print()` function for the output, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This script analyzes and describes the biological process shown in the\n  provided series of micrographs (L, M, N).\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"The image series illustrates the process of hyphal branching in a fungus.\")\n  print(\"\\nHere is a step-by-step description based on the panels:\")\n  \n  # Description of Panel L\n  print(\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
