  # Description of Panel L
  print("1. Panel L: This panel shows a mature fungal hypha, a filament made of elongated cells separated by cross-walls (septa). An arrowhead points to one of these septa.")
  
  # Description of Panel M
  print("2. Panel M: At the site indicated by the arrowhead in the previous panel, a small swelling or bulge has appeared on the side of the hyphal wall. This is the initiation site of a new branch.")
  
  # Description of Panel N
  print("3. Panel N: The bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new, smaller hypha that extends from the original filament. This is a newly formed lateral branch.")
  
  # Conclusion
  print("\nConclusion: The sequence from L to N clearly depicts the formation of a lateral branch from an existing hypha. This process is called hyphal branching and is a primary mode of vegetative growth that allows fungi to expand and colonize their substrate.")
