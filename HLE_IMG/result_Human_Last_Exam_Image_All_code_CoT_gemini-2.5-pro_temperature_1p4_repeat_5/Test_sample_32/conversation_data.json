    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the **seta (the stalk supporting the capsule)**.\n\n*   In **_Grimmia montana_**, the seta is **straight**, causing the capsule to be held upright (erect).\n*   In **_Grimmia curviseta_**, as its name suggests (*curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk), the seta is **strongly curved or arched (arcuate)**, which makes the capsule nod or hang downwards.\n\nThis difference in the seta's curvature is the most prominent and easily observable feature to separate the sporophytes of these two species. The capsules in the provided image appear to be on short, straight setae, which is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved, causing the capsule to be nodding or pendulous.>>>"
