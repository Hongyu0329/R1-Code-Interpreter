    "To determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement, we need to perform a harmonic analysis. This involves identifying the key, the notes in the measure, and the function of the resulting chord within that key.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Determine the Key:** I will first identify the key signature of the piece to establish the tonal center. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), indicating either E-flat major or C minor. Given the piece's character and standard analysis, the key is C minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** I will examine the notes played by both the right and left hands in measure 30. The notes are E-natural, G, and B-flat.\n3.  **Identify the Chord:** Based on these notes, I will determine the root, quality, and inversion of the chord. The notes E♮-G-B♭ form an E diminished triad (E°), with the root E♮ in the bass.\n4.  **Determine the Function:** An E° triad is not native (diatonic) to the key of C minor. I will analyze its function as a secondary, or applied, chord. The root, E-natural, is the leading tone to F. The F minor triad is the subdominant (iv) chord in C minor. Therefore, the E° chord functions as the leading-tone chord of the subdominant.\n5.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:** The analysis \"leading-tone chord of the subdominant\" translates to the Roman numeral **vii°/iv**.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through these steps and print the final analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st mvt,\n    to determine the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the key.\")\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    print(f\"The key signature is three flats (B-flat, E-flat, A-flat), and the piece is in {key}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify the notes in measure 30.\")\n    notes_in_measure = [\"E-natural\", \"G\", \"B-flat\"]\n    print(f\"The notes played by both hands are: {', '.join(notes_in_measure)}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Identify the chord and its inversion.\")\n    chord_name = \"E diminished\"\n    bass_note = \"E-natural\"\n    print(f\"The notes form an {chord_name} triad.\")\n    print(f\"The bass note is {bass_note}, which is the root, so the chord is in root position.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Determine the chord's function in the key.\")\n    print(f\"The {chord_name} chord is not diatonic in {key}.\")\n    print(\"It functions as a secondary (or applied) chord.\")\n    print(\"The root, E-natural, is the leading tone to F.
