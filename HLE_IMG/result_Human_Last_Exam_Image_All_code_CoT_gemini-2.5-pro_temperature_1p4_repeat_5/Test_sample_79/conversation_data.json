    "My plan is to first convert the provided geographical coordinates from DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format to decimal degrees. This conversion is necessary because decimal degrees are the standard format used by most online mapping and geo-location services. Once I have the decimal coordinates, I can use them to pinpoint the exact location on a satellite map and research what is known about any structures at that specific spot. The python code below will perform this conversion and print out each step of the calculation. Finally, based on the research for that location, I will identify the structure and clarify whether it is a historic landmark.\n\n```python\ndef identify_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts DMS coordinates to decimal degrees and identifies the structure at that location.\n    \"\"\"\n    # DMS coordinates from the user\n    lat_deg = 29\n    lat_min = 6\n    lat_sec = 18.75\n    \n    lon_deg = 103\n    lon_min = 47\n    lon_sec = 50.28\n\n    # --- Latitude Conversion ---\n    # The formula for decimal degrees is: Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)\n    # North latitudes are positive.\n    decimal_lat = lat_deg + (lat_min / 60) + (lat_sec / 3600)\n\n    # --- Longitude Conversion ---\n    # West longitudes are negative.\n    decimal_lon = - (lon_deg + (lon_min / 60) + (lon_sec / 3600))\n\n    # --- Print results and identification ---\n    print(\"Converting coordinates to identify the structure:\")\n    \n    # Print latitude conversion\n    print(\"\\n1.
