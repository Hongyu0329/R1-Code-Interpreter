    "Based on the visual clues in the image, I can identify the location. The scene features a beach on a large body of water with a distinct tree line on the opposite shore, which is characteristic of the Puget Sound area. The beach bonfire is a key activity. By cross-referencing these features with popular locations in the Pacific Northwest, the image strongly matches Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington. This park is famous for its sunsets and beach bonfires.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# The city identified from the image is Seattle.\n# This script will print the name of the city.\ncity = \"Seattle\"\n\n# The original image was taken in 2022. This is just for context.\nyear = 2022\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The image was most likely taken in the city of {city}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Seattle>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2022.
