# Step 1: Define the number of lines for the shapes in the third row.
# The shape in the first cell is a scribble, which we've counted as 6 lines.
lines_in_cell_1 = 6

# The shape in the second cell is a bisected semicircle, which has 2 lines.
lines_in_cell_2 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the operation.
# The scribble in the first cell symbolizes subtraction.
# We calculate the number of lines for the missing shape.
lines_in_missing_cell = lines_in_cell_1 - lines_in_cell_2

# Step 3: Print the equation to show the logic.
print("The rule for the third row is subtraction based on the shape in the first column.")
print("The number of lines in the missing shape is calculated as follows:")
print(f"{lines_in_cell_1} - {lines_in_cell_2} = {lines_in_missing_cell}")
print("\nWe must find the answer choice with 4 lines.")
print("Choice 2 is the correct answer.")
