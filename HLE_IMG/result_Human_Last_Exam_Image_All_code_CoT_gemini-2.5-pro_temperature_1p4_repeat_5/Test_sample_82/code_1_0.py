    Determines the location of the new alkene in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.

    The Heck reaction proceeds via three main steps:
    1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
    2. Migratory insertion: The C4=C5 double bond inserts into the C9-Pd bond, forming a new C5-C9 bond and a C4-Pd bond.
    3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon beta to C4 is eliminated. The carbons beta to C4 are C3 and C5.
       - C5 becomes a quaternary carbon after step 2, so it has no hydrogens to eliminate.
       - C3 has hydrogens available for elimination.
    Therefore, a hydrogen is eliminated from C3, forming a new double bond between C3 and C4.
