    "Based on the analysis of the painting's style and elements, I will identify the artist. The artwork is characteristic of a specific surrealist painter known for creating impossible architectural scenes and visual paradoxes. My plan is to use a Python script to simply print the name of the artist.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist who created the provided painting.\n    The painting is a well-known work in the surrealist/illusionist style.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Jos de Mey\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Jos de Mey>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
