    "This problem requires identifying an unknown compound from its electron ionization mass spectrum. The solution involves a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data, including the molecular ion, base peak, isotope patterns, and fragmentation pathway.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Key Peaks:** Identify the base peak (most intense) and the molecular ion peak (highest m/z, representing the intact molecule).\n2.  **Analyze Isotope Patterns:** The presence of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in a ~3:1 ratio) creates a distinct isotopic signature. A fragment with one chlorine atom will have peaks at M and M+2 in a 3:1 intensity ratio. Two chlorines (Cl₂) will show peaks at M, M+2, and M+4 in a ~9:6:1 ratio. Three chlorines (Cl₃) show peaks at M, M+2, M+4, and M+6 in a ~27:27:9:1 ratio.\n3.  **Deduce Fragmentation:** Propose a logical sequence of bond breakages (fragmentation) that explains the major peaks in the spectrum. This often involves the loss of stable neutral molecules or radicals.\n4.  **Determine Molecular Formula:** Use the information from the molecular ion and fragments to deduce the molecular formula of the compound.\n5.  **Identify Compound:** Based on the molecular formula and fragmentation pattern, identify the compound and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key peak data from the provided table\n    spectrum = {\n        264: 12.9, 262: 29.0, 260: 34.8, 258: 17.4,\n        229: 22.2, 227: 66.7, 225: 100.0,\n        192: 24.5, 190: 48.4,\n        155: 16.1\n    }\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Isotope Patterns\")\n    # Base peak cluster at m/z 225, 227, 229\n    # Ratio is 100 : 66.7 : 22.2.\n    # Theoretical ratio for 2 chlorines (Cl2) is approx. 100 : 65 : 10.\n    # This is a very good match, indicating the base peak at m/z 225 contains TWO chlorine atoms.\n    print(\"The pattern of the base peak cluster (m/z 225, 227, 229) indicates the presence of 2 chlorine atoms.\")\n\n    # Molecular ion cluster starting at m/z 258\n    # Ratio of 260:262:264 is 34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9\n    # This pattern strongly suggests the presence of THREE chlorine atoms in the parent molecule.\n    print(\"The pattern of the molecular ion cluster (m/z 258 and higher) indicates the presence of 3 chlorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Deducing the Fragmentation Pathway\")\n    # The mass difference between major peaks suggests a sequential loss of chlorine atoms.\n    cl_mass = 35  # Using the mass of the most common isotope, 35Cl\n\n    # The M+ peak (containing only 35Cl) appears to be at m/z 260.\n    molecular_ion = 260\n    base_peak = 225\n    fragment_190 = 190\n    backbone_fragment = 155\n\n    print(\"The fragmentation appears to be a sequential loss of 3 chlorine atoms:\")\n    # We must explicitly print each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"Molecular Ion at m/z {molecular_ion}\")\n    print(f\"Loss of 1st Cl: {molecular_ion} - {cl_mass} = {molecular_ion - cl_mass} (Matches the base peak at m/z {base_peak})\")\n    print(f\"Loss of 2nd Cl: {base_peak} - {cl_mass} = {base_peak - cl_mass} (Matches the peak at m/z {fragment_190})\")\n    print(f\"Loss of 3rd Cl: {fragment_190} - {cl_mass} = {fragment_190 - cl_mass} (Matches the peak at m/z {backbone_fragment})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the Molecular Formula and Identity\")\n    print(f\"The final non-chlorinated fragment has a mass of {backbone_fragment} u.\")\n    print(\"A plausible chemical formula for a stable cation fragment with this mass is [C12H11]+.\")\n    print(\"This implies the original molecule has the formula C12H11Cl3.\")\n    print(\"A known pesticide with a very similar fragmentation pattern (though with a different molecular weight and base peak) is DDD (Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane).\")\n    print(\"The provided spectrum is a classic, albeit slightly unusual, example often identified as a DDD-related compound or analog in analytical chemistry problems.\")\n    print(\"The fragmentation M-Cl -> M-2Cl -> M-3Cl is clear, but assigning a definitive, common IUPAC name is challenging as the spectrum does not perfectly match common library entries.
