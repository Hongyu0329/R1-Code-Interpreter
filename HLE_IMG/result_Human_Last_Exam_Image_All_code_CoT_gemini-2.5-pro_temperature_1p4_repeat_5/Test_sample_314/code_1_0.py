    """
    This function provides the solution to the graphene band structure puzzle based on the step-by-step analysis.
    The analysis relies on understanding how the tight-binding parameters 't' (hopping) and 's' (overlap)
    affect the band structure's bandwidth and asymmetry.

    Analysis Summary:
    - Condition 1 (minimum t): Corresponds to the narrowest bandwidth. Plot 2 clearly shows the smallest energy range. -> Sim 2
    - Condition 2 (minimum |s|): Corresponds to the least electron-hole asymmetry. Plot 1 shows the smallest asymmetry. -> Sim 1
    - Condition 3 (unique sign(s)): Corresponds to a flipped asymmetry direction. Plot 4's asymmetry is flipped compared to 1, 2, and 3. -> Sim 4
    - Condition 4 (maximum s): Corresponds to the largest positive 's', meaning the largest asymmetry among plots 1, 2, and 3. Plot 3 is the most asymmetric. -> Sim 3

    The final answer is the sequence of simulation indices corresponding to conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
