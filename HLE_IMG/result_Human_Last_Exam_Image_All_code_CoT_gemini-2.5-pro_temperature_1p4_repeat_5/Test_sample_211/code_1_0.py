# The task is to identify the individual bird from a set of images.
# After careful visual analysis of the feather patterns, particularly the unique scalloping
# on the back and a specific minor disruption in that pattern, the correct image is identified.

# The matching image is 'B'.
# This script will print the identified letter.
