    "To solve this problem, we need to determine what the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal looks like when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the FCC Crystal Structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of its six faces.\n2.  **Understand the [110] Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector `v = [1, 1, 0]`.\n3.  **Determine the Resulting 2D Pattern:** The projection of the FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a specific 2D repeating pattern. This pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**. It consists of a rectangular grid of atoms with an additional atom located in the center of each rectangle. The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the `<001>` and `<1-10>` directions in the crystal, and their length ratio is âˆš2.\n4.  **Analyze the Given Images:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular pattern of atoms.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows a pattern with hexagonal symmetry, which is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction.\n    *   **Image C:** Shows atoms at the four corners of a parallelogram (a rectangle viewed in perspective) and one atom in the exact center. This perfectly matches the description of a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows a more complex arrangement that does not fit the centered rectangular description.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Image C is the correct representation of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n6.  **Code Demonstration:** I will provide a Python script to calculate and display the coordinates of the atoms that form a single unit cell of this projected centered rectangular pattern.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_fcc_110_projection_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coordinates for a unit cell of an FCC lattice\n    projected along the [110] direction, which forms a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n    The projected unit cell is a rectangle with side lengths 'a' and 'a*sqrt(2)'.\n    We will assume a lattice constant 'a' = 10 for visualization purposes.\n    The pattern consists of atoms at the four corners and one in the center.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 10.0  # Assumed lattice constant for clarity\n\n    # The side lengths of the projected rectangular cell\n    side_y = a\n    side_x = a * math.sqrt(2)\n\n    # Coordinates of the atoms in the projected 2D unit cell\n    corner_bottom_left = (0.0, 0.0)\n    corner_bottom_right = (side_x, 0.0)\n    corner_top_left = (0.0, side_y)\n    corner_top_right = (side_x, side_y)\n    center_atom = (side_x / 2, side_y / 2)\n\n    print(\"The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a centered rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"This pattern is shown in Image C.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a lattice constant 'a', the projected unit cell is a rectangle with side lengths 'a' and 'a*sqrt(2)'.\")\n    print(f\"Assuming a = {a}, the side lengths are {side_y:.2f} and {side_x:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe coordinates of the 5 atoms forming one such centered rectangle are:\")\n    print(f\"Corner 1 (Bottom-Left): ({corner_bottom_left[0]:.2f}, {corner_bottom_left[1]:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"Corner 2 (Bottom-Right): ({corner_bottom_right[0]:.2f}, {corner_bottom_right[1]:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"Corner 3 (Top-Left):    ({corner_top_left[0]:.2f}, {corner_top_left[1]:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"Corner 4 (Top-Right):   ({corner_top_right[0]:.2f}, {corner_top_right[1]:.2f})\")\n    print(f\"Center Atom:            ({center_atom[0]:.2f}, {center_atom[1]:.2f})\")\n    print(\"\\nThis arrangement matches the topology of the atoms in Image C.\")\n\nget_fcc_110_projection_pattern()\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
