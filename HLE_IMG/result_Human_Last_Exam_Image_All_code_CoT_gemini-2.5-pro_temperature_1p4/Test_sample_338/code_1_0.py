    This function solves the problem based on the reasoning provided.

    2. It identifies the base plot number n_0.
    3. It calculates the final expression n_0 / |t^2|.
    """

    # Step 1: Determine |t^2|
    # For a 1D Dirac fermion, when the potential height V = 2 * Energy E,
    # a special symmetry arises. The wave number inside the barrier k' becomes equal to the
    # wave number outside k. Also, the spinor matching term s'*s becomes 1.
    # The inverse of the transmission amplitude 't' simplifies to:
    # 1/t = [cos(k*delta_z) - i*sin(k*delta_z)] * exp(i*k*delta_z)
    # 1/t = exp(-i*k*delta_z) * exp(i*k*delta_z) = 1
    # Thus, t = 1.
    t_squared = 1

    # Step 2: Identify n_0
    # The problem is now to find the number n_0 of the base plot.
    # The analysis of parameters satisfying V > 2m for all variations forces m_0 = 1/2.
    # Plot #5 shows the least number of oscillations, characteristic of a small barrier width Δz.
    # It is the most plausible candidate for the base case with the simplest set of parameters,
    # e.g., (m_0, V_0, Δz_0) = (1/2, 3/2, 1/2).
    # Hence, we identify n_0 = 5.
    n_0 = 5

    # Step 3: Compute the final value
    result = n_0 / t_squared
