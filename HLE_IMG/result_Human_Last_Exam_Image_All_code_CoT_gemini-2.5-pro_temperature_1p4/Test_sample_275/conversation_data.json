    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided RT-PCR gel results. Each distinct band on the gel represents a unique mRNA molecule (a splice species) of a certain size. By examining the results from different primer pairs, we can identify and count all the unique splice species.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Categorize by Primer Specificity:** The key to distinguishing the splice species is to use the information about the primers.\n    *   **Primer E1F2** is designed to span the `929^3465` splice junction. Any product from this primer confirms a species with this specific splice.\n    *   **Primer E1F3** spans the `929^3506` splice junction. Products from this primer confirm species with this splice.\n    *   **Primer E1F1** is upstream of the splice sites detected by E1F2/E1F3. It will amplify transcripts that use different splice patterns or are unspliced in that region.\n2.  **Count Species in Each Category:** We will count the number of distinct bands for each category.\n    *   **E1F2 Species:** We'll check panels D and F.\n    *   **E1F3 Species:** We'll check panel G.\n    *   **E1F1 Species:** We will use panel I, as it's the most sensitive experiment (`30 cycles`) for this primer pair and reveals the most bands.\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** Since these primer sets detect mutually exclusive sets of initial splice events, the total number of species is the sum of the species found in each category.\n\nThis process allows us to systematically count every unique splice variant shown in the results without double-counting.\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the provided RT-PCR data to determine the total number of splice species.\n    The logic is based on counting the number of unique PCR products (bands) for each\n    set of primers that target different splice junctions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the RT-PCR results to find all unique splice species...\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Count species detected with primer E1F2 ---\n    # Primer E1F2 detects the 929^3465 splice.\n    # Panel D (E1F2/E5R) shows 1 band (551 bp).\n    # Panel F (E1F2/L2R) also shows 1 band (972 bp).\n    # This confirms one unique species with this splice pattern.\n    species_from_E1F2 = 1\n    print(f\"1.
