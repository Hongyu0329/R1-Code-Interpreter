# Step 3: Determine the integer parameters of the shapes based on the data and geometric constraints.
# Through analysis, the relationship that best fits all the data and integer constraints is:
# - The radius of a circle, r, must be an even integer.
# - The width of a green rectangle, w_g, is equal to r.
# - The height of a green rectangle, l_g, is equal to 1.5 * r.

# We choose the simplest, smallest integers that satisfy these conditions.

w_g = r

# Step 4: Calculate the theoretical area ratios using these parameters to verify the model.
# L = 6*r + w_g = 7*r
# W = 2*r*(1 + sqrt(3))
# Area_total = L * W = 14 * r^2 * (1 + sqrt(3))
# Area_circles = 9 * pi * r^2
# Area_green = w_g * l_g = r * 1.5*r = 1.5 * r^2

# Step 5: Calculate the final dimensions of the outer rectangle.
# Length x = 6r + w_g
# Width y = 2r(1 + sqrt(3))

width_y = 2 * r * (1 + math.sqrt(3))

# Step 6: Round the dimensions to the nearest cm and print the final answer.
