    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which the entire pattern can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and remain unchanged. The number of times the pattern appears identical during a full 360-degree rotation is the order of the rotational symmetry.\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**: By examining the tiling, we can see several repeating shapes that could be centers of rotation. The most prominent are the dark blue hexagons and the light yellow squares surrounded by orange rhombi.\n\n2.  **Analyze Symmetry around Hexagons**: Let's consider the center of one of the dark blue hexagons. A regular hexagon has 6 sides. If we rotate the entire tiling by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around this center point, the hexagon itself will align perfectly with its original position. Crucially, we must also check if the surrounding pattern aligns. In this tiling, each hexagon is surrounded by six squares, and these squares are part of star-like patterns. A 60-degree rotation maps each of these surrounding elements onto the next identical element. Thus, the entire tiling is invariant under this rotation. This confirms the presence of 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Analyze Symmetry around Squares**: We can also consider the center of a light yellow square. A square has 4-fold symmetry. Rotating the pattern by 360 / 4 = 90 degrees around the center of a square also leaves the entire pattern unchanged. This means the tiling also has centers of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n4.  **Determine the Overall Symmetry**: When a pattern has multiple orders of rotational symmetry, \"the rotational symmetry\" of the tiling refers to the highest order found. In this case, we have found both 6-fold and 4-fold symmetry. The highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold. The following Python code formalizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The rotational symmetry is determined by the highest order of rotation found in the pattern.\n    # We identify that the centers of the dark blue hexagons provide the highest order.\n    # A hexagon has 6 sides, which corresponds to a 6-fold symmetry.\n    \n    num_sides_of_central_polygon = 6\n    full_rotation = 360\n    \n    # The angle of rotation for one step of the symmetry operation.\n    rotation_angle = full_rotation / num_sides_of_central_polygon\n    \n    print(\"The rotational symmetry of a tiling is the highest order of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n    print(\"In this tiling, the highest order of symmetry is centered on the hexagons.\")\n    print(f\"A hexagon has {num_sides_of_central_polygon} sides.\")\n    print(\"The calculation for the rotation angle is:\")\n    print(f\"{full_rotation} (degrees in a full circle) / {num_sides_of_central_polygon} (sides of hexagon) = {int(rotation_angle)} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"Since the pattern repeats {num_sides_of_central_polygon} times in a 360-degree rotation, the rotational symmetry is {num_sides_of_central_polygon}-fold.\")\n    \n    # The final answer is the order of the symmetry.\n    final_answer = num_sides_of_central_polygon\n    print(f\"\\nThe rotational symmetry is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
