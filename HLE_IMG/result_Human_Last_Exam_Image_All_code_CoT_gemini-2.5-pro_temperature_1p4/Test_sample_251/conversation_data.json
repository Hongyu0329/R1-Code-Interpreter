    "My plan is to solve this problem by first determining the time value for each small square on the ECG grid, then identifying the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the R-R interval) in terms of small squares, and finally calculating the duration of this interval in seconds.\n\n1.  **Determine Time per Small Square:** The ECG paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. Each small square on the grid is 1 mm wide. Therefore, the time duration for one small square can be calculated as 1 second / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Find the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, I will locate the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves. The most significant pause occurs in the fourth strip, around the timestamp 0:06:08. I will count the number of small squares between the peaks of these two R-waves.\n3.  **Count the Squares:** The R-wave before the pause aligns with a major grid line. The R-wave after the pause is located 6 large squares and 2 small squares to the right. Since one large square is 5 small squares, the total distance is (6 * 5) + 2 = 32 small squares.\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:** I will multiply the number of small squares (32) by the time per small square (0.04 seconds) to find the total duration of the longest R-R interval.\n\n```python\n# The ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n# Each small square on the grid is 1 mm.\nspeed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n# First, calculate the time duration of one small square (1 mm).\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Next, identify the longest R-R interval on the strip by counting the number of small squares.\n# Visual inspection shows a long pause in the fourth row.\n# Let's count the number of small squares for this longest interval.\n# The interval spans 6 large squares and 2 small squares.\n# Since one large square = 5 small squares:\nnum_large_squares = 6\nnum_small_squares_extra = 2\nnum_small_squares_total = (num_large_squares * 5) + num_small_squares_extra\n\n# Finally, calculate the duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = num_small_squares_total * time_per_small_square_sec\n\nprint(f\"The ECG paper speed is {speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec.\")\nprint(f\"The time for one small square is 1 / {speed_mm_per_sec} = {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {num_small_squares_total} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {num_small_squares_total} small squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<1.28>>>"
