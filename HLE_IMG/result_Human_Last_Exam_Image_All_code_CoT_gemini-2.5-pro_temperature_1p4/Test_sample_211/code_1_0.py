# The user wants me to identify the correct image from the options provided.
# This is a visual pattern recognition task.
# I have analyzed the target image and compared it to all the options (A through I).

# Key features of the Target image:
# 1. Posture: Bird is looking over its left shoulder.
# 2. Feather Pattern: A distinct, dense "scalloped" pattern on the back and wings.
# 3. Lighting: Illumination comes from the left, creating specific highlights and shadows.

# Comparison with options:
# - Images A, B, D, E, F, G, H, and I show birds with different patterns, lighting, or postures.
# - Image C is a very close match in terms of posture, lighting, and most importantly, the specific feather pattern on the back.
# The size, shape, and density of the scalloped markings in C are visually identical to the Target.

correct_option = 'C'

# The final answer is the letter of the correct image.
