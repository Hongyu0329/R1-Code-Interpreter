    "Based on my analysis of the histopathological image, the key feature is the presence of a large, cellular, crescent-shaped structure within Bowman's space that is compressing the glomerular tuft. This finding is the hallmark of a specific type of severe kidney disease.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will print out the diagnosis based on this classic histopathological finding.\n\n```python\ndef identify_histopathology(image_features):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides a diagnosis based on key features observed in a histopathological image.\n\n  Args:\n    image_features: A list of strings describing the observed features.\n\n  Returns:\n    A string containing the diagnosis.\n  \"\"\"\n  if \"cellular crescent in glomerulus\" in image_features:\n    return \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n  else:\n    return \"Diagnosis cannot be determined from the provided features.\"\n\n# The provided image prominently displays a hypercellular crescent filling Bowman's space\n# and compressing the glomerular tuft. This is the pathognomonic feature.\nfeatures_observed = [\"cellular crescent in glomerulus\", \"glomerular tuft compression\", \"tubular injury\"]\ndiagnosis = identify_histopathology(features_observed)\n\nprint(\"Histopathological Diagnosis:\")\nprint(diagnosis)\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
