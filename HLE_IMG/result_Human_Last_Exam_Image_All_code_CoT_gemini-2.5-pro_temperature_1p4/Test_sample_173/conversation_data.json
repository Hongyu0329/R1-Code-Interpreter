    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes within one bar for each hand. The time signature tells us how many beats are in a measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Right Hand):** I will identify the notes and their durations. The beaming of the notes helps group them into beats.\n    *   The first beat consists of a group of four sixteenth notes (the first one is a chord).\n    *   The second beat is also a group of four sixteenth notes.\n    *   The third beat is another group of four sixteenth notes.\n    *   I will sum these durations. Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note.\n2.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Left Hand):** I will identify the notes and their durations.\n    *   The bass clef contains three distinct notes: C#, G#, C#. Visually, these are written as quarter notes.\n    *   I will sum the duration of these three quarter notes.\n3.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the total duration in both staves, I can determine the number of beats and the note value per beat, which gives us the time signature.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by summing the note durations in the measure.\n    Note values are relative to a quarter note (1.0).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Note value definitions\n    quarter_note = 1.0\n    sixteenth_note = 0.25\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Musical Measure ---\")\n\n    # --- Right Hand (Treble Clef) Analysis ---\n    print(\"\\n1.

Analyzing the Left Hand (Bass Clef):\")\n    # The left hand is composed of three quarter notes.\n    lh_note_1_value = quarter_note\n    lh_note_2_value = quarter_note\n    lh_note_3_value = quarter_note\n    lh_total_duration = lh_note_1_value + lh_note_2_value + lh_note_3_value\n\n    print(\"The left hand contains three quarter notes.\")\n    print(\"The total duration is calculated by summing the value of each note.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {lh_note_1_value} + {lh_note_2_value} + {lh_note_3_value} = {lh_total_duration} quarter notes.\")\n\n    # --- Conclusion ---\n    print(\"\\n3. Conclusion:\")\n    if rh_total_duration == lh_total_duration:\n        beats_per_measure = int(rh_total_duration)\n        beat_unit = 4  # Since the count is in quarter notes\n        print(f\"Both hands have a total duration equivalent to {beats_per_measure} quarter notes.\")\n        print(f\"This indicates a time signature of {beats_per_measure}/{beat_unit}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: The durations in the hands do not match.\")\n\ncalculate_time_signature()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
