    Analyzes the volcano plot to identify the protein with a reduced degradation rate.

    A volcano plot shows the relationship between fold change and statistical significance.
    - X-axis (LOG2(FOLD)): Positive values mean the protein is more abundant (up-regulated).
                             Negative values mean the protein is less abundant (down-regulated).
    - Y-axis (-LOG10(P-VALUE)): Higher values mean the change is more statistically significant.

    The problem states that one protein has a reduced degradation rate.
    - A protein's level is a balance of its synthesis and degradation.
    - Protein Level is proportional to (Synthesis Rate / Degradation Rate).
    - A reduction in the degradation rate will cause the protein to accumulate, leading to an
      increase in its overall level.

    Therefore, we are looking for a protein that is significantly up-regulated. This means it
    should have a large positive LOG2(FOLD) value and a high -LOG10(P-VALUE).

    Let's examine the labeled proteins from the plot:
