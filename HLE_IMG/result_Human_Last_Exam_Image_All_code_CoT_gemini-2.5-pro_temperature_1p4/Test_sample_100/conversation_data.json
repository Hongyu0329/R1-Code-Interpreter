    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the molecular formula of the product, followed by a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The provided chemical structure is a bicyclic organic molecule. Based on the reaction sequence, particularly the final acid hydrolysis step, the most chemically plausible structure is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). Specifically, it is a derivative of **2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one**. This core structure is substituted with a **p-methoxybenzyl (PMB)** group on the nitrogen and a **trifluoromethyl (CF3)** group on the double bond. I will first calculate the molecular formula of this starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Step 1 (CAN, ACN/H₂O):** Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is a reagent commonly used to remove the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction replaces the PMB group (C₈H₉O) with a single hydrogen atom (H).\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction Step 2 (Pd/C, H₂):** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms (H₂).\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction Step 3 (4 N HCl, 70 °C):** These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The lactam ring will be opened by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). This converts the cyclic amide into a linear molecule containing both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine group (-NH₂), which will be protonated to -NH₃⁺ under the acidic conditions.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** By tracking the addition and subtraction of atoms through these three steps, I will determine the final molecular formula of the product. The provided Python script automates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef format_formula(formula_dict):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atoms into a standard molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest\n    order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n    parts = []\n    for atom in order:\n        count = formula_dict.get(atom, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            parts.append(f\"{atom}{count if count > 1 else ''}\")\n    return \"\".join(parts)\n\ndef apply_reaction(current_formula, atoms_to_remove, atoms_to_add):\n    \"\"\"Applies the changes of a reaction to a molecular formula.\"\"\"\n    next_formula = current_formula.copy()\n    for atom, count in atoms_to_remove.items():\n        if atom in next_formula:\n            next_formula[atom] -= count\n    for atom, count in atoms_to_add.items():\n        next_formula[atom] = next_formula.get(atom, 0) + count\n    return next_formula\n\n# --- Step 0: Define the starting material ---\n# Core (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one): C6H7NO\n# Substituents: PMB (C8H9O) on N, CF3 (CF3) on C=C.\n# Substitution removes one H from N and one H from C.\n# Total C = 6(core) + 8(PMB) + 1(CF3) = 15\n# Total H = 7(core) + 9(PMB) - 1(for PMB sub) - 1(for CF3 sub) = 14\n# Total F = 3\n# Total N = 1\n# Total O = 1(core) + 1(PMB) = 2\nstarting_material = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\nprint(f\"Step 0: The determined starting material formula is {format_formula(starting_material)}.\")\n\n# --- Step 1: Deprotection of PMB group ---\npmb_group = {'C': 8, 'H': 9, 'O': 1}\nh_atom = {'H': 1}\nintermediate_1 = apply_reaction(starting_material, pmb_group, h_atom)\nprint(f\"Step 1 (CAN): Remove PMB group (-C8H9O), Add H (+H).
