    "This Apulian red-figure vase depicts a dramatic mythological scene. The key elements for identification are the figure in the chariot wearing a Phrygian cap (indicating an Eastern origin), the figure ascending from the chariot, the large wing suggesting a divine or magical vehicle, and the dead man lying on the ground.\n\nThis combination of elements strongly suggests the conclusion of the myth of Medea. After taking revenge on her unfaithful husband Jason by killing his new bride and her father, King Creon of Corinth, Medea escapes the city in a winged chariot, a gift from her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n\nIn the vase painting:\n1.  The dead man on the ground represents the tragedy Medea leaves behind, likely King Creon.\n2.  The chariot is part of her magical escape. The wing belongs to the divine power (perhaps Nike, a Fury, or the chariot itself) enabling her departure.\n3.  The central figure actively leaving the scene, ascending in the chariot, is Medea herself. The driver, though depicted with Medea's characteristic Phrygian cap, can be interpreted as a divine agent facilitating her escape. The primary actor in the myth's climax is Medea, who is departing. Therefore, she is the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the figure leaving the chariot in the provided image of a Greek vase.\n    The scene is interpreted as the myth of Medea escaping from Corinth.\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Medea\"\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot is identified as {figure_name}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
