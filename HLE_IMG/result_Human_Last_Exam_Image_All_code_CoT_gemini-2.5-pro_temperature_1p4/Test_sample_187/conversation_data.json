    "This problem asks us to identify the types of pericyclic reactions occurring and the byproduct formed in the reaction between a Münchnone and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to yield a substituted pyrrole.\n\nHere is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** The first reactant is a Münchnone (a type of mesoionic compound), which can act as a 1,3-dipole. The key resonance structure for this reaction shows a carbanion at position 4 and an iminium group (C=N+), making the C4-N3-C2 system a 4π-electron 1,3-dipole. The second reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), a symmetrical alkyne with electron-withdrawing groups, making it an excellent dipolarophile (a 2π-electron system).\n\n2.  **Propose the First Reaction:** The reaction between a 1,3-dipole and a dipolarophile is a classic **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition**. This is a pericyclic reaction, specifically a thermally allowed [4π + 2π] cycloaddition, which forms a five-membered ring. In this case, it leads to a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intermediate and Second Reaction:** The initial bicyclic cycloadduct is unstable, especially at 100 °C. It contains a bridge (`-O-C(=O)-`) that corresponds to a molecule of carbon dioxide. This bridge is readily eliminated to form a stable aromatic pyrrole ring. The concerted elimination of a small molecule like CO2, where two sigma bonds to a single atom are broken, is another type of pericyclic reaction known as a **cheletropic elimination** (which can also be viewed as a retro-cycloaddition).\n\n4.  **Identify the Byproduct:** The molecule eliminated during the second pericyclic step is **carbon dioxide (CO2)**. We can verify this by an atom count:\n    *   Münchnone (C10H9NO2) + DMAD (C6H6O4) → Total Reactants: C16H15NO6\n    *   Pyrrole Product (C15H15NO4)\n    *   Difference = Reactants - Product = (C16-C15)H(15-15)N(1-1)O(6-4) = C1H0N0O2 = CO2.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The two pericyclic reactions are 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and cheletropic elimination. The stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide. I will write a Python script to print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the reaction types and byproduct for the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    reaction_type_1 = \"1,3-dipolar cycloaddition\"\n    reaction_type_2 = \"Cheletropic elimination\"\n    byproduct = \"carbon dioxide (CO2)\"\n\n    print(\"The reaction involves two sequential pericyclic reactions.\")\n    print(f\"1. The first reaction is a {reaction_type_1}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The second reaction is a {reaction_type_2}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe stoichiometric byproduct formed during this process is {byproduct}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, Cheletropic elimination, Carbon dioxide (CO2)>>>"
