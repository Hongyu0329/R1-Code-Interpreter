    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the Jones polynomial for the given knot:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the knot from the provided image. By observing its characteristics, such as the number of crossings (10) and its alternating nature, I can compare it to standard knot classifications. This knot is identified as the **10_139 knot**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Writhe:** The writhe of the knot diagram is crucial. By assigning a consistent orientation (e.g., clockwise) and checking each crossing, I can determine if they are right-handed (+1) or left-handed (-1). All 10 crossings in this diagram are left-handed, making the total writhe `w = -10`.\n\n3.  **Find the Jones Polynomial:** Standard knot theory databases typically provide the Jones polynomial for the version of a knot with a positive writhe. The polynomial for the standard `10_139` knot (with `w = +10`) is `t^7 - t^6 + 2t^5 - 2t^4 + 3t^3 - 2t^2 + 2t - 1 + t^-1 - t^-2`. Since the provided diagram has a negative writhe, it represents the mirror image of the standard knot. To find the polynomial for the mirror image, we substitute `t` with `t^-1`. This gives us:\n    `p(t) = t^{-7} - t^{-6} + 2t^{-5} - 2t^{-4} + 3t^{-3} - 2t^{-2} + 2t^{-1} - 1 + t - t^2`\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** Finally, I will rearrange the polynomial terms in decreasing order of degree, as requested, and generate a Python script to print the result. The code will construct the polynomial string from its coefficients and powers to ensure all numbers are explicitly handled.\n\nHere is the Python code that generates the Jones polynomial for the given knot.\n\n```python\ndef get_jones_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the Jones polynomial for the given knot (10_139 mirror).\n    The polynomial is constructed from its coefficients and powers and formatted\n    in decreasing degree order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The terms of the Jones polynomial for the knot 10_139 (mirror)\n    # stored as a list of (coefficient, power) tuples in decreasing power order.\n    polynomial_terms = [\n        (-1, 2),\n        (1, 1),\n        (-1, 0),\n        (2, -1),\n        (-2, -2),\n        (3, -3),\n        (-2, -4),\n        (2, -5),\n        (-1, -6),\n        (1, -7)\n    ]\n\n    output_parts = []\n    \n    # Format the first term\n    coeff, power = polynomial_terms[0]\n    if coeff == 1 and power != 0:\n        term_str = \"\"\n    elif coeff == -1 and power != 0:\n        term_str = \"-\"\n    else:\n        term_str = str(coeff)\n\n    if power == 1:\n        term_str += \"t\"\n    elif power != 0:\n        term_str += f\"t^{{{power}}}\"\n    \n    output_parts.append(term_str)\n\n    # Format the remaining terms\n    for coeff, power in polynomial_terms[1:]:\n        # Determine the sign part\n        if coeff > 0:\n            sign = \" + \"\n        else:\n            sign = \" - \"\n        \n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        # Determine the coefficient part\n        if abs_coeff == 1 and power != 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n        \n        # Determine the variable part\n        if power == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            var_str = \"t\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"t^{{{power}}}\"\n            \n        output_parts.append(f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{var_str}\")\n\n    print(\"\".join(output_parts))\n\nget_jones_polynomial()\n```\n<<<-t^{2} + t - 1 + 2t^{-1} - 2t^{-2} + 3t^{-3} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-5} - t^{-6} + t^{-7}>>>"
