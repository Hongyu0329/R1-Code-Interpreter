    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Identify the plant:** I will first analyze the visual characteristics of the plant in the image. The leaves are dark green with a very distinct and intricate network of white or pale green veins, a pattern known as reticulation.\n2.  **Determine the species:** Based on this unique leaf pattern, the plant is identifiable as *Debregeasia hedyotidea*.\n3.  **Find the endemic location:** I will then find the native origin of this specific plant species.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that contains this information within a simple data structure (a dictionary) to simulate looking up the answer in a database. The script will then print the name of the island where the plant is endemic.\n\n```python\ndef find_endemic_island():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the plant from its description and finds the island it is endemic to\n    from a small internal database.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary acts as a small botanical database.\n    # The plant in the image is identified as Debregeasia hedyotidea due to its\n    # distinctive reticulated leaf venation.\n    plant_database = {\n        'Debregeasia hedyotidea': {\n            'common_name': 'Taiwanese Ivy',\n            'endemic_location': 'Taiwan'\n        },\n        'Wollemi Pine': {\n            'common_name': 'Wollemi nobilis',\n            'endemic_location': 'Australia'\n        },\n        'Dragon Blood Tree': {\n            'common_name': 'Dracaena cinnabari',\n            'endemic_location': 'Socotra'\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The plant identified in the image.\n    plant_name = 'Debregeasia hedyotidea'\n\n    # Retrieve and print the endemic location.\n    if plant_name in plant_database:\n        island = plant_database[plant_name]['endemic_location']\n        print(f\"The plant '{plant_name}' is endemic to the island of: {island}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not find information for '{plant_name}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Taiwan>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
