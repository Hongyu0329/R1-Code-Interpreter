    "This is a mate-in-2 chess puzzle. Black is to move and achieve checkmate in two moves, without moving the black queens.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the board state:** First, I will carefully identify the positions of all pieces for both White and Black from the provided image. The White king appears to be in a very tight spot.\n2.  **Identify White's weaknesses:** The White king on g1 has very limited mobility. The squares g2 is controlled by the Black bishop on h3. The pawn on h2 blocks that square. The only potential escape square seems to be h1.\n3.  **Evaluate Black's candidate moves:** I will look for a sequence of two moves for Black that forces a checkmate. The constraint is that Black's queens cannot be moved. This narrows down the possibilities to Black's knight, rook, bishop, and pawns.\n4.  **Formulate the mating sequence:** A common pattern in such puzzles is a forcing move (like a check) that reduces White's possible replies to just one, followed by a final move that delivers an inescapable checkmate.\n5.  **Verify the solution:** I'll double-check the proposed sequence to ensure it leads to checkmate against White's forced move and that there are no alternative escape paths for the White king.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n1.  **Black's First Move (1. ... Nf2+):** Black moves the knight from d1 to f2. This places the White king on g1 in check.\n2.  **White's Forced Reply (2. Kh1):** The White king must move out of check.\n    *   It cannot move to g2 because that square is attacked by the Black bishop on h3.\n    *   It cannot capture the knight on f2 as it is not a legal king move.\n    *   It cannot move to f1 as it is occupied by its own bishop.\n    *   The only legal move for White is to move the king to h1.\n3.  **Black's Second Move (2. ... Rh8#):** Black moves the rook from f8 to h8, delivering checkmate.\n    *   The White king on h1 is now in check from the rook on h8.\n    *   The king cannot escape to g1 or g2, as both squares are controlled by the Black knight on f2.\n    *   The king cannot move to h2, as it is blocked by its own pawn.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked by any White piece.\n    *   The rook on h8 cannot be captured.\n\nThis sequence forces checkmate in two moves, as required.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_2():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the sequence of moves for Black to achieve mate in 2.\n  The puzzle specifies not to move the Black queens.\n  \"\"\"\n  move_1 = \"Nf2+\"\n  move_2 = \"Rh8#\"\n\n  print(\"The sequence for Black to mate in 2 is:\")\n  print(f\"1. ... {move_1}\")\n  print(f\"2. ... {move_2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_mate_in_2()\n```\n<<<Nf2+, Rh8#>>>"
