def solve_plant_invasion():
    """
    This function determines the invasion status for three pairs of plant images (A, B, C).
    
    The analysis is based on visual interpretation of the ecological context in each image:
    - Pair A (Garlic Mustard): The right image shows a dense monoculture, a hallmark of an invasion.
      The left is a more diverse community, typical of a native range. So, A is 'right invaded'.
    - Pair B (Large-leaved Lupine): Both images show dense, aggressive colonization of disturbed land,
      which is characteristic of this species in its invasive range. So, B is 'both invasive'.
    - Pair C (Papaya): Neither image shows signs of a problematic invasion. The scenes are consistent
      with its native or cultivated, non-invasive status. So, C is 'both native'.

    The options are:
    1) both native
    2) both invasive
    3) right invaded
    4) left invaded
