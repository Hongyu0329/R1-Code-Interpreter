    This function prints the final sequence of pairings between airfoil shapes (A-H)
    and their corresponding pressure coefficient plots (1-8).
    
    The analysis is as follows:
    - Airfoil A (thin, cambered) -> Plot 5 (moderate lift)
    - Airfoil B (symmetric, thicker) -> Plot 8 (low lift, more than D)
    - Airfoil C (thin, less cambered) -> Plot 4 (moderate lift, less than A)
    - Airfoil D (symmetric, thin) -> Plot 2 (lowest lift)
    - Airfoil E (thick, cambered, blunt LE) -> Plot 3 (high lift, broad peak)
    - Airfoil F (thick, highly cambered, sharp LE) -> Plot 6 (highest lift, sharp peak)
    - Airfoil G (thick, cambered, very blunt LE) -> Plot 7 (high lift, broadest peak)
    - Airfoil H (thick, reflex camber) -> Plot 1 (high lift but less than E,F,G)
    
    The final sequence is formed by listing the plot number for each airfoil from A to H.
