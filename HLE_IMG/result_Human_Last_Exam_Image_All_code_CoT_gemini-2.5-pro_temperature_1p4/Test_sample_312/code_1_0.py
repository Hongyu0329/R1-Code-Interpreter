    This function solves the SWNT plot identification puzzle.
    The logic for determining the m-values is as follows:

    1.  Classification of SWNTs (n=4, m=0-4):
        - Metallic (n-m is multiple of 3): (4,1), (4,4)
        - Semiconducting: (4,0), (4,2), (4,3)
        - Tube Diameter d ~ sqrt(n^2+nm+m^2): d(4,0)<d(4,1)<d(4,2)<d(4,3)<d(4,4)

    2.  Analysis of Band Structure Plots (#1, #3, #5, #7, #9):
        - Metallic (no band gap): #1, #7.
        - Semiconducting (band gap): #3, #5, #9.
        - Band density is proportional to diameter.
        - Metallic pair: d(4,1) < d(4,4), so density of #1 < density of #7.
          => Plot #1 is m=1, Plot #7 is m=4.
        - Semiconducting trio: d(4,0) < d(4,2) < d(4,3), so density of #9 < density of #3 < density of #5.
          => Plot #9 is m=0, Plot #3 is m=2, Plot #5 is m=3.

    3.  Analysis of Oscillator Strength Plots (#2, #4, #6, #8):
        - Metallic (Brillouin Zone contains K/K' points): #2.
        - Semiconducting (BZ misses K/K' points): #4, #6, #8.
        - BZ height in k-space is inversely proportional to diameter.
        - Plot #2 is metallic, high symmetry suggests armchair (4,4). => Plot #2 is m=4.
        - The missing plot must be for the other metallic tube, m=1.
        - Semiconducting trio: d(4,0)<d(4,2)<d(4,3) => BZ height: h(m=0)>h(m=2)>h(m=3).
        - Visually, height of hexagon #8 > #6 > #4.
          => Plot #8 is m=0, Plot #6 is m=2, Plot #4 is m=3.

    4.  Final Sequence (Plot #1 to #9):
        - Plot 1 (Band, m=1)
        - Plot 2 (Oscillator, m=4)
        - Plot 3 (Band, m=2)
        - Plot 4 (Oscillator, m=3)
        - Plot 5 (Band, m=3)
        - Plot 6 (Oscillator, m=2)
        - Plot 7 (Band, m=4)
        - Plot 8 (Oscillator, m=0)
        - Plot 9 (Band, m=0)
