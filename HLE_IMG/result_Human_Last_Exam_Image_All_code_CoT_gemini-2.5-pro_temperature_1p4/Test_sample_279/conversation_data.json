    "Based on my analysis, I will provide a Python script to determine the caries classification.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first explain the most common system for classifying dental caries, which is G.V. Black's classification system.\n2.  I will then analyze the image provided. The image shows a carious lesion and a restoration on the occlusal (biting) surface of a posterior tooth.\n3.  By comparing the location of the lesion in the image with the definitions in G.V. Black's system, I can identify the correct class.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that outlines this logic and prints the final classification.\n\n```python\ndef find_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the G.V. Black caries classification for the lesion\n    shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define G.V. Black's classifications for context.\n    print(\"Step 1: G.V. Black's Classification System\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Class I:   Caries in pits or fissures on occlusal surfaces of molars/premolars.\")\n    print(\"Class II:  Caries on proximal (in-between) surfaces of molars/premolars.\")\n    print(\"Class III: Caries on proximal surfaces of incisors/canines (front teeth).\")\n    print(\"Class IV:  Caries on proximal surfaces of incisors/canines, involving the incisal edge.\")\n    print(\"Class V:   Caries on the gingival (gumline) third of any tooth.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the provided image.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Image Analysis\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The image displays the top (occlusal) surface of a molar tooth.\")\n    print(\"A large filling is present in the center, and there is dark staining and decay in the surrounding grooves (pits and fissures).\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3: Match the analysis to the classification.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    lesion_location = \"Pits and fissures on the occlusal surface\"\n    classification_code = \"I\" # Roman numeral for 1\n\n    print(f\"The lesion is located in the '{lesion_location}'.\")\n    print(f\"According to G.V.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
