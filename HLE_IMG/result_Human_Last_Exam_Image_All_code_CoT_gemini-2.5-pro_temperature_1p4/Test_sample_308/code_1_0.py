    Analyzes the roller configurations and displacement plots to find the correct pairings.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The slope of a displacement plot (A-H) corresponds to the ratio of the
        radii of the driving roller to the driven roller (r_driver / r_driven)
        at the point of contact.
    2.  The number of lobes on the driving (green) roller dictates the number of
        periodic cycles in the displacement plot.
    3.  The specific shapes of the rollers determine the smoothness and the
        amplitude of the variations in the plot's slope.
