    "To find the value of the current I in the circuit, we will use the method of nodal analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Nodes:** The circuit has four main nodes.\n    *   The top node, connected to the positive terminal of the 41 V source (we'll call its voltage `V_source = 41 V`).\n    *   The bottom node, connected to ground (voltage = 0 V).\n    *   The node between the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors. Let's call its voltage `V_B`.\n    *   The node between the 14 Ω, 11 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors. Let's call its voltage `V_D`.\n2.  **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** We will write a KCL equation for each of the two unknown nodes, `V_B` and `V_D`. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving the node. We will assume all currents are leaving the nodes.\n    *   **KCL at Node B:** The sum of currents leaving through the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors is zero.\n        `(V_B - 41) / 76 + (V_B - 41) / 8 + (V_B - V_D) / 14 = 0`\n    *   **KCL at Node D:** The sum of currents leaving through the 11 Ω, 29 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors is zero.\n        `(V_D - 41) / 11 + (V_D - 0) / 29 + (V_D - V_B) / 14 = 0`\n3.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We now have a system of two linear equations with two variables (`V_B` and `V_D`). We can rearrange these equations and solve them using Python.\n    *   Equation 1: `V_B * (1/76 + 1/8 + 1/14) - V_D * (1/14) = 41/76 + 41/8`\n    *   Equation 2: `-V_B * (1/14) + V_D * (1/11 + 1/29 + 1/14) = 41/11`\n4.  **Calculate Current I:** The current I is the current flowing from node B to node D through the 14 Ω resistor. We can find it using Ohm's Law once we know `V_B` and `V_D`.\n    *   `I = (V_B - V_D) / 14`\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script using the `numpy` library is ideal for solving this system of linear equations efficiently and accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Define the known values from the circuit diagram ---\nV_source = 41  # Voltage of the source in Volts\nR76 = 76       # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 8         # Resistance in Ohms\nR14 = 14       # Resistance in Ohms\nR11 = 11       # Resistance in Ohms\nR29 = 29       # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# --- Set up the system of linear equations (A * x = b) for nodal analysis ---\n# where x = [V_B, V_D] are the unknown node voltages.\n\n# The coefficient matrix A is derived from the KCL equations:\n# Eq1: V_B*(1/R76+1/R8+1/R14) - V_D*(1/R14) = V_source/R76 + V_source/R8\n# Eq2: -V_B*(1/R14) + V_D*(1/R11+1/R29+1/R14) = V_source/R11\nA = np.array([\n    [(1/R76 + 1/R8 + 1/R14), -1/R14],\n    [-1/R14, (1/R11 + 1/R29 + 1/R14)]\n])\n\n# The constant vector b is also derived from the KCL equations:\nb = np.array([\n    V_source/R76 + V_source/R8,\n    V_source/R11\n])\n\n# --- Solve for the unknown node voltages V_B and V_D ---\ntry:\n    node_voltages = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    V_B = node_voltages[0]\n    V_D = node_voltages[1]\n\n    # --- Calculate the current I using Ohm's Law ---\n    # I flows from node B to node D through R14.\n    I = (V_B - V_D) / R14\n\n    # --- Print the results ---\n    print(f\"Solved Node Voltages:\")\n    print(f\"Voltage at node B (V_B): {V_B:.2f} V\")\n    print(f\"Voltage at node D (V_D): {V_D:.2f} V\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the current I:\")\n    # Using f-string to format the final equation with calculated values\n    print(f\"I = (V_B - V_D) / R14 = ({V_B:.2f} V - {V_D:.2f} V) / {R14} Ω = {I:.3f} A\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations cannot be solved.
