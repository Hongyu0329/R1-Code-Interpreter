# This problem is a riddle that requires deductive reasoning rather than calculation.
# The logical steps are encoded in this script's comments.

# Step 1 & 2: Identify the crater and its name's meaning.
# The image shows the Kamisoshirasu crater on the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.
# The name "Kamisoshirasu" comes from Japanese mythology and its etymological
# meaning is "Dwelling of the Gods".

# Step 3: Deconstruct the phrase "X of Y" based on the etymology.
# The phrase "Dwelling of the Gods" perfectly fits the riddle's "X of Y" structure.
X = "Dwelling"
Y = "Gods"

# Step 4: Explain the connection to Carl Sagan's philosophy.
# The riddle connects "Dwelling of Gods" to Sagan's reverence for images of Earth from space.
# The link is metaphorical: The "Pale Blue Dot" image shows humanity its collective home (our "Dwelling")
# and confronts us with our shared, god-like power and responsibility to preserve or destroy it.
# In this view, the image represents the most important "Dwelling of Gods" (humanity's domain)
# for us to contemplate.

# Step 5: Print the components and the final answer.
# The prompt asks to output the components of the final "equation". Since this is a word
# puzzle, we will print the decoded X and Y values.

print(f"The phrase 'X of Y' from the crater's name is: '{X} of {Y}'")
print(f"In this phrase, X = '{X}'")
print(f"In this phrase, Y = '{Y}'")
print("\nThe question asks for the value of Y.")
print("Therefore, the final answer is:")
print(Y)
