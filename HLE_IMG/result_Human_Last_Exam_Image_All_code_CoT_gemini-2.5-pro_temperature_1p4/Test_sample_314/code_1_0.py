    Solves the puzzle by mapping the simulation plots to the specified conditions.

    The mapping is based on a qualitative analysis of the band structures:
    - Condition 1 (minimum t): Corresponds to simulation 2 by elimination.
    - Condition 2 (minimum |s|): Corresponds to simulation 3, which has the least asymmetry.
    - Condition 3 (unique sign(s)): Corresponds to simulation 4, which has a unique upward asymmetry.
    - Condition 4 (maximum s): Corresponds to simulation 1, which has the largest downward asymmetry.

    The final answer is the sequence of simulation indices corresponding to conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
