The primary distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule). *Grimmia montana* has a very short, straight seta, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and distinctly curved seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves.
