    "The main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, which allows for identification at a glance, is the length and curvature of the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very short, straight seta, which makes the capsule appear immersed or just barely emergent among the perichaetial leaves (the leaves surrounding the reproductive structures).\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name suggests ( *curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk), has a long, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves.\n\nThe image provided shows moss capsules that are immersed, which is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the key distinguishing sporophyte feature\n    between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species1 = {\n        \"name\": \"Grimmia montana\",\n        \"seta_length\": \"very short\",\n        \"seta_curvature\": \"straight\",\n        \"capsule_position\": \"immersed or emergent (sitting among the leaves)\"\n    }\n\n    species2 = {\n        \"name\": \"Grimmia curviseta\",\n        \"seta_length\": \"long\",\n        \"seta_curvature\": \"distinctly curved (arcuate)\",\n        \"capsule_position\": \"exserted (held well above the leaves)\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule):\\n\")\n    print(f\"- {species1['name']}: Has a {species1['seta_length']}, {species1['seta_curvature']} seta, making the capsule {species1['capsule_position']}.\")\n    print(f\"- {species2['name']}: Has a {species2['seta_length']}, {species2['seta_curvature']} seta, which holds the capsule in an {species2['capsule_position']} position.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the presence of a long, curved seta in G. curviseta versus a short, straight seta in G. montana is the key visual difference.\")\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule). *Grimmia montana* has a very short, straight seta, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
