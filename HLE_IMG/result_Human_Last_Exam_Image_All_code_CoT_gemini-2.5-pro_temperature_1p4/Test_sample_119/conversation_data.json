    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at **m/z 135**.\n    *   An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (the Nitrogen Rule). We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows a complex multiplet for 5 protons in the aromatic region (~7.3 ppm), which is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for a benzene ring is 4.\n    *   Let's test the formula **C₉H₁₃N**:\n        *   Molecular Weight = (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 135.\n        *   Degree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 4.\n    *   The formula C₉H₁₃N perfectly matches the molecular weight and the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Peaks > 3000 cm⁻¹: Aromatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks < 3000 cm⁻¹: Aliphatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks ~1600, ~1500 cm⁻¹: Aromatic C=C ring stretching.\n    *   A weak, broad signal around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ suggests an N-H stretch, possibly from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n4.  **NMR Spectroscopy (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC):**\n    *   **Fragments from ¹H NMR:**\n        *   ~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H): A phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n        *   ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a CH group.\n        *   The remaining side chain has signals for a -CH- group (1H) and a -CH₂- group (2H).\n    *   **Fragments from ¹³C NMR & DEPT-135:**\n        *   7 total carbon signals, implying some symmetry as the formula is C₉H₁₃N. A monosubstituted benzene ring and a 3-carbon side chain would give 4 (aromatic) + 3 (aliphatic) = 7 signals. This is consistent.\n        *   Aliphatic signals: **49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm**.\n        *   DEPT-135 shows one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n        *   Therefore, the signal at **43.5 ppm is the -CH₂- group**. The signals at **49.6 ppm and 19.2 ppm** correspond to the **-CH-** and **-CH₃** groups respectively.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure with HSQC:**\n        *   HSQC connects protons to the carbons they are attached to.\n        *   ¹H (~2.8 ppm, 2H) correlates with ¹³C (43.5 ppm, CH₂).\n        *   ¹H (~2.7 ppm, 1H) correlates with ¹³C (49.6 ppm, CH).\n        *   This confirms we have a -CH₂- group (δC=43.5, δH≈2.8) and a -CH- group (δC=49.6, δH≈2.7).\n    *   **Distinguishing Isomers:**\n        *   **Isomer A (1-phenylpropan-2-amine):** C₆H₅-**CH₂**-**CH**(NH₂)-CH₃\n            *   The benzylic -CH₂- group's expected shifts are δC≈45 ppm, δH≈2.8 ppm. This is an excellent match for our data (43.5 ppm, ~2.8 ppm).\n            *   The -CH(NH₂)- group's expected shifts are δC≈50 ppm, δH≈2.7 ppm. This is an excellent match for our data (49.6 ppm, ~2.7 ppm).\n        *   **Isomer B (2-phenyl-1-propanamine):** C₆H₅-**CH**(CH₃)-**CH₂**-NH₂\n            *   This structure's predicted shifts do not align well with the experimental NMR data.\n\n5.  **Conclusion & IUPAC Name:**\n    *   All the NMR data consistently points to the structure being **1-phenylpropan-2-amine** (also known as amphetamine).\n    *   The IUPAC naming conventions for this structure are as follows:\n        1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n        2.  Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. The amine is on carbon 2, making it a **propan-2-amine**.\n        3.  A phenyl substituent is located on carbon 1.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n*(Note: The mass spectrum's base peak at m/z 30 strongly suggests the isomeric structure 2-phenyl-1-propanamine. However, in cases of conflicting data, the rich, detailed, and consistent information from the combination of 1D and 2D NMR experiments is generally considered more definitive for structure elucidation.)*\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_and_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name\n    of the unknown compound and prints the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the step-by-step analysis of the provided spectra\n    # MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC.\n    \n    compound_name = \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\"\n    \n    # The name is constructed based on IUPAC rules:\n    # 1.
