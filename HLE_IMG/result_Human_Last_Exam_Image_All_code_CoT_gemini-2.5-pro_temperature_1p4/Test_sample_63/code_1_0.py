    print("The spectrum displays several key signals. Let's focus on the most telling ones in the upfield region (0-4 ppm):")
    print(" - A signal at ~1.1 ppm is a triplet.")
    print(" - A signal at ~2.8 ppm is a quartet.")
    print("This triplet-quartet pattern is a classic fingerprint for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).")
    print(" - The -CH3 group (3 protons) is split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 protons) into a triplet (2+1=3).")
    print(" - The -CH2- group (2 protons) is split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 protons) into a quartet (3+1=4).")
    print("The integrations (relative peak areas) suggest a 6H triplet and a 4H quartet, which points to a diethylamino group, -N(CH2CH3)2.")

    print("Step 2: Evaluating Candidates")
    print("-------------------------------")

    print(" - Candidates A-G and B-G: Both contain a dimethylamino group, -N(CH3)2. This would produce a single singlet, not a triplet and a quartet. These candidates are eliminated.")
    print(" - Candidates C-L and D-L: Both contain a diethylamino group, -N(C2H5)2. These are consistent with the triplet and quartet signals. The correct structure must be one of these two.")

    print("--------------------------------------")
    print("The main difference between C-L and D-L is the number of methyl groups on the aromatic ring.")
    print(" - The spectrum shows a sharp singlet at ~2.3 ppm. This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached directly to a benzene ring (an Ar-CH3 group).")
    print(" - Structure C-L has ONE methyl group on the aromatic ring. This would produce exactly one singlet in this region, which perfectly matches the spectrum.")
    print(" - Structure D-L has TWO methyl groups on the aromatic ring. Since these two groups are in different chemical environments (one ortho, one para to the amide), they should produce TWO separate singlets. The spectrum only shows one.")
