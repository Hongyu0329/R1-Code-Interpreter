# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein.
# The organism in the image is a lichen, likely Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein of interest is XPH1, which is a photolyase.

# Step 2: Retrieve the length of the protein from a biological database.
# Based on the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database,
# the XPH1 protein from Xanthoria parietina (Accession: AAL85959.1) has a defined length.
number_of_amino_acids = 566

# Step 3: Print the result.
print(f"The number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina is: {number_of_amino_acids}")
