The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), specifically interacting with its V, C1, and C2 domains. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of downstream pathways (JNK/JUN, NFÎºB) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, thus predicting the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.
