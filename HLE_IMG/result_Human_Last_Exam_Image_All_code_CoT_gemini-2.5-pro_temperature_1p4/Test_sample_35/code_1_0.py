S100B can be utilized as a prognostic marker for neurological disorders, not solely as an adjunct marker. Here's why:

A prognostic marker's value lies in its ability to predict the course or outcome of a disease. The diagram shows that the binding of S100B to its RAGE receptor is an upstream event that directly initiates a cascade of detrimental cellular processes.

1.  Activation of Pathogenic Pathways: S100B signaling activates key pathways like JNK/JUN and NFκB.
2.  Direct Link to Pathology: These pathways lead directly to established hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease progression, including:
    -   Apoptosis (programmed cell death) via Caspases.
    -   Production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1β.
    -   The final outcomes of neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.

Given this direct causal link between the S100B protein and the severity of the pathology, the concentration of S100B would logically correlate with the extent of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Therefore, higher levels of S100B would predict a more aggressive disease course and a worse prognosis, establishing it as a valuable prognostic marker.

<<<The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), specifically interacting with its V, C1, and C2 domains. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of downstream pathways (JNK/JUN, NFκB) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, thus predicting the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.>>>
