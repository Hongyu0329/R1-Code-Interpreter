        # Plot 1: Looks like it's settling to a positive state (yellow), but it's wavy.
        # This fits the case c=-1 (stabilizing), b=d=1. The force is F = -(Φ-1)(Φ^2+1),
        # which has a stable equilibrium at Φ=1. Code 'c'.
        1: 'c',

        # Plot 2: Settles to a positive (yellow) uniform state. The background seems to shift up
        # immediately, suggesting F(0)>0. This points to a unique d=1. This plot seems simpler
        # than plot 11, so we assign it the simpler case d=1, b=c=0. Code 'D'.
        2: 'D',

        # Plot 3: Shows a strong tendency towards positive values but in a complex, turbulent way.
        # This could be from b=0, c=d=1. The force is F = -Φ^3+Φ+1, which has a positive stable
        d# equilibrium. Code 'z'.
        3: 'z',

        # Plot 4: Very symmetric pattern (blue/yellow shapes are mirrored). The dynamics are chaotic and space-filling.
        # Symmetry implies b=0, d=0, so c is unique. Chaos suggests c=1 (destabilizing). Code 'C'.
        4: 'C',

        # Plot 5: Settles to a uniform blue (negative) state. The blue seems to grow from the pulses,
        # with the corners remaining light. This implies F(0)=0. The case b=-1, c=d=0 (code 'b') has
        # F = -Φ^2(Φ+1) and fits this perfectly. Code 'b'.
        5: 'b',

        # Plot 6: Asymmetric, regular waves, with yellow crests wider than blue troughs. This suggests
        # an asymmetry favoring positive Φ. This pattern matches b=1, c=d=-1. The c=-1 provides stability
        # for waves, and b=1 provides the asymmetry. Code 'B'.
        6: 'B',

        # Plot 7: Highly dynamic, favoring large positive values (intense red). Unique c=0 with b=d=1 gives a
        # positive equilibrium and F(0)=1, fitting the visuals. Code 'Z'.
        7: 'Z',

        # Plot 8: Visually identical to plot 6. Thus, same parameters. Code 'B'.
        8: 'B',

        # Plot 9: Symmetric, regular wave pattern. Symmetry implies b=0, d=0 (unique c). Regular waves
        # suggest c=-1 (stabilizing). Code 'c'.
        9: 'c',

        # Plot 10: Settles to a negative (blue) state, but the initial force appears positive. This unique
        # behavior matches b=-1, c=d=1 (code 'b'), where F(0)=1, but the stable equilibrium is at Φ=-1. Code 'b'.
        10: 'b',

        # Plot 11: Settles to a positive (yellow) state with F(0)>0 (background shifts up). It is more complex
        # than plot 2. This fits the d=1, b=c=-1 case. Code 'D'.
        11: 'D',

        # Plot 12: Settles to a uniform blue state. The background shifts immediately, so F(0)<0. This points
        # to d=-1. This is the simpler of the two `d=-1` plots. Case: d=-1, b=c=0. Code 'd'.
        12: 'd',

        # Plot 13: Like plot 12, settles to blue with F(0)<0. However, it's more complex, with sharp 'kinks'.
        # This fits the more complex force term from d=-1, b=c=1. Code 'd'.
        13: 'd',

        # Plot 14: This plot becomes predominantly blue, suggesting a negative equilibrium. F(0) appears negative.
        # This matches unique c=0, b=d=-1. Code 'Z'.
        14: 'Z',

        # Plot 15: Settles to a uniform yellow (positive) state. Like plot 5, the change emanates from the
        # pulses, suggesting F(0)=0. This corresponds to b=1, c=d=0. Code 'B'.
        15: 'B',
