    "Based on the analysis of the recurring annual spikes in the Google Trends data, we can deduce the country.\n\n*   **Red Line:** Shows a prominent spike every year around late January or early February. This timing is consistent with the **Chinese New Year (or Spring Festival)**, which is based on the lunar calendar.\n*   **Blue Line:** Shows a smaller, sharp spike every year in early April. This corresponds to the **Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day)**, a traditional Chinese holiday that usually falls on April 4th or 5th.\n*   **Yellow Line:** Shows a significant spike every year in early October. This aligns with **China's National Day** on October 1st, which kicks off a week-long holiday known as \"Golden Week.\"\n\nThe consistent alignment of these three distinct patterns with major Chinese holidays strongly indicates that the country is China.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the Google Trends data to identify the country.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The red line's annual spike in Jan/Feb corresponds to the Chinese New Year.\n    event1 = \"Chinese New Year\"\n\n    # The blue line's annual spike in early April corresponds to the Qingming Festival.\n    event2 = \"Qingming Festival\"\n\n    # The yellow line's annual spike in early October corresponds to China's National Day.\n    event3 = \"National Day\"\n\n    # All three of these major events are unique to one country's calendar.\n    country = \"China\"\n\n    print(f\"The analysis of the three recurring annual events points to one country:\")\n    print(f\"1.
