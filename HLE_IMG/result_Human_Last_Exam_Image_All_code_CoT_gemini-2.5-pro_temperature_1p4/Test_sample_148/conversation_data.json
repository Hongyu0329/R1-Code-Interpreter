    "This is a medical image analysis task. The provided image is a micrograph from a crush smear of a mass in the sella turcica. My plan is to analyze the clinical information and the cytological features in the image to arrive at the most likely diagnosis. I will then present this analysis and the final diagnosis in a Python script, as per the user's instructions.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Clinical Context:** A 28-year-old female with a sellar mass. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland, making a pituitary tumor a primary consideration.\n2.  **Cytological Features:**\n    *   **Cellular Arrangement:** The image shows cells arranged in a cohesive, sheet-like cluster with a syncytial appearance (indistinct cell borders).\n    *   **Nuclear Morphology:** The cells are relatively uniform (monomorphic). The nuclei are round to oval, with finely stippled chromatin, often described as a \"salt-and-pepper\" pattern. Prominent nucleoli are not seen.\n    *   **Cytoplasm:** The cytoplasm is moderately abundant, granular, and eosinophilic (pink).\n    *   **Background:** The background is granular and contains scattered bare nuclei, which is common in crush preparations of soft tumors.\n3.  **Synthesis:** The combination of a sellar location with these specific cytological features—monomorphic cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin—is classic for a pituitary adenoma (also known as a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor). Other possibilities like meningioma or craniopharyngioma are less likely given these specific features.\n\nI will now create a Python script that outlines this reasoning and prints the final diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes clinical and pathological data to provide a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Information\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_gender = \"female\"\n    tumor_location = \"sella turcica\"\n\n    # Pathological Findings from the Image\n    cellular_pattern = \"Cohesive sheets and syncytial clusters\"\n    cell_morphology = \"Monomorphic cells (uniform in appearance)\"\n    nuclear_features = \"Round to oval nuclei with finely stippled ('salt-and-pepper') chromatin\"\n    cytoplasmic_features = \"Moderate, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm\"\n    \n    # Diagnostic Rationale\n    print(\"Analyzing the case...\")\n    print(f\"Clinical Presentation: A {patient_age}-year-old {patient_gender} with a mass in the {tumor_location}.\")\n    print(\"This location strongly suggests a tumor of the pituitary gland.\")\n    print(\"\\nMicroscopic Findings:\")\n    print(f\"- Cellular Pattern: {cellular_pattern}\")\n    print(f\"- Cell Morphology: {cell_morphology}\")\n    print(f\"- Key Nuclear Feature: {nuclear_features}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The combination of the clinical presentation and the classic cytological features is characteristic of a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor.\")\n\n    # Final Diagnosis\n    final_diagnosis = \"Pituitary adenoma\"\n    \n    print(\"\\n-------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Final Diagnosis: {final_diagnosis}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n# Run the diagnostic function\nprovide_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Pituitary adenoma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
