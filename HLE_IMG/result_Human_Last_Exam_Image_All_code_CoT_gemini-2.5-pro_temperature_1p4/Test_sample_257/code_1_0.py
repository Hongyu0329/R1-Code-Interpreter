    # Step 1: Identify the most deshielded proton in the molecule.
    # The molecule is a large, positively charged aromatic system.
    # Protons on such systems are deshielded (have high chemical shifts).
    # The most deshielded proton is the one on the central ring, located between the two
    # highly electronegative nitrogen atoms. This environment is extremely electron-deficient.
    # The reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid leads to sulfonation on one of the outer
    # rings, which does not remove this unique central proton.

    # Step 2: Determine the integration of this proton's NMR signal.

    # There is only one such proton in the entire molecule.

    # according to the n+1 rule.
    # The carbon atom this proton is attached to is bonded to two nitrogen atoms and
    # two quaternary carbon atoms within the ring structure.
    # None of these adjacent atoms have protons attached.
    # Therefore, the number of neighboring protons, n, is 0.
