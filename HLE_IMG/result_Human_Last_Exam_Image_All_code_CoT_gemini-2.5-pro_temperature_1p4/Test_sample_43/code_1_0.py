    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze Reactants and Conditions ---
    print("Analysis of the Reaction:")
    print("=========================")
    print("Starting Material (Compound 1): Contains several key functional groups:")
    print("  - A tertiary alcohol (-OH), which is acidic.")
    print("  - A benzodioxole group (a cyclic acetal), which can be cleaved by Lewis acids.")
    print("  - Benzyl (Bn) and p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ether groups, which are generally stable.")
    print("\nReagents and Conditions:")
    print("  - Reagent: Methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), a strong base and nucleophile.")
    print("  - Stoichiometry: 5 equivalents (excess).")
    print("  - Temperature: 80 Â°C (high).")
    print("  - Duration: 8 hours (long).")
    print("  - Yield: 91% (high selectivity).")
    print("These 'forcing' conditions suggest a reaction with a high activation barrier is occurring.\n")

    # --- Step 3 & 4: Propose and Evaluate Mechanism ---
    print("Proposed Mechanism:")
    print("===================")
    print("Step A: Acid-Base Reaction")
    print("The first equivalent of CH3MgBr, a strong base, will deprotonate the most acidic site, the tertiary alcohol, to form a magnesium alkoxide and methane gas.")
    print("\nStep B: Intramolecular Rearrangement")
    print("The newly formed magnesium alkoxide is positioned perfectly next to the benzodioxole ring. The high temperature and Lewis acidity of the magnesium ion facilitate an intramolecular attack.")
    print("  - The alkoxide oxygen acts as a nucleophile.")
    print("  - It attacks the central carbon of the -O-CH2-O- acetal.")
    print("  - This opens the 5-membered dioxole ring and forms a new, more stable 7-membered dioxepane ring.")
    print("  - The process breaks one of the aryl ether bonds, which becomes a phenoxide.")
    print("\nStep C: Workup")
    print("Upon aqueous workup, the phenoxide is protonated to give the final product, which contains a phenol group.\n")

    # --- Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices ---
    print("Evaluation of Answer Choices:")
    print("=============================")
    print("Choice A is incorrect because Grignard reagents do not typically cleave stable Bn or PMB ethers.")
    print("Choice B is plausible but less specific. It doesn't explain the fate of the acetal's CH2 group or the ring rearrangement.")
    print("Choices D and E suggest an intermolecular attack by the Grignard's methyl group. An intramolecular reaction, when possible, is almost always faster and more selective, making it the far more likely path to a 91% yield product.")
    print("\nChoice C accurately describes the intramolecular rearrangement, which is a known process for such systems under these conditions. It correctly identifies the final product as containing a new 7-membered ring and a phenol.")

    # --- Step 6: Final Conclusion ---
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("===========")
    print("The reaction proceeds through deprotonation of the alcohol, followed by a highly selective intramolecular attack of the resulting alkoxide on the benzodioxole acetal. This leads to a ring expansion.")
    print("\nThe correct product and mechanism are described in Choice C:")
    print("Product: (4aR,5R)-4a-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(1-((4-methoxybenzyl)oxy)-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-4a,5-dihydro-4H-[1,3]dioxepino[6,5,4-cd]benzofuran-9-ol")
    print("Mechanism: the methylmagnesium bromide first deprotonated the free alcohol to form an alkoxylate; this alkoxylate then attacked and ring opened the benzodioxole ring.")
