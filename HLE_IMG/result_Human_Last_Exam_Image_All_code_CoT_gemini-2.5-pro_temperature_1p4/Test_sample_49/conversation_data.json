    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan to solve for the cutoff frequency of the given circuit:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit:** First, I will carefully analyze the provided infinite ladder network diagram. The circuit consists of resistors with resistance `r` and a capacitor with capacitance `C`. The input voltage is applied at node `c₀`, and the output is the voltage at node `a₀`, which is across the capacitor `C`.\n2.  **Nodal Analysis:** I will use nodal analysis to write down the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for a general section of the ladder (nodes `cₙ` and `dₙ`) and for the specific boundary nodes (`c₀`, `a₀`, `c₁`, `d₁`).\n3.  **Solve Difference Equations:** The KCL equations form a system of linear difference equations. I will solve this system by finding a general solution and then applying the boundary conditions (input at `c₀`, capacitor at `a₀`, and voltages remaining finite as we go to infinity) to find the specific solution.\n4.  **Find the Transfer Function:** From the solution, I will derive the transfer function `H(s) = Vₐ₀(s) / Vᵢₙ(s)`, where `s = jω` is the complex frequency.\n5.  **Determine Cutoff Frequency:** The derived transfer function will have the form of a first-order low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency, `ω_c`, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function drops to `1/√2` of its DC gain. I will calculate this frequency from the transfer function's pole.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to represent the derived formula for the cutoff frequency, `ω_c`, and print it out in a clear format, ensuring all numbers in the equation are explicitly shown as requested.\n\nBased on the analysis, the cutoff angular frequency `ω_c` is found to be:\n`ω_c = (sqrt(3) - 1) / (2 * r * C)`\n\nHere is the Python code to display this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the cutoff frequency for the given ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols for resistance and capacitance\n    r, C = sympy.symbols('r C', positive=True)\n\n    # The numbers that appear in the derived formula for the cutoff frequency\n    num_sqrt_val = 3\n    num_minus_val = 1\n    denominator_coefficient = 2\n\n    # Construct the symbolic expression for the cutoff frequency omega_c\n    numerator = sympy.sqrt(num_sqrt_val) - num_minus_val\n    denominator = denominator_coefficient * r * C\n    omega_c = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Print the final equation in a formatted string, showing each component number.\n    # The result is the angular cutoff frequency omega_c.\n    print(\"The cutoff frequency at node a0 is expressed by the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"omega_c = (sqrt({num_sqrt_val}) - {num_minus_val}) / ({denominator_coefficient} * r * C)\")\n    \n    # For clarity, let's also print the expression using sympy's pretty print\n    print(\"\\nSymbolic expression using sympy:\")\n    sympy.pprint(omega_c, use_unicode=True)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_circuit()\n\n```\n<<<(sqrt(3) - 1)/(2*r*C)>>>"
