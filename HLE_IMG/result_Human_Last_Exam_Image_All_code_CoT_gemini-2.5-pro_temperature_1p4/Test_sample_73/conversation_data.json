    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the two reactants and one product in the provided esterification reaction scheme.\n2.  I will locate the stereocenters in each of the reactant molecules. The problem specifies there are four stereocenters in total in the scheme, which implies two in the reactants and two in the product.\n3.  For the first reactant, the acyl chloride `(α-methoxy-α-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetyl chloride)`, I will determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the four substituents attached to its chiral center. Then, by interpreting the 3D representation in the diagram, I will assign its absolute configuration as (R) or (S).\n4.  For the second reactant, the alcohol `(1-methoxy-4-methylpentan-2-ol)`, I will repeat the process: determine CIP priorities for the substituents on its chiral carbon and assign the absolute configuration based on the provided stereochemistry.\n5.  I will analyze the reaction type, which is an esterification. This reaction proceeds through a nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanism. Crucially, this mechanism does not affect the bonds to the chiral centers of either the acyl chloride derivative or the alcohol. Therefore, the reaction occurs with retention of stereochemistry at both centers.\n6.  Based on the retention of configuration, the two stereocenters in the final ester product will have the same absolute configurations as the corresponding stereocenters in the reactants.\n7.  Finally, I will list the four stereochemical assignments—one for each reactant from left to right, followed by the two in the product from left to right—and present this sequence in a Python script.\n\n**Step-by-step determination:**\n\n*   **First stereocenter (Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   Chiral Carbon Substituents: `-OMe` (methoxy), `-COCl` (carbonyl chloride), `-CF3` (trifluoromethyl), `-Ph` (phenyl).\n    *   CIP Priorities: By atomic number of the atom attached to the chiral center, `-OMe` is #1 (Oxygen). For the carbon-based groups, we look at the atoms they are attached to: `-COCl` (C is attached to Cl, O, O), `-CF3` (C is attached to F, F, F), `-Ph` (C is attached to C, C, C). Comparing the highest atomic number in each set (Cl=17, F=9, C=6), the priority order is `-COCl` > `-CF3` > `-Ph`.\n    *   Full Priority Order: 1: `-OMe`, 2: `-COCl`, 3: `-CF3`, 4: `-Ph`.\n    *   Configuration Assignment: The drawing shows the lowest priority group, `-Ph` (#4), in the plane of the page. The `-OMe` group (#1) is shown with a dashed bond (going back). The `-COCl` (#2) is in the plane (up), and the `-CF3` (#3) is assumed to be on a wedged bond (coming forward) to complete the tetrahedron. To assign the configuration, we can imagine viewing the molecule with the lowest priority group (`-Ph`, #4) pointing towards us. From this viewpoint, the remaining groups appear in a clockwise arrangement (1: `-OMe` on the left, 2: `-COCl` on top, 3: `-CF3` on the right). When the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, a clockwise arrangement corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Second stereocenter (Alcohol):**\n    *   Chiral Carbon Substituents: `-OH` (hydroxyl), `-CH2OMe` (methoxymethyl), `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (isobutyl), `-H` (hydrogen).\n    *   CIP Priorities: 1: `-OH` (Oxygen), 2: `-CH2OMe` (C attached to O), 3: `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (C attached to C), 4: `-H`.\n    *   Configuration Assignment: The drawing shows the bond to the hydroxyl group (`-OH`, #1) as a solid wedge (coming forward), and the carbon backbone is in the plane. The lowest priority group, `-H` (#4), is therefore on a dashed bond (going back). Since the lowest priority group is in the back, we can directly determine the configuration. Tracing the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (`-OH` -> `-CH2OMe` -> `-CH2CH(CH3)2`) follows a counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenters in the Product:**\n    *   The esterification reaction proceeds with retention of configuration.\n    *   The stereocenter from the acyl chloride remains **(S)**.\n    *   The stereocenter from the alcohol remains **(S)**.\n\n*   **Final Sequence:**\n    *   Moving from left to right across the reaction scheme, the configurations are: (S), (S) for the reactants, and (S), (S) for the product.\n\n```python\ndef get_stereochemical_assignments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the reaction scheme, from left to right.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The four stereochemical assignments are determined as follows:\n    # 1.
