# This script identifies the simplified Chinese characters on the seal.
# The characters are read in the traditional Chinese order for seals:
# right column from top to bottom, then left column from top to bottom.

# Step 1: Define the identified characters in simplified Chinese.
# Top-Right character: 長 -> 长 (cháng)
# Bottom-Right character: 樂 -> 乐 (lè)
# Top-Left character: 毋 -> 毋 (wú)
# Bottom-Left character: 相 -> 相 (xiāng)
top_right = "长"
bottom_right = "乐"
top_left = "毋"
bottom_left = "相"

# Step 2: Combine the characters to form the final phrase.
# The phrase is formed by reading them in the specified order.
final_phrase = top_right + bottom_right + top_left + bottom_left

# Step 3: Print the breakdown and the final result.
print("The character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is identified as follows:")
print(f"Character 1 (Top-Right): {top_right}")
print(f"Character 2 (Bottom-Right): {bottom_right}")
print(f"Character 3 (Top-Left): {top_left}")
print(f"Character 4 (Bottom-Left): {bottom_left}")
print("\nCombining these in the correct reading order forms the phrase:")
print(f"'{top_right}' + '{bottom_right}' + '{top_left}' + '{bottom_left}' = '{final_phrase}'")
