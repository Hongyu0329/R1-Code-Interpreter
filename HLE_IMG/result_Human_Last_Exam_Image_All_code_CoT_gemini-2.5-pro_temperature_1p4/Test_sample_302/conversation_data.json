    "My plan to identify the characters on the seal is as follows:\n1.  First, I will recognize that the characters are in an ancient Chinese script known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū).\n2.  Next, I will determine the correct reading order. For a four-character seal like this, the traditional order is to read the right column from top to bottom, followed by the left column from top to bottom.\n3.  I will then identify each of the four characters based on their forms in seal script.\n    *   **Top-Right:** This character is 長 (cháng), which means \"long\" or \"eternal\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** This character is 樂 (lè), which means \"joy\" or \"happiness\". Together, \"長樂\" is a common auspicious phrase meaning \"eternal happiness\".\n    *   **Top-Left:** This character is 毋 (wú), which is a negative particle meaning \"do not\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** This character is clearly composed of the radicals for \"tree\" (木) and \"eye\" (目), which forms the character 相 (xiāng), meaning \"mutual\" or \"each other\".\n4.  After identifying the traditional characters, I will convert them to their corresponding simplified Chinese forms.\n5.  Finally, I will present these characters in a Python script that prints each character individually and then combines them into the final phrase, as read from the seal. The resulting phrase is \"长乐毋相\".\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the simplified Chinese characters on the seal.\n# The characters are read in the traditional Chinese order for seals:\n# right column from top to bottom, then left column from top to bottom.\n\n# Step 1: Define the identified characters in simplified Chinese.\n# Top-Right character: 長 -> 长 (cháng)\n# Bottom-Right character: 樂 -> 乐 (lè)\n# Top-Left character: 毋 -> 毋 (wú)\n# Bottom-Left character: 相 -> 相 (xiāng)\ntop_right = \"长\"\nbottom_right = \"乐\"\ntop_left = \"毋\"\nbottom_left = \"相\"\n\n# Step 2: Combine the characters to form the final phrase.\n# The phrase is formed by reading them in the specified order.\nfinal_phrase = top_right + bottom_right + top_left + bottom_left\n\n# Step 3: Print the breakdown and the final result.\nprint(\"The character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is identified as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Character 1 (Top-Right): {top_right}\")\nprint(f\"Character 2 (Bottom-Right): {bottom_right}\")\nprint(f\"Character 3 (Top-Left): {top_left}\")\nprint(f\"Character 4 (Bottom-Left): {bottom_left}\")\nprint(\"\\nCombining these in the correct reading order forms the phrase:\")\nprint(f\"'{top_right}' + '{bottom_right}' + '{top_left}' + '{bottom_left}' = '{final_phrase}'\")\n```\n<<<长乐毋相>>>"
