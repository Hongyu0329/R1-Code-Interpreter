    "Based on the satellite image and the provided coordinates, I can identify the structure for you.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will parse the given coordinates (29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W).\n2.  I will convert these coordinates from the DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format to Decimal Degrees to make them easier to use with mapping and research tools. I will show the equation for this conversion.\n3.  Using the location, I will research historical and archaeological records to identify the square structure visible in the image.\n4.  Finally, I will present the information, including the site's name, its history, and its status as a historic landmark.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a new StringIO object\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef identify_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a structure from satellite imagery based on geographic coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
