    "To identify the correct crystal lattice pattern, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the theoretical pattern:** We need to know what the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice along the [110] direction looks like. This can be determined through crystallographic theory or by simulating it. The established pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the projected atom positions form rectangles with an additional atom at the center of each rectangle.\n2.  **Generate the pattern with code:** We will write a Python script to programmatically generate the coordinates of atoms in an FCC lattice and then project them along the [110] direction. This will confirm the theoretical pattern.\n3.  **Analyze the given images:** We will visually inspect each of the four images (A, B, C, D) to identify their underlying patterns.\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular grid.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows a centered rectangular grid.\n    *   **Image C:** Shows a hexagonal (or honeycomb-like) grid.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows a pattern of interlocking, non-centered rectangles.\n4.  **Match the patterns:** We will compare the theoretical pattern with the patterns observed in the images to find the correct match. The centered rectangular pattern generated from the FCC [110] projection matches Image B.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to derive the answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_and_project_fcc():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates FCC atom positions and projects them along the [110] direction\n    to determine the characteristic 2D pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # FCC basis in fractional coordinates (assuming lattice constant a=1)\n    basis = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.5, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.0, 0.5],\n        [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]\n    ])\n    \n    # Generate atoms in a 2x2x2 block of unit cells to see the repeating pattern\n    atoms_3d = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                for b in basis:\n                    atoms_3d.append(b + np.array([i, j, k]))\n    \n    atoms_3d = np.array(atoms_3d)\n    \n    # Project along [110] direction.
