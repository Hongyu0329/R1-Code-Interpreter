    "Based on the melody and chord progression provided in the sheet music, I can identify the jazz standard. The opening melodic phrase is very distinctive.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Melody**: The first six notes of the melody are C, F, G, Ab, G, F. This melodic line is the classic opening of a well-known jazz standard.\n2.  **Analyze the Harmony**: The piece starts on an F minor chord (F-), which establishes the tonic key. The overall chord progression, while possibly a specific arrangement, supports the melodic identification.\n3.  **Identify the Song and Composer**: The melody and harmony point conclusively to the jazz standard \"Alone Together\". I will then find the composer of this piece. The composer is Arthur Schwartz, with lyrics by Howard Dietz.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that prints the title and the composer's name as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard\n  from the provided sheet music and prints the information.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Alone Together\"\n  composer = \"Arthur Schwartz\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<Title: Alone Together, Composer: Arthur Schwartz>>>"
