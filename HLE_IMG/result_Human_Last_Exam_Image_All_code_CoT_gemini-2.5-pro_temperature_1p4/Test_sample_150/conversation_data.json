    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.** The starting materials are benzene and propanoyl chloride, with AlCl₃ as a catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts Acylation reaction. The propanoyl group will be added to the benzene ring to form Intermediate-1.\n2.  **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.** Intermediate-1 is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group from the first step is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This will form Intermediate-2.\n3.  **Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.** Intermediate-2 is treated with H₂/Pd. This is a catalytic hydrogenation. For a ketone where the carbonyl group is adjacent to a benzene ring (a benzylic ketone), this reaction typically reduces the carbonyl group completely to a methylene (CH₂) group through hydrogenolysis. This will form Intermediate-3.\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the final reaction.** Intermediate-3 is reacted with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator ((PhCO₂)₂). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. A hydrogen atom at this position will be replaced by a bromine atom to yield the final product.\n5.  **Final Step: Name the product.** Based on the structure derived from the reaction sequence, I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the final product.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that describes each step of the reaction, identifies the structure/name of each intermediate, and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef track_reaction_and_identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given chemical reaction sequence step-by-step\n    and identifies the name of the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initial Reactants\n    reactant_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reactant_2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation ---\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Starting with a Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {reactant_1} reacts with {reactant_2} in the presence of AlCl3.\")\n    print(f\"Result: The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming Intermediate-1.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Electrophilic Bromination ---\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Proceeding with Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {intermediate_1} is treated with Br2/FeBr3.\")\n    print(\"Result: The acyl group (-COCH2CH3) is a meta-director, so bromine adds to the meta position (position 3) of the phenyl ring.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-2 is: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Hydrogenolysis) ---\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(\"Step 3: Performing a Catalytic Hydrogenation.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {intermediate_2} is reduced with H2/Pd.\")\n    print(\"Result: The benzylic ketone is completely reduced to an alkyl chain (hydrogenolysis).
