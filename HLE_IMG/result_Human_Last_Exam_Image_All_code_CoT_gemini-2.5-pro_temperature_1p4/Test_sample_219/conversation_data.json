    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: Visually inspect the provided raster plot to find the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These appear as dense, vertical lines of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: For each identified burst, estimate the center time in seconds from the x-axis.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: Compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI**: Sum all the calculated IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output**: Round the final average to two significant figures and present the steps and the result in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from a neuronal firing graph, calculates the\n    inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes their average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # By visual inspection, the dense vertical bands of activity are centered at these approximate times:\n    burst_timestamps = [2, 9, 16, 25, 35, 45]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    # The IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    \n    print(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]}s - {burst_timestamps[i]}s = {inter_burst_intervals[i]}s\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCalculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    sum_of_intervals = np.sum(inter_burst_intervals)\n    number_of_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    \n    # Create the string for the sum part of the equation\n    sum_equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(f\"Average = ({sum_equation_str}) / {number_of_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {sum_of_intervals} / {number_of_intervals} = {average_ibi:.2f}s\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Round the result to two significant figures.\n    # The value 8.6 already has two significant figures.\n    final_answer = float('{:.2g}'.format(average_ibi))\n\n    print(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer}s\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<8.6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
