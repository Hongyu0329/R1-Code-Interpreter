    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric environment around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main ligand structure. Free rotation around a single bond is possible unless it is restricted by significant steric hindrance (i.e., when bulky groups are too close to each other).\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the Phenyl Rings:** We are considering the peripheral phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L.\n2.  **Analyze Bonding and Steric Hindrance for each Ring:**\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached to the C-6 positions of phenyl rings A and C, respectively. The key observation is that these specific carbon atoms (C-6 of A and C-6 of C) are directly bonded to the central Iridium (Ir) atom. This is known as cyclometalation. The area around the Ir center is very crowded with other ligands. Attaching another phenyl ring (K or L) at this already-congested metalation site creates severe steric clashes, which effectively \"locks\" these rings in place and prevents them from rotating freely.\n    *   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached to the C-4 positions of phenyl rings A and C. The C-4 position is on the opposite side of the ring from the metalation site (C-6) and is pointed away from the central metal atom. There are no major steric impediments to prevent rotation around the single C-C bond connecting H to A, and J to C.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to the C-6 position of pyridine ring D. While this is adjacent to the coordinating nitrogen atom, the bond points away from the metal center and the rest of the complex. There is sufficient space for ring G to rotate freely around its connecting C-C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, rings H, J, and G are not sterically hindered and can rotate freely. Rings K and L are attached at the highly congested metalation sites, so their rotation is restricted.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the free rotation of phenyl rings in the given Iridium complex\n    based on steric hindrance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Rings are classified based on their attachment point.\n    # Rings attached to a cyclometalated carbon are considered restricted.\n    # Other peripheral rings are considered free to rotate.\n\n    all_rings = ['G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L']\n    \n    # Rings attached to carbons directly bonded to the Iridium center (metallated carbons).\n    # These carbons are C-6 of ring A and C-6 of ring C.\n    rings_on_metallated_carbons = ['K', 'L']\n    \n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Phenyl Ring Rotation:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 35)\n\n    for ring in sorted(all_rings):\n        if ring in rings_on_metallated_carbons:\n            print(f\"Ring {ring}: Attached to a carbon directly bonded to the Ir metal center.\")\n            print(\"           This creates severe steric hindrance, restricting rotation.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Ring {ring}: Attached to the ligand periphery, away from the congested metal center.\")\n            print(\"           The single C-C bond allows for free rotation.\")\n            freely_rotating_rings.append(ring)\n        print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The rings that can rotate freely are those not attached to the highly congested metalation sites.\")\n    \n    # Sort for consistent output\n    freely_rotating_rings.sort()\n    \n    # Use print() to display the final result clearly\n    print(\"\\nFreely rotating rings are:\")\n    for ring in freely_rotating_rings:\n        print(f\"- {ring}\")\n\n    # Combine the letters for the final answer\n    final_answer_set = \", \".join(freely_rotating_rings)\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Set: {{{final_answer_set}}}\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_ring_rotation()\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
