    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will analyze each of the three chiral centers (stereocenters) one by one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nFirst, let's identify the chiral centers and the parent chain. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so it should receive the lowest possible number. The longest carbon chain containing the alcohol group determines the parent name. Based on this, we can number the carbons as follows:\n- The chiral carbon with the -OH group is C2.\n- The adjacent chiral carbon with the ethyl group is C3.\n- The third chiral carbon with the methyl and aminoethyl groups is C4.\n\nThe IUPAC name is likely `5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol` or `3-(2-amino-1-methylethyl)pentan-2-ol` depending on the interpretation of the main chain, but the local analysis of each chiral center's absolute configuration (R/S) will be the same. We will proceed by analyzing C2, C3, and C4 from left to right as depicted in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Configuration at C2 (carbon with -OH group):**\n    *   **Assign priorities to substituents:**\n        1.  -OH (highest atomic number, O=8)\n        2.  -C3... (the rest of the carbon chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -H (implicit hydrogen, lowest priority)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** In the drawing, the -OH group is dashed (pointing away from the viewer). By convention for a chain drawn in the plane, the implicit -H atom must be wedged (pointing towards the viewer). The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH -> -C3... -> -CH3) traces a clockwise (R) direction. Since the lowest priority group (-H) points towards the viewer, we must reverse the configuration. Thus, C2 is **(S)**.\n\n2.  **Configuration at C3 (carbon with ethyl group):**\n    *   **Assign priorities to substituents:**\n        1.  -C2... (the part of the chain containing the -OH group, as O > C)\n        2.  -C4... (the part of the chain containing the -NH2 group)\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n        4.  -H (implicit hydrogen)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The ethyl group is wedged (towards the viewer). Therefore, the implicit -H atom is dashed (away from the viewer). The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C2... -> -C4... -> -Ethyl) traces a counter-clockwise (S) direction. Since the lowest priority group (-H) points away from the viewer, we keep the assigned configuration. Thus, C3 is **(S)**.\n\n3.  **Configuration at C4 (carbon with -CH3 and -CH2NH2 groups):**\n    *   **Assign priorities to substituents:**\n        1.  -CH2NH2 (The carbon is bonded to N, H, H. Nitrogen's high atomic number gives this priority.)\n        2.  -C3... (the rest of the carbon chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -H (implicit hydrogen)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The -CH3 group is dashed (away). Therefore, the implicit -H atom is wedged (towards the viewer). The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 -> -C3... -> -CH3) traces a counter-clockwise (S) direction. Since the lowest priority group (-H) points towards the viewer, we reverse the configuration. Thus, C4 is **(R)**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, we get the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration of the provided molecule\n    by analyzing each chiral center according to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the absolute configuration of the molecule...\")\n    print(\"The molecule has three chiral centers, which we label C2, C3, and C4 from left to right.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Analysis of Chiral Center C2 ---\n    print(\"Analysis of Chiral Center C2 (with -OH group):\")\n    print(\"Substituent Priorities (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH\")\n    print(\"2: -C3H(Et)...
