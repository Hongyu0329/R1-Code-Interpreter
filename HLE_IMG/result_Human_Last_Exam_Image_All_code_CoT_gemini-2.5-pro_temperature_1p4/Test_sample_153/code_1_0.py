# Step 1: Define the given efficiencies and losses.
transformer_efficiency = 0.98
transmission_loss = 0.02

# Calculate the efficiency of the transmission line.
transmission_efficiency = 1 - transmission_loss

# Step 2: Calculate the overall efficiency for real power delivery.
# The total efficiency is the product of the efficiencies of the components in series.
total_efficiency_factor = transformer_efficiency * transmission_efficiency

# Step 3: Define the given line impedance components.
R_line = 0.08  # Resistance in Ohms
X_line = 0.16  # Reactance in Ohms

# Step 4: The problem provides several choices for the equations.
# Based on our calculation, P_delivered = total_efficiency_factor * (P_wind + P_pv)
# Let's check the options.
# Our calculated total_efficiency_factor is 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.
# This matches the coefficient in option C.
p_delivered_coeff = total_efficiency_factor

# Option C also uses the correct line impedance Z_line = 0.08 + j0.16.
# The voltage drop formula in option C is of the form:
# V_drop = ( (p_delivered_coeff * P_total) + j * Q_comp * q_factor) / V_nominal * (R_line + j*X_line)
# From option C, we can identify the coefficient for the reactive power term.
q_comp_factor = 0.979

Higher reactive power flow increases the voltage drop across the line (V_drop approx (PR + QX)/V). These fluctuations cause voltage variations (flicker), which can affect the stability and quality of the power supply.")
