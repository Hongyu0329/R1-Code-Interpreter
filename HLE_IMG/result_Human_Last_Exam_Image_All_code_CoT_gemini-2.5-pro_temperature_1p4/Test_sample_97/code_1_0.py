# Step 1: Determine the radius of the yellow circles (r_y).
# The center of a bottom yellow circle is at y=0.5 and it touches the bottom edge (y=0).
# Therefore, its radius is 0.5 cm.
r_y = 0.5

print("\n--- Analysis for Question 1 (Gap between yellow and white circles) ---")

# Let's assume the yellow and white circles are tangent and test this assumption.
# For a small circle (r_y) in the valley of two large, tangent circles (r_w), where the small
# circle also touches a line, a specific geometric relationship holds.
# The relationship between the white circle's radius (r_w) and the y-coordinate of its center (y_b) is:
# r_w = y_b * (y_b - 1)
print("Assuming tangency, the geometry requires that r_w = y_b * (y_b - 1), where r_w is the white circle radius and y_b is the y-coordinate of its center.")

# The problem states all measurements are multiples of 0.5.
# Based on the image, r_w is a few times larger than r_y. Let's test plausible values for y_b
# that are multiples of 0.5, starting from values greater than 1 (so r_w > 0).
# If y_b = 1.5, r_w = 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75.
# If y_b = 2.0, r_w = 2.0 * 1.0 = 2.0.
# If y_b = 2.5, r_w = 2.5 * 1.5 = 3.75.
# The value r_w=2.0 looks visually consistent with the image. Let's proceed with this.
y_b = 2.0
r_w = 2.0
print(f"Using the 'multiple of 0.5' rule and visual estimation, we test the plausible solution y_b = {y_b} cm.")
print(f"This gives a white circle radius r_w = {r_w} cm.")

print("The equation holds. Since we found a consistent solution under the assumption of tangency, the assumption is correct.")

# --- Question 2: Is there any gap between white circles in the first row and second row? ---
print("\n--- Analysis for Question 2 (Gap between white circle rows) ---")

# The green rectangle has "no gap to its neighbors". Visually, it fits between the top and bottom rows of white circles
# and its height is the diameter of a middle-row circle (2*r_w).
# This means the vertical distance between the centerlines of adjacent white circle rows is 2 * r_w.
vertical_dist = 2 * r_w
print(f"The vertical distance between the centerlines of adjacent white circle rows is 2 * r_w = 2 * {r_w} = {vertical_dist} cm.")

# Now, let's find the actual distance (d) between the centers of two adjacent circles in neighboring rows.
# Their centers are separated vertically by `vertical_dist` and horizontally by `r_w`.
# We use the Pythagorean theorem: d = sqrt(r_w^2 + vertical_dist^2).
d_squared = r_w**2 + vertical_dist**2
d = math.sqrt(d_squared)
print(f"The distance 'd' between their centers is calculated by: d = sqrt({r_w}^2 + {vertical_dist}^2)")
print(f"d = sqrt({r_w**2} + {vertical_dist**2}) = sqrt({d_squared}) = {d:.4f} cm.")

# For the circles to be tangent, this distance 'd' must equal the sum of their radii (r_w + r_w).
sum_of_radii = 2 * r_w
print(f"For the circles to touch, this distance must be equal to the sum of their radii, which is 2 * r_w = {sum_of_radii} cm.")

# We compare the calculated distance 'd' with the required sum of radii.
gap = d - sum_of_radii
is_gap = gap > 1e-9 # Use a small tolerance for floating point comparison

if is_gap:
    print(f"Since the center distance {d:.4f} is greater than the sum of radii {sum_of_radii}, a gap exists.")
    answer2 = 'Y'
else:
    print(f"Since the center distance {d:.4f} is equal to the sum of radii {sum_of_radii}, no gap exists.")
    answer2 = 'N'
