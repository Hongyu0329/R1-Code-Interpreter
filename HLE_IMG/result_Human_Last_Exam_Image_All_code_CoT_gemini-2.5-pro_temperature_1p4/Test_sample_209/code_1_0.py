    This function explains the reasoning for identifying the correct giraffe.

    The task is to identify which of the images (A, B, C, D, E, or F)
    shows the same giraffe as the target image. Giraffe coat patterns
    are unique and can be used for identification, similar to fingerprints.

    1.  **Analyze Target:** The target giraffe has a distinctive pattern on its
        shoulder and flank. Key features include a small triangular cluster of
        three spots high on the shoulder and a larger, uniquely shaped spot
        directly below it.

    2.  **Compare Options:**
        -   Images A, C, D, E, and F all show different spot patterns. The shapes,
            colors, and arrangements of their spots do not match the key features
            of the target giraffe.
        -   Image B shows a spot pattern that is a clear match. The triangular
            cluster on the shoulder and the large spot below it are identical
            to the target.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The spot pattern in Image B is a match to the target.
