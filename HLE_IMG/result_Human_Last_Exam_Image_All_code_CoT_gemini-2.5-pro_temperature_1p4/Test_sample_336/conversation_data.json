    "My plan is to solve this problem by first identifying the principal molecule from the reaction diagram, which is the product. Then, I will write a Python script using the RDKit library to perform the required calculations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Target Molecule**: The image displays a chemical reaction. The question asks for the analysis of \"the depicted molecule\". This most logically refers to the final product of the reaction. I'll determine the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for this product molecule, which is `5-fluoro-4-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)pyridin-2-amine`.\n2.  **Check the Condition**: The problem specifies that the molecule must have a Crippen logP value greater than 1. My script will first calculate this value to confirm the molecule qualifies.\n3.  **Calculate the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For the qualifying molecule, I will calculate its ECI. The formula for ECI is the sum of the product of each atom's degree (number of connections) and its eccentricity (the longest shortest path to any other atom). The calculation will include hydrogen atoms as specified.\n4.  **Construct the Final Output**: The script will print the full equation used to calculate the ECI, showing the degree and eccentricity for each atom. Finally, it will print the total sum, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit is not installed.
