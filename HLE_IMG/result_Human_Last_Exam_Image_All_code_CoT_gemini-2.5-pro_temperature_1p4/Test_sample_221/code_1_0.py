# Step 1: Define the parameters m and n based on visual inspection of the image.
# The path between two adjacent pentagons is found by moving m steps, turning 60 degrees, and moving n steps.
# From the image, we can determine m and n.
m = 4
n = 2

# Step 2: Define the number of pentagonal faces, P.
# This is always 12 for a Goldberg polyhedron.
P = 12

# Step 3: Calculate the number of hexagonal faces, H.
# First, calculate the triangulation number, T.
# The formula is T = m^2 + m*n + n^2.
T = m**2 + m * n + n**2

# Then, calculate the number of hexagonal faces, H.
# The formula is H = 10 * (T - 1).
H = 10 * (T - 1)

# As requested, outputting the numbers in the final equations.

print(f"The number of pentagonal faces is P = {P}.")
print("The triangulation number T is calculated as: T = m^2 + m*n + n^2")

print("The number of hexagonal faces H is calculated as: H = 10 * (T - 1)")
print(f"H = 10 * ({T} - 1) = 10 * {T-1} = {H}")

# Step 4: Format and print the final answer as m,n,H,P.
