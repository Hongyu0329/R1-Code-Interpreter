    "This image shows a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. To distinguish it from a Pacific coast community, we need to identify a species that is exclusive to the Atlantic.\n\n1.  **Identify the visible organisms:** The photo contains several species: clusters of acorn barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides* is a likely candidate), small, dark Rough Periwinkles (likely *Littorina saxatilis*), and two larger, lighter-colored snails.\n2.  **Focus on the indicator species:** While many barnacle and snail species look similar across oceans, the larger, light-colored snail with distinct brownish spiral bands is a key identifier. This is the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n3.  **Check the geographic range:** The Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is native to the coasts of northeastern Europe. It was introduced to North America in the 19th century and is now extremely abundant on the Atlantic coast, from Canada to Maryland. Crucially, this species is **not** established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of *Littorina littorea* in this photo definitively indicates it was taken on a shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean, not the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the species that indicates the photo's location\n  and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The most prominent and geographically distinct species in the image is the\n  # Common Periwinkle. This snail is abundant on the Atlantic coasts of North\n  # America and Europe but is not found on the Pacific coast of North America.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(\"The scientific name of the species that definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast is:\")\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
