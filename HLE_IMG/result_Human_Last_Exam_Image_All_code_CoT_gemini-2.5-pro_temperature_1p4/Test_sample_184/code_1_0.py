    This function identifies the products of the reaction based on stereochemistry conservation.
    
    1. The starting material has a quaternary chiral center with a specific configuration:
       - Methyl (Me) group is wedge (up).
       - Methoxy (OMe) group is dash (down).
    2. This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction sequence (electrocyclic opening + Diels-Alder).
    3. We check which of the potential products (A-H) retain this specific configuration.
    4. Only products A and G have the Me(wedge)/OMe(dash) configuration.
    5. Therefore, A and G are the two products formed.
