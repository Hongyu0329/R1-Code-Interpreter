    "I have analyzed the image to find the secret message. My thinking process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image has a distinct \"glitch art\" aesthetic, featuring the character Urotsuki from the game \"Yume Nikki 2kki\", along with elements from Minecraft (a cake and a birch tree). The most structured and least noisy part of the image is the vertical colored bar on the right border. This is the most likely place for an encrypted message.\n\n2.  **Decode the Color Bar:** The bar on the right is a sequence of colored squares. There are 8 unique colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, White, and Black. These are the 8 corners of the RGB color cube, which strongly suggests a 3-bit encoding. I'll map them to numbers 0-7 based on their RGB components (treating R, G, B as bits in a 3-bit number, with Red as the most significant bit):\n    *   Black (000): 0\n    *   Blue (001): 1\n    *   Green (010): 2\n    *   Cyan (011): 3\n    *   Red (100): 4\n    *   Magenta (101): 5\n    *   Yellow (110): 6\n    *   White (111): 7\n\n3.  **Find the Equation:** The prompt's instructions for me hint that the solution is an equation. I'll examine the sequence of colors on the right border to find numbers for this equation.\n    *   The first color block is **Red**, which maps to the number **4**.\n    *   The second color block is **Green**, which maps to the number **2**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Operation:** I will hypothesize a simple mathematical operation between these two numbers. The additive color model (RGB) provides a strong clue: Red light + Green light = Yellow light. In our number mapping, this corresponds to:\n    *   Red (4) + Green (2) = Yellow (6)\n\n5.  **Verify the Result:** The result of the addition is **6**. In our mapping, the number 6 corresponds to the color **Yellow**. I then check if Yellow appears in the color sequence on the border. Visual inspection confirms that a Yellow block does indeed appear in the sequence (it's the 6th block). This confirms my hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Answer:** The hidden equation is `4 + 2 = 6`. I will now provide a Python script that defines these numbers and prints the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The first number is derived from the first color on the border, Red.\n# In the chosen color-to-number mapping (based on RGB bit values), Red corresponds to 4.\nn1 = 4\n\n# The second number is from the second color, Green, which maps to 2.\nn2 = 2\n\n# The operation is assumed to be addition, suggested by the additive color model (Red + Green = Yellow).\n# The result of the addition is 4 + 2 = 6.\nresult = n1 + n2\n\n# The number 6 maps to the color Yellow, which is present in the border sequence, confirming the equation.\n# The code now prints the final equation, showing each number.\nprint(f\"{n1} + {n2} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<4 + 2 = 6>>>"
