    "Of course, I can help with this. This problem involves a well-known reaction in organic chemistry called the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a \"backbone rearrangement\" common in terpenes and steroids.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The starting material is a triterpenoid alcohol reacting with strong acid (HCl) and heat. This points to an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. The complex change in the carbon skeleton suggests a series of carbocation rearrangements.\n2.  **Propose the Mechanism:**\n    *   First, the alcohol group is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺).\n    *   Water leaves, generating a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n    *   This carbocation undergoes a cascade of seven sequential [1,2]-shifts of adjacent methyl groups (as methanide ions, :CH₃⁻) and hydrogen atoms (as hydride ions, :H⁻) to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This is the backbone rearrangement.\n    *   The cascade proceeds down the backbone of the molecule until the positive charge reaches the C-13 position.\n    *   Finally, a proton is eliminated from an adjacent carbon (C-12) to form the stable tetrasubstituted alkene shown in the product.\n3.  **Trace the Substituents:** By carefully tracking the sequence of these shifts, we can determine which original substituent (H or CH₃) ends up at each of the numbered positions in the final product structure.\n    *   **Shift 1 & 2:** A CH₃ group from C-4 moves to C-3, and then an H atom from C-5 moves to C-4. This leaves one of the original C-4 methyl groups at position **1**.\n    *   **Shift 3 & 4:** A CH₃ from C-10 moves to C-5, and then an H atom from C-9 moves to C-10. This places a hydrogen atom at position **2**.\n    *   **Shift 5:** A CH₃ group from C-8 moves to C-9. This places a methyl group at position **3**.\n    *   **Shift 6:** A CH₃ group from C-14 moves to C-8. This places a methyl group at position **4**.\n    *   **Shift 7:** An H atom from C-13 moves to C-14. This places a hydrogen atom at position **5**.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will use a Python script to print the final answer clearly in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions after a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.\n    The solution is based on the well-established mechanism for the acid-catalyzed backbone\n    rearrangement of friedelinol to olean-12-ene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary to store the identified substituent for each position\n    # The keys are the numbered positions in the product molecule.\n    # The values are the substituents ('H' or 'CH3') that end up at these positions.\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group remaining at C-4\n        2: \"H\",      # The hydride that shifted from C-9 to C-10\n        3: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group that shifted from C-8 to C-9\n        4: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group that shifted from C-14 to C-8\n        5: \"H\"       # The hydride that shifted from C-13 to C-14\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    print(f\"1 = {substituents[1]}, 2 = {substituents[2]}, 3 = {substituents[3]}, 4 = {substituents[4]}, 5 = {substituents[5]}\")\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
