    "To determine the worst-case time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its recursive structure.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Breakdown**: The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm.\n    *   **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `n <= 1`, as an array with 0 or 1 elements is already sorted.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: For `n > 1`, the algorithm performs three main actions:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the prefix of the array, `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then checks if the last element `a[n-1]` is smaller than the element before it. After the first step, `a[n-2]` should be the largest element in the `a[0...n-2]` prefix. This comparison effectively checks if the last element `a[n-1]` needs to be moved into the prefix.\n        3.  `swap(...)` and `sort(a, n - 1)`: If the condition is true (meaning the elements are out of order), it swaps them and then—crucially—calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the prefix, which has now been disturbed by the swapped element.\n\n2.  **Worst-Case Scenario**: The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true for every recursive step. This forces the algorithm to execute both `sort(a, n - 1)` calls. A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) triggers this worst-case behavior.\n\n3.  **Recurrence Relation**: Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n` in the worst case.\n    *   The first recursive call takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   The comparison and swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   The second recursive call (which is always executed in the worst case) also takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   Therefore, the recurrence relation is: `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)` which simplifies to `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`, where `c` is a constant.\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence**: This is a classic recurrence relation that leads to exponential growth.\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   This expands to `T(n) ≈ c * 2^n`.\n    *   The time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nTo verify this, the following Python code implements the algorithm and counts the number of recursive calls in the worst-case scenario.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's necessary to increase the recursion limit for demonstrating the rapid growth.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Global variable to count the number of calls to the sort function.\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to swap two elements in a list.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort(a, n):\n    \"\"\"The sorting algorithm from the problem, with a call counter.\"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            sort(a, n - 1)\n\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and demonstrates the time complexity of the sort function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the given sorting algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The worst case occurs with a reverse-sorted list.\\n\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation for the number of operations T(n) in the worst case is:\")\n    print(\"T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\\n\")\n    print(\"This recurrence resolves to O(2^n).
