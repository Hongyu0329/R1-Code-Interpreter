# Step 1: Define known values
r_yellow = 0.5  # Radius of yellow circle in cm

# Step 2: Derive the radius of the white circle (R)
# From the geometric analysis, we derived the formula R = 4 * r
R_white = 4 * r_yellow
print(f"The radius of a white circle (R) is derived from R = 4 * r_yellow = 4 * {r_yellow} = {R_white} cm.")

# Step 3: Determine coordinates of the white circle centers
# The y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of circles is R_white.
# The y-coordinates of the centers are R, 3R, 5R.
y_centers = [R_white * (2*j + 1) for j in range(3)]

# The x-coordinate of the first column of circles (x_0) is determined by the green square on the left.
# The green square has side length S=R=2. It's against the left wall (x=0).
# Its right edge is at x=S=2.
# The first white circle is tangent to it, so its center is at x_0 = S + R_white.
S_green = R_white
x0 = S_green + R_white
print(f"The x-coordinate of the first column of circles (x_0) is x_0 = S + R = {S_green} + {R_white} = {x0} cm.")

# The x-coordinates of the centers are x_0, x_0 + 2R, x_0 + 4R
x_centers = [x0 + i * (2 * R_white) for i in range(3)]

# The right-most white circles are in the third column (i=2).
x_rightmost = x_centers[2]

# The centers of the three right-most circles are:
center_br = (x_rightmost, y_centers[0]) # bottom-right
center_mr = (x_rightmost, y_centers[1]) # middle-right
center_tr = (x_rightmost, y_centers[2]) # top-right

# Step 4: Identify the unique circle and state its center
# Based on analysis of the geometric arrangement and tangencies, the middle circle in the right-most column
# is unique.
target_center = center_mr
print("\nThere are three white circles in the right-most column with centers at:")
print(f"({center_br[0]}, {center_br[1]})")
print(f"({center_mr[0]}, {center_mr[1]})")
print(f"({center_tr[0]}, {center_tr[1]})")
print("\nBased on geometric analysis, the middle one has a unique pattern of tangencies.")
print(f"The center of the specified right-most white circle is ({int(target_center[0])}:{int(target_center[1])}).")

final_y = int(target_center[1])
