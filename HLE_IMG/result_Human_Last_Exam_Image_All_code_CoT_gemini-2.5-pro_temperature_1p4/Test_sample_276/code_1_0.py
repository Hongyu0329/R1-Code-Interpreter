    Analyzes the clinical case and identifies the most likely diagnosis.
    
    The patient is a 67-year-old female presenting with a one-month history of
    low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, and diarrhea. She has a history of
    uveitis and arthritis. Her exam shows right lower quadrant tenderness, and
    labs show leukocytosis (WBC 13,000) and a positive fecal occult blood test.
    The CT scan demonstrates significant inflammatory wall thickening in the
    ileocecal region.

    This combination of chronic ileocolitis, constitutional symptoms, and classic
    extraintestinal manifestations (uveitis, arthritis) is highly characteristic
    of Crohn's Disease.
    
    Other diagnoses are less likely:
    - Infections (Yersinia, Salmonella) are typically more acute.
    - Ileocecal TB and Lymphoma can mimic Crohn's but do not explain the history of
      uveitis and arthritis as well.
    - Other conditions like volvulus or torsion are acute emergencies and do not fit
      the month-long history.
