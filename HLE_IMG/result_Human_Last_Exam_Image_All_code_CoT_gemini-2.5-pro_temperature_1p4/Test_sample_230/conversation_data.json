    "Based on a visual analysis of the painting, my plan is to identify the artwork by focusing on its key characteristics: the central windmill, the fire raging in the building on the right, the dramatic stormy sky, and the 19th-century art style. These elements strongly suggest a specific historical event or a romanticized depiction of one. I will use these details to search art history databases and image repositories to find the correct painting and its title.\n\nThe script below will print the title of the painting.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the title of the painting.\n    The painting is from the 19th century and depicts a dramatic scene.\n    Key features are a windmill, a fire in the background, and a stormy sky.\n    Based on these features, the artwork is identified as a work by François-Antoine Bossuet.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"The Burning of the Kattenburg Mill, Amsterdam\"\n    artist = \"François-Antoine Bossuet\"\n    year = \"c. 1830\"\n    \n    print(f\"The title of the painting is: {title}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<The Burning of the Kattenburg Mill, Amsterdam>>>"
