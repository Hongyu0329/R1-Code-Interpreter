    This function identifies the matching nyala.

    Steps for identification:
    1.  Examine the horns of the target animal: note their specific shape, curve, and size.
    2.  Examine the stripe pattern on the torso.
    3.  Critically, examine the unique pattern of white spots on the rear flank. This is like a fingerprint.
    4.  Compare these features with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    5.  Image B shows a nyala with an identical spot pattern on its rear flank and a matching horn structure.

    # The correct image is B.
    answer = 'B'
