    "This task requires a musical analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for a specific chord. I will first identify the key signature, then analyze the notes present in the specified measure (m. 30), and finally determine the chord's function within the key to assign the appropriate Roman numeral.\n\n1.  **Key Signature:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to the key of C minor. The tonic (i) is C minor.\n\n2.  **Chord Identification (Measure 30):** The notes played in measure 30 are G, B-natural (B♮), D, and F-sharp (F♯).\n\n3.  **Root and Quality:** The notes G, B♮, and D form a G major triad. The note G is the fifth scale degree of C minor, making it the dominant. In a minor key, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree to create a major dominant (V) chord, which is why the B is natural instead of flat.\n\n4.  **Functional Analysis:** The chord's root is G, the dominant of C minor. The primary function of this chord is to lead to the tonic (C minor), which it does in the following measure (m. 31). Therefore, its function is Dominant. The F♯ is a chromatic tone, acting as a leading tone to the dominant's root (F♯ resolves to G), intensifying the dominant function. While the chord technically spells out a G Major 7th, in functional harmony, it's analyzed based on its role. The overwhelming function is that of the dominant.\n\n5.  **Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a major dominant chord in root position is V.\n\nThe code will print out this step-by-step analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect stdout to a variable to format the final output as requested.\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nfrom io import StringIO\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\n\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st mvt.\n    and determines the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure_number = 30\n    notes_in_chord = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\", \"F-sharp\"]\n    root_of_chord = \"G\"\n    scale_degree = 5\n    function = \"Dominant\"\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n\n    print(f\"Musical Analysis for Measure {measure_number}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
