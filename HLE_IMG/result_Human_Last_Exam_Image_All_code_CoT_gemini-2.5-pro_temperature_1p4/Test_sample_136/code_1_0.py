    # 1. The necklace has 6 beads, arranged as a regular hexagon.
    num_beads = 6

    # 2. Analyze the symmetries.
    # From the image, each row contains colorings that are rotations of one another.
    # For example, in the first row, each necklace can be obtained from the previous one
    # by a clockwise rotation. This means rotations are symmetries.
    # For a 6-bead necklace, the fundamental rotation is by 360/6 degrees.

    # 3. Calculate the rotation angle.
    # The final equation for the angle is 360 degrees / number of beads.
    angle = 360 / num_beads

    # 4. Check for reflections.
    # Let's number the bead positions 1 to 6 clockwise from the top.
    # Consider the 2nd necklace in Row 1: Blue at pos 1, Green at pos 2.
    # Reflecting this across the vertical axis (through beads 1 and 4) keeps the
    # Blue bead at 1 but moves the Green bead from 2 to 6.
    # The resulting coloring (Blue at 1, Green at 6) is the 1st necklace in Row 2.
    # Since a coloring and its reflection are in different equivalence classes (rows),
    # reflection is not a symmetry.

    # 5. Identify the group and its generator.
    # The group consists of only rotations, so it is the cyclic group C6.
    # This group is generated by a single element: the rotation calculated above.
