    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we will multiply the share of total trips by the combined mode share for cars (1 occupant + more than 2 occupants) and the average trip distance. Summing these values across all distance categories gives us a weighted total VMT for the baseline.\n2.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the Proposed table.\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The reduction is the difference between the Baseline VMT and the Proposed VMT. We will then express this reduction as a percentage of the Baseline VMT.\n\nThe calculation does not require the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures, as we are concerned with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT), and the mode shares are already provided for car trips (i.e., vehicle trips).\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations and prints out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data Definition ---\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    trip_shares = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_distances = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n    # Baseline scenario data (Table 1)\n    baseline_car1_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_carpool_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed scenario data (Table 2)\n    proposed_car1_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_carpool_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    baseline_vmt_components = []\n    for i in range(len(trip_shares)):\n        total_car_share = baseline_car1_share[i] + baseline_carpool_share[i]\n        vmt_component = trip_shares[i] * total_car_share * avg_distances[i]\n        baseline_vmt += vmt_component\n        baseline_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the total weighted Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.\")\n    print(\"Baseline VMT Equation:\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"({trip_shares[i]} * ({baseline_car1_share[i]} + {baseline_carpool_share[i]}) * {avg_distances[i]})\" for i in range(len(trip_shares))])\n    print(f\"VMT_baseline = {equation_str}\")\n    sum_str = \" + \".join([f\"{comp:.4f}\" for comp in baseline_vmt_components])\n    print(f\"VMT_baseline = {sum_str} = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    proposed_vmt_components = []\n    for i in range(len(trip_shares)):\n        total_car_share = proposed_car1_share[i] + proposed_carpool_share[i]\n        vmt_component = trip_shares[i] * total_car_share * avg_distances[i]\n        proposed_vmt += vmt_component\n        proposed_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the total weighted Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.\")\n    print(\"Proposed VMT Equation:\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"({trip_shares[i]} * ({proposed_car1_share[i]} + {proposed_carpool_share[i]}) * {avg_distances[i]})\" for i in range(len(trip_shares))])\n    print(f\"VMT_proposed = {equation_str}\")\n    sum_str = \" + \".join([f\"{comp:.4f}\" for comp in proposed_vmt_components])\n    print(f\"VMT_proposed = {sum_str} = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\")\n    print(\"Percentage Reduction Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Reduction = ( (VMT_baseline - VMT_proposed) / VMT_baseline ) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Reduction = ( ({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f} ) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Reduction = ( {vmt_reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f} ) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\\n\")\n\n\ncalculate_vmt_reduction()\nprint(\"<<<52.2>>>\")\n```"
