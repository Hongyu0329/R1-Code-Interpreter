    "My thinking process to solve this riddle involves breaking it down into two parts, based on the two clues provided, and then finding the common term \"X Y\" that links them.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue is: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man receiving an award. A reverse image search or recognizing the individuals and the context reveals the man receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The event is the 2019 NHL Awards (which took place on June 19, 2019, but photos are often dated by publication).\n*   On that night, Kucherov won three major individual awards: the Art Ross Trophy, the Ted Lindsay Award, and the Hart Memorial Trophy.\n*   In sports, achieving three significant feats is commonly called a **\"hat trick\"**. So, the first \"X Y\" refers to this accomplishment. The phrase \"Hat Trick is pictured\" is used figuratively to refer to the person who achieved it.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical industrial process. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to make felt from fur for hats.\n*   This process was highly toxic to the workers, who were called \"hatters\". The neurological damage they suffered from mercury poisoning gave rise to the idiom \"mad as a hatter\".\n*   Due to this toxicity, the use of mercury in hat-making has been discontinued.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings to identify \"X Y\".**\n*   The first clue points to a \"hat trick\" in sports.\n*   The second clue points to the process of making hats, the very object for which the term \"hat trick\" was originally coined in the sport of cricket. The \"trick\" of the trade involved using mercury.\n*   Therefore, the common two-word phrase \"X Y\" that connects both clues is **\"Hat Trick\"**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the two-word phrase \"X Y\".\n\n    Clue 1 Analysis: The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    He won three major trophies that night (Hart Memorial, Art Ross, and Ted Lindsay),\n    a feat known as a \"hat trick\".\n\n    Clue 2 Analysis: The phrase \"Another X Y\" refers to the historical process of making\n    felt hats. This process (the \"trick\" of the trade) used mercury salts, which are\n    highly toxic. The practice has since been abandoned. The original \"hat trick\" in\n    cricket involved awarding the player a hat.\n\n    Conclusion: The common phrase is \"Hat Trick\".\n    \"\"\"\n    first_word = \"Hat\"\n    second_word = \"Trick\"\n    \n    print(f\"The solution is: {first_word} {second_word}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
