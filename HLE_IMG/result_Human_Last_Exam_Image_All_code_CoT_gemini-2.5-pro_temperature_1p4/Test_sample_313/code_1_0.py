    This function solves the riddle by identifying the two-word phrase "X Y".

    Clue 1 Analysis: The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.
    He won three major trophies that night (Hart Memorial, Art Ross, and Ted Lindsay),
    a feat known as a "hat trick".

    Clue 2 Analysis: The phrase "Another X Y" refers to the historical process of making
    felt hats. This process (the "trick" of the trade) used mercury salts, which are
    highly toxic. The practice has since been abandoned. The original "hat trick" in
    cricket involved awarding the player a hat.

    Conclusion: The common phrase is "Hat Trick".
