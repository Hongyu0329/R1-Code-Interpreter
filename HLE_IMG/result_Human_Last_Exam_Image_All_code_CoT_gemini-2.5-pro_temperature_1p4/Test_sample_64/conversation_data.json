    "The image displays a time-lapse sequence (labeled L, M, and N) of a biological process occurring in a filamentous organism, such as a fungus or alga.\n\n*   In panel **L**, we see a straight filament made of elongated cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The arrowhead points to a septum of a subapical cell (a cell below the tip).\n*   In panel **M**, the same cell pointed to in L has begun to form a bulge on its side wall. This is the initiation of a new growth point.\n*   In panel **N**, this bulge has developed further and elongated into a new side branch, causing the main filament to bend. The arrowhead now points to the base of this new branch.\n\nThis entire sequence from L to N clearly illustrates the formation of a new branch from an existing filament.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
