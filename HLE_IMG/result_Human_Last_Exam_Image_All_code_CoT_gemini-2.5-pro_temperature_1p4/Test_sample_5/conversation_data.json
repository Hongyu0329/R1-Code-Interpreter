    "Based on my analysis of the provided sheet music, I can identify the piece for you.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the musical characteristics:** I will examine the key signature, time signature, tempo, dynamics, and the specific melodic and harmonic patterns in the score.\n2.  **Identify the style and period:** The complex arpeggios, dramatic dynamic shifts, and rich chromatic harmony are strong indicators of the Romantic era, specifically virtuoso piano music.\n3.  **Compare to known compositions:** I will match these features against well-known piano works. The opening melody and the subsequent \"scherzando\" character are very distinctive. The style is highly reminiscent of Frédéric Chopin's etudes.\n4.  **Pinpoint the exact piece:** By comparing the first few measures note-for-note, I can confirm the piece is the Etude in E minor, Op. 25, No. 5 by Chopin, sometimes nicknamed the \"Wrong Note\" etude due to its dissonant grace notes in the main theme.\n5.  **Provide the answer:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the piece and then provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Frédéric Chopin\"\n    work = \"Etude in E minor\"\n    opus_number = \"Op. 25, No. 5\"\n    \n    full_title = f\"{composer} - {work}, {opus_number}\"\n    \n    print(full_title)\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Frédéric Chopin - Etude in E minor, Op. 25, No. 5>>>"
