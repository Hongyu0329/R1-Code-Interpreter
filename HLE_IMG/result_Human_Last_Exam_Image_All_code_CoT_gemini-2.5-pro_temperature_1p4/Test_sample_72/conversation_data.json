    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Reaction**: The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene and, under photochemical conditions (`hv`), forms a complex fused-ring product. The problem states that two pericyclic reactions are involved.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction (Step 1)**: The reaction is initiated by light (`hv`), which suggests a photochemical reaction. Aromatic compounds like hexafluorobenzene can undergo photochemical valence isomerization. In this case, hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to its non-aromatic Dewar-benzene isomer (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation involves the rearrangement of pi electrons within the molecule to form new sigma bonds and create a bicyclic system. This type of intramolecular ring-formation from a conjugated pi system is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**. This is the first pericyclic reaction.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction (Step 2)**: The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene. The structure of the final product indicates that a new four-membered ring has been formed, fusing the two molecules. This reaction occurs between one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene intermediate (a 2π-electron system) and the double bond of cyclobutene (another 2π-electron system). A reaction where two unsaturated molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct is called a **cycloaddition**. Since it involves a 2π system reacting with another 2π system, it is specifically a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed under photochemical conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**: The two pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the types of pericyclic reactions\n    in the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first reaction is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene.\n    reaction_1 = \"Electrocyclic reaction\"\n    \n    # The second reaction is the photochemical cycloaddition of the intermediate with cyclobutene.\n    reaction_2 = \"[2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    \n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\")\n    print(f\"1. {reaction_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {reaction_2}\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<Electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
