    "Of the four depicted complexes, those with shorter lifetimes are the ones that are less chemically stable under operating conditions in a Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC). The stability of these Iridium(III) complexes is primarily dictated by the strength and inertness of the cyclometalated Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n\nA critical factor influencing stability is the substitution pattern on the phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. Specifically, a well-documented degradation pathway exists for complexes where a fluorine atom is present at the 2'-position of the phenyl ring (i.e., ortho to the bond connecting the phenyl and pyridine rings).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Standard Cyclometalation:** In a standard 2-phenylpyridine ligand, the Iridium atom forms a five-membered chelate ring by bonding to the pyridine's nitrogen atom and activating a C-H bond at the 2'-position of the phenyl ring to form an Ir-C bond.\n2.  **Effect of 2'-Fluorine Substitution:** If a fluorine atom is located at the 2'-position, it blocks this site for C-H activation. Consequently, cyclometalation is forced to occur at the only other available ortho position, which is the 6'-position.\n3.  **Destabilizing Geometry:** This alternative cyclometalation results in a geometry where the fluorine atom at the 2'-position is now *ortho* to the Ir-C bond at the 6'-position. This Ir-C(6')-C(1')-C(2')-F arrangement is known to be unstable and susceptible to a degradation pathway involving C-F bond cleavage, which significantly shortens the complex's lifetime.\n4.  **Complex Analysis:**\n    *   **Complex 1 (2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand):** Contains a fluorine at the 2'-position. It is expected to be unstable and have a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2 (2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand):** The fluorine is at the 4'-position, which is *para* to the Ir-C bond. This does not trigger the specific degradation pathway. It is expected to be relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 3 (2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand):** Contains a fluorine at the 2'-position. It is expected to be unstable and have a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4 (2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand):** Contains a fluorine at the 2'-position. It is expected to be unstable and have a shorter lifetime.\n\nTherefore, complexes [1], [3], and [4] are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes based on their ligand structures\n    to determine which are expected to have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to represent if a complex has the destabilizing 2'-fluoro substituent.\n    # True indicates presence, leading to shorter lifetime.\n    complexes_stability_info = {\n        1: True,   # Ligand: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine -> Has 2'-F\n        2: False,  # Ligand: 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine    -> No 2'-F\n        3: True,   # Ligand: 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine    -> Has 2'-F\n        4: True,   # Ligand: 2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine    -> Has 2'-F\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The key to determining the lifetime of these emitter complexes is their chemical stability.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: A known cause of instability is a fluorine atom at the 2'-position of the phenylpyridine ligand, which leads to a rapid degradation pathway.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing each complex for this feature:\")\n\n    unstable_complexes = []\n    for complex_id, is_unstable in complexes_stability_info.items():\n        if is_unstable:\n            status = \"unstable (shorter lifetime)\"\n            unstable_complexes.append(complex_id)\n        else:\n            status = \"stable (longer lifetime)\"\n        print(f\"  - Complex {complex_id}: Contains a 2'-fluoro substituent? {is_unstable}.
