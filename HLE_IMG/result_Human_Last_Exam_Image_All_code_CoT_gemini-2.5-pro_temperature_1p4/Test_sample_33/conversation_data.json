    "This is an excellent ECG for analysis. Let's break it down step-by-step to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I will examine the R-R intervals to determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Determine the Heart Rate:** I will estimate the ventricular rate to see if it's within the normal range, bradycardic, or tachycardic.\n3.  **Examine the QRS Complexes:** I will check the duration (narrow vs. wide) and the morphology (shape) of the QRS complexes.\n4.  **Look for Atrial Activity:** I will search for P waves or other signs of atrial activity like fibrillatory or flutter waves.\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** I will combine all the features to select the most appropriate diagnosis from the given options.\n\nBased on this plan, I will generate a Python script that programmatically outlines this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically lays out the reasoning for the ECG diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key findings from the ECG analysis\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate = \"Very fast tachycardia (>150 bpm, approaching 200 bpm at times)\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (> 0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Bizarre and polymorphic (changing shape)\"\n    atrial_activity = \"No discernible P waves, chaotic baseline consistent with fibrillatory waves\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Breakdown:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
