The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the large steric hindrance of the rigid proline ring fused to the MÃ¼nchnone intermediate. This bulky ring structure at the C2 position directs the incoming alkyne to add with a specific orientation to minimize steric clash. In contrast, the acyclic intermediate in Reaction 2 has substituents (e.g., isopropyl and methyl) that are not sterically different enough to enforce selectivity, resulting in a 1:1 mixture of products. Reactions 1 and 2 establish that the reaction is not inherently selective for acyclic systems, highlighting the crucial role of the proline ring's structure in controlling the outcome of Reaction 3.
