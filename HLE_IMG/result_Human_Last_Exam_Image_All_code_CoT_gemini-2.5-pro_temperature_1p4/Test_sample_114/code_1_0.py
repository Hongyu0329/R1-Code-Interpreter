The difference in regioselectivity between these reactions is a classic example of steric control in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The key reactive intermediate formed in all three reactions is a mesoionic oxazolium-5-olate, commonly known as a Münchnone. The regioselectivity of its reaction with methyl propiolate is determined by the substituents on the Münchnone.

### The Role of Steric Hindrance

The governing principle is that the bulkiest group on the dipolarophile (the -COOCH3 group on methyl propiolate) will preferentially add to the least sterically hindered side of the 1,3-dipole (the Münchnone).

### Analysis of Reaction 3 (Highly Regioselective)

1.  **Intermediate:** The starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a bicyclic Münchnone. In this intermediate, the C2 position is part of the rigid five-membered pyrrolidine ring, while the C4 position bears a small methyl group.
2.  **Steric Environment:** This structure creates a significant steric difference between the two reactive carbons of the dipole. The C2 position is extremely bulky and sterically encumbered due to the fused ring.
3.  **Outcome:** To minimize steric repulsion in the reaction's transition state, the large -COOCH3 group of the alkyne adds to the sterically accessible C4 position. This results in the highly regioselective formation of a single product, Product B (C10H13NO2), whose structure is consistent with the provided NMR data (e.g., the vinylic singlet at 6.70 ppm).

### Analysis of Reaction 2 (Non-selective)

1.  **Intermediate:** The starting material is an acyclic N-acyl-N-methyl-amino acid. The resulting Münchnone has a flexible, acyclic substituent at C2 (e.g., isopropyl) and a methyl group at C4.
2.  **Steric Environment:** While the isopropyl group is larger than the methyl group, the steric difference is far less pronounced than in the rigid proline case. The flexibility of the acyclic group can reduce its effective steric footprint in the transition state.
3.  **Outcome:** Because the steric difference between the C2 and C4 positions is not large enough to effectively direct the cycloaddition, both possible regioisomeric transition states are of similar energy. This leads to the formation of Product A (C9H13NO2) as a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers, demonstrating a lack of regioselectivity.

### Conclusion: Contribution of Reactions 1 & 2

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial because they establish a baseline for this type of reaction. They demonstrate that with simple, flexible acyclic Münchnone intermediates, the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate is inherently non-selective under these conditions. This makes the high regioselectivity seen in Reaction 3 stand out.

Therefore, the reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the **large, rigid steric hindrance imposed by the proline ring in the bicyclic Münchnone intermediate**, which is absent in the more flexible acyclic intermediates of Reactions 1 and 2.
