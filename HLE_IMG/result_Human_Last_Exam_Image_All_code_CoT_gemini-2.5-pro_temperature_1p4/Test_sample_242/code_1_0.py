    Solves the alkene metathesis cascade problem by logical deduction.

    Thinking Process:
    1.  The problem asks for the identity (H or Me) and stereochemistry (UP or DOWN) of four substituents R1, R2, R3, and R4 in the product of an alkene metathesis cascade.
    2.  The starting material has two methyl (Me) groups and two complex side chains on a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core. The product will therefore have two Me groups and two hydrogens at the R1-R4 positions.
    3.  The answer choices pair (R1, R2) and (R3, R4), suggesting one pair is (Me, Me) and the other is (H, H).
    4.  The product diagram ambiguously shows R1 and R2 on the same quaternary carbon. Having two Me groups here (R1=Me, R2=Me) is impossible as they originate from different carbons in the starting material.
    5.  Therefore, it is most likely that R1 and R2 are hydrogens, and R3 and R4 are the methyl groups. This directs us to options C, D, and E.
    6.  All three of these options show R3 = Me DOWN and R4 = Me DOWN. Let's rationalize this. The two Me groups in the starting material are `exo` (let's call this UP). During the complex rearrangement, the molecule's orientation can effectively flip, making the original `exo` groups point DOWN in the final drawing relative to the new convex face. The key is that their relative stereochemistry is preserved: they start `cis` (both UP) and they end `cis` (both DOWN).
    7.  With R3 and R4 established as Me DOWN, we need to determine the stereochemistry of R1=H and R2=H. These hydrogens must be `trans` to the methyl groups.
    8.  If the original `exo` (UP) face becomes DOWN in the product, then the original `endo` (DOWN) face must become UP. The hydrogens at the R1 and R2 positions must come from this `endo` face.
    9.  Since all hydrogens on the original `endo` face are `cis` to each other, the hydrogens at R1 and R2 must also be `cis`. Therefore, they must both be UP.
    10. This leads to the conclusion: R1 = H UP, R2 = H UP, R3 = Me DOWN, R4 = Me DOWN. This corresponds to option C.
