    "To identify the rock specimens, let's analyze their visual characteristics.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has many visible holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is typical of extrusive igneous rocks that cooled rapidly from lava containing trapped gases. This specimen is likely Scoria.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular fragments cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This type of rock, made from broken pieces of other rocks, is called a clastic rock. Since the fragments appear volcanic in origin, it's a Volcanic Breccia.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly porous rock. Its appearance is consistent with Pumice, a volcanic rock so full of gas bubbles that it's very lightweight and can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock features very large, intergrown crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained, crystalline texture (phaneritic) indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. Such a coarse-grained igneous rock is known as a Pegmatite.\n\nThe following Python code will print the identifications for each specimen.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
