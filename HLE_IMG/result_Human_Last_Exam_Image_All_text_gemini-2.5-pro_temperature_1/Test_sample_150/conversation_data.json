    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid.\n    *   **Mechanism:** AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming an acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). This electrophile then attacks the benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring. The product is **propiophenone**, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n    *   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and Iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n    *   **Mechanism:** FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes Br₂ to generate an electrophilic bromine species which attacks the aromatic ring. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the ring is an electron-withdrawing group and is therefore a **meta-director** and deactivating.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is substituted onto the benzene ring at the position meta (position 3) to the propiophenone group. The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** m-Br-C₆H₄-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n    *   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and Palladium catalyst (Pd).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a powerful reduction method. It can reduce multiple functional groups.\n        *   **Reduction of the ketone:** The benzylic ketone is reduced completely to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This type of reduction is called hydrogenolysis and proceeds via an alcohol intermediate. C=O → CH₂.\n        *   **Reduction of the aryl halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is also cleaved and replaced with a carbon-hydrogen bond (hydrogenolysis). C-Br → C-H.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** Both the ketone and the bromo substituent are removed/reduced, resulting in **propylbenzene**.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** C₆H₅-CH₂CH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Free Radical Bromination.\n    *   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n    *   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) is the source of bromine radicals. Benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) is a radical initiator. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) is the solvent.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction selectively brominates at the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This is because the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from this position leads to the formation of a highly stable benzylic radical, which is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Product:** In propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃), the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group. A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogen atoms at this position. The final product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** C₆H₅-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Summary of structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
