    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of multiple neurons over time. The vertical axis represents the \"Electrode Number\" (from 0 to 128), and the horizontal axis represents \"Time (s)\" (from 0 to 50 seconds). Each black dot signifies an action potential, or \"spike,\" from a single neuron at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period when many neurons fire in a coordinated, high-frequency manner. On this raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating that a large number of electrodes recorded spikes within a short time window. We can visually identify five major synchronized bursts across the recorded time.\n\n3.  **Determine the Timestamps of Bursts:** We need to estimate the time at which each burst occurs. For consistency, we can estimate the center of each dense vertical band.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first major burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 13 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst is centered at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n    The identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 13 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the midpoints of consecutive bursts. With five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n    *   **IBI₁:** The interval between Burst 2 and Burst 1:\n        t₂ - t₁ = 13 s - 3 s = 10 s\n    *   **IBI₂:** The interval between Burst 3 and Burst 2:\n        t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 13 s = 11 s\n    *   **IBI₃:** The interval between Burst 4 and Burst 3:\n        t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = 12 s\n    *   **IBI₄:** The interval between Burst 5 and Burst 4:\n        t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** We find the average of the calculated intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 10 s + 11 s + 12 s + 12 s = 45 s\n    *   Number of intervals = 4\n    *   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 45 s / 4 = 11.25 s\n\n6.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated average is 11.25 s.\n    *   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n    *   The third digit is '2'. Since this is less than 5, we do not round up the preceding digit.\n    *   Therefore, 11.25 s rounded to two significant figures is 11 s.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Identification:** It is crucial to identify the main, network-wide synchronized events. The five chosen bursts are the most prominent and consistent across the electrode array. Smaller, less-synchronized firing events are correctly excluded.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** While visual estimation has some inherent uncertainty, the intervals are relatively consistent. Using the center of the burst is a standard method. Checking the calculation with slightly different reasonable estimates (e.g., using the start of the burst) yields the same result, confirming the robustness of the calculation.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the specified precision is a key part of the question. Rounding 11.25 to two significant figures correctly results in 11.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 13 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 48 s. The average inter-burst interval is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
