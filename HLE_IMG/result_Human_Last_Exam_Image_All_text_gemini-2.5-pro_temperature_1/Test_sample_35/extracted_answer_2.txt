The protein S100B binds to the V domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its levels are directly correlated with the activation of pathways leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thereby providing information on the potential severity and progression of the disease.
