    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and name the molecule according to IUPAC rules.**\n\n1.  **Find the principal functional group:** The amino group (-NH2) is the principal functional group, so the molecule will be named as an alkanamine.\n2.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the carbon attached to the principal functional group:** We need to find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms that includes the -CH2- part of the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   Let's trace the possible chains starting from the CH2NH2 group. Let's label the key carbons in the drawing from left to right as C_alpha (with OH), C_beta (with Ethyl), and C_gamma (with Me and CH2NH2).\n    *   The chain starting from the amine and going through the ethyl group is: `NH2-CH2-C_gamma-C_beta-CH2CH3`. This chain has 5 carbon atoms.\n    *   The chain starting from the amine and going through the C_alpha is: `NH2-CH2-C_gamma-C_beta-C_alpha-CH3`. This chain also has 5 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Choose the principal chain:** When two chains have the same length, we choose the one with the maximum number of substituents.\n    *   Chain 1 (through ethyl): Substituents are a methyl group on C_gamma and a (1-hydroxyethyl) group on C_beta. This gives 2 substituents.\n    *   Chain 2 (through C_alpha): Substituents are a methyl group on C_gamma, an ethyl group on C_beta, and a hydroxyl group on C_alpha. This gives 3 substituents.\n    *   Therefore, we choose the second chain.\n4.  **Number the principal chain:** We number the chain starting from the end closest to the principal functional group (-NH2).\n    *   C1: The carbon of the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   C2: The carbon C_gamma.\n    *   C3: The carbon C_beta.\n    *   C4: The carbon C_alpha.\n    *   C5: The terminal methyl group attached to C4.\n5.  **Name the molecule:**\n    *   The parent chain is a pentan-1-amine.\n    *   Substituents are: a methyl group at C2, an ethyl group at C3, and a hydroxyl group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is: **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n6.  **Identify chiral centers:** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, C2, C3, and C4 are all bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **C2:** Bonded to H, -CH3, -CH2NH2 (C1), and the rest of the chain (C3).\n    *   **C3:** Bonded to H, -CH2CH3, C2, and C4.\n    *   **C4:** Bonded to H, -OH, -CH3 (C5), and C3.\n    *   We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of these three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration of each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n**Careful Point:** The drawing at the leftmost chiral center (C4) is ambiguous, showing two dashed bonds (-OH and -CH3). A tetrahedral carbon cannot have this geometry if the C-C bond is in the plane. We will interpret this drawing assuming the C5-C4-C3 chain forms a zig-zag in the plane of the paper, which is a common convention for showing side-chain stereochemistry. This implies the -OH is dashed (away) and the implied -H is wedged (forward).\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of C2 (rightmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Assign priorities to the groups attached to C2:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 (C1): The carbon is bonded to (N, H, H).\n    *   -C3...: The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    *   -CH3: The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    *   -H\n    *   Comparing the first atoms of the substituents on the carbons attached to C2: N > C > H. Therefore, the priority order is:\n        1.  -CH2NH2\n        2.  -C3...\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n2.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C3-C2 bond is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) is wedged (forward). The -CH3 group (priority 3) is dashed (away). This means the implied -H (priority 4) is in the plane.\n    *   To determine the configuration when the lowest priority group is in the plane, we can use the swap method. Let's swap the position of -H (4) and -CH3 (3).\n    *   In the new (imaginary) molecule, -H is dashed (away). We can now trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from -CH2NH2 (1, wedged) -> -C3 (2, in the plane to the left) -> -CH3 (3, now in the plane) is counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite. Thus, **C2 is R**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of C3 (middle chiral center):**\n1.  **Assign priorities to the groups attached to C3:**\n    *   -C4...: The carbon is bonded to (O, C, H).\n    *   -C2...: The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    *   -CH2CH3 (Ethyl): The carbon is bonded to (C, H, H).\n    *   -H\n    *   Comparing the first atoms of the substituents: O > C. So, the -C4 group is priority 1. Comparing -C2 and -Ethyl, (C, C, H) > (C, H, H). So -C2 is priority 2. The order is:\n        1.  -C4...\n        2.  -C2...\n        3.  -CH2CH3\n        4.  -H\n2.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C-C backbone is in the plane. The ethyl group (priority 3) is wedged (forward). This implies the implied -H (priority 4) is dashed (away).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, we can directly read the configuration.\n    *   Tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3: -C4 (up-left) -> -C2 (down-right) -> -Ethyl (forward). This path is clockwise (R).\n    *   Thus, **C3 is R**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of C4 (leftmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Assign priorities to the groups attached to C4:**\n    *   -OH: Attached via Oxygen (O).\n    *   -C3...: Attached via Carbon, which is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    *   -CH3 (C5): Attached via Carbon, which is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    *   -H\n    *   The priority order is:\n        1.  -OH\n        2.  -C3...\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n2.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   As mentioned in the careful point, we interpret the C5-C4-C3 chain as being in the plane. The drawing shows -OH (priority 1) as dashed (away). This implies the implied -H (priority 4) must be wedged (forward).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards us, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from -OH (1, back) -> -C3 (2, in the plane to the right) -> -CH3 (3, in the plane to the left) is counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   Because the lowest priority group is wedged, we reverse the result from S to R.\n    *   Thus, **C4 is R**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by the configurations of all its chiral centers, listed in order of their numbering.\n*   C2 is R.\n*   C3 is R.\n*   C4 is R.\n\nThe full absolute configuration is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
