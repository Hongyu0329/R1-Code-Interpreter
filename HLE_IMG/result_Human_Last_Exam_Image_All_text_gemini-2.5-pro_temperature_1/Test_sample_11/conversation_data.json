    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to guess the country from the small part of the flag:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visible pattern:** The image displays a small section from the top-left corner of a flag. We can clearly see three horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the colors are:\n    *   Black\n    *   White (a relatively thin stripe)\n    *   Red (a thicker stripe)\n\n2.  **Search for flags with this pattern:** The first step is to think of countries that use a horizontal tricolor flag with black, white, and red stripes in this specific order (black on top).\n    *   The most famous flag with this design is the historical flag of the **German Empire** (1871–1918).\n    *   Another country that used this flag was the **Republic of Upper Volta** (1958–1984), before it became Burkina Faso.\n    *   However, the question asks to \"Guess the Country,\" which usually implies a current sovereign state. As of today, no UN-recognized country officially uses a simple black-white-red horizontal tricolor.\n\n3.  **Consider common puzzle tricks:** Since there's no direct match with a current country's flag, we should consider if there is a trick involved. A very common trick in flag puzzles is to show the image upside down.\n\n4.  **Invert the pattern:** If we flip the visible pattern vertically, the order of the stripes becomes:\n    *   Red\n    *   White\n    *   Black\n\n5.  **Search for flags with the inverted pattern (Red-White-Black):** This color combination is known as the Arab Liberation colors and is used by several current countries:\n    *   **Yemen:** Its flag is a simple horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black.\n    *   **Egypt:** Its flag is red, white, and black with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   **Syria:** Its flag is red, white, and black with two green stars in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   **Iraq:** Its flag is red, white, and black with the Takbir (\"Allahu Akbar\") written in green in the center of the white stripe.\n\n6.  **Select the most likely candidate:** Out of these options, the flag of Yemen is the only one that is a plain tricolor without any additional symbols or emblems. The puzzle shows only the stripes in one corner and obscures the rest of the flag. Without any visual information about a central emblem, the most logical and simple answer is the country whose flag consists only of these stripes.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The image shows an upside-down version of the flag of Yemen. The puzzle creator has inverted the flag to make it more challenging.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
