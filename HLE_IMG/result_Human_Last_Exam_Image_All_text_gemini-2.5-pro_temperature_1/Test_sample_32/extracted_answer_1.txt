The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an "immersed" capsule that sits nestled within the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long and strongly curved ("cygneous" or swan-necked) seta, which holds the capsule well above and often hanging over the side of the plant, making it "exserted".
