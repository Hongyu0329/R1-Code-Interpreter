    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the primary, most easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte generation of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the foot (which attaches to the gametophyte), the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains the spores).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta (Stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically very short and straight.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is so short, the capsule does not rise above the surrounding leaves (the perichaetial leaves). This condition is described as \"immersed\" or \"emergent.\" The capsule appears to be sitting directly in the cushion of the moss plant. The capsules in the provided image show this immersed characteristic.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta (Stalk):** The species name itself, *curviseta*, is a major clue. It translates to \"curved seta.\" This species has a relatively long seta that is distinctly and strongly curved, often in a swan-neck or S-shape (cygneous).\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The long, curved seta holds the capsule well above and often to the side of the main moss cushion. This condition is described as \"exserted.\" The capsule frequently hangs or nods due to the curve in the seta.\n\n4.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   The most striking and immediate difference between the two species' sporophytes is the **seta and the resulting capsule position**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, you would see capsules nestled down among the leaves with no visible stalk.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, you would see capsules held up and away from the leaves on obvious, long, curved stalks.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Sporophyte:** While there are also differences in the gametophyte (the leafy part), the question specifically asks about the sporophyte.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This implies a macroscopic feature that doesn't require a microscope. The difference in seta length and curvature is a perfect example of such a feature.\n*   **Nomenclature as a Clue:** The scientific name *Grimmia curviseta* directly points to the key feature (curved seta).\n*   **Image Interpretation:** The provided image shows immersed capsules on what must be very short, straight setae, a feature consistent with *Grimmia montana* and inconsistent with *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta that leaves the capsule immersed among the leaves, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a long, strongly curved seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves (exserted).\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an \"immersed\" capsule that sits nestled within the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long and strongly curved (\"cygneous\" or swan-necked) seta, which holds the capsule well above and often hanging over the side of the plant, making it \"exserted\".>>>"
