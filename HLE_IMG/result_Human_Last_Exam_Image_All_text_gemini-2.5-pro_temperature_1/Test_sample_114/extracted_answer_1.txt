The reactions proceed via a [3+2] cycloaddition between a Münchnone intermediate and methyl propiolate. The regioselectivity of this addition is determined by the substituents at the C2 and C4 positions of the Münchnone.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 serve as a critical control. The starting material, N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, generates a Münchnone with methyl groups at both C2 and C4. The 13C labeling experiment (Reaction 2) shows that these two methyl groups are scrambled, indicating that the Münchnone intermediate is fluxional and undergoes a rapid equilibrium that swaps the C2 and C4 substituents. This happens because the two methyl substituents are sterically very similar.

In Reaction 3, the starting material is N-acetyl-proline. The resulting Münchnone has a methyl group at C2, but the C4 position is a sterically hindered bridgehead carbon, part of the fused proline ring. The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of the large, non-equilibrating steric difference between the C2 and C4 positions of this rigid intermediate. The cycloaddition is sterically controlled: the extremely bulky C4-position of the Münchnone approaches the small hydrogen atom of the alkyne, while the much less hindered C2-position approaches the larger ester group. This specific orientation minimizes steric repulsion and is overwhelmingly favored, leading to the formation of a single regioisomer, Product B. The proline ring's rigidity prevents the fluxional scrambling seen in Reaction 2, thereby locking in the steric bias and ensuring high regioselectivity.
