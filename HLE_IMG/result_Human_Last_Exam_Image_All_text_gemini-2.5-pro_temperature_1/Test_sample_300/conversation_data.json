    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**Analysis of Each Artwork:**\n\n1.  **Top-Left:**\n    *   **Subject:** Three women from a Chinese ethnic minority group, identifiable by their distinctive clothing and headdresses.\n    *   **Style:** Chinese ink and color painting, characterized by realistic figure drawing combined with traditional ink wash techniques.\n    *   **Signature & Seal:** A signature \"邦文\" (Bāngwén) and a red seal are visible in the upper right corner. \"Bangwen\" is the courtesy name (字) of the contemporary artist **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**, who is renowned for his figure paintings, especially of Tibetan and other minority peoples. The style is consistent with his work.\n\n2.  **Top-Middle:**\n    *   **Subject:** A landscape, likely depicting buildings nestled in mountains or trees.\n    *   **Style:** An ink sketch with highly expressive, abstract, and rhythmic lines. This style, which deconstructs and reconstructs scenery into points, lines, and planes, is a signature of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He was a master at blending Western modernist abstraction with the spirit of Chinese ink painting.\n\n3.  **Top-Right:**\n    *   **Subject:** Chinese calligraphy.\n    *   **Style:** Energetic, free-flowing cursive script (草书, caoshu). The characters are highly stylized, connected, and have a strong sense of momentum.\n    *   **Signature:** The calligraphy style is famously and unmistakably that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. His calligraphy is known for its grand, unrestrained, and powerful character.\n\n4.  **Middle-Left:**\n    *   **Subject:** Chinese calligraphy.\n    *   **Style:** Vigorous and fluid cursive script.\n    *   **Signature & Seal:** The signature at the bottom left is \"于右任\" (**Yu Youren**). Yu Youren was a master calligrapher of the 20th century, particularly famous for his \"Standard Cursive Script,\" which aimed to create a systematic and accessible form of the script. The bold, powerful, yet controlled strokes are characteristic of his style.\n\n5.  **Middle-Center:**\n    *   **Subject:** A realistic portrait of a young woman with short hair, in a white shirt, holding a paintbrush and a book/palette.\n    *   **Style:** This is a highly realistic oil painting, a prime example of the Academic Realism (or Scar Art) movement in China.\n    *   **Identification:** This is one of the most iconic works of modern Chinese art, titled \"Youth\" (青年女歌手), painted by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)** in 1984. He is a leading figure in Chinese realist oil painting.\n\n6.  **Middle-Right:**\n    *   **Subject:** A stylized portrait of a woman with an elaborate headdress, surrounded by sparrows and autumn leaves.\n    *   **Style:** The work features a figure with an elongated neck and a simplified, elegant face against a decorative background. This distinctive synthesis of Western Fauvism and traditional Chinese ink painting (with its emphasis on lines and emotional expression) is the hallmark of **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n\n7.  **Bottom-Left:**\n    *   **Subject:** A vibrant courtyard scene with loofah gourds hanging from a trellis, laundry on a line, and a rooster in a basket.\n    *   **Style:** The painting uses bright, bold colors and strong geometric compositions. This approach to depicting rural Chinese life with the formal language of Western modernism is characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n    *   **Signature & Seal:** A signature \"吴冠中\" and the date \"一九七九\" (1979) are visible in the bottom left, confirming the attribution.\n\n8.  **Bottom-Middle:**\n    *   **Subject:** A landscape painting of a river gorge with towering, dark cliffs and a fleet of boats with red sails.\n    *   **Style:** The style is characterized by the use of heavy, layered ink to build up monumental, powerful mountain forms, creating a sense of depth and solidity. This technique, and the subject of the Three Gorges, is strongly associated with **Li Keran (李可染)**, one of the most important landscape painters of 20th-century China.\n\n9.  **Bottom-Right:**\n    *   **Subject:** A single lobster.\n    *   **Style:** The painting is executed with remarkable economy of brushwork, yet it vividly captures the creature's form, texture (especially the translucent shell), and vitality.\n    *   **Identification:** Painting shrimps, crabs, and lobsters with such lively spirit and masterful brushwork was a specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese artists. This style is quintessentially his.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of style, subject matter, and visible signatures, the authors of the nine works, from left to right and top to bottom, are:\n\n1.  Shi Guoliang (史国良)\n2.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n3.  Mao Zedong (毛泽东)\n4.  Yu Youren (于右任)\n5.  Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)\n6.  Lin Fengmian (林風眠)\n7.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n8.  Li Keran (李可染)\n9.  Qi Baishi (齐白石)\n\n<<<Shi Guoliang, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Yu Youren, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
