    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Goal of the Question**\n    The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes will have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Operational lifetime refers to the stability of the device and how long it can function before significant degradation. Shorter lifetime implies lower chemical or electrochemical stability.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the Structures of the Complexes**\n    All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structure: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-.\n    *   The central metal ion is Ir(III).\n    *   The ancillary bidentate ligand (N^N) is the same for all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The tert-butyl groups are bulky and improve solubility and film-forming properties but are not expected to be the primary determinant of the difference in stability between these four specific complexes.\n    *   The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-), which is a stable, non-coordinating anion.\n    *   The key difference lies in the two cyclometalating ligands (C^N ligands), which are substituted 2-phenylpyridine ligands. The variation is in the number and position of fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. It has no fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom at the ortho position relative to the Ir-C bond.\n        *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has three fluorine atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate Structural Differences to Stability and Lifetime**\n    The operational stability of cyclometalated iridium complexes in devices like LECs or OLEDs is strongly influenced by the strength of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond, which is often the weakest point and prone to cleavage during redox cycling.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative element. When substituted onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has several consequences:\n        1.  **Strengthening the Ir-C Bond:** The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms makes the carbon atom bonded to iridium more electronegative, which strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond. A stronger bond makes the complex more resistant to dissociation and degradation.\n        2.  **Increasing Redox Stability:** Fluorination lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is typically located on the Ir center and the phenyl part of the C^N ligand. A lower HOMO energy means the complex is harder to oxidize, making it more stable against oxidative degradation.\n    *   **General Trend:** As a general rule, increasing the degree of fluorination on the cyclometalating ligand enhances the chemical and electrochemical stability of the iridium complex, leading to a longer operational lifetime.\n\n*   **Step 4: Rank the Complexes by Expected Lifetime**\n    Based on the number of stabilizing fluorine atoms, we can rank the complexes in order of increasing stability:\n    *   **Complex 2 (no F):** Least stable. The Ir-C bond is the weakest, and the complex is the most susceptible to oxidation. It is expected to have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 3 (one F):** More stable than Complex 2. The single fluorine at the 2-position provides significant stabilization.\n    *   **Complex 1 (two F):** More stable than Complex 3. The additional fluorine at the 4-position further strengthens the complex.\n    *   **Complex 4 (three F):** Most stable. With three fluorine atoms, this complex is expected to be the most robust and have the longest lifetime.\n\n    Therefore, the expected order of operational lifetimes is:\n    Lifetime(2) < Lifetime(3) < Lifetime(1) < Lifetime(4)\n\n*   **Step 5: Answer the Question**\n    The question asks which complexes are expected to show \"shorter lifetimes\". The plural form suggests that more than one complex should be selected. According to our ranking, Complexes 2 and 3 have the shortest lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 4. Complex 2 is the least stable, and Complex 3, while an improvement, is still significantly less fluorinated and thus likely less stable than the heavily fluorinated complexes 1 and 4. Therefore, it is logical to group Complexes 2 and 3 together as those with shorter lifetimes.\n\n*   **Step 6: Match with Answer Choices**\n    The pair of complexes with the shorter lifetimes is [2, 3]. This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
