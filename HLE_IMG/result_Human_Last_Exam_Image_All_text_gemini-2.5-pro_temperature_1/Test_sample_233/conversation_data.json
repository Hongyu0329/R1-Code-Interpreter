    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Image and Query**\nThe user has provided a close-up image of a runestone and asked for its ID. The key information is that it is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" Ingvar runestones are a specific group of about 26 Viking Age runestones that mention Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland. The image shows runic characters carved in horizontal bands, a distinct stylistic feature. The task is to find the specific catalog number (e.g., Sö 179, U 785) for this stone.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribing the Runes**\nA careful transcription of the visible runes is necessary for identification. Let's analyze the three visible rows of text.\n\n*   **Top Row (from left to right):** The first visible character is the end of a rune, followed by the runes `ᚢ` (u), `ᚱ` (r), a word divider `፡`, then `ᛁ` (i), `ᚾ` (n), `ᚴ` (k), `ᚢ` (u), `ᛅ` (a), `ᚱ` (r), `ᛋ` (s). This sequence reads `...ur : inkuars...`. This is the end of a word and the name \"Ingvars\" (Genitive form of Ingvarr).\n\n*   **Middle Row:** This row starts with the runes `ᚦ` (þ), `ᛅ` (a), `ᛁ` (i), `ᚱ` (R), which spells `þaiR` (\"they\"). This is followed by a word divider `፡`, the runes `ᚠ` (f), `ᚢ` (u), `ᚱ` (r), `ᚢ` (u), spelling `furu` (\"travelled\"). After another divider `፡`, we see the runes `ᛏ` (t) and `ᚱ` (r). This line reads `þaiR : furu : tr...`\n\n*   **Bottom Row:** This row starts with a word divider `×`, then the runes `ᛁ` (i), `ᚴ` (k), `ᛁ` (i), `ᛚ` (l), `ᛅ` (a), spelling `ikila`. This is likely the end of the word `trikila` from the line above. After a divider `፡`, we see `ᚠ` (f), `ᛁ` (i), `ᛅ` (a), `ᚱ` (r), `ᛁ` (i), spelling `fiari` (\"far\"). This is followed by a divider `፡` and the runes `ᛅ` (a) and `ᛏ` (t), spelling `at` (\"for/to\"). The line reads `...ikila : fiari : at...`.\n\n**Step 3: Combining the Transcribed Lines**\nPutting the transcribed parts together, we get the following text fragment:\n*   ...[br]uþ**ur : inkuars**\n*   **þaiR : furu : trik**...\n*   ...**ila : fiari : at**...\n\nThis translates to: \"...brother Ingvar's. They travelled valiantly far for...\"\n\n**Step 4: Searching for the Inscription Among Ingvar Runestones**\nNow we search for an Ingvar runestone with this specific text. This inscription is very famous. It belongs to the **Gripholm Runestone**.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Identification**\n*   **ID:** The Gripholm Runestone is cataloged as **Sö 179**. \"Sö\" stands for the province of Södermanland, Sweden.\n*   **Location:** It is located at Gripsholm Castle.\n*   **Inscription:** The full inscription on Sö 179 is: *Tola let ræisa stæin þennsa at sun sinn Harald, broður Ingvars. ÞæiR foru drængila fiarri at gulli ok austarla ærni gafu, dou sunnarla a Særklandi.* (Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle, (they) died southwards in Serkland.)\n*   **Matching the fragment:** The transcribed fragment `...ur : inkuars : þaiR furu : trikila : fiari : at...` is a perfect match for the central part of the Sö 179 inscription.\n*   **Visual Style:** The Gripholm Runestone is known for its text being carved in straight horizontal bands, exactly as seen in the image.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Runic alphabets and spelling varied. Accurate transcription requires familiarity with the Younger Futhark and its variants.\n*   The fragment shows parts of three consecutive lines of text, which is a strong clue.\n*   Word dividers (often `·` or `:`) are important for parsing the text.\n*   Context is key. Identifying the name `inkuars` (Ingvar's) was a critical confirmation that this is indeed an Ingvar runestone and helped anchor the rest of the transcription.\n*   Cross-referencing the transcription with known runestone inscriptions is the final step to confirm the ID.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the image fragment is from the Gripholm Runestone.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
