    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Identify the Script and Reading Direction:** The characters are carved in an ancient style known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū). Seals are read in the traditional Chinese manner: from top to bottom, and from right to left. Therefore, we will identify the characters in the following order: top right, bottom right, top left, bottom left.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Character:**\n\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This character is **長** (cháng). It depicts a person with long hair. In simplified Chinese, this character is written as **长**. It means \"long\".\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This character is **風** (fēng). The seal script form clearly shows the traditional structure. In simplified Chinese, it is written as **风**. It means \"wind\".\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This character is **破** (pò). It is composed of the radical for \"stone\" (石) on the left and the component \"skin\" (皮) on the right. This character is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese. It means \"to break\" or \"to cleave\".\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This character is **浪** (làng). It consists of the \"water\" radical (氵) on the left and the component \"good\" (良) on the right. This character is also the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese. It means \"waves\".\n\n3.  **Combine the Characters:** Reading the characters in the correct order (top-to-bottom, right-to-left), we get the phrase **長風破浪** (Cháng Fēng Pò Làng).\n\n4.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:** Converting the traditional characters to their simplified forms, we get:\n    *   長 -> **长**\n    *   風 -> **风**\n    *   破 -> **破**\n    *   浪 -> **浪**\n\n5.  **Final Phrase:** The full phrase in simplified Chinese is **长风破浪**. This is a well-known Chinese idiom that means \"to ride the long wind and break the waves,\" signifying having great ambition and the courage to overcome all difficulties to reach one's goals.\n\n<<<长风破浪>>>"
