    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The piece is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (a treble clef and a bass clef joined by a brace).\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), shown by the \"C\" symbol.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as â™© = 80, which is a moderate, walking pace (Andante).\n*   **Key Signature and Tonality:** The piece begins with no sharps or flats in the key signature, suggesting C major or A minor. The first chord played by the left hand is an A minor chord (A-C-E), and the opening melody in the right hand is an ascending A natural minor scale (A-B-C-D-E-F-G). This strongly points to A minor as the initial key. However, the piece is filled with accidentals and the key signature changes to three sharps (A major / F# minor) at measure 4, indicating frequent modulation and a complex harmonic language.\n*   **Dynamics and Articulation:** The piece starts softly (`p` - piano) and builds dramatically. There is a sudden jump to loud (`f` - forte) in measure 3. Later, there are markings for `mp` (mezzo-piano) and `mf` (mezzo-forte). The use of staccato dots, accents, and slurs contributes to its character.\n*   **Texture and Rhythm:** The texture varies significantly. It begins with a simple melody over broken chords. At measure 3, it erupts into dense, fast-moving sixteenth-note arpeggios in both hands. This driving sixteenth-note rhythm in the accompaniment becomes a persistent feature, creating a sense of urgency and intensity. The right hand often plays powerful octaves and block chords.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Characteristic Features**\n*   **Opening Motif:** The quiet, ascending A minor scale in the first two measures is a very distinct and ominous opening.\n*   **Dramatic Shift:** The abrupt change in dynamics and texture at measure 3 is a key structural moment. The music transforms from calm and sparse to loud and virtuosic.\n*   **Main Theme/Motif:** Starting at measure 4, a new, powerful melodic idea appears in the right hand (F#-E-D#-E...) over relentless, chromatically shifting chords in the left hand. This rhythmic and melodic pattern is highly memorable.\n*   **Virtuosity:** The piece requires a high level of technical skill, with its rapid arpeggios, large jumps, and complex chordal passages. The flourish at the end of measure 11 is a clear example of its virtuosic character.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesizing the Clues and Identifying the Piece**\nThe combination of a quiet, ominous introduction, a sudden burst of dramatic energy, and a powerful, rhythmically driven main theme is characteristic of epic film or video game music. The specific melodic and harmonic content, particularly the main theme starting at measure 4, is iconic.\n\nThese musical elements are the defining features of **\"One-Winged Angel\"**, the final boss theme from the video game **Final Fantasy VII**, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The excerpt is from a popular and challenging piano arrangement of the orchestral original. The theme beginning at measure 4 is famously associated with the antagonist, Sephiroth.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
