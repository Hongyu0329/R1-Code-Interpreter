    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Elements**\n\n*   **Key and Time Signature:** The music is in 4/4 time. The key signature has no sharps or flats, and the piece begins and ends on a C major chord, indicating the key is C Major.\n*   **Chords:** The chord progressions are typical of early 20th-century jazz and popular music. We see chords like C, G7, E7, F, A- (Am), and D- (Dm). The use of the E7 chord (a secondary dominant) leading to the A- chord is a common harmonic device.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes and swinging rhythms. There are characteristic arpeggiations and chromatic passing tones (like F# and G#), which are hallmarks of jazz improvisation and melody.\n*   **Tempo and Structure:** A tempo marking of \"Mod.\" (Moderato) and a metronome mark of quarter note = 128 is visible. This indicates a moderately fast, danceable tempo. The structure includes repeat signs and navigational markings like \"D.S. to Coda\" (Dal Segno to Coda), which are standard in jazz and popular song forms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\n\nBased on the elements above, the style is a form of jazz. The combination of:\n1.  A string-centric melody (often played on violin or guitar).\n2.  A driving, \"hot\" rhythm.\n3.  Harmonic choices common in the 1930s.\n4.  A repertoire that includes American pop songs of the era.\n...strongly points to **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as **Jazz Manouche** or **Sinti Swing**). This style was pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist St√©phane Grappelli.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title**\n\nTo find the title, we can analyze the main melodic theme, which starts after the first repeat sign.\n*   The first two bars of the theme have the notes: E E F F# | G G G G.\n*   The next two bars are: A A G# G# | G F# F# F.\nThis distinctive melody, combined with the underlying chord progression (`C | C | E7 | E7 | F | F...`), belongs to the song **\"Coquette\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\n\nThis requires looking into the history of both the song and the musical style.\n*   **The Song:** \"Coquette\" was composed in **1928** by Americans Johnny Green and Carmen Lombardo, with lyrics by Gus Kahn. Therefore, the country of origin of the composition itself is the **USA**.\n*   **The Style:** The Gypsy Jazz arrangement, for which this song is famously known, originated in **France** in the 1930s with the Quintette du Hot Club de France.\n\nThe question asks for the country of origin of \"this song\". The most direct answer refers to the origin of the composition.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n*   **Title:** \"Coquette\"\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz / Jazz Manouche\n*   **Country of Origin:** USA\n\n<<<Title: Coquette\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (also known as Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: USA>>>"
