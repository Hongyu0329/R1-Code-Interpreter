    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large orchestra typical of the late Romantic period. The instruments listed are:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten - 2 Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (Erste Hoboe - 1st Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (Erstes Fagott - 1st Bassoon)\n    *   A full string section (`I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.`, `Br.` for Bratsche/Viola, `Celli`).\n*   **Performance Directions:** The score uses German terms:\n    *   `(Vorhang)` means \"Curtain\".\n    *   `(die übrigen)` means \"the rest\".\n    *   `m.D.` is an abbreviation for `mit Dämpfer`, which means \"with mute\".\n*   **Conclusion from Step 1:** The instrumentation and the German language strongly suggest the piece is by a German or Austrian composer from the mid-to-late 19th or early 20th century.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style and Context**\n*   **Harmony and Texture:** The music is highly chromatic, with many accidentals and complex, shifting harmonies. The texture is lush and layered, particularly in the strings, which are divided (`divisi`, indicated by `1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `Solo`, `die übrigen`) and muted (`mit Dämpfer`). This creates a shimmering, atmospheric, and emotionally intense sound world.\n*   **Contextual Clues:** The marking `1 (Vorhang)` indicates this is rehearsal mark 1, the point where the curtain rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act. This music, therefore, sets the scene for Act II. The quiet dynamics (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`) suggest a scene of intimacy, tension, or nocturnal atmosphere, rather than a grand, festive opening.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Key Melodic Motifs**\n*   The most recognizable feature is the melody played by the `1. Pult` of the first violins (`I. Viol.`). The melody begins with a descending and then ascending figure: G-sharp, F-sharp, E-sharp, F-sharp.\n*   This specific melodic shape, combined with the underlying chromatic harmony and the shimmering, muted string sonority, is one of the most famous passages in the operatic repertoire. It is known as the \"Day and Night\" motif or the \"Garden\" music.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   The combination of late-Romantic German style, the specific lush orchestration with muted strings, the highly chromatic harmony, and the iconic melodic motif points directly to the work of Richard Wagner.\n*   Specifically, this music is the beginning of Act II of his opera **Tristan und Isolde**. The turbulent orchestral prelude to Act II concludes, the tempo slows, and this music begins as the curtain rises on a garden at night, where Isolde is waiting impatiently for Tristan's arrival. The music perfectly captures the feeling of longing and nocturnal magic.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe sheet music is the opening of the first scene of Act II of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
