    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the artistic style and basic elements of the scene.**\nThe artwork is a painting on a Greek vase, specifically an Attic red-figure pelike from the Classical period (c. 460-450 BC), attributed to the Niobid Painter. The scene is dynamic and depicts a mythological event involving a chariot. There are three main figures in the central action: a driver in the chariot, a figure being held by the driver, and a figure falling from the chariot to the ground.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key figures using iconographic clues.**\n*   **The Charioteer:** The figure driving the chariot has a large wing, clearly identifying her as a divine being. A winged goddess driving a chariot, often at dawn, is the standard representation of Eos, the Greek goddess of the dawn. She is wearing a patterned sleeve and an ornate headdress, which are sometimes used to denote figures from the East.\n*   **The Abducted Figure:** Eos is holding a figure wrapped in drapery. Eos was famous in mythology for abducting handsome young mortal men. Her most famous lover, and a frequent subject in art, was Kephalos (or Cephalus), an Athenian hunter. Although this figure is heavily draped, it is most likely the beautiful youth Kephalos being abducted.\n*   **The Falling Figure:** A nude male figure is shown falling headfirst from the chariot, suggesting violence or an accident.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the mythological narrative.**\nThe presence of Eos as the winged charioteer strongly indicates that the scene is one of her famous abductions. The most likely story depicted is the **abduction of Kephalos by Eos**. Eos fell in love with the mortal Kephalos and carried him away in her chariot to live with her.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the specific question: \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\"**\nThis question can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  **The figure literally falling from the chariot:** This is the nude male on the ground. In the myth of Eos and Kephalos, there is no specific named character who falls from the chariot. This figure is likely an anonymous companion or a symbolic addition by the artist to add drama to the scene.\n2.  **The main figure who is the subject of the \"leaving\":** The central narrative is the abduction of Kephalos. He is the one being forcibly taken, or \"leaving\" his mortal life and home, by means of the chariot. As the main character of the myth being depicted (alongside Eos), he is the focus of this act of departure.\n\nGiven that Kephalos is the central figure of the myth and the purpose of the chariot's journey, it is most probable that the question refers to him as the figure who is \"leaving\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe scene depicts the goddess Eos abducting the mortal Kephalos. The figure being held in the chariot, who is the subject of the abduction and thus leaving his world, is Kephalos.\n\n<<<Kephalos>>>"
