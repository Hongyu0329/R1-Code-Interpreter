**Product A:** The structure is 5-acetyl-1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-1-(2-(methoxycarbonyl)vinyl)pyrrolidine. This is formed by decarboxylation of the starting material, followed by Michael addition to methyl propiolate, and subsequent C-acetylation at the C5 position of the pyrrolidine ring.
**Structure of A:** A pyrrolidine ring with the following substituents: the nitrogen atom is bonded to a (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) group and a (-CH=CH-COOCH3) group. The C5 carbon of the pyrrolidine ring is bonded to an acetyl group (-COCH3).

**Product B:** The structure is a bicyclic anhydride, 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-d][1,4]oxazepine-5,8-dione. This is formed by the Michael addition of the starting material's nitrogen to methyl propiolate, followed by intramolecular cyclization of the carboxylic acid onto the ester carbonyl, eliminating methanol.
**Structure of B:** A pyrrolidine ring fused to a 7-membered anhydride ring containing a C=C double bond. The nitrogen atom, common to both rings, is also substituted with the (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) group.

**Product C:** The structure is 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride. This is the mixed anhydride formed from the reaction of the starting material's carboxylic acid with acetic anhydride.
**Structure of C:** The starting material in which the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3).
