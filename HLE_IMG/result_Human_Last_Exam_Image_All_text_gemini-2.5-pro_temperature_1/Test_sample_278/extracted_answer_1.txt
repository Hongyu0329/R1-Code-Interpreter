**Morphology:** The image shows a dimorphic fungus presenting with both round-to-oval **budding yeast cells** (blastoconidia) and elongated, filament-like **pseudohyphae**, which are chains of budding cells that have not detached and show constrictions at their junctions.
**Type of Microorganism:** The microorganism is a **Fungus**, specifically a **dimorphic yeast**. The observed morphology is classic for an infection by a *Candida* species, such as *Candida albicans*.
