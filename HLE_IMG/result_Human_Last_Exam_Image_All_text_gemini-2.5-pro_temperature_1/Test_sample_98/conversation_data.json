    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the object's features:** The image shows a circular metal medallion with a suspension loop at the top. It features two busts in profile facing each other. The figure on the left is particularly distinct, with stylized curly hair and prominent ram's horns. The figure on the right is less clear but appears to be a second portrait. The overall artistic style is not purely classical Greek or Roman; it is more schematic and decorative, with strong patterns, particularly in the hair.\n\n2.  **Identify the iconography:** The ram's horns are a crucial clue. In the ancient world, this attribute was associated with the Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon (or Jupiter-Ammon in the Roman pantheon). It was also famously used in portraits of Alexander the Great after he was declared the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Siwa Oasis oracle. The format of two confronting busts is also known from Roman imperial art, often depicting a royal or imperial couple.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artifact:** This specific medallion is a well-known archaeological find. It is the central decorative element from a large gold dish, or patera, which is part of the **Pietroasele Treasure** (also known as the Pietroasa Treasure). This treasure was discovered in Romania in 1837. The original patera was broken by its finder, but this central medallion survived.\n\n4.  **Determine the archaeological context and dating:** The Pietroasele Treasure is a hoard of gold objects attributed to the **Goths**, a Germanic people who lived north of the Danube River and interacted with the Late Roman Empire. The style of the objects combines Roman motifs and craftsmanship with Germanic artistic tastes. This period is known as the Migration Period. Archaeologists have extensively studied the treasure and, based on its style, craftsmanship, and historical context, have dated it to the **late 4th century AD**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the information to answer the question:** The medallion is from the Pietroasele Treasure. The treasure is dated by archaeologists to the late 4th century AD. Therefore, the century ascribed to this medallion is the 4th century AD.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
