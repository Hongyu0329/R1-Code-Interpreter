    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   A quick search for \"awards ceremony June 20 2019\" reveals that the NHL Awards ceremony took place on this date in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. On that night, he won several major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy for league MVP.\n*   So, the image depicts Nikita Kucherov, an ice hockey player, at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical context. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the process of \"carroting,\" which turned animal fur into felt for making high-quality hats.\n*   The workers who performed this job were called **hatters**.\n*   Chronic exposure to the mercury vapors caused a neurological disorder known as erethism, or \"mad hatter disease.\" Symptoms included tremors, irritability, and mental instability.\n*   Due to the high toxicity, the use of mercury in the felting industry was eventually discontinued. Thus, the traditional mercury-using **hatter** is a profession that has largely ceased to exist in that form.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   From Step 2, we identified \"X Y\" as **Hatter**. Now we must see if this fits the first clue.\n*   How does \"Hatter\" relate to the image of Nikita Kucherov?\n*   In ice hockey, when a player scores three goals in a single game, it is called a **hat-trick**.\n*   A player who is skilled at scoring and frequently achieves this feat could be colloquially or metaphorically referred to as a **hatter**. Nikita Kucherov is an elite goal-scorer known for scoring hat-tricks.\n*   Therefore, the picture shows a \"hatter\" (in the hockey sense) being celebrated for his excellent season.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n*   The term \"Hatter\" successfully links both clues.\n*   Clue 1: A hatter (a hockey player who scores hat-tricks, represented by Nikita Kucherov) is pictured.\n*   Clue 2: Another hatter (a person who makes hats) is a profession whose traditional methods involving mercury salts are no longer in use due to toxicity.\n*   The word that fits both descriptions is \"Hatter\".\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
