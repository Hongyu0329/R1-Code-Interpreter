    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Request**\n    The objective is to find the full name of the artist who created the painting shown in the image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the Image for Clues**\n    The primary clue for identifying an artist is usually their signature on the artwork. I will scan the image, particularly the corners, to locate a signature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locate and Decipher the Signature**\n    In the bottom right-hand corner of the painting, a signature is visible. The provided cropped images help to see this area more clearly. The signature reads \"Picasso\" followed by the number \"38\". This indicates the artist's last name is Picasso and the work was likely completed in the year 1938.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the Artist**\n    The surname \"Picasso\" is strongly associated with the world-renowned Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The style of the watercolor, a landscape from 1938, is also consistent with his work during the time he spent in the south of France (e.g., Mougins).\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the Full Name**\n    The question asks for the artist's \"full name\". While he is universally known as Pablo Picasso, his full birth name is Pablo Ruiz Picasso. This is the more complete and formal name.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Verification**\n    A quick search for \"Picasso landscape watercolor 1938\" confirms that this piece is indeed by Pablo Picasso. It is often titled \"Paysage de Mougins\" (Landscape of Mougins). This confirms the artist's identity.\n\n<<<Pablo Ruiz Picasso>>>"
