    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT from the Baseline to the Proposed scenario.\n**Formula:** Percentage Reduction = [(VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline] * 100%\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question is about Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles the car itself travels, regardless of the number of occupants. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Total Car Share:** For each distance category, the total car mode share is the sum of the share for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a weighted sum. We must calculate the VMT for each distance category separately and then add them together. The \"share of total trips\" for each distance category serves as the weighting factor.\n\n---\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Car Mode Share for Each Scenario**\n\nFirst, we determine the total percentage of trips made by car in each distance category for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n**Baseline (Table 1):**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = **53%**\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = **81%**\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = **85%**\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = **89%**\n\n**Proposed (Table 2):**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = **3%**\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = **27%**\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = **41%**\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = **49%**\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Weighted VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nWe calculate a representative VMT value by multiplying the share of trips, average distance, and car mode share for each distance category, then summing the results.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 1 (avg miles) × 0.53 (car share) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (share of trips) × 4 (avg miles) × 0.81 (car share) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (share of trips) × 7.5 (avg miles) × 0.85 (car share) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (share of trips) × 20 (avg miles) × 0.89 (car share) = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT (VMT_B) =** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Weighted VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data for the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 1 (avg miles) × 0.03 (car share) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (share of trips) × 4 (avg miles) × 0.27 (car share) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (share of trips) × 7.5 (avg miles) × 0.41 (car share) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (share of trips) × 20 (avg miles) × 0.49 (car share) = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT (VMT_P) =** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n---\n**Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nNow, we use the total weighted VMT values to find the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** VMT_B - VMT_P = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (VMT Reduction / VMT_B) × 100%\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction in Car VMT is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
