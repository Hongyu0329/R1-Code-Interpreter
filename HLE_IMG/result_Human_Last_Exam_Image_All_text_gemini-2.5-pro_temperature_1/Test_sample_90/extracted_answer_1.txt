(A more precise representation shows the dihydropyrrolizine core, which is a 5/5 fused ring system, with the N-acetyl-pyrroline substituent on the bridgehead nitrogen).
 

**Product B:**
B is a complex tetracyclic product formed from rearrangement and oxidation of the initial unacetylated cycloadduct. A plausible structure fitting the spectral data is a derivative of a pyrrolo[1',2':1,2]azepino[3,4-b]indole-dione scaffold, simplified here as a tetracyclic lactam.
 

**Product C:**
C is 1-(1-acetyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
