    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the function does nothing, as a single-element (or empty) array is already sorted. This is the `if n > 1:` check.\n    -   **Recursive Step (`n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the current sub-array (`a[n-1]`) with the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`). Note that after `sort(a, n-1)` has run, `a[n-2]` should hold the largest value among the first `n-1` elements.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it means the `n`-th element is smaller than the largest of the preceding elements. It swaps them. This swap might disrupt the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the potential disruption caused by the swap, it makes a *second* recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements again.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n    -   The cost of the comparison and swap operations is constant, let's denote it as `c`.\n    -   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    -   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. It also takes `T(n-1)` time, but only if the `if` condition is met.\n    -   Therefore, the recurrence relation can be expressed as:\n        -   `T(n) = T(n-1) + c` (Best case: the `if` condition is never true)\n        -   `T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1) = 2T(n-1) + c` (Worst case: the `if` condition is always true)\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    To find the worst-case time complexity, we need to find an input that makes the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` true at every step of the recursion.\n    -   Let's consider an array sorted in reverse (descending) order, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`.\n    -   `sort(a, 3)` where `a = [3, 2, 1]`:\n        -   Calls `sort(a, 2)`. This sorts `a[0...1]` from `[3, 2]` to `[2, 3]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.\n        -   Now, back in `sort(a, 3)`, it checks `if a[2] < a[1]` which is `if 1 < 3`. This is true.\n        -   It swaps `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n        -   It makes the second call to `sort(a, 2)`. This will sort `a[0...1]` from `[2, 1]` to `[1, 2]`. The final array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.\n    -   In this example, the `if` condition was met, forcing the second recursive call. This pattern holds for any reverse-sorted input, making it the worst-case scenario.\n\n4.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    The recurrence relation for the worst case is:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    with a base case `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n    Let's expand this relation:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    `= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    `= 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    ...\n    `= 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    Let `k = n-1`, so `n-k = 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n    The sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 1)` is a geometric series equal to `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm does terminate. Each recursive call is on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), which will eventually reach the base case `n <= 1`.\n*   **Best Case:** For an already sorted array, the `if` condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` will always be false. The recurrence becomes `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n*   **Worst Case:** For a reverse-sorted array, the `if` condition is consistently met, leading to two recursive calls at each step. This is the key to the exponential complexity.\n*   **Comparison to Standard Algorithms:** This algorithm is highly inefficient compared to standard sorting algorithms. Simple ones like Bubble Sort are `O(n^2)`, and efficient ones like Merge Sort are `O(n log n)`. The `O(2^n)` complexity makes this algorithm impractical for all but the smallest inputs.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe worst-case time complexity is determined by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
