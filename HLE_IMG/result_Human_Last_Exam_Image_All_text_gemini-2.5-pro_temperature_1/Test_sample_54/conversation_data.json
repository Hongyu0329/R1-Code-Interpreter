    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2.**\n\n1.  **Identify the structures:**\n    *   Compound 1 is a polycyclic aromatic cation. Although the prompt text gives a name that corresponds to a different structure (`tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate`), we will analyze the structures as drawn in the image. Structure 1 contains a fused ring system with three ether-like oxygen atoms integrated into the periphery and a central positive charge. The core resembles a trioxatriangulenium (TOTA+) cation derivative. These are a class of pyrylium-like salts.\n    *   Compound 2 is structurally very similar to compound 1, but one of the oxygen atoms in the polycyclic framework has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom is further substituted with an amino group (-NH2), forming an N-amino group (`>N-NH2`). The rest of the molecule, including the positive charge and the tetrafluoroborate counterion, remains the same.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:**\n    *   The reaction involves the replacement of an oxygen atom in a heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen-containing group. This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts (or their polycyclic analogues like compound 1). Pyrylium salts react with primary amines (R-NH2) to form the corresponding pyridinium salts, where the ring oxygen is replaced by `>N-R`.\n\n3.  **Identify Reagent A:**\n    *   The product 2 contains an N-amino group (`>N-NH2`). To form such a group from a pyrylium-like salt, the nucleophilic amine required is hydrazine (H2N-NH2).\n    *   The reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of hydrazine on the electrophilic ring, followed by ring opening and ring closure to expel the oxygen atom and form the new nitrogen-containing heterocycle.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A must be **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3.**\n\n1.  **Identify the structures:**\n    *   Compound 2 is the N-amino quinacridinium derivative formed in the first step. The key functional group for this reaction is the `>N-NH2` group.\n    *   Compound 3 is the final product. It has the same core polycyclic quinacridinium structure as compound 2. The difference is that the `>N-NH2` group has been replaced by an N-propyl group (`>N-CH2CH2CH3`).\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:**\n    *   The overall transformation is the conversion of an N-amino group to an N-alkyl group: `>N-NH2` -> `>N-CH2CH2CH3`. This reaction requires a source for the propyl group and a mechanism to remove the terminal `-NH2` moiety.\n\n3.  **Identify Reagent B:**\n    *   The propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`) can be introduced from several sources, but a common method in heterocyclic chemistry involves using an aldehyde. The required aldehyde would be **propanal (CH3CH2CHO)**.\n    *   The mechanism for this transformation is as follows:\n        a.  The N-amino group of compound 2 reacts with propanal to form a hydrazone intermediate.\n            `R-N-NH2 + O=CH-CH2CH3` -> `R-N-N=CH-CH2CH3` + H2O\n        b.  The hydrazone can then undergo a specific rearrangement and decomposition sequence, often promoted by heat or base, that results in the cleavage of the N-N bond and the formation of the N-alkyl product, with the loss of nitrogen gas (N2). This type of reaction is a known method for the N-alkylation of N-amino azaheterocycles.\n    *   An alternative reagent might be a propyl halide (e.g., propyl bromide). However, alkylation would likely occur on the terminal nitrogen, and a separate step would be needed to cleave the N-N bond, making it less likely for a single-step transformation denoted by \"B\". The reaction with an aldehyde provides a more direct, albeit complex, path to the final product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**, which converts the pyrylium-like salt (1) into an N-amino derivative (2).\n*   **Reagent B** is **propanal (CH3CH2CHO)**, which reacts with the N-amino derivative (2) to form the N-propyl product (3).\n\nFinal answer should list reagents A and B.\nA: H2N-NH2 (hydrazine)\nB: CH3CH2CHO (propanal)\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and B is propanal (CH3CH2CHO).>>>"
