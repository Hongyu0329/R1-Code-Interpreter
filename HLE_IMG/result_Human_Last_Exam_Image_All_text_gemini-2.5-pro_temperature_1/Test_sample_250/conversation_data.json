    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key is either A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The first chord of the piece is F- (F minor), and the piece ends on an F chord (likely F minor, though the final chord is just labeled 'F'). This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n*   The time signature is common time (4/4), as indicated by the 'C' symbol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   Let's examine the first few notes of the melody in the key of F minor.\n*   The first note is a C (the 5th of the F minor scale).\n*   The melody in the first measure is C (held for a beat and a half) followed by A♭ (the 3rd).\n*   The second measure contains the notes G (the 2nd) and F (the tonic).\n*   So, the opening melodic phrase is C - A♭ - G - F. This is a very distinctive and famous melodic line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   Let's look at the chord changes in the first few bars:\n    *   Bar 1: F-\n    *   Bar 2: E-7♭5 (also known as E half-diminished)\n    *   Bar 3: E♭-6\n    *   Bar 4: D♭maj7 - G7\n*   This progression features a descending chromatic bass line: F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭. This is a classic harmonic device.\n*   Later in the piece (the B section or bridge), we see a standard ii-V-I progression:\n    *   Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | ...\n*   This is a ii-V-I in A♭ major, the relative major key of F minor. This is a very common structure for the bridge of a jazz standard.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\n*   The combination of the opening melody (C - A♭ - G - F in F minor), the descending chromatic harmony in the A section, and the ii-V-I bridge in the relative major are all hallmark characteristics of the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   The music for the song \"Yesterdays\" was written by the renowned American composer **Jerome Kern**. The lyrics were written by Otto Harbach. The song was written for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the melody and harmony, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\", composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
