    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic structural features.**\n*   **Ring System:** The molecule has a complex, fused ring system. Counting the rings reveals it is a tetracyclic compound (it contains four fused rings). All four rings are six-membered.\n*   **Heteroatoms:** The structure contains two nitrogen (N) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom, in addition to carbon and hydrogen. The presence of nitrogen in a cyclic system, typically of natural origin, confirms it is an alkaloid.\n*   **Functional Groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is part of a six-membered ring and is adjacent to a nitrogen atom. A functional group with a carbonyl bonded to a nitrogen is an amide. When this group is part of a ring, it is called a lactam.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core alkaloid skeleton.**\n*   The overall tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids.\n*   If we were to mentally remove the oxygen atom and reduce the C=O group to a CH2 group, the resulting parent skeleton would be that of **sparteine**. Sparteine is a well-known tetracyclic bis-quinolizidine alkaloid.\n*   Therefore, the given compound is an oxo-derivative of sparteine.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific compound.**\n*   The presence of the lactam group on the sparteine skeleton points to a specific compound. The most common and well-known oxo-sparteine with this structure is **lupanine**.\n*   Lupanine (C15H24N2O) is a major alkaloid found in the seeds of various plants in the genus *Lupinus* (lupins).\n*   The stereochemistry shown in the diagram, with the specific arrangement of atoms at the chiral centers (indicated by wedges and dashes), corresponds to the naturally occurring isomer of lupanine.\n\n**Step 4: Differentiate from other similar alkaloids.**\n*   **Sparteine:** Lacks the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Matrine:** Another tetracyclic alkaloid with a lactam group, but it has a different ring fusion pattern.\n*   **Cytisine:** A tricyclic (three-ring) alkaloid.\n*   **Anagyrine:** Similar to lupanine but has a double bond in the lactam ring, making it a pyridone ring instead of a piperidone ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the tetracyclic sparteine skeleton and the presence of a lactam functional group, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Recognize the Lactam:** The C=O group next to a ring nitrogen is a key feature.\n2.  **Identify the Parent Skeleton:** Recognizing the underlying sparteine structure is crucial for classification.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The specific 3D arrangement of the atoms is important. The drawing represents a single, specific stereoisomer, which is lupanine.\n4.  **Common vs. Systematic Name:** For complex natural products like this, the common name (\"lupanine\") is almost always used instead of the very long and complicated IUPAC systematic name.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
