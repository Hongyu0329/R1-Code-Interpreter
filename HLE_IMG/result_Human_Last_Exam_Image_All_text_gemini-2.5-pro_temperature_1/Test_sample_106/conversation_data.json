    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reaction type**\nThe starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It reacts with catalytic acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 Â°C). The product is an alkene, and water is eliminated. This indicates an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. The significant difference between the carbon skeleton of the starting material and the product (in terms of methyl group positions) suggests that the reaction involves a complex carbocation rearrangement, specifically a Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement involving a series of [1,2] shifts.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the reaction mechanism**\n\n1.  **Formation of the initial carbocation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 is protonated by the acid catalyst, forming a good leaving group (-OH2+). This group departs as a water molecule, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n2.  **Carbocation rearrangement cascade:** The secondary carbocation at C-3 is relatively unstable and will rearrange to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This occurs via a cascade of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts along the \"backbone\" of the molecule. The driving force is the formation of a thermodynamically stable final product, which in this case is a tetrasubstituted alkene.\n\n    *   The problem specifies that the product has the chemical formula C30H50, and the structure shows a tetrasubstituted double bond. Let's trace the shifts that lead to this product.\n    *   The gem-dimethyl group at C-4 (where substituent 1 is located) appears unchanged in the product. This implies that the methyl groups at C-4 do not participate in the rearrangement.\n    *   A plausible reaction cascade that preserves the C-4 gem-dimethyl group starts with a [1,2]-hydride shift from C-2 to C-3, forming a carbocation at C-2. Although this is a secondary -> secondary carbocation shift, it is the necessary initiation for the subsequent favorable shifts.\n    *   The cascade proceeds as follows:\n        a. **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-10 migrates to C-2. This forms a stable tertiary carbocation at C-10.\n        b. **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen from C-9 migrates to C-10, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-9.\n        c. **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-8 migrates to C-9, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-8.\n        d. **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-14.\n        e. **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen from C-13 migrates to C-14, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-13.\n\n3.  **Elimination to form the final product:** The cascade terminates with the carbocation at C-13. A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-18. This elimination step (E1) forms the final, stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**\nBy tracking the movement of the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups during the rearrangement cascade, we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** This position is on one of the two methyl groups at C-4. As established, this gem-dimethyl group does not participate in the rearrangement. Therefore, the substituent remains a methyl group. **1 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):** The original methyl group at C-10 migrates away (to C-2). The hydrogen atom from C-9 migrates to C-10. Thus, the substituent at position 2 in the product is a hydrogen atom. **2 = H**.\n*   **Position 3 (on C-8):** The original methyl group at C-8 migrates away (to C-9). The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8. Thus, the substituent at position 3 in the product is a methyl group. **3 = CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (on C-14):** The original methyl group at C-14 migrates away (to C-8). The hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to C-14. Thus, the substituent at position 4 in the product is a hydrogen atom. **4 = H**.\n*   **Position 5 (on C-13):** The original hydrogen atom at C-13 migrates away (to C-14). The carbon at C-13 then becomes a carbocation, and finally becomes an sp2-hybridized carbon atom in the C=C double bond. In the final product, this carbon has no H or CH3 substituent. However, the question requires an answer of H or CH3. The group that was originally at this position and migrated away was a hydrogen atom. This is the most logical interpretation of the ambiguous question for this position. **5 = H**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = H\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
