    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Style and Subject:** The image shows a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame (a tondo). The style of the figures, with their classical grace, drapery, and emotional restraint, is characteristic of the Italian Early Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century. The scene depicts a Christian sacrament: a priest is giving the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to kneeling communicants, including a child.\n2.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a visible inscription. Although partially obscured, the words \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" can be discerned. This can be translated from an archaic form of Italian/French as \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which confirms the subject matter is the Eucharist.\n3.  **Identify the Medium:** The sculpture has a smooth, slightly glossy finish, which is highly characteristic of glazed terracotta. This specific medium was pioneered and perfected by a particular Florentine workshop.\n4.  **Connect the Clues:** The combination of the Florentine Renaissance style, the use of glazed terracotta for a religious relief, and the specific subject of a sacrament points directly to the workshop of the Della Robbia family. The founder of this dynasty, Luca della Robbia, was particularly famous for these works.\n5.  **Identify the Specific Artwork and Artist:** A search for \"Luca della Robbia sacraments\" or \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" leads to the \"Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament\" (Tabernacolo del Sacramento). This work, created around 1441-1443 for the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, Florence (now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence), features several roundels depicting the Seven Sacraments. The image provided is a detail showing the roundel of the Eucharist from this very altarpiece. This specific masterpiece is firmly attributed to the master sculptor **Luca della Robbia**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing Artists:** It is important to distinguish Luca della Robbia (c. 1400â€“1482) from his nephew Andrea della Robbia and other family members who continued the workshop. While their styles are similar, this particular tabernacle is a well-documented and celebrated work by Luca himself.\n*   **Reading the Inscription:** The archaic language of the inscription is a key clue that helps confirm the artwork's subject and period.\n*   **Recognizing the Medium:** Identifying the medium as glazed terracotta is a crucial step that narrows down the potential artists significantly to the Della Robbia school.\n*   **Context of the Altarpiece:** Understanding that this roundel is a detail from a larger altarpiece (a tabernacle) dedicated to the sacraments is essential for a precise identification.\n\nBased on this analysis, the author of this detail of the altarpiece is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
