    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Key Signature:** The question asks for the Roman numeral analysis of measure 30. The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This corresponds to the key of C minor, which is the home key of the sonata.\n\n2.  **Divide the Measure for Analysis:** In measure 30, the harmony in the left hand changes halfway through. The left hand plays a G octave for the first two beats and a C octave for the last two beats. This indicates a change in harmony, so we should analyze the two halves of the measure separately.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Half (Beats 1-2):**\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays a G octave. This establishes G as the root of the chord.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays fast sixteenth notes. The principal notes on beat 1 are B-natural and G. The F-sharp is a chromatic lower neighbor to the G.\n    *   **Combined Harmony:** The notes G, B-natural, and D (implied from the G chord and the preceding harmony) form a G major triad.\n    *   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of C minor, a G major chord is the dominant. The B-natural is the raised leading tone, which is standard for a dominant chord in a minor key. Therefore, the Roman numeral is **V**. This chord also serves as the resolution of the V7/V (D7 chord) from the previous measure (m. 29).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Half (Beats 3-4):**\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays a C octave. This establishes C as the root of the chord.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Continues with complex passagework. However, to understand the function, we must look at the context. Measure 31 begins with an F minor chord, which is the subdominant (iv) in C minor.\n    *   **Functional Analysis:** The chord in the second half of measure 30 functions to lead into the F minor chord of measure 31. The dominant of F minor is C major (or C dominant 7th). The notes in the right hand, despite their complexity and variations across different editions (the E-natural on beat 2 is a strong clue), serve to outline this C major harmony.\n    *   **Combined Harmony:** The notes C (in the bass) and E-natural and G (in the right hand) form a C major triad.\n    *   **Roman Numeral:** A C major chord in the key of C minor that functions as the dominant of the subdominant (iv) is called a secondary dominant (or applied dominant). Its Roman numeral is written as V of iv, or **V/iv**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Measure 30 contains a clear harmonic progression: the dominant chord (V) moves to a secondary dominant chord (V/iv).\n    *   The question asks for \"the\" correct Roman numeral, which is ambiguous for a measure with two chords. However, the most significant harmonic event in this measure is the introduction of the V/iv. This chord introduces new chromaticism (the E-natural) and is the engine that drives the harmony forward into the subdominant area in the next measure. The V chord is more of a temporary arrival point from measure 29. Therefore, the most functionally descriptive answer for the measure's purpose is the secondary dominant.\n\n<<<V/iv>>>"
