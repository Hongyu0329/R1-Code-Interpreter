    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC crystal has atoms at the eight corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces. The key atomic positions in fractional coordinates within the conventional unit cell are (0,0,0) [corner], (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2) [face centers]. All other atom positions can be generated from these by lattice translations.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction and the Resulting Projection**\nViewing a crystal structure along a specific direction, like [110], means projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction. The plane perpendicular to the [110] direction is the (110) plane.\n\nThe key result from crystallography for an FCC lattice is:\n*   The projection of the FCC lattice onto the (110) plane results in a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n*   The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1 -1 0] crystal directions.\n*   If the cubic lattice constant is 'a', the side lengths of the projected rectangular unit cell are 'a' and 'a√2'. The ratio of the sides is √2 : 1 ≈ 1.414 : 1.\n*   The pattern consists of atoms at the corners of this rectangle and one atom in the exact center of the rectangle.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Four Given Images**\nWe need to examine the pattern of atoms projected onto the front plane of the box in each image and see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** The atoms, when projected onto the front plane, form a simple rectangular grid (specifically, a 2x3 grid of points). There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This pattern is not a centered rectangle. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** The projected pattern of atoms appears irregular and does not form a recognizable, repeating lattice structure like a centered rectangle. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** The projected pattern of atoms has a six-fold rotational symmetry, resembling a hexagon. A hexagonal projection is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction, not the [110] direction. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** Let's analyze the projection of the atoms onto the front plane.\n    *   There are atoms that form the corners of a rectangle. For instance, atoms at coordinates (approximately) (0,6), (6,6), (0,12), and (6,12).\n    *   There is an atom located at (approximately) (3,9), which is precisely in the center of the rectangle formed by the corner atoms.\n    *   This arrangement constitutes a **centered rectangular pattern**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The rectangle in image D appears to be a square (sides are both 6 units long, ratio 1:1), whereas the theoretical projection for [110] has a side ratio of √2:1. However, in schematic diagrams of crystal structures, aspect ratios are often not drawn to perfect scale. The crucial feature is the *topology* of the pattern—the presence of atoms at both the corners and the center of the rectangle. Image D is the only one that exhibits this correct topology. The other atoms (in the \"back\" of the box) represent the next layer in the stacking sequence, which further confirms a periodic crystal structure consistent with the FCC lattice.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the topological analysis of the projected patterns:\n*   A is a simple rectangle.\n*   B is irregular.\n*   C is hexagonal.\n*   D is a centered rectangle.\n\nThe theoretically predicted pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction is a centered rectangle. Therefore, image D is the correct representation, despite the minor inaccuracy in the aspect ratio of the rectangle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
