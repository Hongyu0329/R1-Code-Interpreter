    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup\nThe objective is to identify all unique mRNA splice species based on the results of several RT-PCR experiments.\n*   **Genome Map (A):** Shows the layout of genes (E1, E2, E4, etc.) on a 7,857 bp genome.\n*   **Primers:** Different primer pairs are used to amplify specific regions of the transcribed mRNA.\n*   **Splice-Specific Primers:** The primers E1F2 and E1F3 are crucial as they are designed to only amplify transcripts containing specific splice junctions:\n    *   **E1F2:** Detects the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   **E1F3:** Detects the 929^3506 splice.\n*   **General Primer:** E1F1 is a general forward primer in the E1 region, upstream of the splice sites, which can theoretically amplify all transcripts originating from that promoter.\n*   **Gel Panels (B-I):** Each panel shows the PCR products for a given primer pair. Different bands represent different sized products, indicating different splice variants.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Evidence for Splice Species Systematically\n\nWe can identify groups of splice species based on the specific evidence from each PCR reaction.\n\n**Analysis Group 1: Species detected with the general E1F1 primer**\n*   **Panels B (E1F1/E4R), C (E1F1/E5R), and H/I (E1F1/L1R):** These panels consistently show a pair of bands whose sizes differ by 31 bp (190 vs 159 bp; 584 vs 553 bp; 450 vs 419 bp).\n*   **Conclusion:** This indicates the existence of two related splice species that differ by the inclusion or exclusion of a 31 bp sequence. Let's call them **Species 1** and **Species 2**.\n\n**Analysis Group 2: Species detected with the E1F2 splice-specific primer**\n*   **Panels D (E1F2/E5R) and F (E1F2/L2R):** These experiments use the E1F2 primer, which is specific for the 929^3465 splice junction. Both panels show only a single band (551 bp in D, 972 bp in F).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies a single, unique splice species containing the 929^3465 splice. Let's call this **Species 3**.\n\n**Analysis Group 3: Species detected with the E1F3 splice-specific primer**\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This experiment uses the E1F3 primer, specific for the 929^3506 splice junction. It shows two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp).\n*   **Conclusion:** This identifies two different splice species that both share the 929^3506 splice but differ in their downstream structure. Let's call them **Species 4** and **Species 5**.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidate Findings and Check for Overlaps\n\nNow we have a preliminary count of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 species. We must check if these groups are truly distinct.\n\n*   Are Species 1 and 2 (the 31 bp pair) the same as any of Species 3, 4, or 5?\n    *   If they had the 929^3465 splice (like Species 3), the E1F2-specific reactions (Panels D and F) would have shown two bands with a 31 bp difference, but they only show one. So, they are not Species 3.\n    *   If they had the 929^3506 splice (like Species 4 and 5), the E1F3-specific reaction (Panel G) should show a pair of bands with a 31 bp difference. It does not; the bands differ by 72 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Species 1 and 2 represent a distinct splice pattern that does not involve the 929^3465 or 929^3506 junctions.\n\n*   Are Species 3, 4, and 5 distinct from each other?\n    *   Species 3 is defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   Species 4 and 5 are defined by the 929^3506 splice. They are distinct from Species 3.\n    *   Species 4 and 5 are distinct from each other because they produce different sized products (1003 bp vs 931 bp) with the same primer pair in Panel G.\n\n*   **Final Tally:** Based on this systematic analysis, the evidence points to 5 distinct splice species.\n\n### Step 4: Reconcile with All Data\nThe analysis so far identifies 5 species. We must check this against Panel I, which is the most sensitive general assay (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles).\n*   **Panel I shows 4 bands:** 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp.\n*   **The Problem:** Our analysis points to 5 species, but this experiment shows only 4 products.\n*   **Explanation:** The general E1F1 primer should amplify all 5 species. The bands at 450 bp and 419 bp correspond to Species 1 and 2. The remaining three species (Species 3, 4, and 5) must therefore correspond to the remaining two bands (378 bp and 187 bp). This is only possible if two of these three species produce PCR products of the same size in this specific reaction, causing their bands to co-migrate and appear as one.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nDespite Panel I showing only 4 bands, the combined evidence from the splice-junction-specific primers (E1F2 and E1F3) and the characteristic 31 bp size difference seen with the general E1F1 primer logically requires the existence of 5 distinct splice species. The discrepancy in band number in Panel I is best explained by the co-migration of products from two different species.\n\nThe identified species are:\n1.  A species with a backbone different from the others, including a 31 bp element.\n2.  The same species as #1, but lacking the 31 bp element.\n3.  A species defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n4.  A species defined by the 929^3506 splice (longer version).\n5.  A species defined by the 929^3506 splice (shorter version).\n\nTotal number of splice species found is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
