    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry is a property a shape or pattern has when it looks the same after being rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees around a central point. The \"order\" of the rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches itself during a full 360-degree rotation. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation in the Tiling**\nTo find the rotational symmetry of the entire tiling, we need to find a point around which the entire pattern, not just a single tile, can be rotated and remain unchanged. We can look for prominent, repeating motifs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Motif Centered on a Blue Hexagon**\n1.  **Locate a central point:** A clear, repeating motif is the star-like shape formed around each dark blue hexagon. Let's choose the center of one of these blue hexagons as our potential center of rotation.\n2.  **Examine the immediate surroundings:** The blue hexagon is a regular hexagon, which itself has 6-fold symmetry. It is surrounded by six identical tan, pentagon-like shapes.\n3.  **Perform a test rotation:** Imagine rotating the entire tiling by 60 degrees (which is 360° / 6) around the center of the blue hexagon.\n    *   The central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n    *   Each of the six surrounding tan shapes moves into the position of its neighbor.\n    *   The six orange rhombi located slightly further out also rotate into the positions of their neighbors.\n    *   Looking at the entire pattern, every shape in the tiling lands on top of an identical shape after a 60° rotation.\n4.  **Conclusion for this center:** Since the tiling is identical after a 60° rotation, it has at least 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Other Potential Centers (for completeness)**\n1.  **Center of a tan square:** If we pick the center of one of the tan squares, we can see it is surrounded by four orange rhombi and four of the tan pentagon-like shapes. Rotating the tiling by 90° (360° / 4) around this point also leaves the entire pattern unchanged. This means the tiling also has centers of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Other centers:** The tiling also possesses centers of 3-fold and 2-fold rotation at other locations (e.g., at certain vertices where tiles meet).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nWhen a pattern has multiple orders of rotational symmetry (like 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold), \"the rotational symmetry\" of the tiling is defined by the highest order present. This highest order dictates the overall symmetry classification of the pattern.\n\nIn this case, we have identified centers of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest order among these is 6.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry because it can be rotated by 60 degrees (360/6) about the center of any of the blue hexagons and appear unchanged. This is the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n<<<6>>>"
