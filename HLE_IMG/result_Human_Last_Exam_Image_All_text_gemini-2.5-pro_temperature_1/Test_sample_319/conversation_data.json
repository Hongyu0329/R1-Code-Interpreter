    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots representing an audio signal over time.\n    *   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This shows the frequency content of the sound over time. We see a persistent horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle, this tone is interrupted by a vertical blur. This vertical blur signifies a short burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, characteristic of noise (like a cough, static, or a door slam). Critically, the horizontal line of the tone appears to be continuous *through* the noise burst, which is a key visual clue to the perceptual experience.\n    *   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. We see a clean, regular sine wave on the left, which corresponds to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes highly irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the burst of noise. After the noise, the clean sine wave returns. This plot represents the *physical* reality of the sound: the tone *stops* when the noise begins and resumes after the noise ends.\n\n2.  **Identify the Discrepancy:** There is a conflict between what is physically present (the tone is interrupted, as shown in the waveform) and what is often perceived by a listener (the tone continues without interruption *behind* the noise, as suggested by the spectrogram). This discrepancy is the basis of a perceptual illusion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   \"...an illusion...\": This confirms our observation from Step 2.\n    *   \"...similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\": The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain resolves an ambiguous 2D drawing into one of two possible 3D cubes. This comparison suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain \"filling in\" missing information or resolving ambiguity to create a complete, coherent perception.\n    *   \"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\": This points to a fundamental brain mechanism that helps us make sense of our environment. A prime example is understanding speech in a noisy room, where our brains must perceptually restore parts of words that are obscured by other sounds.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Name the Phenomenon:** The illusion where the brain perceptually restores a missing sound that has been replaced by another sound (typically noise) is known as the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Although the term \"phonemic\" specifically refers to speech sounds, it is also commonly used to describe this effect with non-speech sounds like pure tones, as it was the context in which it was famously discovered and studied by Richard M. Warren. The more general scientific term is the \"auditory continuity illusion\" or \"temporal induction,\" but the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most widely recognized name for this specific type of auditory completion. This ability is crucial for auditory scene analysis, allowing us to perceive continuous streams of sound (like speech or music) even when they are momentarily masked by other noises.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing Perception from Reality:** The core of the problem is to understand that the image depicts the stimulus for an illusion, and the question asks about the resulting perceptual phenomenon. The waveform shows the physical stimulus, while the spectrogram visually hints at the perceived continuity.\n*   **The Necker Cube Analogy:** This clue is not about having two alternate perceptions (bistability) but about the brain's active role in constructing a stable perception from incomplete or ambiguous sensory data.\n*   **Generality of the Term:** While the image uses a simple tone, the phenomenon's name, \"Phonemic Restoration,\" comes from its critical role in speech perception, which aligns with the clue about a \"common... perceptual ability.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image and description point directly to the auditory illusion where the brain fills in a missing sound that is masked by noise. This phenomenon is most famously known as the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
