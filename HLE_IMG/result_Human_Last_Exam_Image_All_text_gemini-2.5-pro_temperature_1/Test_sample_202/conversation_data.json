    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**General Principles for Rock Identification**\n\nTo identify these rocks, we will observe key characteristics for each specimen:\n1.  **Texture:** This refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or particles. Key textures include:\n    *   **Phaneritic (coarse-grained):** Individual crystals are visible to the naked eye. This indicates slow cooling, typical of intrusive igneous rocks.\n    *   **Aphanitic (fine-grained):** Crystals are too small to be seen without a microscope. This indicates rapid cooling, typical of extrusive igneous rocks.\n    *   **Vesicular:** Contains holes (vesicles) created by trapped gas bubbles during rapid cooling. Common in extrusive igneous rocks.\n    *   **Clastic:** Composed of fragments (clasts) of other rocks cemented together. Common in sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks.\n2.  **Composition (inferred from color):**\n    *   **Felsic:** Light-colored (white, pink, light gray), rich in silica, quartz, and feldspar.\n    *   **Mafic:** Dark-colored (black, dark green, reddish-brown), rich in magnesium and iron.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Specimen**\n\n**Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, bubbly appearance. It is covered in many visible holes (vesicles). The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Careful Points:** The high number of vesicles indicates it formed from gas-rich lava that cooled quickly at the Earth's surface (extrusive). The reddish-brown color suggests a mafic or intermediate composition with oxidized iron.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Scoria**. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock characterized by its high vesicularity and typically dark or reddish color. It is essentially a frothy volcanic crust.\n\n**Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is very light in color (white to light gray). Like specimen H, it is highly vesicular, giving it a frothy or spongy texture. It appears to be low in density.\n*   **Careful Points:** The light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. The extremely vesicular texture indicates it was formed from a very gassy, explosive volcanic eruption. These characteristics are distinct from Scoria.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. Pumice is a felsic extrusive igneous rock so full of gas bubbles that it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n**Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous, smaller, angular rock fragments of different colors (white, gray, red) cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix.\n*   **Careful Points:** This is a clastic rock. The angularity of the fragments and the ashy appearance of the matrix suggest a volcanic origin rather than a sedimentary one (which would have more rounded fragments if transported by water). It is formed from material violently ejected during a volcanic eruption.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Tuff** (or Volcanic Breccia). Tuff is a rock formed from the consolidation of volcanic ash and other fine pyroclastic materials. When it contains significant amounts of larger angular fragments like this, it can also be called a tuff breccia.\n\n**Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. There are no vesicles or fragments. The crystals are a mix of light colors (white, pinkish, and translucent gray) and some dark minerals.\n*   **Careful Points:** The coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates the rock cooled very slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface (intrusive). The predominance of light-colored minerals suggests a felsic composition. The visible minerals are likely quartz (grayish), feldspar (white/pink), and a dark mineral like biotite or hornblende.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Granite**. Granite is a common felsic, intrusive igneous rock known for its coarse-grained, crystalline texture.\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications**\n*   **H:** Scoria (Extrusive Igneous)\n*   **I:** Tuff / Volcanic Breccia (Pyroclastic Igneous)\n*   **J:** Pumice (Extrusive Igneous)\n*   **K:** Granite (Intrusive Igneous)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
