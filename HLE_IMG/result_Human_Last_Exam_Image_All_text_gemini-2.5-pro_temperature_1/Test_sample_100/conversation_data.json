    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the starting material and determine its molecular formula. The drawing shows a bicyclic lactam. The most plausible interpretation of this structure is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene scaffold. The specific structure is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The group \"PMB\" stands for p-methoxybenzyl.\n\nLet's calculate its molecular formula:\n*   The core bicyclic structure is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. It consists of 6 carbons and 1 nitrogen in the skeleton.\n*   Let's count the atoms in the core with its substituents (except the PMB group):\n    *   Carbon atoms: 6 in the ring system + 1 from the trifluoromethyl (-CF3) group = 7 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: There are 5 hydrogens on the carbon skeleton (1 at C1, 1 at C4, 1 at C6, 2 at C7). Let's assume there is an H on the nitrogen for now. That would be 6 hydrogens.\n    *   Nitrogen atoms: 1.\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (from the carbonyl group C=O).\n    *   Fluorine atoms: 3 (from the -CF3 group).\n    *   So, the formula for the de-protected core, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, is C7H6F3NO.\n*   The starting material has a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group attached to the nitrogen atom instead of a hydrogen. The formula of the PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) is C8H9O.\n*   To get the molecular formula of the starting material, we take the formula of the core (C7H6F3NO), subtract one hydrogen (from the N-H bond), and add the PMB group (C8H9O).\n*   Starting Material Formula = (C7H6F3NO - H) + C8H9O = C(7+8)H(6-1+9)F3N1O(1+1) = C15H14F3NO2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction to form Intermediate 1**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for the oxidative deprotection of a PMB-protected amine. The PMB group is cleaved from the nitrogen atom, which is subsequently protonated by the aqueous solvent.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen. The net change is the loss of C8H8O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = C7H6F3NO.\n*   The structure of Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction to form Intermediate 2**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). Other functional groups like the amide carbonyl and the C-F bonds are stable under these mild conditions.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** One molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added across the double bond.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H6F3NO + H2 = C7H8F3NO.\n*   The structure of Intermediate 2 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction to form the final Product**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (N2-C3) in the bicyclic ring is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the molecule.\n*   **Formula of Product:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = C7H10F3NO2.\n*   **Structure of Product:** The bicyclic ring opens to form a substituted cyclopentane. The product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Let's verify its formula:\n    *   C: 5 (cyclopentane ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CF3) = 7.\n    *   H: 7 (on the ring carbons) + 1 (in COOH) + 2 (in NH2) = 10.\n    *   F: 3.\n    *   N: 1.\n    *   O: 2 (in COOH).\n    *   The formula C7H10F3NO2 is confirmed.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nStarting Material: C15H14F3NO2\nStep 1 (CAN): - C8H8O -> C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\nStep 2 (Pd/C, H2): + H2 -> C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\nStep 3 (HCl, H2O): + H2O -> C7H10F3NO2 (Product)\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
