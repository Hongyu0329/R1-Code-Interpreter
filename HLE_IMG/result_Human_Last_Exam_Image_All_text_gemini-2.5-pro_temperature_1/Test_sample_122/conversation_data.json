    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: N-Protection of L-Tryptophan**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the natural amino acid L-tryptophan. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for the amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the primary amine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate, specifically a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. The NaOH also serves to deprotonate the carboxylic acid to the carboxylate, making it less reactive, and to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, which is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved.\n\n**Step 2: Amide Coupling to form an O-Benzyl Hydroxamate**\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (Triethylamine).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation, often used in peptide synthesis. The EDC activates the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 by forming a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. HOBt then reacts with this intermediate to form a more stable active ester, which helps to prevent racemization and other side reactions. The base, Et3N, neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine to generate the free nucleophile (H2NO-Bn). This nucleophile then attacks the activated carboxyl group to form a new amide-like bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product is a hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. Its systematic name is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. The original carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is now an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NHOBn).\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by Catalytic Hydrogenolysis**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This method is highly effective for removing protecting groups that contain a benzyl group (a phenylmethyl group, -CH2Ph). Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n    1.  The **N-Cbz group** (-NH-C(O)O-CH2Ph): The bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is cleaved by hydrogen and the catalyst. This initially forms an unstable carbamic acid (-NHCOOH), which spontaneously decarboxylates (loses CO2) to yield the free primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** (-C(O)NH-O-CH2Ph): The bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(O)NHOH).\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The N-Cbz group reverts to a primary amine, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate becomes a hydroxamic acid. The L-tryptophan backbone remains intact, with its stereochemistry preserved. The final product's structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Name of the Product:**\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is **(S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide**. It is also commonly referred to by the semi-systematic name **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. This compound is a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has been investigated as an anti-cancer drug under the non-proprietary name **Abexinostat**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Identify the reacting functional groups in each step.\n*   Recognize the purpose of each reagent (protection, activation, coupling, deprotection).\n*   Follow the transformation of the functional groups through the reaction sequence.\n*   Note that stereochemistry is maintained throughout the synthesis.\n*   Understand that catalytic hydrogenolysis (H2, Pd/C) is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups like Cbz and O-benzyl.\n*   Be aware that complex drug-like molecules can have multiple names (systematic, semi-systematic, and non-proprietary/trade names).\n\nGiven the context of a multi-step synthesis of a bioactive molecule, the specific non-proprietary drug name is often the expected answer.\n\n<<<Abexinostat>>>"
