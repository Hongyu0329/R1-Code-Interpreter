    "This is a medical interpretation task, not a coding task. Based on the clinical information and the provided images, I will give a pathological diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica, the location of the pituitary gland. This clinical presentation most commonly suggests a pituitary adenoma. The sample is an intraoperative crush smear, a common technique for rapid diagnosis of central nervous system lesions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cytology:**\n    *   The main cellular component consists of a cohesive, syncytial-like sheet of epithelial cells.\n    *   These cells are relatively monotonous (uniform in appearance).\n    *   The nuclei are round to oval with stippled or \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, which is characteristic of neuroendocrine cells, such as those of the pituitary gland.\n    *   The cytoplasm is moderate in amount, eosinophilic (pink), and has indistinct cell borders.\n    *   These features are highly characteristic of a **pituitary adenoma**.\n\n3.  **Identify Additional Findings:**\n    *   Scattered throughout the smear, and highlighted in the cropped images (e.g., `crop3.jpg`, `crop10.jpg`), are small, ovoid, dark-staining structures.\n    *   These structures are consistent in size and shape with yeast organisms.\n    *   Budding forms and the formation of pseudohyphae (chains of budding yeast cells) are visible, particularly in `crop10.jpg`.\n    *   This morphology is characteristic of **_Candida_ species**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The image shows two distinct pathological processes occurring simultaneously:\n    *   A primary neoplasm with features of a pituitary adenoma.\n    *   A superimposed fungal infection, morphologically consistent with Candidiasis.\n\n5.  **Final Diagnosis:** The combination of a sellar mass composed of monotonous neuroendocrine cells and the presence of budding yeast and pseudohyphae leads to a diagnosis of Pituitary Adenoma with a co-existing fungal infection, likely _Candida_.\n\n<<<Pituitary adenoma with superimposed fungal infection (consistent with Candida)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
