    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first determine the molecular formula of the initial reactant by counting the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms. The starting material is 5-(Trifluoromethyl)-7-(p-methoxybenzyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1**: The first step uses CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate), which is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction removes the PMB group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the atomic count to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2**: The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2), which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the bicyclic ring. This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. I will update the atomic count to find the formula of Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3**: The third step involves treating Intermediate 2, a strained bicyclic aminoketone, with strong acid (4 N HCl) and heat. These conditions promote the hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-nitrogen bond, which opens the strained bicyclic ring to form a more stable monocyclic product. This process involves the net addition of one molecule of water (H2O).\n5.  **Final Calculation**: I will calculate the molecular formula of the final product by applying the atomic changes from the third reaction to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that starts with the atomic composition of the initial reactant and sequentially applies the changes for each reaction step, printing the formula at each stage to show the process clearly.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Structure: 5-(Trifluoromethyl)-7-(p-methoxybenzyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one\n    # Core (C6H5N): 6 C, 5 H, 1 N\n    # C=O group: 1 O\n    # CF3 group: 1 C, 3 F\n    # PMB group (p-methoxybenzyl, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3): 8 C, 9 H, 1 O\n    atoms = {\n        'C': 6 + 1 + 8,  # Core + CF3 + PMB\n        'H': 5 + 9,      # Core + PMB\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 1 + 1       # Ketone + PMB ether\n    }\n    \n    def format_formula(atom_dict):\n        # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical for others\n        formula = \"\"\n        if 'C' in atom_dict and atom_dict['C'] > 0:\n            formula += f\"C{atom_dict['C']}\"\n        if 'H' in atom_dict and atom_dict['H'] > 0:\n            formula += f\"H{atom_dict['H']}\"\n        \n        sorted_keys = sorted([key for key in atom_dict if key not in ['C', 'H']])\n        for key in sorted_keys:\n            if atom_dict[key] > 0:\n                formula += f\"{key}{atom_dict[key]}\"\n        return formula\n\n    print(f\"Starting Material Formula: {format_formula(atoms)}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - Deprotection of PMB group with CAN.\n    # Remove PMB group (C8H9O) and add 1 H to the Nitrogen.\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 9\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    atoms['H'] += 1\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula (after deprotection): {format_formula(atoms)}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2.\n    # Reduce C=C double bond, adding 2 H atoms.\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula (after hydrogenation): {format_formula(atoms)}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Acid hydrolysis with 4 N HCl at 70 C.\n    # This causes hydrolytic cleavage of a C-N bond in the strained bicyclic system.\n    # This corresponds to the net addition of one water molecule (H2O).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n    \n    final_formula = format_formula(atoms)\n    print(f\"Final Product Formula (after hydrolysis): {final_formula}\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number explicitly.\n    print(\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is determined as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms: {atoms['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Nitrogen atoms: {atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Oxygen atoms: {atoms['O']}\")\n    \ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
