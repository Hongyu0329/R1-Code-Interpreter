    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: Visually inspect the provided raster plot to find the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are visible as dense vertical lines of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: Estimate the center time for each identified burst from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: Compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI**: Find the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output**: Round the final average to two significant figures and display the entire calculation process.\n\nBased on this plan, here is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from a neuronal activity graph, calculates the\n    inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and estimate the timestamps of the synchronized bursts.\n    # These are the dense vertical bands of firing activity across many electrodes.\n    burst_timestamps = [2.5, 9.0, 17.5, 25.5, 36.5, 47.5]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Calculating the inter-burst intervals (time between consecutive bursts):\")\n    for i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n        print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {inter_burst_intervals[i]:.1f} s\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Step 5: Display the final calculation and round the result.\n    intervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, [f\"{i:.1f}\" for i in inter_burst_intervals]))\n    num_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n    sum_intervals = sum(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"Average = ({intervals_sum_str}) / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {sum_intervals:.1f} / {num_intervals}\")\n    \n    # The final answer is rounded to two significant figures.\n    final_answer = f\"{average_ibi:.1f}\"\n    print(f\"Average = {final_answer} s\")\n\n    return final_answer\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Run the calculation and store the final answer.\n    result = calculate_average_ibi()\n    # The final answer format is specified by the problem.\n    # The instruction says \"directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>>\"\n    # But since the prompt also says \"Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\"\n    # and the final format is just a number, I will print the result as requested,\n    # and then add the special format at the end.\n    # Let's assume the special format is the final expected output.\n    # Final answer is 9.0 which has two significant figures.\n\n```\n<<<9.0>>>"
