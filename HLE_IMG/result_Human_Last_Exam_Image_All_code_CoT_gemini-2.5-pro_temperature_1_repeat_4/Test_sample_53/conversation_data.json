    "This image depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology, specifically the conclusion of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step identification of the figures:\n1.  **The Scene:** The vase shows a chariot speeding away from a fallen figure. This represents the story where suitors had to race King Oenomaus for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia. Pelops, with divine help and by sabotaging the king's chariot, won the race and Hippodamia's hand.\n2.  **The Figures in the Chariot:**\n    *   The driver, wearing a patterned sleeve and a cap, is **Pelops**. His attire often hints at his origin from Lydia in Asia Minor.\n    *   The female passenger he is carrying away is **Hippodamia**, the prize of the race.\n3.  **The Fallen Figure:** The man lying on the ground, seemingly run over by the chariot wheel, is King **Oenomaus**, Hippodamia's father, who was killed during the race.\n4.  **The Winged Figure:** The large white wing above the chariot belongs to **Nike**, the goddess of Victory, who is crowning Pelops and signifying his triumph.\n\nThe question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" refers to the occupants of the departing chariot. While this includes both Pelops and Hippodamia, the central female figure being carried away is Hippodamia.\n\nThe following Python code identifies the characters and provides the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_mythological_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the figures depicted on the ancient Greek vase.\n    The scene is the chariot race of Pelops and Oenomaus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the characters in the scene\n    driver = \"Pelops\"\n    passenger = \"Hippodamia\"\n    fallen_king = \"Oenomaus\"\n    \n    print(\"The mythological scene on the vase is the story of Pelops and Hippodamia.\")\n    print(f\"The driver of the chariot, the victor of the race, is {driver}.\")\n    print(f\"The fallen man on the ground is King {fallen_king}.\")\n    print(f\"The woman in the chariot being carried away is the king's daughter.\")\n    \n    # The question asks for the figure leaving in the chariot.\n    # This refers to the main passenger being taken away.\n    print(\"\\nThe figure leaving the chariot is:\")\n    print(passenger)\n\nidentify_mythological_figure()\n```\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
