    "My plan is to analyze the harmony in the specified measure of the provided sheet music to determine the correct Roman numeral.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has three flats (Bb, Eb, Ab), which corresponds to C minor (or its relative major, Eb major). Given the piece's title (\"Pathetique\" Sonata) and overall tonality, the key is C minor.\n2.  **Locate the Measure:** I will find measure 30 by counting from the nearest marked measure, which is measure 28. Measure 30 is the second full measure after the bar marked '28'.\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** I will identify the notes played on the first beat of measure 30. The bass clef shows the notes G (bottom line), B-natural (second line, with a natural sign), and F (fourth line).\n4.  **Analyze the Chord:** The notes are G, B-natural, and F. These notes form a G dominant 7th chord (G7), with the 5th (D) omitted, which is a very common practice. The B-natural is the crucial leading tone to the tonic C, created by raising the 7th degree of the C natural minor scale (Bb to B-natural), a hallmark of the harmonic minor scale.\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The root of the chord is G.\n    *   In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant).\n    *   A major chord built on the dominant is represented by a capital Roman numeral 'V'.\n    *   The presence of the minor seventh (F) makes it a dominant seventh chord, so a '7' is added.\n    *   The chord is in root position because the root, G, is the lowest note.\n6.  **Construct the Final Answer:** The resulting Roman numeral is V7. I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef get_roman_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\"\n    sonata (1st mvt.) and provides the corresponding Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Notes on the first beat of measure 30\n    notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"F\"]\n    \n    # Analysis\n    root = \"G\"\n    scale_degree = \"5th\"\n    scale_degree_roman = \"V\"\n    chord_quality = \"Dominant 7th\"\n    extension = \"7\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st Mvt., Measure {measure}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
