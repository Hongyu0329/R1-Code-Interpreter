  The image sequence (L, M, N) depicts the process of hyphal branching in a filamentous organism, such as a fungus.

  Step-by-step breakdown:
  1.  In panel L, we see a mature hypha (a single filament). The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a dividing wall between cells.
  2.  In panel M, a new branch initiates as a small, localized bulge from the side of the hypha, right at the septum.
  3.  In panel N, this bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new young branch that extends from the main filament.

  This branching is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to grow and form a complex network called a mycelium, allowing them to explore and absorb nutrients from their surroundings.
