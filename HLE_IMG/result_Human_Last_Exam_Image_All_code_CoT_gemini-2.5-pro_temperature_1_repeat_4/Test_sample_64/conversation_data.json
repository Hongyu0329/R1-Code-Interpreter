    "This image displays a biological process over time, shown in three stages labeled L, M, and N. My analysis identifies this as the formation of a new branch from an existing filament, a process common in fungi.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the sequence of images (L, M, N) to understand the changes occurring to the cellular structure.\n2.  Identify the key features: a filamentous structure, cell walls (septa), and a new outgrowth.\n3.  Determine the specific biological term for this type of growth.\n4.  Write a Python script to print a clear explanation of the process.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Image L:** Shows a straight, multi-cellular filament. An arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall between two cells.\n*   **Image M:** At the location marked by the arrowhead in the previous panel, the cell wall has started to bulge outwards, forming a small, rounded protrusion.\n*   **Image N:** The protrusion has enlarged significantly, forming the beginning of a new filament or branch extending sideways from the original one.\n\nThis sequence clearly illustrates the initiation and early development of a lateral branch from a fungal hypha. Therefore, the process is **hyphal branching**. The script below will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef describe_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides a description of the biological process shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Hyphal Branching\"\n  description = \"\"\"\n  The image sequence (L, M, N) depicts the process of hyphal branching in a filamentous organism, such as a fungus.\n\n  Step-by-step breakdown:\n  1.  In panel L, we see a mature hypha (a single filament). The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a dividing wall between cells.\n  2.  In panel M, a new branch initiates as a small, localized bulge from the side of the hypha, right at the septum.\n  3.  In panel N, this bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new young branch that extends from the main filament.\n\n  This branching is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to grow and form a complex network called a mycelium, allowing them to explore and absorb nutrients from their surroundings.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process being depicted is: {title}\")\n  print(\"-\" * 30)\n  # Use textwrap to format the description nicely\n  print(textwrap.dedent(description).strip())\n\ndescribe_biological_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
