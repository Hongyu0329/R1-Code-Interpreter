    "I have analyzed the chessboard position to find the forced checkmate in two moves for White.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze the Black King's position:** The Black King is on e4. It is not currently in check, but its movement is severely restricted.\n    *   The d4 square is controlled by the White Queen on a4.\n    *   The f5 square is controlled by the White King on h4 and the White Rook on h5.\n    *   The d3 and f3 squares are controlled by the White Rook on f3.\n    *   All immediate escape squares are covered.\n\n2.  **Find White's first move:** I need to find a move that forces a specific response from Black, leading to an inevitable checkmate on the next turn. A checking move is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's consider the move **1. Rf3-e3+ (Re3+)**. This puts the Black King in check.\n    *   Now, let's analyze Black's possible responses to 1. Re3+:\n        *   **Capture the Rook:** Can the Rook on e3 be captured?\n            *   The Queen on d5 cannot capture it (`Qxe3`) because it is pinned to the King by the White Knight on e7.\n            *   The pawn on f4 cannot capture it (`fxe3`) because it is pinned to the King by the White King on h4.\n            *   Therefore, the only piece that can capture the Rook is the King itself.\n        *   **Move the King:** Can the King move to a safe square? No, as established in step 1, all adjacent squares are controlled or occupied by its own pieces.\n    *   This means Black has only one legal move: **1... Kxe3**.\n\n3.  **Find White's second move (the checkmate):** After Black plays 1... Kxe3, the Black King is now on e3. White must deliver the final checkmating move.\n    *   Let's play **2. Qa4-d1# (Qd1#)**. This attacks the Black King on e3.\n    *   Let's verify if this is checkmate:\n        *   The King on e3 cannot escape.\n            *   d2 and f2 are covered by the Bishop on g2.\n            *   d3, e2, f3, d4, and e4 are all covered by the Queen on d1.\n            *   f4 is blocked by its own pawn.\n        *   The check cannot be blocked by any Black piece.\n        *   The White Queen on d1 cannot be captured.\n    *   Therefore, 2. Qd1# is checkmate.\n\nThe solution is 1. Re3+ Kxe3 2. Qd1#. I will now generate a Python script to print this solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_checkmate():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution to the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n  \"\"\"\n  move1_white = \"Re3+\"\n  move1_black = \"Kxe3\"\n  move2_white = \"Qd1#\"\n\n  print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 is:\")\n  print(f\"1. {move1_white} {move1_black}\")\n  print(f\"2. {move2_white}\")\n\nfind_checkmate()\n```\n<<<1. Re3+ Kxe3 2. Qd1#>>>"
