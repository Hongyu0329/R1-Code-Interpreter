    print("Analysis:")
    print("  - Starting Material (SM) formula: C9H14N2O2")
    print("  - Product C formula: C11H16N2O3")
    print("  - The difference is C2H2O, which corresponds to an acetyl group added to the starting material.")
    print("  - The reaction is: SM + Ac2O -> C + Acetic Acid (CH3COOH)")
    print("  - Formula check: C9H14N2O2 + C4H6O3 -> C11H16N2O3 + C2H4O2. This balances.")
    print("  - The secondary amine of the pyrrolidine ring is acetylated by Ac2O. The carboxylic acid remains.")
    print("  - The 1H-NMR signal at 5.41 ppm (vinyl H) indicates that the product exists as its enamine tautomer.")
    print("\nProposed Structure for C:")

    # --- Product A ---

    print("Molecular Formula: C14H20N2O3")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("  - This product results from the full cycloaddition pathway.")
    print("  - Step 1: Munchone formation from SM + Ac2O.")
    print("  - Step 2: Cycloaddition with methyl propiolate (C4H4O2).")
    print("  - Step 3: Loss of CO2.")
    print("  - The initial product (P') would have the formula C14H18N2O3.")
    print("  - Product A's formula (C14H20N2O3) has two more hydrogens than P', suggesting a reduction occurred.")
    print("  - The most likely reduction is of the imine (C=N) bond in the substituent side-chain to an amine (C-N).")
    print("  - The NMR data for A supports this structure:")
    print("    - 7.95 ppm: NH proton of the new pyrrolidine side-chain.")
    print("    - 6.14 ppm: A single proton on the newly formed pyrrole ring.")
    print("    - 3.77 ppm: OCH3 from the methyl ester.")

    print("    - Three carbonyl signals (175.6, 173.8, 169.3 ppm), suggesting a structure with multiple lactam or imide rings.")
    print("    - No OCH3 or acetyl CH3 signals, indicating these groups were lost or transformed during the rearrangement.")
    print("    - A signal at 83.2 ppm suggests a bridgehead carbon bonded to two heteroatoms (e.g., N-C-N).")
    print("  - The structure is difficult to determine from first principles but corresponds to a known complex pentacyclic (5-ring) ketone.")
    print("\nProposed Structure for B:")
