def solve_roller_puzzle():
    """
    This function determines the correct pairing between roller configurations (1-8)
    and their corresponding angular displacement plots (A-H).

    The matching is done based on two main principles:
    1. Periodicity: The number of lobes on the driving (green) roller corresponds to the
       number of periodic cycles in the displacement plot.
    2. Variation Shape/Magnitude: The specific geometry of both rollers determines the
       shape and magnitude of the plot's oscillations. Sharp features lead to sharp
       changes, and smooth shapes lead to smooth changes.

    The final result is a sequence of 8 integers representing the configuration number
    for each plot from A to H.
