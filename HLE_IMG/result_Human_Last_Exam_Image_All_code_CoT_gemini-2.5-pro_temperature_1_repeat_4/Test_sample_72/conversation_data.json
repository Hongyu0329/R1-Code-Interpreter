    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the chemical reaction to identify the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄) and is initiated by light (hv). The product is a complex tricyclic molecule formed by joining the two reactants. The structure of the product, a linear fusion of three four-membered rings, is a key clue.\n\n2.  **Propose a Stepwise Mechanism:** The question states that two pericyclic reactions occur. A direct reaction between the starting materials in a single step does not lead to the observed product. Therefore, a two-step mechanism is likely.\n    *   **Step 1: Isomerization of a Reactant:** Benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization. A plausible first step is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene into its isomer, hexafluoro Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This intramolecular reaction is a type of pericyclic reaction known as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   **Step 2: Reaction between Intermediate and Other Reactant:** The intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, now has two isolated double bonds. It can react with cyclobutene. The reaction between two alkene systems (one from Dewar benzene, one from cyclobutene) to form a four-membered ring is a cycloaddition. Since it involves a 2π-electron system reacting with another 2π-electron system, it is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This type of reaction is known to be photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n3.  **Verify the Mechanism:** This two-step mechanism (electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition) correctly predicts the final product's tricyclic structure, the location of the remaining double bond, and the placement of the fluorine and hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically prints out this step-by-step explanation and states the final conclusion, ensuring to mention the numbers '2' and '2' as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Introduction to the analysis\n    print(\"The chemical transformation shown occurs via two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\")\n    print(\"Let's break down the process step-by-step to identify them.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: The first pericyclic reaction\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene ---\")\n    print(\"The first step involves the reactant hexafluorobenzene on its own.\")\n    print(\"Under photochemical conditions (hv), hexafluorobenzene undergoes a valence isomerization to form hexafluoro Dewar benzene.\")\n    print(\"This is an intramolecular process where the pi-electron system of the benzene ring rearranges to form a new sigma bond and a bicyclic structure.\")\n    print(\"This type of reaction is classified as an ELECTROCYCLIC REACTION.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: The second pericyclic reaction\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Reaction with Cyclobutene ---\")\n    print(\"The intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene.\")\n    print(\"This is an intermolecular reaction between two molecules.\")\n    print(\"A pi-bond from hexafluoro Dewar benzene (a 2-pi electron system) and the pi-bond from cyclobutene (another 2-pi electron system) react to form a new four-membered ring, joining the two molecules.\")\n    print(\"This pericyclic reaction is classified as a CYCLOADDITION.\")\n    print(\"Specifically, since it involves a 2-pi system and a 2-pi system, it is called a [2+2] CYCLOADDITION.\")\n    print(\"The numbers in the name of this reaction type are 2 and 2.\")\n    \n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are:\")\n    print(\"1.
