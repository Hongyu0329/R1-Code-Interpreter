    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to deduce the structure and name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis**: The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z 135. An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule), likely one. A plausible molecular formula with a mass of 135 containing C, H, and one N is C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 135).\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**: For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**: The spectrum shows characteristic peaks for:\n    *   Aromatic C-H stretches (>3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aliphatic C-H stretches (<3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aromatic C=C stretches (~1600, 1500 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Two peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, which are indicative of a primary amine (-NH₂) group (symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching).\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**:\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals, which for a 9-carbon molecule (C₉H₁₃N) implies some symmetry. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 4 signals: ipso, ortho, meta, para) and a 3-carbon side chain with no internal symmetry.\n    *   The signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are in the aromatic region. The signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n        *   The negative signal corresponds to one CH₂ group.\n        *   The positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. There are three CH groups in the aromatic ring, which means the aliphatic side chain must contain one CH and one CH₃ group to account for the remaining two positive signals.\n    *   Therefore, the side chain is composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n5.  **¹H NMR Analysis**:\n    *   A multiplet at ~7.2 ppm integrating to 5H confirms a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A doublet at ~1.2 ppm integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This confirms a `-CH(R)-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   The remaining aliphatic signals are a multiplet at ~2.8 ppm (2H, the CH₂ group) and a multiplet at ~2.7 ppm (1H, the CH group).\n    *   A broad signal at ~1.0 ppm (2H) corresponds to the primary amine (-NH₂) protons.\n\n6.  **Putting it all together with HSQC**: The HSQC spectrum directly links the protons to their attached carbons.\n    *   ¹H ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates to ¹³C at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H ~2.7 ppm (CH) correlates to ¹³C at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   ¹H ~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates to ¹³C at 43.5 ppm.\n\n7.  **Structure Elucidation**: Based on the fragments identified (C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, -NH₂), two main isomers are possible: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃) and 2-phenylpropan-1-amine (CH₃-CH(C₆H₅)-CH₂-NH₂).\n\n    *   For **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**:\n        *   The benzylic CH₂ group is expected to have a ¹³C shift of ~40-45 ppm. The data shows a CH₂ at **43.5 ppm**. This is a strong match.\n        *   The CH group attached to the amine is expected to have a ¹³C shift of ~50-60 ppm. The data shows a CH at **49.6 ppm**. This is also a strong match.\n    *   This assignment is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\nThe following Python script systematically presents this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of a compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data from the problem ---\n    molecular_ion_mz = 135\n    c13_shifts_ppm = [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2]\n    h1_shifts_ppm = {\"C6H5\": \"7.2-7.4\", \"CH2\": \"~2.8\", \"CH\": \"~2.7\", \"CH3\": \"~1.2\", \"NH2\": \"~1.0\"}\n    hsqc_correlations = {\n        \"CH3\": (\"~1.2\", 19.2),\n        \"CH\": (\"~2.7\", 49.6),\n        \"CH2\": (\"~2.8\", 43.5)\n    }\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of spectroscopic data:\")\n    \n    # 1.
