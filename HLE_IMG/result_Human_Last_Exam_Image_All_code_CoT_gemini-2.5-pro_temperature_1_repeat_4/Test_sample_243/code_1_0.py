# Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.
# The plant is identified as Debregeasia heale, also known as Heale's Debregeasia.
# This identification is based on the unique and highly characteristic reticulated (net-like) white venation on its dark green leaves.

# Step 2: Research the origin of the identified plant.
# Research shows that Debregeasia heale is a critically endangered (possibly extinct in the wild) species.
# Botanical records indicate it was native to a specific island.

# Step 3: State the endemic location.
# The plant was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.

plant_name = "Debregeasia heale"
endemic_island = "Saint Helena"

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
