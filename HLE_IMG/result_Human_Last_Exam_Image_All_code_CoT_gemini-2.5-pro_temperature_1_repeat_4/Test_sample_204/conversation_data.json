    "To solve this problem, I will first identify each mineral specimen based on its visual characteristics (crystal habit, color, luster, cleavage/fracture). Then, I will determine the silicate structural class for each identified mineral. Silicate structures are classified based on the degree of polymerization of the silica (SiOâ‚„) tetrahedra, which increases in complexity as more oxygen atoms are shared between tetrahedra. Finally, I will order the specimens from the least complex structure to the most complex structure.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify Specimen A:** This is a dark, prismatic crystal. Its form is typical of a single-chain silicate like pyroxene.\n2.  **Identify Specimen B:** This specimen is flaky and splits into thin sheets, which is characteristic of a sheet silicate (phyllosilicate) like mica or chlorite.\n3.  **Identify Specimen C:** This is a mass of olive-green, granular crystals, which is the classic appearance of olivine, an isolated tetrahedra silicate (nesosilicate).\n4.  **Identify Specimen D:** This is a transparent, well-formed crystal with a glassy luster, characteristic of quartz, which is a framework silicate (tectosilicate).\n5.  **Classify Structures:**\n    *   Olivine (C) is a nesosilicate (isolated tetrahedra).\n    *   Pyroxene (A) is an inosilicate (single chain).\n    *   Mica/Chlorite (B) is a phyllosilicate (sheet).\n    *   Quartz (D) is a tectosilicate (framework).\n6.  **Order by Complexity:** The complexity increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron:\n    *   Nesosilicates (0 shared oxygens)\n    *   Inosilicates (2 shared oxygens in single chains)\n    *   Phyllosilicates (3 shared oxygens)\n    *   Tectosilicates (4 shared oxygens)\n7.  **Final Order:** Based on the classification, the order of increasing complexity is C (Olivine), A (Pyroxene), B (Mica/Chlorite), D (Quartz).\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this identification and sorting process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify minerals and their silicate structures\n    # The complexity is ranked from 1 (least complex) to 4 (most complex).\n    minerals = [\n        {'label': 'C', 'name': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'A', 'name': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'name': 'Mica/Chlorite', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'D', 'name': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the minerals based on their complexity rank\n    sorted_minerals = sorted(minerals, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 4: Print the identification for each specimen\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Silicate Structure:\")\n    # Print the details in the original A, B, C, D order for clarity\n    for mineral in sorted(minerals, key=lambda x: x['label']):\n        print(f\"  Specimen {mineral['label']}: {mineral['name']} - {mineral['structure']}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final ordered list\n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    \n    ordered_labels = [mineral['label'] for mineral in sorted_minerals]\n    \n    # Print the equation-like format\n    print(f\"{ordered_labels[0]} < {ordered_labels[1]} < {ordered_labels[2]} < {ordered_labels[3]}\")\n\nsolve_mineral_complexity()\n```\n<<<C < A < B < D>>>"
