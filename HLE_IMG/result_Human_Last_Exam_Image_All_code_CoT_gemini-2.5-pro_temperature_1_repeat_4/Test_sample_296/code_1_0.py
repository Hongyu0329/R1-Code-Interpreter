def solve_idiom_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the Russian idiom based on visual clues.

    The image presents two clues:
    1. A literal depiction (in red): A person uses a crowbar ("лом") to break the ground,
       against which there is no defense ("нет приёма").
    2. A figurative depiction (colored): A modern taxi is shown next to a horse-drawn
       carriage, illustrating how a superior force or method (the car)
       makes an older one (the carriage) obsolete.

    Both clues point to the same Russian idiom.
