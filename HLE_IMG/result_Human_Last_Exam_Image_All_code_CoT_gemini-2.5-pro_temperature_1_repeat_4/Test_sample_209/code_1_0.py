# The task is to re-identify a giraffe from a target image among several options.
# The key is to compare the unique coat patterns, which act as natural markings.

# Step 1: Analyze the spot pattern on the target giraffe's torso and neck.
# I will focus on a distinctive cluster of spots on the shoulder area.
# - There is a large, irregularly shaped spot on the shoulder.
# - Directly below it are two smaller spots, side-by-side.
# - At the base of the neck, there's a Y-shaped pattern.

# Step 2: Compare this specific pattern with each of the options provided (A, B, C, D, E, F).
# - Image A: Different color and pattern. Not a match.
# - Image B: The pattern on the shoulder and neck perfectly matches the target. The large spot, the two spots below it, and the Y-shape are all present in the same configuration. This is a match.
# - Image C: Different color and pattern. Not a match.
# - Image D: The spots are much darker and the pattern is different. Not a match.
# - Image E: The pattern on the shoulder does not match the target's key features. Not a match.
# - Image F: The pattern is different, spots appear stretched. Not a match.

# Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.
# The spot pattern in image B is an exact match to the target giraffe.

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
answer = 'B'
print(f"The image that shows the same giraffe as the target is: {answer}")
