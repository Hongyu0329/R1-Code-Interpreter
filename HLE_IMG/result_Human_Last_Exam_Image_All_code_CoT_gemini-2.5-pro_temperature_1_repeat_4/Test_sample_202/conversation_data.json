    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as color, texture (crystal size, presence of layers, holes, or fragments), and overall appearance.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, bubbly texture. These holes, called vesicles, are formed by gas escaping from lava as it cools. This type of rock is known as scoria.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various smaller, angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of a volcanic breccia or a tuff, which are formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger rock fragments ejected during an eruption.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, very porous rock. Its texture appears almost frothy. This is a classic example of pumice, a volcanic rock so full of gas bubbles that it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock is made of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained texture (phaneritic) indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth. The presence of large light-colored (likely feldspar) and some dark minerals is characteristic of a pegmatite, which is an extremely coarse-grained igneous rock.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    rock_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A reddish, vesicular (bubbly) extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia/Tuff - Composed of angular volcanic fragments and ash cemented together.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A light-colored, highly vesicular and lightweight volcanic rock.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - A very coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock with large, interlocking crystals.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, description in rock_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia/Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
