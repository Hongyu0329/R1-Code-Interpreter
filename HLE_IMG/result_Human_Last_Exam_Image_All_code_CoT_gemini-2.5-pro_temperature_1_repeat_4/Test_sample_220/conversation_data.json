    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we need to understand what this projection looks like.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the theoretical 2D projection:** We will determine the arrangement of atoms when a 3D FCC lattice is projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n2.  **Characterize the pattern:** The key features of the projected pattern are its symmetry (e.g., rectangular, hexagonal) and the aspect ratio of its unit cell.\n    *   The atoms in an FCC lattice have coordinates that are permutations of `(0, 0, 0)` (corners) and `(1/2, 1/2, 0)` (face centers) within a unit cube.\n    *   Projecting these atomic positions along the `[110]` direction onto a plane results in a **centered rectangular pattern**.\n    *   The sides of this rectangular unit cell are aligned with the `[001]` and `[1-10]` crystal directions. The lengths of the sides are proportional to `a` and `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant.\n    *   Therefore, the aspect ratio of the rectangle is `(a√2) / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n3.  **Analyze the given images:** We will inspect each image to see if it matches the description of a centered rectangular lattice with an aspect ratio of approximately `√2`.\n4.  **Identify the correct image:** The image that best matches the theoretical pattern is the correct answer.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided images to identify the FCC [110] projection.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the theoretical pattern\n    expected_pattern = \"Centered Rectangular Lattice\"\n    expected_aspect_ratio = math.sqrt(2)\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Crystal Lattice Patterns\")\n    print(\"=\" * 35)\n    print(f\"Theoretical pattern for FCC [110] projection: {expected_pattern}\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical aspect ratio of the unit cell: sqrt(2) = {expected_aspect_ratio:.3f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze each image based on visual inspection\n    # The coordinates are estimated from the provided graphs.\n\n    # Analysis of Image A\n    # Pattern: Appears to be a simple rectangular lattice, not centered.\n    # Atoms at (2, 6.5), (4, 6.5), (2, 9), (4, 9), etc. form a simple grid.\n    analysis_A = \"Image A shows a simple rectangular lattice, not a centered one.
