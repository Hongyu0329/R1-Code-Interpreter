    "This image illustrates a fascinating auditory illusion. The top panel (a spectrogram) and the bottom panel (a waveform) show a continuous tone that is physically interrupted by a short burst of noise. However, when a person listens to this, their brain perceptually restores the missing portion of the tone, creating the illusion that the tone continued seamlessly behind the noise. This \"filling-in\" process is a powerful example of how our brains construct a coherent reality from sensory input. The phenomenon's similarity to the Necker Cube lies in how the brain resolves ambiguity to form a stable perception.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef get_phenomenon_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n  The illusion is that a tone interrupted by noise is perceived as continuous.\n  \"\"\"\n  return \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n\n# Print the name of the phenomenon\nphenomenon_name = get_phenomenon_name()\nprint(phenomenon_name)\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
