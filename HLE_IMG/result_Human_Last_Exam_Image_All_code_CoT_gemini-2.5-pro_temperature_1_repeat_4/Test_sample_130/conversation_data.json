    "An emission spectrum is like a fingerprint for an element. By observing the specific colors (or wavelengths) of light emitted by a substance when it's heated or energized, we can identify the element.\n\nTo solve this, I will write a Python script that contains a database of prominent spectral lines for several common elements. The script will then compare the visually distinct lines from the image (a strong blue-violet line, a very prominent green line, and a bright yellow-orange line) against this database to find the best match. The element with the most matching spectral lines will be our answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its observed spectral lines\n    against a database of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A database of prominent spectral lines for some elements (wavelengths in nanometers)\n    element_spectra = {\n        \"Hydrogen\": [410, 434, 486, 656],\n        \"Helium\": [447, 501, 587, 667],\n        \"Sodium\": [589],  # Strong yellow doublet, often seen as one line\n        \"Mercury\": [404, 436, 546, 578] # Includes the yellow doublet as one average value\n    }\n\n    # Prominent lines estimated from the provided image (in nm).\n    # We can clearly see a blue-violet, a very strong green, and a yellow-orange line.\n    observed_lines = [436, 546, 578]\n\n    print(\"Starting element identification process...\")\n    print(f\"Observed prominent spectral lines (estimated wavelengths in nm): {observed_lines}\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\n    best_match_element = \"Unknown\"\n    max_matches = 0\n\n    # Iterate through our database to find the best match\n    for element, known_lines in element_spectra.items():\n        matches = 0\n        matched_lines_info = []\n        \n        # Check each observed line against the element's known lines\n        for obs_line in observed_lines:\n            # We'll allow a small tolerance (e.g., +/- 5 nm) for our estimation\n            for known_line in known_lines:\n                if abs(obs_line - known_line) <= 5:\n                    matches += 1\n                    matched_lines_info.append(f\"Observed ~{obs_line}nm -> {element} line at {known_line}nm\")\n                    break # Found a match for this observed line, move to the next one\n        \n        print(f\"Comparing with {element}:\")\n        if matched_lines_info:\n            for info in matched_lines_info:\n                print(f\"  - Match found: {info}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  - No significant matches found.\")\n        print(f\"Total matches for {element}: {matches}\")\n        print(\"-\"*40)\n\n        # Update the best match if this element is a better fit\n        if matches > max_matches:\n            max_matches = matches\n            best_match_element = element\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The element with the most matches ({max_matches}) is: {best_match_element}\")\n    print(\"The distinct pattern of a strong blue-violet line, a very prominent green line, and bright yellow-orange lines is characteristic of Mercury.\")\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Mercury>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
