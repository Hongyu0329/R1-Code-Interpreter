    "This problem requires us to determine the substituents at five specific positions in the product of a complex chemical reaction. The reaction starts with a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol (C30H52O) and, under acidic conditions with heat, yields an alkene (C30H50) and water. The prompt states that the transformation involves a number of [1,2] shifts, which is characteristic of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material and Product Skeletons:**\n    *   The starting material is a saturated pentacyclic alcohol. The drawing suggests a typical triterpenoid structure like those from the lupane, ursane, or oleanane families. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is at position C-3.\n    *   The product has a double bond between C-12 and C-13, which is characteristic of the **olean-12-ene** skeleton.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Rearrangement:**\n    *   Acid-catalyzed dehydration of the alcohol at C-3 would form a carbocation at C-3.\n    *   A typical backbone rearrangement would then begin with a [1,2]-methyl shift from the adjacent C-4 to C-3.\n    *   However, let's carefully examine the product structure. At position C-4 (which includes the substituent labeled '1'), there is a gem-dimethyl group (two CH3 groups).\n    *   If a methyl group from C-4 had shifted away during the reaction, the product would only have one methyl group remaining at C-4.\n    *   The presence of the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 in the final product is a crucial piece of evidence. It implies that the C-4 methyl groups **did not** participate in the rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   Since the C-4 methyls are untouched, the series of [1,2] shifts cannot have been initiated by a shift from C-4. This means the standard backbone rearrangement starting from the A-ring is not what happened.\n    *   The most logical conclusion is that the rearrangement was localized elsewhere in the molecule, leaving the methyl groups on the A and B rings (including those at C-4 and C-10) in their original positions.\n    *   A plausible scenario is that the starting material shown in the image is illustrative, and the actual reactant might have had the hydroxyl group in a different position (e.g., at C-11 or C-12) which could lead to the C-12/C-13 double bond via a more localized set of shifts without disturbing the rest of the skeleton.\n    *   For example, an alcohol at C-11 would form a carbocation at C-11. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-12 would move the cation to C-12. Another [1,2]-hydride shift (from a skeleton with an H at C-13, like ursane) would move the cation to C-13. Deprotonation from C-12 would then yield the final olean-12-ene product. This involves multiple [1,2] shifts but preserves the methyl framework.\n\n4.  **Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   Based on the reasoning that the methyl groups on the main A/B/C/D ring system are spectators in the rearrangement, we can identify the substituents by looking at the standard oleanane skeleton.\n    *   **Position 1:** Located on C-4. This is a **CH3** group (part of the gem-dimethyl pair).\n    *   **Position 2:** Located on C-10. This is the angular methyl group between rings A and B. It is a **CH3** group.\n    *   **Position 3:** Located on C-9. This position holds a hydrogen atom at the fusion of rings B and C. It is an **H**.\n    *   **Position 4:** Located on C-14. This is the angular methyl group at the fusion of rings C and D. It is a **CH3** group.\n    *   **Position 5:** Located on C-8. This is the angular methyl group at the fusion of rings B and C. It is a **CH3** group.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the specified positions based on the analysis\n    of the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a triterpenoid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The analysis concludes that the methyl groups on the main skeleton\n    # are not involved in the rearrangement, based on the final product structure.\n    # Therefore, the substituents correspond to those in a standard oleanane skeleton.\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",  # Methyl group at C-4\n        2: \"CH3\",  # Methyl group at C-10\n        3: \"H\",    # Hydrogen atom at C-9\n        4: \"CH3\",  # Methyl group at C-14\n        5: \"CH3\"   # Methyl group at C-8\n    }\n\n    # Format the output as requested: 1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
