    "My plan to identify the authors of the artworks is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze each of the nine images in a grid, moving from left to right and top to bottom.\n2.  For each artwork, I will examine its style, subject matter, and any visible signatures or seals, using the provided close-up crops for better detail.\n3.  I will use this visual information, along with knowledge of prominent Chinese artists and their characteristic styles, to identify the creator of each piece.\n4.  Finally, I will compile the list of authors in the correct order (1 to 9) and present it in a clear format using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the author for each of the 9 artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Xu Beihong (徐悲鸿)\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",\n        \"Mao Zedong (毛泽东)\",\n        \"Shitao (石涛)\",\n        \"Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)\",\n        \"Lin Fengmian (林风眠)\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",\n        \"Li Keran (李可染)\",\n        \"Qi Baishi (齐白石)\"\n    ]\n\n    positions = [\n        \"1.
