    "Yes, there is significant evidence of insect activity in this image. The most prominent feature is the large, white, fuzzy growth on the twig. This is an insect-induced structure called a **wool sower gall** (or oak apple gall).\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that will print the explanation.\n1.  Acknowledge the evidence of insect activity.\n2.  Identify the specific structure (the wool sower gall).\n3.  Explain which insect creates it (a cynipid gall wasp).\n4.  Describe where the eggs are laid to create this structure.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the insect activity visible in the image and answers where the eggs are laid.\n    \"\"\"\n    evidence = \"Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity.\"\n    gall_identification = \"The white, spherical, fuzzy growth on the oak twig is a 'wool sower gall'.\"\n    culprit = \"This gall is created by a small insect called a cynipid gall wasp (Callirhytis seminator).\"\n    egg_location_explanation = \"The female wasp lays her eggs in the bark of a twig or the central vein of a young leaf on an oak tree.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
