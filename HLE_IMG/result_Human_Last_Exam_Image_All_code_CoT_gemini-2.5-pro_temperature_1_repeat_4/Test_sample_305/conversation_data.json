    "Based on the context provided, the advertisement is for a product that helped women entering the workforce during World War II deal with what was euphemistically called \"inherent limitations.\" This phrasing was commonly used in advertising of the era to refer to menstruation.\n\nThe task is to identify a product sold in Britain during WWII, aimed at women workers, with a French-derived name, that addressed this \"limitation.\"\n\n1.  **Product Type:** The clues point to a menstrual product. Sellers like Boots (a chemist) confirm it's likely a personal hygiene or health product.\n2.  **Product Name:** The name must be derived from French.\n3.  **Historical Context:** During WWII, the leading tampon brand, Tampax, ran extensive advertising campaigns encouraging women to continue working without interruption. These ads used phrases very similar to the one in the prompt, such as \"inherent handicaps\" or \"inherent disadvantages.\"\n4.  **Name Origin:** The name \"Tampax\" is a portmanteau including the word \"tampon,\" which is a French word meaning \"plug\" or \"stopper.\"\n\nTherefore, the product is Tampax.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wwii_ad_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle about the WWII product for women workers.\n    \n    The clues are:\n    1. WWII-era Britain.\n    2. Aimed at new women workers.\n    3. Claimed to help overcome \"inherent limitations\" (a euphemism for menstruation).\n    4. Has a French-derived name.\n    \n    The product that fits all these criteria is Tampax.\n    - It was heavily advertised to women war workers during WWII.\n    - Ads used language like \"inherent handicaps\" to refer to menstruation.\n    - The name is derived from the word \"tampon,\" which is French.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    product_name = \"Tampax\"\n    print(f\"The product with a French-derived name advertised to women workers in WWII Britain to help overcome 'inherent limitations' was: {product_name}\")\n\nsolve_wwii_ad_riddle()\n```\n<<<Tampax>>>"
