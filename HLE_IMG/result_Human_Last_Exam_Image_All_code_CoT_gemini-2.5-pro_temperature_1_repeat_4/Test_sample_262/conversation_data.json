    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Structures:** I will first examine the chemical structures of the four Iridium(III) complexes provided. I will identify the common core structure and the specific differences between them. The key variation is the substitution pattern of fluorine atoms on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligands.\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability and Lifetime:** I will apply fundamental principles of organometallic chemistry related to the stability of such complexes. The operational lifetime of an emitter in a Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC) is directly related to its chemical stability under operating conditions.\n3.  **Identify Key Destabilizing Factor:** I will focus on the effect of fluorine substitution at different positions. A fluorine atom at the C2-position (ortho to the Iridium-Carbon bond) is known to be a critical factor that significantly reduces the stability of the complex, leading to faster degradation and thus a shorter device lifetime. This is due to the lability of the ortho C-F bond.\n4.  **Identify Complexes with Shorter Lifetimes:** I will systematically check each complex for the presence of this destabilizing ortho-fluorine. The complexes that possess this feature are the ones expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that automates this analysis. The script will define the properties of each complex, apply the stability rule, and print a clear explanation of the reasoning process along with the final list of complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes based on their structure\n    to determine which ones are expected to have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of each complex.\n    # The key feature for stability is the position of fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    # We denote the carbon attached to Iridium as C1, so the ortho-position is C2.\n    # A dictionary stores the fluorine positions for each complex.\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'name': 'Complex 1', 'fluorine_positions': [2, 4]},\n        2: {'name': 'Complex 2', 'fluorine_positions': []},\n        3: {'name': 'Complex 3', 'fluorine_positions': [2]},\n        4: {'name': 'Complex 4', 'fluorine_positions': [2, 4, 5]}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the molecular structures.\")\n    print(\"The four molecules are Iridium(III) complexes.
