    Analyzes the provided image to determine the connectivity of the PGp area.

    The image displays polar plots for five inferior parietal lobule (IPL) areas.
    The task is to identify the areas most strongly connected to PGp.

    1. Locate the 'PGp' plot in the image (bottom right).
    2. Identify the connections with the highest strength. Strength is indicated by the
       length of the wedge, and significant connections extend beyond the inner black circle.
    3. The PGp plot shows the strongest connections are in the 'Insula' region.
    4. The specific labels for these connections are 'Id1', 'Ig2', and 'Ig1'.
    5. This corresponds to answer choice G.
