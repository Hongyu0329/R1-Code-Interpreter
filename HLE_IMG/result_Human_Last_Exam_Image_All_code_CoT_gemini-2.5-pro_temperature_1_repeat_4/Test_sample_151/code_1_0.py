    This function provides the IUPAC name for the product of the given reaction sequence.
    The reaction sequence involves:
    1. Knoevenagel/elimination to form an acrylate-phosphonate intermediate.
    2. A domino Michael addition/intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.
    Based on a step-by-step mechanistic analysis, a 5-membered ring is formed.
    The final IUPAC name is constructed based on the structure of this 5-membered heterocyclic product.
