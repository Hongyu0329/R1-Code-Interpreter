    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the painting:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will examine the key elements in the painting fragment. The central subject is a windmill under a dark, stormy sky. In the background to the right, there appears to be a fire or a burning building. The style, with its dramatic lighting and atmosphere, is characteristic of 19th-century Romanticism.\n2.  **Identify the artwork:** Using these visual cues, I will search for paintings matching this description. The specific combination of a windmill, a storm, and a fire points to a well-known work from that period.\n3.  **Formulate the answer:** Once the painting is identified, I will provide its title. I will present this information in a simple Python script that prints the name of the painting, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_painting_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the title of the provided painting.\n    The painting is a 19th-century work by the Russian artist Maxim Vorobiev.\n    It depicts a windmill under a stormy sky with a fire in the background,\n    a theme that is a Romantic reinterpretation of earlier Dutch landscapes.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"The Oak Fractured by Lightning\"\n    artist = \"Maxim Vorobiev\"\n    year = \"1842\"\n\n    print(f\"The title of the 19th-century painting is: {title}\")\n    print(f\"It was painted by {artist} in {year}.\")\n\nfind_painting_title()\n```\n<<<The Oak Fractured by Lightning>>>"
