# The user wants me to identify the correct Nyala from the given images.
# I have analyzed the distinctive features of the target Nyala, such as its horn shape, stripe pattern, and especially the unique spot pattern on its flank.
# By comparing these features with each of the options, I have concluded that image D shows the same individual.
# The horn curvature and the specific arrangement of spots behind the front leg are identical between the target and image D.

# I will now print the letter corresponding to the correct image.
correct_image = 'D'
