    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to identify the \"Intermediate\" product.**\n    *   The reactants are 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the primary amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom, displacing the chloride ion (Cl-). This is an SN2 reaction.\n    *   The conditions (DME, Reflux) are suitable for this substitution. While a subsequent cyclization is possible, the problem labels the product as \"Intermediate\" which is then used in a second, distinct step. This suggests the most likely intermediate is the stable, uncyclized substitution product.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is `ethyl 2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanoate`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to identify the final \"Product\".**\n    *   The intermediate is reacted first with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) and then with benzylamine.\n    *   This two-step procedure is a standard method in organic chemistry for the selective conversion of an ester into an amide. The trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester's carbonyl group, which is then attacked by benzylamine.\n    *   This transforms the ethyl ester group (-COOEt) of the intermediate into an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n    *   The structure of the final product is `N-benzyl-2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanamide`.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n    *   I will systematically count the number of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) atoms in the final product's structure, `N-benzyl-2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanamide`.\n    *   The final formula will be presented as a string, e.g., CxHyNzOwSs.\n\n4.  **Write Python code to perform the atom count and print the result.**\n    *   The code will break down the molecule into its constituent parts (thiazole ring, backbone chain, benzyl group) and sum up the atoms for each element.\n    *   The code will then print the calculation and the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the reaction scheme.\n    The final product is N-benzyl-2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanamide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Atom counts for each part of the molecule\n    # 1.
