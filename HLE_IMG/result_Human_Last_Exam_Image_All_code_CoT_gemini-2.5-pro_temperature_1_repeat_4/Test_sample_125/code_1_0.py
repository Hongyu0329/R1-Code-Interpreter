# The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to synthesize a complex molecule.
# Based on chemical principles, the synthesis can be broken down into three main stages.

# Step 1: Oxidation of the starting material to create a necessary functional group (aldehyde).
step_1_oxidation = 1

# Step 2: A one-pot condensation reaction (Chichibabin pyridine synthesis) to assemble the large precursor.
step_2_condensation = 1

# Step 3: A final cyclization and aromatization step (Scholl reaction) to form the target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
step_3_cyclization = 1

# The minimum total number of steps is the sum of these individual, distinct chemical transformations.
total_steps = step_1_oxidation + step_2_condensation + step_3_cyclization

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation representing the total number of steps is the sum of the individual steps.
print(f"{step_1_oxidation} + {step_2_condensation} + {step_3_cyclization} = {total_steps}")
print("The minimum number of steps is 3.")

# Final answer format
# print(f'<<<{total_steps}>>>')
