    "My thinking process to solve this riddle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image and the first clue**: The image features two men at an awards ceremony. The man on the right is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player. The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019. The date in the clue, June 20, 2019, is likely referring to this event, possibly with a one-day discrepancy. At this event, Kucherov won the Hart Memorial Trophy, the Art Ross Trophy, and the Ted Lindsay Award.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue**: The second clue, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts,\" is a key piece of historical and chemical information. This points directly to the process of making felt for hats. Historically, mercuric nitrate (a mercury salt) was used to treat fur to create felt. This process was extremely toxic to the hat makers, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". The use of mercury in felt making has since been discontinued. This strongly suggests that \"X Y\" is **Felt Hat**.\n\n3.  **Connect the two clues**: Now I need to link \"Felt Hat\" to the scene in the picture. The connection is a pun. While Nikita Kucherov is pictured holding the Art Ross Trophy, the most prestigious award he won that night was the **Hart** Memorial Trophy for being the league's Most Valuable Player. The word \"Hart\" is a homophone of \"Hat\". Therefore, the clue \"Felt Hat is pictured\" is solved through this play on words: a winner of the \"Hart\" (Hat) trophy is pictured, and the historical context of mercury points to a \"Felt\" hat.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by breaking it down into two parts\n    and connecting them with a pun.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Analyze the clue about mercury salts.\n    # The clue \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts\"\n    # refers to the historical process of making felt. Mercuric nitrate was used to make\n    # felt for hats, a practice now discontinued due to its toxicity.\n    # This identifies \"X Y\" as \"Felt Hat\".\n    X = \"Felt\"\n    Y = \"Hat\"\n\n    # Part 2: Connect \"Felt Hat\" to the image.\n    # The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    # At this event, he won the \"Hart\" Memorial Trophy.\n    # The word \"Hart\" sounds the same as \"Hat\".\n    connection = \"The 'Hart' Trophy sounds like 'Hat'.\"\n\n    # Conclusion: The two clues connect through this pun.\n    final_answer = f\"{X} {Y}\"\n\n    print(f\"Clue 1 Analysis: The image shows the winner of the 'Hart' Memorial Trophy.\")\n    print(f\"Clue 2 Analysis: The process of making '{X}' for hats with mercury salts has ceased.\")\n    print(f\"The Connection (Pun): 'Hart' sounds like '{Y}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Therefore, X Y is: {final_answer}\")\n\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<Felt Hat>>>\n```"
