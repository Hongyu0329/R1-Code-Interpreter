    "This is a famous piece of music from a video game. I will identify the piece based on its key signature, melody, and characteristic arpeggiated patterns. The music is in A major, features a very distinctive and memorable melody, and is well-known for its fast, virtuosic arpeggios, particularly in its many piano arrangements. The piece is \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", the theme of Flandre Scarlet from the game *Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the music.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music from the provided sheet music.\n\n    The sheet music displays a piano arrangement of a popular video game theme.\n    Key characteristics include:\n    - Key Signature: A Major (3 sharps: F#, C#, G#)\n    - Time Signature: 4/4\n    - Tempo: Quarter note = 80\n    - A distinctive melody followed by rapid, virtuosic sixteenth-note arpeggios.\n\n    Based on these features, the piece is identified as \"U.N.
