The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). It can be used as a prognostic marker because its binding to RAGE directly initiates the signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, its levels can predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.
