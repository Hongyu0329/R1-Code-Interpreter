  # Part 1: Receptor Identification
  receptor_info = "Based on the diagram, the protein S100B has a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). The arrow from S100B clearly points to its binding on the extracellular domain of the RAGE receptor."

  # Part 2: Marker Role Explanation
  marker_explanation = (
      "S100B should be considered a prognostic marker, not just an adjunct one. Here's the reasoning:\n\n"
      "1.  A prognostic marker is used to predict the likely course or outcome of a disease. An adjunct marker merely assists in making a diagnosis.\n"
      "2.  The diagram shows that the binding of S100B to RAGE directly triggers signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that result in key pathological outcomes: apoptosis (cell death), neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.\n"
      "3.  Since S100B is an upstream driver of these processes, its levels would directly correlate with the severity and rate of disease progression. Higher S100B levels would predict a worse prognosis, which is the exact function of a prognostic marker."
  )

  # Final concise answer to be wrapped in the special format
  final_answer = "The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). It can be used as a prognostic marker because its binding to RAGE directly initiates the signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, its levels can predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder."
