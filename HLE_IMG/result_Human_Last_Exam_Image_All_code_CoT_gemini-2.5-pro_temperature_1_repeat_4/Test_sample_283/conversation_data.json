    "This is a fascinating historical puzzle based on modern data. Let's break down the clues from the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Peaks:** I will examine the graph to determine the approximate dates of the annual peaks for each of the three colored lines (red, yellow, and blue). These peaks represent a surge in search interest, which typically happens around the anniversary of a significant event or a public holiday.\n2.  **Correlate Dates with Events:** I will correlate these annual dates with major historical events or national observances of various countries.\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows a sharp peak every year around late January. This timing strongly suggests Australia Day, which is celebrated on January 26th.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Shows a very strong peak every year in late April. This corresponds perfectly with Anzac Day on April 25th, a major day of remembrance in Australia (and New Zealand).\n    *   **Blue Line:** Shows smaller, but consistent, annual peaks around late May and early June. This aligns with Australia's National Reconciliation Week, which runs from May 27th to June 3rd and includes significant dates like National Sorry Day and Mabo Day.\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The timing of all three distinct sets of events points to a single country. The combination of Australia Day (January), Anzac Day (April), and National Reconciliation Week events (May/June) is unique to Australia. Therefore, the country must be Australia.\n\nI will now provide a python script that states the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n\n    - The red line's annual peak in late January corresponds to Australia Day (Jan 26).\n    - The yellow line's annual peak in late April corresponds to Anzac Day (Apr 25).\n    - The blue line's annual peak in late May/early June corresponds to National Reconciliation Week.\n\n    These three events are uniquely significant to one country.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"Australia\"\n    print(f\"The country where these three historic events took place is: {country}\")\n\nsolve_country_mystery()\n<<<Australia>>>\n```"
