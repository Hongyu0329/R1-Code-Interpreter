    "Based on a careful analysis of the runes in the provided image, I have identified the runestone.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Transliteration**: The runes visible in the image can be transliterated into Latin characters. The script is Younger Futhark.\n    *   The top row clearly shows the runes for **r-a-i-s-a** (ᚱᛅᛁᛋᛅ). This corresponds to the Old Norse word `ræisa`, meaning \"to raise\".\n    *   The middle row shows **s-t-a-i-n** (ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ). This corresponds to the Old Norse word `stæin`, meaning \"stone\".\n    *   The bottom row shows **þ-i-n-s-a** (ᚦᛁᚾᛋᛅ). This corresponds to the Old Norse word `þennsa`, meaning \"this\".\n2.  **Identification**: The sequence `ræisa stæin þennsa` (\"to raise this stone\") is a common phrase on runestones. However, the user specified it is an \"Ingvar runestone\". This specific fragment is famously from the Gripsholm Runestone.\n3.  **Confirmation**: The Gripsholm Runestone is one of the most well-known Ingvar runestones. Its inscription begins: \"Tóla had this stone raised (`ræisa stæin þennsa`) in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother...\"\n4.  **Runestone ID**: The official catalog ID for the Gripsholm Runestone is **Sö 179**. The \"Sö\" stands for the province of Södermanland in Sweden.\n\nThe following Python code will print this identification.\n\n```python\ndef find_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment\n    and prints its official catalog ID.\n    \n    The analysis is based on transliterating the visible runes:\n    - Top row: r-a-i-s-a -> 'ræisa' (to raise)\n    - Middle row: s-t-a-i-n -> 'stæin' (stone)\n    - Bottom row: þ-i-n-s-a -> 'þennsa' (this)\n    \n    This text fragment, 'ræisa stæin þennsa', is from the famous Gripsholm Runestone,\n    which is an Ingvar runestone. Its catalog ID is Sö 179.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    number_part = 179\n    \n    # Deconstruct the number to print each digit as requested\n    n1 = number_part // 100\n    n2 = (number_part // 10) % 10\n    n3 = number_part % 10\n    \n    print(\"The runestone depicted in the image is the Gripsholm Runestone.\")\n    print(f\"Its official catalog ID is {province_code} {n1}{n2}{n3}.\")\n\nfind_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
