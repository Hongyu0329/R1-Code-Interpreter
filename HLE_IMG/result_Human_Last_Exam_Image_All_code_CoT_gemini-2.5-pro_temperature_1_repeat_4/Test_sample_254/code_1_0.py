# It doesn't say "at the end of the code block". So I will put it at the very end of the whole response.
# The prompt says "Don't include multiple code blocks". So I will just have one.
# It also says "use 'print' function for the output when relevant". My code does this.
# The final result should be printed by the script.
# Let's add a final print statement to the script for the <<<>>> format.
# No, that's not what it means. It means I, the AI, should literally write <<<41.0>>> at the end of my text response.

# The prompt now also says "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
# Let's adjust the final print statement to be more explicit.
# Done in the code above.

# The code is ready.
