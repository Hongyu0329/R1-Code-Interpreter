    "This is a classic mass spectrometry problem. To solve it, we need to analyze the molecular ion and the major fragment peaks, paying close attention to isotopic patterns, which are a dead giveaway for certain elements like chlorine and bromine.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, assigned a relative intensity of 100%. From the table and graph, the base peak is at **m/z = 225**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak:** We see significant peaks at m/z 225 (I=100%) and m/z 227 (I=66.7%). The ratio of their intensities is 100 / 66.7 ≈ 3 / 2. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes being roughly 3:1, the pattern for a Cl₂ species is M⁺:(M+2)⁺ ≈ 9:6 or 3:2).\n\n3.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The molecular ion peak is the peak corresponding to the intact molecule. It should be in the highest m/z region of the spectrum. We see a prominent cluster of peaks starting at **m/z = 260**. Let's assume this is the molecular ion (containing only the lightest isotopes).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have the molecular ion at m/z = 260 and the base peak (a fragment) at m/z = 225.\n    *   The mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 amu. This corresponds to the mass of one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n    *   This implies that the molecule fragments by losing one chlorine atom to form the base peak: `[M]⁺• → [M-Cl]⁺`.\n    *   Since the fragment `[M-Cl]⁺` (at m/z 225) contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule `M` must have contained **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   Now we can find the mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule (let's call it 'R'). From the base peak: `mass(R) + 2 * mass(³⁵Cl) = 225` → `mass(R) + 70 = 225` → `mass(R) = 155`.\n    *   The most plausible chemical formula for a hydrocarbon radical 'R' with a mass of 155 is **C₁₂H₁₁** (12 * 12 + 11 * 1 = 155).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Fragmentation Pathway:**\n    *   **Molecule:** `[C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃]⁺•` (m/z 260 for the lightest isotopes)\n    *   **Loss of 1st Cl:** `[C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺` (m/z 225). This matches our base peak.\n    *   **Loss of 2nd Cl:** Look for a peak at 225 - 35 = 190. The spectrum shows a major peak at **m/z = 190** (I=48.4%). This is `[C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺`.\n    *   **Loss of 3rd Cl:** Look for a peak at 190 - 35 = 155. The spectrum shows a peak at **m/z = 155** (I=16.1%). This is `[C₁₂H₁₁]⁺`.\n    *   The entire fragmentation cascade `M⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺ → [M-2Cl]⁺ → [M-3Cl]⁺` is clearly visible, confirming our analysis.\n\n6.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ has a high degree of unsaturation, suggesting aromatic rings.\n    *   A plausible structure that fits the formula is a trichlorinated derivative of phenylcyclohexene.\n    *   One such structure is **3,4,5-trichloro-1-phenylcyclohex-1-ene**. This structure is consistent with the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and its likely fragmentation behavior.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spec():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the step-by-step deduction to identify the compound\n    from its mass spectrum data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
