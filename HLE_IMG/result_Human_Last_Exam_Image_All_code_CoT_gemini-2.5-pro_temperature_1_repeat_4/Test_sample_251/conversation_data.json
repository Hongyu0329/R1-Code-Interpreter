    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Grid:** The ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec. The grid is composed of large squares (5 mm) and small squares (1 mm).\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square:**\n    *   One large square (5 mm) represents 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n    *   One small square (1 mm) represents 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complexes). There is a significant pause on the fourth strip, starting just after the timestamp `0:06:08`.\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** I will count the number of large squares between the peaks of the R-waves surrounding this long pause. By placing the first R-wave on a major vertical line, I can count that the next R-wave falls exactly 8 large squares away.\n5.  **Calculate the Duration:** I will multiply the number of large squares by the time per large square to get the total duration in seconds.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final result and the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    The standard ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n    The grid consists of large squares, each 5 mm wide.\n    Therefore, the time for one large square is 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n    By inspecting the ECG strip, the longest interval between two R-waves\n    is found to be 8 large squares.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # ECG parameters\n    time_per_large_square = 0.2  # seconds\n    \n    # Measurement from the ECG strip\n    num_large_squares = 8\n    \n    # Calculation\n    longest_rr_interval = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(f\"The longest R-R interval is determined by measuring the number of large squares between the two R-waves of the longest pause.\")\n    print(f\"Number of large squares = {num_large_squares}\")\n    print(f\"Time per large square = {time_per_large_square} seconds\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_large_squares} large squares * {time_per_large_square} seconds/large square = {longest_rr_interval:.1f} seconds\")\n\ncalculate_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.6>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
