def get_product_name():
    """
    This function determines and returns the IUPAC name of the product.
    The reaction is an Oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by keto-enol tautomerization.

    1. Reactant: A 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene system (with an additional methoxy group).
       The reaction proceeds via a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.
    2. Intermediate: An enol is formed.
       (3-substituted cyclohex-1-en-1-ol)
    3. Tautomerization: The enol converts to the stable keto form.
       (3-substituted cyclohexan-1-one)
    4. Substituent analysis: The original side chain rearranges.
       Original side chain at C1: -C(H)(OCH3)-CH=CH-CH3
       New side chain at C3: -CH(CH3)-CH=C(H)(OCH3)
    5. IUPAC Naming of the product:
       - Parent: cyclohexanone
       - Position of substituent: 3
       - Name of substituent:
         - Numbering from point of attachment: -C1H(CH3)-C2H=C3H(OCH3)
         - It's a prop-2-en-1-yl group with a methyl at C1 and methoxy at C3.
         - Name: (3-methoxy-1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl)
       - Stereochemistry: The rearrangement favors a chair transition state
         with bulky groups in equatorial positions, which results in an (E)-alkene.
       - Final name: 3-((E)-3-methoxy-1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl)cyclohexanone
