# This script explains the final color calculation in the shader.
# It demonstrates that despite calculating three values (r, g, b),
# the final color only uses the first one (r), resulting in a greyscale image.

# Let's imagine at a certain pixel, the Worley() function returns these values:
r = 0.2
g = 0.25
b = 0.15

print(f"Calculated values are: r = {r}, g = {g}, b = {b}")

# The shader code for color is:
# COLOR.rgb = vec3(vec3(r, g, b).x);

# Step 1: A temporary vector is created from r, g, and b.
temp_vec = np.array([r, g, b])
print(f"Step 1: Create a temporary vector: [{temp_vec[0]}, {temp_vec[1]}, {temp_vec[2]}]")

# Step 2: The .x swizzle selects the first component of this vector.
selected_component = temp_vec[0]
print(f"Step 2: Select the '.x' component: {selected_component}")

# Step 3: A new vector is created for the final color,
# where all components are equal to the selected value.
final_color_vec = np.array([selected_component, selected_component, selected_component])
print(f"Step 3: Create the final color vector: [{final_color_vec[0]}, {final_color_vec[1]}, {final_color_vec[2]}]")

print("\nConclusion: The final RGB color is (r, r, r), which is always a shade of grey.")
print("This rules out the colored images A, B, and F.")
print("The shader generates Worley noise, which rules out rectangular images A and D.")
print("Between the remaining greyscale Worley patterns C and E, C has a density of points that better matches the 8+ points defined in the shader.")
print("\nTherefore, the correct image is C.")
