    "This is a complex tactical position where White has a strong attack against the Black king. The key to finding the best move is to calculate the consequences of the most forcing moves, which are checks.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising move, **Nh6+**:\n\n1.  **White plays Nh6+**. This is a check from the knight on f7. Black's king on g8 has no safe squares to move to (h8 is controlled by the knight, and f8 is controlled by the White queen on d5). Therefore, Black is forced to capture the knight.\n2.  **Black plays ...gxh6**. This is Black's only legal move. By capturing the knight, the g-file is opened up for Black's king, but critically, the h-file is now open for the White queen.\n3.  **White plays Qh5+**. The queen moves from d5 to h5, delivering a check. The Black king must move out of check. The only legal square is g7.\n4.  **Black plays ...Kg7**. Forced move.\n5.  **White plays Qg4+**. The queen shifts to g4, again checking the king. The king's only escape is back to the corner.\n6.  **Black plays ...Kh8**. Another forced move.\n7.  **White plays Qg8#**. The queen delivers the final blow. It's checkmate. The Black king is trapped and cannot move, and no piece can capture the White queen or block the check.\n\nSince Nh6+ leads to a forced checkmate, it is the best move by a wide margin. Other moves like Ne5+ or Nd6+ are also strong and lead to a winning advantage, but a forced mate is always superior.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and explains the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move = \"Nh6+\"\n    explanation = [\n        \"The best move for White is Nh6+.\",\n        \"This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence.\",\n        \"Let's break down the line:\",\n        \"1.
