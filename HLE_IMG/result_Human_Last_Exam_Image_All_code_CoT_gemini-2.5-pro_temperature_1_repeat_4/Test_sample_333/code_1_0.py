    This function provides the solution to the airfoil matching problem.
    It determines the correct pairing between each airfoil shape (A-H)

    # The pairings are determined as follows:
    # A -> 1 (Thin, low-medium camber)
    # B -> 8 (Thin, medium camber, more than A)
    # C -> 4 (Thin, S-camber, aft-loading)
    # D -> 2 (Thin, near-symmetric, lowest lift)
    # E -> 5 (Very thick, blunt nose, broad suction peak)
    # F -> 6 (Thick, drooped nose, sharp leading-edge spike)
    # G -> 7 (Thick, S-camber, aft-loading)
    # H -> 3 (Thick, moderate camber, high lift)
    
    # The final answer is the sequence of plot numbers for airfoils A through H.
