def solve_higgs_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Higgs branching ratio plot identification puzzle.

    The decay channels are listed in the order:
    {b-bbar, τ-τbar, c-cbar, gg, γγ, W+W-, ZZ, t-tbar}

    The analysis yields the following mapping from decay channel to plot number:
    - H -> b-bbar: Plot 4 (Dominant at low mass)
    - H -> τ-τbar: Plot 6 (m_τ > m_c, so BR is higher than c-cbar)
    - H -> c-cbar: Plot 7 (Less likely than τ-τbar)
    - H -> gg:     Plot 5 (Second most dominant decay at low mass)
    - H -> γγ:      Plot 8 (Rarest decay, lowest BR)
    - H -> W+W-:    Plot 1 (Dominant at high mass, opens at ~161 GeV)
    - H -> ZZ:      Plot 2 (Second dominant at high mass, opens at ~182 GeV)
    - H -> t-tbar:  Plot 3 (Opens only at very high mass, ~346 GeV)
