# The user wants me to select the best statement from a list of choices.
# This is a reasoning task based on provided biological data, not a coding task.
# I will print the final answer choice.

# Analysis Summary:
# 1. D. willistoni has two elements where D. melanogaster has one, suggesting a duplication.
#    This creates an ortholog/paralog pair.
# 2. RNA-Seq data shows different expression patterns for the left and right elements in D. willistoni,
#    indicating they are two separate genes.
# 3. Parsimony is used to identify the ortholog. The D. melanogaster gene (CG14879) mostly has 2 CDSs.
# 4. The analysis shows the 'right element' in D. willistoni also has a 2-CDS structure, which is
#    described as maximizing parsimony.
# 5. Therefore, the 'right element' is the ortholog, and the 'left element' is the paralog.
# 6. Option P correctly states: Left element is paralog, right is ortholog, the reason is CDS parsimony,
#    and they are separate genes. This matches all points of the analysis.

print("Reasoning:")
print("1. Gene Duplication: The presence of two elements in D. willistoni versus one in D. melanogaster implies a duplication event, resulting in one ortholog and one paralog.")
print("2. Separate Genes: Different RNA-Seq expression levels and tissue-specific patterns between the left and right elements indicate they are two separate genes, not parts of one.")
print("3. Ortholog Identification via Parsimony: The D. melanogaster gene (CG14879) predominantly has isoforms with 2 CDSs. The 'right element' in D. willistoni also has a predicted 2-CDS structure, which the text states maximizes parsimony. This conservation of structure makes the right element the likely ortholog.")
print("4. Conclusion: The right element is the ortholog, and the left element is the paralog. They are separate genes. Statement P accurately summarizes all these points.")
