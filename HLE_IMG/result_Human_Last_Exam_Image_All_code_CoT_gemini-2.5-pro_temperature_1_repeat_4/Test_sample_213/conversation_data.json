    "This sheet music is the orchestral introduction to the second act of an opera.\n\nMy plan to identify it is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Score:** I will examine the instruments listed (e.g., `2 gr. Fl.` for flutes, `engl. Horn` for English Horn, `I. Viol.` for first violins) and the language of the performance directions. The terms are in German (e.g., `Vorhang` for \"Curtain,\" `mit DÃ¤mpfer` for \"with mute\"). This strongly suggests a German or Austrian opera.\n2.  **Musical Style:** The score is for a large orchestra and features complex harmonies and detailed dynamic markings, which is characteristic of the late-Romantic or early 20th-century period.\n3.  **Identify Key Passage:** The music starts just before the curtain rises on Act 2, as indicated by \"1 (Vorhang)\". This is a very specific and identifiable point in an opera.\n4.  **Search and Identify:** By searching for \"opera opening Act 2 German Vorhang,\" combined with a reverse image search of the score, the piece can be uniquely identified. The bustling, chromatic, and richly orchestrated music is highly characteristic of the composer Richard Strauss. This specific passage is the opening of Act II of his opera *Der Rosenkavalier*.\n\nI will now provide the answer using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n    The sheet music is the opening of the second act of Richard Strauss's opera \"Der Rosenkavalier\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Der Rosenkavalier\"\n    print(f\"The name of the opera is: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
