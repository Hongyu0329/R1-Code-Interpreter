    "This is a well-known jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing its distinctive chord progression and melody.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Chords:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), and the first chord is F minor. This points to the key of F minor. The opening chord progression is `Fm - Eø7 - Eb6 - Dbmaj7`, which is a very characteristic \"minor line cliché\" where a note descends chromatically within the chord.\n2.  **Analyze the Melody:** The melody starts with a pickup on C, goes to C#, then D, Eb, F over the descending chords. This melodic line is also very recognizable.\n3.  **Identify the Tune:** Based on this combination of the key, chord progression, and melody, the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\".\n4.  **Identify the Composer:** The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the great jazz pianist and composer Horace Silver.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef find_jazz_standard_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nfind_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
