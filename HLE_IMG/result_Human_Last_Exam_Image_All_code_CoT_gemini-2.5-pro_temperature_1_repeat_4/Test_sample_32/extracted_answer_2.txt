The main distinguishing feature at a glance is the seta (the stalk holding the spore capsule). In Grimmia montana, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, Grimmia curviseta has a longer, distinctly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be emergent or exserted.
