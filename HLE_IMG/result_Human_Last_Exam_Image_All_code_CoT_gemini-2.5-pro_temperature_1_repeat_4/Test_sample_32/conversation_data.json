    "Based on botanical characteristics, the primary distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the nature of the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule). I will generate a Python script to print out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_moss_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the key difference between the sporophytes of\n    Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the characteristics for each species\n    g_montana = {\n        \"name\": \"Grimmia montana\",\n        \"seta\": \"very short and straight\",\n        \"capsule_position\": \"immersed among the leaves\"\n    }\n\n    g_curviseta = {\n        \"name\": \"Grimmia curviseta\",\n        \"seta\": \"longer and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked)\",\n        \"capsule_position\": \"emergent or exserted from the leaves\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule):\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"1.

In Grimmia montana, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, Grimmia curviseta has a longer, distinctly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be emergent or exserted.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
