    Analyzes the provided statements about kidney histopathology images.
    
    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Image B shows classic Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).
    2.  Image D shows classic Nodular Glomerulosclerosis.
    3.  A key conflict exists between Statement 1 and Statement 4 regarding Image D.
    4.  Statement 1 says Image D has no Kimmelstiel-Wilson (K-W) lesions.
    5.  Statement 4 says the arrows in Image D point to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposits suggestive of nodular glomerulosclerosis (which are K-W lesions).
    6.  K-W lesions are by definition made of ECM. So, statements 1 and 4 cannot both be true if Image D is diabetic nephropathy.
    7.  Let's consider an alternative diagnosis for Image D that mimics diabetic nephropathy, such as Light Chain Deposition Disease (LCDD). In LCDD, the nodules are protein deposits, not ECM, and they are not technically K-W lesions.
    8.  Under the LCDD interpretation for Image D:
        - Statement 1 becomes TRUE: The description fits Image B (FSGS). For Image D (interpreted as LCDD), the sclerosis is nodular (loosely "segmental") and the nodules are not K-W lesions.
        - Statement 4 becomes FALSE: The deposits in LCDD are light chain proteins, not extracellular matrix.
    9.  Statement 2 is FALSE because it misidentifies the pathology in Image C.
    10. Statement 3 is FALSE due to ambiguous terminology and lack of clear evidence in Image C.
    11. This line of reasoning concludes that only statement [1] is true.
