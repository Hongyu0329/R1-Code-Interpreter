    print("This aligns well with the visual observation that the number and appearance of APT1-positive cells are comparable across all three panels. Thus, B is likely to be true.\n")

    # --- Statement C ---

    print("This is false. All three images clearly show brown-stained cells, which are indicated as APT1-positive. Thus, C is false.\n")

    # --- Statement D ---

    print("This is not supported by the visual evidence. The density of cells in the PDD panel is visually similar to the control and PD panels, not increased. Thus, D is unlikely.\n")
