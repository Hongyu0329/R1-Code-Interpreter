    print("The spectrum shows the following key signals:")
    print("- A triplet (t) around 1.1 ppm.")
    print("- A singlet (s) around 2.2 ppm.")
    print("- A quartet (q) around 2.5 ppm.")
    print("- A singlet (s) around 3.4 ppm.")
    print("- A multiplet (m) for aromatic protons around 7.1 ppm.")
    print("- A broad singlet (s) for an N-H proton around 9.0 ppm.")
    print("\nThe combination of a triplet at ~1.1 ppm and a quartet at ~2.5 ppm is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Evaluating Candidate Structures ---")
    print("Candidates A-G and B-G: These structures do not contain ethyl groups. They are inconsistent with the spectrum. They are eliminated.")
    print("Candidates C-L and D-L: Both contain a diethylamino group [-N(C2H5)2], which matches the triplet and quartet signals. The key difference is the number of methyl groups on the aromatic ring.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Differentiating C-L and D-L using Integration ---")
    print("Let's analyze the expected integration ratios for the methyl protons.")
    print("The triplet at ~1.1 ppm corresponds to the two methyls of the ethyl groups, representing 6 protons (6H).")
    print("The singlet at ~2.2 ppm corresponds to the methyl group(s) on the aromatic ring.\n")

    print("Analysis for Structure D-L (Lidocaine):")
    protons_aromatic_methyl_DL = 6
    protons_ethyl_methyl = 6
    ratio_DL = protons_aromatic_methyl_DL / protons_ethyl_methyl
    print(f"D-L has two aromatic methyl groups, for a total of {protons_aromatic_methyl_DL}H.")
    print(f"The expected integration equation is: Signal(Aromatic-CH3) : Signal(Ethyl-CH3) = {protons_aromatic_methyl_DL}H : {protons_ethyl_methyl}H")
    print(f"The predicted ratio of the singlet area to the triplet area is {protons_aromatic_methyl_DL}/{protons_ethyl_methyl} = {ratio_DL:.1f}")
    print("Observation: The singlet at 2.2 ppm in the spectrum is clearly smaller than the triplet at 1.1 ppm. This contradicts the 1:1 ratio predicted for D-L.\n")

    print("Analysis for Structure C-L:")
    protons_aromatic_methyl_CL = 3
    ratio_CL = protons_aromatic_methyl_CL / protons_ethyl_methyl
    print(f"C-L has one aromatic methyl group, for a total of {protons_aromatic_methyl_CL}H.")

    print(f"The predicted ratio of the singlet area to the triplet area is {protons_aromatic_methyl_CL}/{protons_ethyl_methyl} = {ratio_CL:.1f}")
    print("Observation: The singlet at 2.2 ppm appears to be roughly half the size of the triplet at 1.1 ppm. This is consistent with the 1:2 ratio predicted for C-L.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the integration analysis, structure C-L is the best match for the provided NMR spectrum. The other signals also align well with C-L's structure (N-H: 1H, Ar-H: 4H, CO-CH2: 2H, N-CH2: 4H). The small peak at 2.8 ppm is likely an impurity.")
