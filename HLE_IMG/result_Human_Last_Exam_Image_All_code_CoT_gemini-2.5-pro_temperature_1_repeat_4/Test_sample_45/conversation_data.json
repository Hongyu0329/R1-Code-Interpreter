    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which we can rotate the entire pattern and have it appear unchanged. The number of times the pattern aligns with its original orientation during a full 360-degree rotation is the order of rotational symmetry.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify a central point or feature in the tiling that can serve as a center of rotation. A good candidate is the center of one of the dark blue, regular hexagons.\n2.  Observe the arrangement of tiles around this central point. Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six identical light-yellow pentagons.\n3.  Determine the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged. Since there are 6 identical surrounding shapes, rotating the pattern by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around the hexagon's center will map each surrounding tile onto an identical one, leaving the overall appearance of the tiling the same.\n4.  The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times this operation can be performed in a full circle, which is 6.\n5.  The Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to find the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the rotational symmetry, we look for a center of rotation and count how many times the pattern looks the same during a 360-degree turn.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify a center of rotation.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue, regular hexagons as our point of rotation.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the surrounding pattern.\")\n    print(\"Each blue hexagon is surrounded by 6 identical light-yellow pentagonal shapes.\")\n    \n    n_sides = 6\n    print(f\"The number of identical repeating units around the center is {n_sides}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the smallest angle of rotation.\")\n    print(\"The smallest angle that leaves the pattern unchanged is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of repeating units.\")\n    \n    angle = 360 / n_sides\n    \n    print(f\"The calculation is: 360 / {n_sides} = {int(angle)} degrees.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Determine the order of rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"Since the pattern matches itself {n_sides} times in a full 360-degree rotation, the tiling has a {n_sides}-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n\nsolve_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
