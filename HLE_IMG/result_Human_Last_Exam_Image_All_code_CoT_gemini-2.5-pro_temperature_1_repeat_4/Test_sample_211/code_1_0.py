  This function analyzes the images of the Sociable weavers to find the match.
  
  Analysis Steps:
  1. Observe the target image, focusing on the scalloped feather pattern on the back.
  2. Identify a unique marking: a small, distinct dark spot on the upper back, slightly to the left of the spine.
  3. Examine the long flight feathers on the wing, noting the prominent white edges.
  4. Compare these features with each of the options (A-I).
  5. Option G exhibits the exact same dark spot in the same location.
  6. The scalloped pattern and the white wing edges in option G also precisely match the target image.
  7. Therefore, G is the correct match.
