    "I will identify the four Chinese characters on the seal face and their reading order. Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character**: This character is `書` (shū), which means \"book\" or \"calligraphy\".\n2.  **Bottom-Right Character**: This character is `畫` (huà), which means \"painting\".\n3.  **Top-Left Character**: This character is `不` (bù), a negative particle meaning \"not\".\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character**: This character is `如` (rú), which means \"as good as\" or \"like\".\n\nReading them in order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left), the phrase is `書畫不如` (shū huà bù rú). This is a philosophical phrase often found on seals, which translates to \"Calligraphy and painting are not as good as...\". The phrase intentionally leaves the object of comparison unstated, inviting contemplation.\n\nI will now convert these traditional characters to their simplified forms and provide a Python script to print the result.\n\n*   `書` -> `书`\n*   `畫` -> `画`\n*   `不` -> `不` (same)\n*   `如` -> `如` (same)\n\nThe simplified phrase is `书画不如`.\n\n```python\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the simplified Chinese characters found on the seal.\n  The characters are read from top to bottom, right to left.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The characters identified on the seal in traditional Chinese are 書, 畫, 不, 如.\n  # Converted to simplified Chinese, they are:\n  char1 = \"书\"  # shū (calligraphy)\n  char2 = \"画\"  # huà (painting)\n  char3 = \"不\"  # bù (not)\n  char4 = \"如\"  # rú (as good as)\n  \n  # The phrase reads \"shū huà bù rú\"\n  full_phrase = f\"{char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\"\n  \n  print(f\"The simplified Chinese characters on the seal are: {full_phrase}\")\n\nget_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<书画不如>>>"
