    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 -> 2):** I will carefully examine the structural changes between the starting material (1) and the first product (2). The key transformation is the replacement of an atom in the core ring system. This will allow me to deduce the identity of reagent A, which must provide the new atoms.\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 -> 3):** I will compare the structure of compound 2 with the final product (3). This reaction involves two distinct changes: a substitution on one part of the molecule and a modification of the group introduced in the first step. Reagent B must be responsible for these changes, primarily by providing the new functional group.\n3.  **Identify Reagents A and B:** Based on the analysis of the transformations, I will identify the chemical structures and names for reagents A and B. Reagent A introduces an N-amino group, and Reagent B introduces an N-propyl group while also causing a reduction.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to present the final answer clearly, as requested. The script will define the reagents and use `print()` statements to explain their roles in the reaction, referencing the compound numbers (1, 2, 3) as per the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Identify Reagent A for the transformation from 1 to 2\n    # The reaction 1 -> 2 involves replacing an oxygen atom in the central\n    # heterocyclic core with a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (-NH2).\n    # This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction.
