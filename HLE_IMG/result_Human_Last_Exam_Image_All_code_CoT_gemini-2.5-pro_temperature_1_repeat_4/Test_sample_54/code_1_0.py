    # the -N-NH2 unit is hydrazine.

    # The reaction 2 -> 3 involves two changes:
    # 1. An oxygen atom in another part of the core is replaced by a nitrogen
    #    atom bearing a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3).
    # 2. The N-amino group (-N-NH2) from compound 2 is reduced to an N-H group.
    # Reagent B must be the source of the N-propyl group. The simplest such reagent
    # is n-propylamine. It acts as a nucleophile for the substitution reaction. The
    # reduction of the N-NH2 group likely occurs under the reaction conditions (e.g., heat).
