    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The provided image is a diagram of a mathematical knot. I will first identify which specific knot it is by analyzing its properties, such as the number of crossings. The diagram shows a knot with 7 crossings. By comparing it to standard knot tables (like the Rolfsen table), this knot is identified as the **7₄ knot**. It is also an **alternating knot**, which can be verified by tracing a path along the knot and observing that the crossings alternate between over and under.\n\n2.  **Apply the Relevant Theorem:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer invariant derived from Khovanov homology. For the special class of alternating knots, a major theorem by Jacob Rasmussen provides a direct link between the Rasmussen invariant and the classical knot signature, `σ(K)`. The theorem states:\n    `s(K) = σ(K)` for any alternating knot `K`.\n\n3.  **Find the Knot Signature:** The knot signature, `σ(K)`, is a well-established invariant. For the 7₄ knot, its signature is a known value that can be found in knot theory references. The signature of the 7₄ knot is -4.\n    `σ(7₄) = -4`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:** Using the theorem from step 2 and the signature value from step 3, the Rasmussen invariant can be calculated directly.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this logic and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Rasmussen invariant of the knot provided in the image\n    by identifying the knot, applying the relevant theorem for alternating knots,\n    and using the known value of its knot signature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identification of the knot\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the knot.\")\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot.
