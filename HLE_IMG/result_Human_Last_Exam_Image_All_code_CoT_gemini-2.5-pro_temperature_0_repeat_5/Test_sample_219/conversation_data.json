    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are the dense vertical bands of dots. I will estimate the center time for each of these bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of identified bursts.\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum the calculated IBIs and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps, including the identified burst times, the individual intervals, the final equation for the average, and the result rounded to two significant figures.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# Visually inspecting the plot, the dense vertical bands (bursts) are centered at approximately:\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 17.5, 35.5, 48.5]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The IBI is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\nintervals = []\nprint(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\nfor i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n    intervals.append(interval)\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval:.1f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(intervals)\nprint(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n# Construct the equation string\nequation_str = f\"({intervals[0]:.1f} + {intervals[1]:.1f} + {intervals[2]:.1f}) / 3 = {average_ibi:.3f} s\"\nprint(equation_str)\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n# To round to 2 significant figures, we can use a format specifier.\n# For a number like 15.333..., two significant figures would be 15.\nrounded_average_ibi = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {rounded_average_ibi} s\")\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
