    "My plan is to identify the characters on the seal and then provide them in simplified Chinese.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Seal Script:** The characters on the seal are in an ancient style called Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū).\n2.  **Reading Order:** Traditional Chinese seals are read from right to left, and top to bottom. So, the order is: top-right character, bottom-right character, top-left character, bottom-left character.\n3.  **Character Identification (Traditional):**\n    *   Top-right: 景 (jǐng) - scenery, view\n    *   Bottom-right: 園 (yuán) - garden, park\n    *   Top-left: 不 (bù) - not, no\n    *   Bottom-left: 廢 (fèi) - to abandon, to abolish, to waste\n4.  **Combine and Translate to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   The traditional phrase is 景園不廢.\n    *   Converting to simplified characters:\n        *   景 remains 景.\n        *   園 becomes 园.\n        *   不 remains 不.\n        *   廢 becomes 废.\n    *   The final simplified phrase is 景园不废.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print these characters.\n\n```python\n# The characters on the seal are read from top to bottom, right to left.\n# The traditional characters are 景園不廢.\n# This script will print the simplified Chinese equivalent.\n\nsimplified_chinese_text = \"景园不废\"\nprint(simplified_chinese_text)\n```\n<<<景园不废>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
