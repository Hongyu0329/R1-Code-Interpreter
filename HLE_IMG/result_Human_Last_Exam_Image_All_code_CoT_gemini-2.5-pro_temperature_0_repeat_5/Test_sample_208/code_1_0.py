    This script solves the Clockwork Conundrum riddle.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. At noon, both hands are at 12.
    2. The hour hand moves in steps of 3 hours (12 -> 3).
    3. The minute hand moves a quarter turn, which is also 3 hours on the clock face (12 -> 3).
    4. In the very first step, both hands move to the '3', so they meet there.
    5. A clock state with the hour hand at 3 and the minute hand at 3 represents the time 3:15.
    6. Since the event is after noon, it's 3:15 PM.
    7. In 24-hour format (airline convention), this is 15:15.
    """

    # The position on the clock where the hands meet.
    meeting_position = 3

    # The hour value is the position of the hour hand.
    hour_value_12h = meeting_position

    # The minute value is the position of the minute hand multiplied by 5.
    minute_value = meeting_position * 5

    # The final equation to convert the PM hour to 24-hour format.
    # We add 12 to the 12-hour format hour.
    hour_value_24h = hour_value_12h + 12

    print(f"This corresponds to an hour of: {hour_value_12h}")
    print(f"And minutes of: {minute_value}")
    print("The equation to convert the hour to 24-hour format is: hour + 12")
    print(f"So, the hour is: {hour_value_12h} + 12 = {hour_value_24h}")
