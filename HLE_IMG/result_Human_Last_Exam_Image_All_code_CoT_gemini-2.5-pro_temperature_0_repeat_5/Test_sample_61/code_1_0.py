# Step 1: Analyze the reaction and determine the final product.
# The reaction is a phase-transfer catalyzed alkylation of methyl 1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2-carboxylate (1)
# with benzyl bromide (2). The strongly basic and aqueous conditions (5 eq. 50% KOH) will cause
# subsequent saponification of the methyl ester and decarboxylation of the resulting beta-keto acid.
# The net result is the replacement of the -COOMe group on compound 1 with a benzyl group from compound 2.
# However, it's more accurate to think of it as the alkylation of 1-indanone.
# The overall transformation is:
# Reactant 1 (-COOMe group is removed) + Benzyl group -> Product A
# This is equivalent to starting with 1-indanone and adding a benzyl group at the C2 position.
# The final product, A, is 2-benzyl-1-indanone.

# Step 2: Calculate the molecular formula of the final product, 2-benzyl-1-indanone.
# We can calculate this by considering the formula of the 1-indanone core and the benzyl group substituent.

# Define the atomic composition of the 1-indanone core structure.
# The molecular formula of 1-indanone is C9H8O.
indanone_core = {'C': 9, 'H': 8, 'O': 1}
print("The reaction effectively produces a substituted 1-indanone.")
print(f"The base structure is 1-indanone, which has the formula C{indanone_core['C']}H{indanone_core['H']}O{indanone_core['O']}.")

# Define the atomic composition of the benzyl group (-CH2-Ph).
# The formula of a benzyl group is C7H7.
benzyl_group = {'C': 7, 'H': 7}
print("\nA benzyl group is added as a substituent.")
print(f"The formula of the benzyl group is C{benzyl_group['C']}H{benzyl_group['H']}.")

# The reaction replaces one hydrogen atom from the C2 position of the 1-indanone core with the benzyl group.
print("\nTo form the final product, one hydrogen atom is removed from the indanone core and replaced by the benzyl group.")

# Step 3: Calculate the final molecular formula for compound A.
product_A = {}
product_A['C'] = indanone_core['C'] + benzyl_group['C']
product_A['H'] = indanone_core['H'] - 1 + benzyl_group['H']
product_A['O'] = indanone_core['O']

print("\nLet's calculate the total number of atoms in the final product A:")
print(f"Total Carbon (C) atoms = {indanone_core['C']} (from indanone) + {benzyl_group['C']} (from benzyl) = {product_A['C']}")
print(f"Total Hydrogen (H) atoms = {indanone_core['H']} (from indanone) - 1 (H replaced) + {benzyl_group['H']} (from benzyl) = {product_A['H']}")
print(f"Total Oxygen (O) atoms = {indanone_core['O']} (from indanone) = {product_A['O']}")

# Step 4: Display the final molecular formula.
molecular_formula = f"C{product_A['C']}H{product_A['H']}O{product_A['O']}"
print(f"\nTherefore, the molecular formula of compound A is {molecular_formula}.")
