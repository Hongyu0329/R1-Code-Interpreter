    "To find the Jones polynomial of the knot in the image, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot**: First, I'll identify the knot from its diagram. By counting the 10 crossings and observing its structure, I can identify it as the knot `10_124` from the Rolfsen knot table. This knot is famous for being one of the \"Perko pair\" knots.\n2.  **Determine Knot Properties**: I will look up the properties of the `10_124` knot. Crucially, this is a *non-alternating* knot. This is important because the standard theorems relating diagram features to the polynomial apply only to alternating knots.\n3.  **Compute the Jones Polynomial**: I will use a reliable Python library, `spherogram`, which is designed for computational knot theory, to calculate the Jones polynomial. Different conventions exist for the Jones polynomial; I will select the one that produces a Laurent polynomial, as suggested by the format in the user's request (`-3t^3 + t - t^{-1} + 5t^{-10}`). The `spherogram` library computes a version, let's call it `J(t)`, which is related to the desired Laurent polynomial version `V(t)` by the transformation `V(t) = J(t⁻¹)`.\n4.  **Format the Output**: Finally, I will write a Python script that performs these computations and formats the resulting polynomial into a string, ordered by decreasing powers of `t`, and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\n\ndef get_knot_jones_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Jones polynomial for the knot shown in the image (10_124)\n    and prints it in a standard mathematical format.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # The knot in the image is the 10_124 knot, also known as a Perko pair knot.\n        # We can create a Knot object for it using its standard name.\n        knot = spherogram.Knot('10_124')\n\n        # The spherogram library calculates a specific version of the Jones polynomial.\n        # Let's call it J(t).
