    This function determines the parameter changes for six simulations of coupled thermosiphons.
    
    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Plot 3 is identified as the reference simulation ('0') because it shows a canonical, well-formed chaotic attractor.
    2.  Plot 1 shows an attractor with looser spirals compared to Plot 3, which is characteristic of a halved Prandtl number ('p').
    3.  Plot 2 displays a much larger and more chaotic attractor, indicating a doubled Rayleigh number ('R').
    4.  Plot 4 shows the two systems are synchronized, with their trajectories overlapping. This is due to a doubled Biot (coupling) number ('B').
    5.  Plot 5 shows the system decaying to a stable point, which is caused by halving the Rayleigh number ('r').
    6.  Plot 6 exhibits a strong asymmetry, with the blue attractor being larger than the orange one. This is consistent with a doubled temperature ratio mu ('M').
    
    Combining these findings in order from plot 1 to 6 gives the final answer.
