    "Of the organisms visible in the photo, the most definitive indicator of an Atlantic coast location (as opposed to a Pacific one) is the common periwinkle snail.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the key species in the image. The photo shows a typical rocky shore community with barnacles and several species of snails.\n2.  Focus on the snails, as they are often geographically distinct. The snails present appear to be common periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*).\n3.  Research the geographic distribution of this species. The common periwinkle is native to the northeastern Atlantic (Europe) and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It is now widespread and abundant there.\n4.  Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is not established on the Pacific coast of North America. Its presence is therefore a strong indicator that the photo was taken on an Atlantic shoreline.\n5.  I will write a simple Python script to print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species\n  that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The image contains several species, including barnacles and snails.\n  # The Common Periwinkle snail (Littorina littorea) is visible.\n  # This species is common on the North American Atlantic coast but is not found on the Pacific coast.\n  # Therefore, its presence is the definitive indicator.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the species indicating an Atlantic Coast location is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
