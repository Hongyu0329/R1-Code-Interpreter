    This function determines and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical scheme.
    
    The reaction involves the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-bromoketone.
    By comparing the atoms in the starting ketone and the final imidazole product, we can deduce
    the structure and name of the required co-reactant.

    Starting Ketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    Product: tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate

    The ketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.
    The reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with their substituents.
    This corresponds to a substituted aminoguanidine derivative.
