# This problem is a multiple-choice question based on logical deduction and interpretation of biological data.
# No calculation or coding is required to arrive at the answer.
# The reasoning process is as follows:
# 1. The presence of two elements in D. willistoni vs. one in D. melanogaster suggests a gene duplication event, resulting in one ortholog and one paralog.
# 2. The text states that RNA-Seq shows differential expression between the left and right elements, indicating they are separate genes.
# 3. The text focuses on the "right element" and shows that its predicted gene structure (2 CDSs) is parsimonious with the common structure of the CG14879 gene in D. melanogaster.
# 4. This makes the right element the likely ortholog (conserved copy) and the left element the likely paralog (diverged copy).
# 5. Option P correctly summarizes all these points: the ortholog/paralog assignment, the reasoning based on parsimony, and the conclusion that they are separate genes.

# Therefore, the final answer is P.
# The problem asks for a code block, so I will print the final answer from within a Python script.

final_answer = "P"
explanation = """The evidence supports that a gene duplication occurred in the D. willistoni lineage. The differential RNA-Seq expression between the two resulting elements indicates they are now separate genes. The 'right element' has a predicted two-CDS structure, which is more parsimonious with the D. melanogaster CG14879 gene than the 'left element' (for which less information is provided, implying it has diverged more). Therefore, the right element is the likely ortholog, and the left element is the likely paralog."""
