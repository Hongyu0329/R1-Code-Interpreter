    "I can help with that. Here is a python script to display the scientific name of the animal.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the animal in the image. The image shows an insect with a black body and distinct orange or red markings. It is perched on a yellow flower, which appears to be goldenrod. The insect's features, including its coloration, shape, and antennae, are characteristic of the Eastern Boxelder Bug.\n\nThe scientific name for the Eastern Boxelder Bug is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\nHere is the Python code to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and returns its scientific name.\n  The insect is identified as the Eastern Boxelder Bug.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the animal depicted in the center of the image is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the scientific name of the animal depicted in the center of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
