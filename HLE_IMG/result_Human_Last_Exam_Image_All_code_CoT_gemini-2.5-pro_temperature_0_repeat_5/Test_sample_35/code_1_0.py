    receptor_identification = "The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). The diagram shows S100B binding to the extracellular portion of RAGE, which consists of the V, C1, and C2 domains. The V-domain is known to be the primary binding site for many RAGE ligands, including S100B."

    marker_explanation = "S100B could be used as a prognostic marker, not merely as an adjunct one. A prognostic marker is used to predict the likely course or outcome of a disease. The signaling pathway shows that S100B binding to RAGE activates downstream cascades (like JNK/JUN and NF-ÎºB) that directly lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since elevated levels of S100B actively drive the progression and worsening of the pathology, its concentration can be used to predict the future severity and course of the neurological disorder. Therefore, a higher level of S100B would suggest a poorer prognosis."
