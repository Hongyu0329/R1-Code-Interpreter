    "Answering this question requires interpreting the Heegaard diagram to determine the fundamental group of the three-manifold it represents. If the fundamental group is trivial, the manifold is the 3-sphere, S³.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Generators:** The fundamental group of the manifold has one generator for each α-curve. In this genus-3 diagram, we have three α-curves (α₁, α₂, α₃), so we will have three generators (x₁, x₂, x₃).\n2.  **Identify Relators:** The relations in the group presentation are determined by the β-curves. Each β-curve defines a relator, which is a word in the generators. We find this word by seeing how the β-curve is mapped onto the surface relative to the α-curves.\n3.  **Interpret the Diagram:** The crucial step is to correctly interpret the topology from the 2D drawing. The diagram is drawn in a symmetric but potentially confusing way. A standard interpretation is that each β-curve encloses exactly one α-curve:\n    *   The blue loop β₁ (connecting outer vertices 3 and 2) encloses the red α₁ curve.\n    *   The blue loop β₂ (connecting outer vertices 2 and 1) encloses the red α₂ curve.\n    *   The blue loop β₃ (connecting outer vertices 1 and 3) encloses the red α₃ curve.\n4.  **Determine the Fundamental Group:** Based on this interpretation, the gluing map is essentially the identity. The relator for βᵢ is simply the generator xᵢ. This leads to the presentation <x₁, x₂, x₃ | x₁=1, x₂=1, x₃=1>.\n5.  **Identify the Manifold:** This presentation defines the trivial group. According to the Poincaré conjecture (proven by Grigori Perelman), any closed, simply-connected 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere (S³).\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this reasoning and prints the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_heegaard_diagram():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Heegaard diagram to identify the corresponding 3-manifold.\n\n    The analysis proceeds by determining the fundamental group of the manifold\n    from the diagram.
