# Step 1: Use the information given in the conversation.
# The radius of a yellow circle is half its diameter.
diameter_yellow = 1.0  # cm
r_yellow = diameter_yellow / 2.0

print("Step 1: Determine the radius of a white circle (R).")
print("The key insight comes from the geometric arrangement where a yellow circle is tangent to two white circles and a straight edge.")
print("This specific geometry leads to the relationship: R = 4 * r, where R is the radius of a white circle and r is the radius of a yellow circle.")

# Step 2: Calculate the radius of the white circle (R_white).
R_white = 4 * r_yellow
print(f"The radius of a yellow circle (r) is {r_yellow} cm.")
print(f"The radius of a white circle (R) is therefore 4 * {r_yellow} = {R_white} cm.\n")

# Step 3: Define the coordinate system and locate the target circle.
# We assume the origin (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner of the bounding box.
# The white circles are arranged on a simple square grid.
# The center of a circle in row 'i' and column 'j' is at x = (2*j - 1)*R and y = (2*i - 1)*R.
print("Step 2: Locate the right-most white circle on the grid.")
print("The right-most white circles are in the 3rd column (j=3).")
print("The question asks for a single circle, so we choose the one with the higher y-coordinate, which is in the middle row (i=2).\n")

# Step 4: Calculate the coordinates of the center of this circle.
# The circle is in column j=3 and row i=2.
j = 3
i = 2
x_center = (2 * j - 1) * R_white
y_center = (2 * i - 1) * R_white

print("Step 3: Calculate the final coordinates.")
print(f"The x-coordinate is calculated as (2 * {j} - 1) * R = (2 * {j} - 1) * {R_white} = {x_center} cm.")
print(f"The y-coordinate is calculated as (2 * {i} - 1) * R = (2 * {i} - 1) * {R_white} = {y_center} cm.\n")

# Step 5: Output the final answer in the required format.
print("The final answer for the center of the right-most white circle is:")
