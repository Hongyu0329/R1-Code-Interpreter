    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** I will first determine the molecular formula of the starting compound by counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1 (PMB Deprotection):** The first reaction uses CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate), which is a standard reagent for removing the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the atomic composition when the PMB group is replaced by a hydrogen atom to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2 (Hydrogenation):** The second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C and H2. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond. I will add two hydrogen atoms to the formula of Intermediate 1 to get the formula for Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The final step involves heating with strong acid (HCl), which hydrolyzes the lactam (a cyclic amide). This reaction consumes one molecule of water. I will add the atoms of water (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2 to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n5.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations step-by-step and prints the final molecular formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 0: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Its formula is C15H14F3NO2.\n    atoms_start = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the product's molecular formula:\")\n    print(f\"Starting material: C{atoms_start['C']}H{atoms_start['H']}F{atoms_start['F']}NO{atoms_start['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Reaction with CAN.
