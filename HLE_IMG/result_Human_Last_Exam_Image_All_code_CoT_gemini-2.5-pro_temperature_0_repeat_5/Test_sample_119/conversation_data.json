    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to deduce the structure and IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectra.\n\n**Step 1: Molecular Formula Determination from Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135.\n*   The Nitrogen Rule states that a molecule with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   The molecular formula can be proposed as CₓHᵧN. The mass equation is 12x + y + 14 = 135, which simplifies to 12x + y = 121.\n*   The ¹³C NMR shows 7 distinct carbon signals. However, a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-) has 6 carbons but only 4 signals due to symmetry (ipso, ortho, meta, para). If we assume a phenyl group is present (supported by IR and ¹H NMR), we need more carbons. Let's try a total of 9 carbons (C₉).\n*   If x = 9, then 12(9) + y = 121 => 108 + y = 121 => y = 13.\n*   The proposed molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N.\n*   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE): DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring, which fits our assumption.\n\n**Step 2: Carbon Skeleton Analysis from ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. (7 signals total)\n*   The signals from δ 126 to 146 ppm are in the aromatic region. The signal at 145.1 ppm is a quaternary carbon (no attached H), likely the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring. The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are aromatic CH carbons.\n*   The signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment distinguishes carbon types. CH/CH₃ signals are positive, CH₂ are negative, and quaternary C are absent.\n*   The data states there is **one negative signal** and **five positive signals**.\n*   The quaternary carbon at 145.1 ppm will be absent.\n*   The 3 aromatic CH carbons (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) will be positive.\n*   This leaves the 3 aliphatic carbons (49.6, 43.5, 19.2). To get a total of 1 negative and 5 positive signals, this group must contain:\n    *   One CH₂ group (1 negative signal).\n    *   Two CH or CH₃ groups (2 positive signals).\n*   So, the side chain consists of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 3: Proton Environment Analysis from ¹H NMR and HSQC**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   ~7.2-7.3 ppm: A multiplet integrating to 5H, characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   ~2.9 ppm: A multiplet integrating to 1H, corresponding to a CH group.\n    *   ~2.7 ppm: A multiplet integrating to 2H, corresponding to a CH₂ group.\n    *   ~1.2 ppm: A doublet integrating to 3H, corresponding to a CH₃ group coupled to a single proton.\n    *   The 2 protons from the amine (NH₂) are likely exchanged or form a very broad signal that is not clearly integrated.\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   The 1H signal at ~2.9 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~43.5 ppm.\n    *   The 1H signal at ~2.7 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~49.6 ppm.\n    *   The 1H signal at ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~19.2 ppm.\n*   This confirms our assignments: C at 49.6 is a CH₂, C at 43.5 is a CH, and C at 19.2 is a CH₃. This perfectly matches the DEPT-135 data.\n\n**Step 4: Structure Assembly and Verification**\n*   We have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃, and an -NH₂ group (from the formula C₉H₁₃N).\n*   To form a stable molecule, the central CH group must be bonded to the phenyl group, the methyl group, and the remaining fragment. This leads to two possibilities for the carbon backbone:\n    1.  C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-\n    2.  C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-\n*   The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to the end of the chain.\n    *   **Structure A:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂ (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)\n    *   **Structure B:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃ (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)\n*   **MS Fragmentation Verification:** The mass spectrum provides the deciding evidence.\n    *   The base peak (most intense) is at m/z = 30. This corresponds to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ fragment.\n    *   This fragment can only be formed from **Structure A** via alpha-cleavage (cleavage of the C-C bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom).\n        C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-|-NH₂  →  [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ (m/z 30) + C₈H₉ radical\n    *   Structure B cannot easily form a fragment at m/z 30.\n    *   Furthermore, the peak at m/z 91 (tropylium ion, [C₇H₇]⁺) is characteristic of a benzyl-type structure and can be formed from Structure A by cleavage between the first and second carbons of the side chain.\n\n**Step 5: Final IUPAC Name**\n*   The confirmed structure is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n*   The parent chain is propane (3 carbons).\n*   The amino group is on carbon 2.\n*   The phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Spectroscopic Analysis ---\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Mass Spectrometry\n    mw = 135\n    formula = \"C9H13N\"\n    dbe = 4\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Mass Spectrum Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z {mw} suggests an odd molecular weight.\")\n    print(f\"By the Nitrogen Rule, this indicates an odd number of nitrogen atoms (likely one).\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is determined to be {formula}.\")\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation is {dbe}, consistent with a benzene ring.\")\n\n    # Step 2: 13C NMR and DEPT-135\n    c13_shifts = [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2]\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: 13C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis\")\n    print(f\"13C NMR signals (ppm): {c13_shifts}\")\n    print(\"DEPT-135 data indicates 1 negative signal (CH2) and 5 positive signals (CH/CH3).\")\n    print(\"Combined with the 13C shifts, we can deduce the following carbon types:\")\n    print(\" - Aromatic: 1 quaternary C (~145.1), 3 CH groups (~126-129)\")\n    print(\" - Aliphatic: 1 CH2 group, 1 CH group, 1 CH3 group\")\n\n    # Step 3: 1H NMR and HSQC\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: 1H NMR and HSQC Analysis\")\n    print(\"1H NMR shows signals for:\")\n    print(\" - A 5H multiplet (~7.2 ppm): Monosubstituted phenyl ring (C6H5-)\")\n    print(\" - A 2H multiplet (~2.7 ppm): A CH2 group\")\n    print(\" - A 1H multiplet (~2.9 ppm): A CH group\")\n    print(\" - A 3H doublet (~1.2 ppm): A CH3 group next to a CH\")\n    print(\"HSQC data correlates these protons to their respective carbons:\")\n    print(\" - CH3 (1H ~1.2 ppm) <=> C (~19.2 ppm)\")\n    print(\" - CH2 (1H ~2.7 ppm) <=> C (~49.6 ppm)\")\n    print(\" - CH (1H ~2.9 ppm) <=> C (~43.5 ppm)\")\n\n    # Step 4: Structure Assembly and Verification\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Structure Assembly and Verification\")\n    print(\"The fragments are: C6H5-, -CH-, -CH2-, -CH3, and -NH2.\")\n    print(\"Assembling these fragments leads to the structure: C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2.\")\n    print(\"This structure is verified by the MS fragmentation pattern:\")\n    print(\" - The base peak at m/z 30 corresponds to the [CH2=NH2]+ fragment, formed by alpha-cleavage.\")\n    print(\" - The peak at m/z 91 corresponds to the [C7H7]+ (tropylium) ion, characteristic of a benzyl group.\")\n\n    # Step 5: IUPAC Name\n    iupac_name = \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\"\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Final IUPAC Name\")\n    print(f\"The parent chain is propane.
