    "This problem describes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, a classic reaction in terpene chemistry. It involves a cascade of [1,2] shifts (of hydride ions, H⁻, or methyl groups, CH₃⁻) along the carbon skeleton, driven by the formation of more stable carbocation intermediates. The reaction terminates with the elimination of a proton to form a stable alkene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid catalyst (HCl). This forms a good leaving group, water (H₂O).\n2.  **Carbocation Formation:** The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the carbon where the alcohol was attached (let's call this C-3, following standard numbering).\n3.  **Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial carbocation undergoes a series of [1,2] shifts to move the positive charge across the molecular backbone, generally forming more stable tertiary carbocations at each step. We will trace the fate of the substituents at the key positions. The starting material is drawn with the following relevant substituents:\n    *   At C-4: Two CH₃ groups.\n    *   At C-5: One H atom.\n    *   At C-10 (A/B ring junction): One CH₃ group.\n    *   At C-9: One H atom.\n    *   At C-8 (B/C ring junction): One CH₃ group.\n    *   At C-14 (C/D ring junction): One CH₃ group.\n    *   At C-13: One H atom.\n\n    The cascade proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Shift 1:** A **CH₃** group migrates from C-4 to C-3. The carbocation moves to C-4.\n    *   **Shift 2:** An **H** atom migrates from C-5 to C-4. The carbocation moves to C-5.\n    *   **Shift 3:** A **CH₃** group migrates from C-10 to C-5. The carbocation moves to C-10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** An **H** atom migrates from C-9 to C-10. The carbocation moves to C-9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** A **CH₃** group migrates from C-8 to C-9. The carbocation moves to C-8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** A **CH₃** group migrates from C-14 to C-8. The carbocation moves to C-14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** An **H** atom migrates from C-13 to C-14. The carbocation moves to C-13.\n\n4.  **Termination:** The cascade stops when the carbocation is at C-13. A proton (H⁺) is then eliminated from the adjacent C-12, forming the final, stable C-12=C-13 double bond.\n\nNow, let's determine the final substituent at each numbered position in the product:\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** Started with two CH₃ groups. One migrated away to C-3. An H atom from C-5 migrated in. Thus, the final C-4 has one CH₃ group and one H atom. The label points to the remaining methyl group. **Therefore, 1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-5. An H atom from C-9 migrated in. **Therefore, 2 = H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-8):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-9. A CH₃ group from C-14 migrated in. **Therefore, 3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-14):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-8. An H atom from C-13 migrated in. **Therefore, 4 = H**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-13):** Started with an H atom, which migrated to C-14. The resulting carbocation at C-13 was then converted into a double bond. The question asks for the substituent (H or CH₃). Since the original substituent at this position was a hydrogen atom before it migrated, we identify it as H. **Therefore, 5 = H**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions after the rearrangement.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"H\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    output = []\n    for position, substituent in sorted(substituents.items()):\n        output.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n    \n    print(\", \".join(output))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
