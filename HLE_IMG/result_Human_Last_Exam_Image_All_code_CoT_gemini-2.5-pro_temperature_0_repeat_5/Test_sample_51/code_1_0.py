    This function provides the transcription of the Ancient Greek word from the image.
    
    Analysis of the word:
    1.  The first letter is a minuscule mu (μ).
    2.  The second letter is a minuscule theta (θ).
    3.  The third is an alpha (α) with a smooth breathing mark (psili) and an acute accent (oxia) above it. This combination is represented as ἄ.
    4.  The fourth and fifth letters are both minuscule lambda (λ).
    5.  The sixth letter is an omicron (ο).
    6.  The final letter is a nu (ν).
    
    Combining these elements gives the full transcription. The word as written is likely a scribal error for the common adverb μᾶλλον (mâllon), meaning "more" or "rather". The question asks what the manuscript "says", so a direct transcription is the appropriate answer.
