# Step 1: Identify the base plot number, n_0.
# By visual inspection, plots #2 and #10 are identical.
# We take the lower index as the identifier for the base plot.
n_0 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the value of |t^2| for the omitted simulation.
# The transmission probability T = |t|^2 for a Dirac fermion is given by:
# T = [1 + (V*(V - 2*E))**2 * sin^2(k2*Dz) / (4*(E**2 - m**2)*((E-V)**2 - m**2))]**-1
# We need to evaluate this under the condition V = 2*E.
# Substituting V = 2*E into the term (V*(V - 2*E))**2 gives:
# (2*E * (2*E - 2*E))**2 = (2*E * 0)**2 = 0.
# This makes the entire fractional term zero.
# Therefore, T = [1 + 0]**-1 = 1.
t_squared = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
result = n_0 / t_squared

# Print the equation and the final answer.
print(f"{n_0} / {t_squared} = {result}")
