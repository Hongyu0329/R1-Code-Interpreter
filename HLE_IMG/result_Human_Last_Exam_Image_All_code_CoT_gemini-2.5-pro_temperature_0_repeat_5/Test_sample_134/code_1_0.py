def identify_molecule():
    """
    This function identifies the molecule shown in the image and prints its name.

    The molecule is a large, cyclic organic compound known as a macrocycle.
    Analysis of its structure reveals the following components:
    - 12 phenylene units (-C6H4-)
    - 6 ethynylene linkers (-Câ‰¡C-)
    - 6 cis-ethenylene linkers (-CH=CH-)

    The combination of these units results in a molecule with the chemical formula C96H60.
    This specific, non-planar nanoring was first synthesized by the research group of Kenichiro Itami.
    It is widely known in the scientific community by its common name.
