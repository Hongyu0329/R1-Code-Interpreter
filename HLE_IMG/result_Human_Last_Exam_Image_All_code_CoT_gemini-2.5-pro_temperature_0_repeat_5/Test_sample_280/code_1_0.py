# This Piet program is a well-known implementation of "Hello, world!".
# When executed by a standard Piet interpreter with a codel size of 10,
# it performs a series of calculations to generate the ASCII codes for the
# string "Hello, world!" and prints them to standard output.

# The Python code below directly produces that final output.

print("Hello, world!")
