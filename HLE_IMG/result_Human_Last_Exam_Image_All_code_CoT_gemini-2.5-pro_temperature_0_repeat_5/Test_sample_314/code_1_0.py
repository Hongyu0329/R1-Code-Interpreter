def solve_graphene_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the graphene band structure puzzle based on qualitative analysis.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Identify the effect of tight-binding parameters t and s on the band structure.
        - t (hopping parameter) scales the overall bandwidth.
        - s (overlap integral) introduces asymmetry. s=0 is symmetric. s>0 compresses the
          conduction band. s<0 compresses the valence band. |s| controls the amount of asymmetry.

    2.  Analyze each simulation:
        - Sim 2 is symmetric -> s = 0.
        - Sim 4 has a compressed valence band -> s < 0.
        - Sim 1 and 3 have a compressed conduction band -> s > 0.

    3.  Match simulations to conditions:
        - Condition 2 (minimum |s|): s=0 is the minimum possible |s|. This matches Sim 2.
        - Condition 3 (unique sign(s)): s<0 is a unique sign among the four simulations. This matches Sim 4.
        - Condition 4 (maximum s): This requires comparing the asymmetry of Sim 1 and Sim 3.
          By aligning the Dirac points (the natural energy reference), we observe that Sim 1
          exhibits a greater asymmetry than Sim 3. Therefore, Sim 1 has the maximum s.
        - Condition 1 (minimum t): By elimination, Sim 3 must correspond to the minimum t.

    4.  Order the simulation indices by the condition number.
