    The task is to choose the best chemical strategy to "cage" a fluorescein molecule, making it non-fluorescent, and then "uncage" it to restore fluorescence specifically in cells that express a particular enzyme.

    1.  **Analyze the Fluorescein Structure:** Fluorescein has two key types of functional groups: two phenolic hydroxyls (-OH) and one carboxylic acid (-COOH). The fluorescence of the molecule is primarily controlled by the electronic state of the xanthene core, which is highly influenced by the two -OH groups. When these groups are converted to esters or ethers, the fluorescence is effectively quenched. Modifying the -COOH group has a much smaller impact on fluorescence. Therefore, the -OH groups are the ideal targets for caging.

    2.  **Evaluate the Caging/Uncaging Strategy:**
        *   **Caging:** A common and effective way to cage fluorescein is to convert the -OH groups into esters. Using acetyl groups is a classic example. This reaction is straightforward and results in fluorescein diacetate (FDA), a non-fluorescent molecule.
        *   **Uncaging:** Ester bonds can be cleaved by esterase enzymes, which hydrolyze the ester back to the original hydroxyl group.
        *   **Cell-Type Specificity:** If a specific esterase enzyme is expressed only in a target cell type (via genetic engineering), then only those cells will be able to cleave the acetyl groups from the caged fluorescein. When the caged molecule (e.g., FDA) is supplied to the tissue, it will enter all cells, but it will only be converted back to fluorescent fluorescein inside the target cells that contain the specific enzyme.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The best strategy is to modify the phenolic -OH groups with acetyl moieties. This creates a non-fluorescent, caged molecule. A genetically targeted esterase enzyme expressed only in specific cells can then cleave the acetyl groups, uncaging the molecule and activating its fluorescence in a highly specific manner. This corresponds to answer choice B.
