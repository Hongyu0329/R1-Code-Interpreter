# This problem requires a step-by-step chemical analysis rather than a calculation.
# The reasoning is as follows:
# 1. The reaction is a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction on an unsymmetrical starting material.
# 2. The (3-azidopropyl) chain will form a 5-membered ring.
# 3. The (4-azidobutyl) chain will form a 6-membered ring.
# 4. This eliminates symmetrical products D and E, and spiro products A, B, and C.
# 5. The only product with one 5-membered and one 6-membered fused ring is F.
# 6. The regiochemistry of the Schmidt rearrangement (ring expansion) is determined by migratory aptitude.
# 7. Both ketones are adjacent to the C1 bridgehead (quaternary) and a tertiary carbon (C3 or C5).
# 8. Migration of C1 is favored for both, but this is impossible.
# 9. A sequential reaction is proposed: one reaction proceeds with C1 migration, altering C1's nature. The second reaction then proceeds with migration of the tertiary carbon (e.g., C5).
# 10. This leads to an unsymmetrical product like F, which has one bridgehead migration and one non-bridgehead migration.

# Therefore, the expected product is F.

print("Step 1: Identify the reaction as a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.")
print("Step 2: Note the starting material is unsymmetrical, with a (3-azidopropyl) chain and a (4-azidobutyl) chain.")
print("Step 3: Predict that the side chains will cyclize to form a 5-membered ring and a 6-membered ring, respectively.")
print("Step 4: Examine the product options. Only product F has one 5-membered and one 6-membered fused N-heterocyclic ring.")
print("Step 5: Analyze the migratory aptitude for the ring expansion. The more substituted carbon migrates. Both ketones are adjacent to the highly substituted C1 bridgehead.")
print("Step 6: Resolve the conflict that C1 cannot migrate in both rearrangements. A sequential mechanism where the first migration of C1 deactivates it for the second migration explains the formation of an unsymmetrical product where one migration involves the bridgehead and the other does not.")
print("Step 7: Conclude that product F is the only one consistent with all these considerations.")
