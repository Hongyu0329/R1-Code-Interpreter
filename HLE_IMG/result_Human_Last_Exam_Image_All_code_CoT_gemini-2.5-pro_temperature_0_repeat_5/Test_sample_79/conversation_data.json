    "Of course, I can help with that. First, let's convert the given coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees to make them easier to use with online mapping tools.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the latitude and longitude values in DMS format.\n2.  Create a function to convert DMS to Decimal Degrees using the formula: `Decimal Degrees = Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)`. Remember that West longitudes are negative.\n3.  Call the function for the given coordinates.\n4.  Print the resulting decimal coordinates.\n5.  Use the decimal coordinates to identify the structure.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the conversion:\n```python\ndef dms_to_decimal(degrees, minutes, seconds, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees.\n    \"\"\"\n    decimal_degrees = degrees + (minutes / 60) + (seconds / 3600)\n    if direction in ['S', 'W']:\n        decimal_degrees *= -1\n    return decimal_degrees\n\n# Latitude: 29° 06' 18.75''N\nlat_deg, lat_min, lat_sec, lat_dir = 29, 6, 18.75, 'N'\n# Longitude: 103° 47' 50.28''W\nlon_deg, lon_min, lon_sec, lon_dir = 103, 47, 50.28, 'W'\n\n# Perform the conversion\ndecimal_lat = dms_to_decimal(lat_deg, lat_min, lat_sec, lat_dir)\ndecimal_lon = dms_to_decimal(lon_deg, lon_min, lon_sec, lon_dir)\n\nprint(f\"The original coordinates are:\")\nprint(f\"Latitude: {lat_deg}° {lat_min}' {lat_sec}\\\"{lat_dir}\")\nprint(f\"Longitude: {lon_deg}° {lon_min}' {lon_sec}\\\"{lon_dir}\")\nprint(\"\\nConverted to Decimal Degrees:\")\nprint(f\"Latitude: {decimal_lat}\")\nprint(f\"Longitude: {decimal_lon}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nBased on these coordinates, the structure can be identified.\")\nprint(\"The square structure visible in the satellite image is not an ancient ruin.\")\nprint(\"It is the remains of the facade of the 'Reata' mansion, a movie set built for the 1956 film 'Giant', starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean.\")\nprint(\"\\nWhile it is not an officially designated historic landmark in a formal sense, it is a well-known point of interest for film enthusiasts and a significant piece of cinematic history located near Marfa, Texas.\")\n\n```\n<<<The structure is the ruin of the Reata mansion movie set from the 1956 film 'Giant'. It is a landmark of cinematic history but not a formally designated historic landmark.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
