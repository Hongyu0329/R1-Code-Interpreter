    "To determine the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction, we will analyze each center one by one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Stereocenter 1:** The chiral carbon in the acyl chloride reactant. We will assign priorities to the four groups attached to it and determine its configuration (R/S).\n2.  **Analyze Stereocenter 2:** The chiral carbon in the alcohol reactant. We will assign priorities to its four groups and determine its configuration (R/S).\n3.  **Analyze Stereocenter 3:** The corresponding chiral carbon in the ester product that originates from the acyl chloride. We will analyze how the reaction affects the CIP priorities and determine the resulting configuration.\n4.  **Analyze Stereocenter 4:** The corresponding chiral carbon in the ester product that originates from the alcohol. We will analyze how the reaction affects the CIP priorities and determine the resulting configuration.\n5.  **Final Output:** We will write a Python script to print the sequence of the four configurations.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   Groups: -OCH₃, -COCl, -CF₃, -C₆H₅\n    *   Priorities (by atomic number):\n        1.  -OCH₃ (Oxygen)\n        2.  -COCl (Carbon attached to Chlorine)\n        3.  -CF₃ (Carbon attached to Fluorine)\n        4.  -C₆H₅ (Carbon attached to Carbon)\n    *   3D Arrangement: -OCH₃ (1) is back, -CF₃ (3) is front. The lowest priority group, -C₆H₅ (4), is in the plane. If we rotate the molecule to place group 4 in the back, the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 is **clockwise**.\n    *   Configuration: **(R)**\n\n*   **Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol):**\n    *   Groups: -OH, -CH₂OCH₃, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂, -H\n    *   Priorities:\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen)\n        2.  -CH₂OCH₃ (Carbon attached to Oxygen)\n        3.  -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂ (Carbon attached to Carbon)\n        4.  -H\n    *   3D Arrangement: The lowest priority group, -H (4), is pointing back. We can directly read the configuration. The sequence 1 → 2 → 3 is **clockwise**.\n    *   Configuration: **(R)**\n\n*   **Stereocenter 3 (Product, from Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   The reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The stereocenter is not part of the reaction site, so its 3D arrangement is retained. However, the -COCl group becomes a -COO-R' group, which changes the CIP priorities.\n    *   New Groups: -OCH₃, -COO-R', -CF₃, -C₆H₅\n    *   New Priorities:\n        1.  -OCH₃ (Oxygen)\n        2.  -CF₃ (Carbon attached to Fluorine, Z=9)\n        3.  -COO-R' (Carbon attached to Oxygen, Z=8)\n        4.  -C₆H₅ (Carbon attached to Carbon)\n    *   The priorities of groups 2 and 3 have swapped. With the same 3D arrangement but new priorities, the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 is now **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Configuration: **(S)**\n\n*   **Stereocenter 4 (Product, from Alcohol):**\n    *   The reaction breaks the O-H bond of the alcohol, but the C-O bond at the stereocenter remains intact. The 3D arrangement is retained. The -OH group becomes an -O(CO)R'' group.\n    *   New Groups: -O(CO)R'', -CH₂OCH₃, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂, -H\n    *   New Priorities: The atom attached to the stereocenter is still Oxygen, so it remains priority 1. The other groups are unchanged. The priority order is the same as in the starting alcohol.\n    *   Since both the 3D arrangement and the priority order are unchanged, the configuration remains the same.\n    *   Configuration: **(R)**\n\nThe final sequence of configurations is (R), (R), (S), (R).\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Stereocenter 1: Acyl chloride reactant\n    # Priorities: 1:-OCH3, 2:-COCl, 3:-CF3, 4:-C6H5.
