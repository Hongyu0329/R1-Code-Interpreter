    This function identifies the matching nyala based on visual features.

    1.  The target nyala has a distinctive horn shape, with a specific lyre-like curve and light-colored tips.
    2.  It has a unique pattern of white spots on its flank, notably a cluster of 3-4 spots just behind the shoulder.
    3.  The pattern of vertical white stripes on its side is also a key identifier.

    -   Image A shows a younger male with different horns.
    -   Image B has a similar spot pattern but the angle of the head obscures the horns for a perfect comparison.
    -   Image C is of poor quality.
    -   Image E has a white bandage on its leg, which the target does not have.
    -   Image F is partially obscured.
    -   Image D shows a nyala whose horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot pattern on the flank are an exact match for the target animal.

    Therefore, image D shows the same nyala.
