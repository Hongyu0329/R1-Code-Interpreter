    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Baseline Car VMT:** For each distance category, we will multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (1 occupant + more than 2 occupants) and the average trip distance. Summing these values across all distance categories gives the total weighted VMT for the baseline scenario.\n2.  **Calculate Total Proposed Car VMT:** We will repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n3.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction:** The reduction is the difference between the Baseline VMT and the Proposed VMT. The percentage reduction is then calculated as `(Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe calculation does not require the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data, as VMT measures the miles traveled by vehicles, regardless of the number of occupants.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    data = {\n        'distance_category': ['0-3 miles', '3-5 miles', '5-10 miles', '10+ miles'],\n        'share_of_total_trips': [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16],\n        'avg_trip_distance': [1, 4, 7.5, 20],\n        'baseline_car_1_occ': [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42],\n        'baseline_car_multi_occ': [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47],\n        'proposed_car_1_occ': [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16],\n        'proposed_car_multi_occ': [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n    }\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n    # Calculate total car share for baseline and proposed scenarios\n    df['baseline_total_car_share'] = df['baseline_car_1_occ'] + df['baseline_car_multi_occ']\n    df['proposed_total_car_share'] = df['proposed_car_1_occ'] + df['proposed_car_multi_occ']\n\n    # Calculate weighted VMT for each category\n    df['baseline_vmt'] = df['share_of_total_trips'] * df['baseline_total_car_share'] * df['avg_trip_distance']\n    df['proposed_vmt'] = df['share_of_total_trips'] * df['proposed_total_car_share'] * df['avg_trip_distance']\n\n    # --- Print Calculation Steps ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\")\n    print(\"We calculate a weighted VMT for each distance category by multiplying (Share of Trips) * (Total Car Share) * (Avg Trip Distance).\\n\")\n    \n    total_baseline_vmt = 0\n    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n        print(f\"Category '{row['distance_category']}':\")\n        print(f\"  {row['share_of_total_trips']} * ({row['baseline_car_1_occ']} + {row['baseline_car_multi_occ']}) * {row['avg_trip_distance']} = {row['baseline_vmt']:.4f}\")\n        total_baseline_vmt += row['baseline_vmt']\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal Baseline Weighted VMT = {total_baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\")\n    print(\"Similarly, we calculate the weighted VMT for the proposed scenario.\\n\")\n\n    total_proposed_vmt = 0\n    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n        print(f\"Category '{row['distance_category']}':\")\n        print(f\"  {row['share_of_total_trips']} * ({row['proposed_car_1_occ']} + {row['proposed_car_multi_occ']}) * {row['avg_trip_distance']} = {row['proposed_vmt']:.4f}\")\n        total_proposed_vmt += row['proposed_vmt']\n        \n    print(f\"\\nTotal Proposed Weighted VMT = {total_proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    vmt_reduction = total_baseline_vmt - total_proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / total_baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\")\n    print(f\"VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT\")\n    print(f\"VMT Reduction = {total_baseline_vmt:.4f} - {total_proposed_vmt:.4f} = {vmt_reduction:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nPercentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {total_baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.2f}%\")\n    \n    return percentage_reduction\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n    print(f\"\\n\\nFinal Answer: The percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is {final_answer:.2f}%.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer:.2f}>>>\")\n\n```"
