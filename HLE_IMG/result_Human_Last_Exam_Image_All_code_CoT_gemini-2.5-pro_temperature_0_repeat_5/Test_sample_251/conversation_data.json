    "To determine the longest R-R interval in seconds from the ECG rhythm strip, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Grid:** The ECG paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. The grid is made of small 1 mm squares. Therefore, the time duration of one small square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to locate the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the sharp upward spikes). This longest pause appears in the second strip, between the 3rd and 4th QRS complexes.\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** I will count the number of small squares between the peaks of these two R-waves. The interval spans approximately 38 small squares.\n4.  **Calculate the Time:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to get the final duration in seconds.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the parameters from the ECG strip.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n# Each small square on the ECG grid is 1 mm.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# 2. Visually measure the longest R-R interval in terms of small squares.\n# The longest interval is found in the second strip and spans approximately 38 small squares.\nlongest_interval_in_small_squares = 38\n\n# 3. Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = longest_interval_in_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# 4. Print the calculation and the result.\nprint(f\"The paper speed is {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec.\")\nprint(f\"The time for one small square is 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {longest_interval_in_small_squares} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {longest_interval_in_small_squares} squares * {time_per_small_square_sec} sec/square\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<1.52>>>"
