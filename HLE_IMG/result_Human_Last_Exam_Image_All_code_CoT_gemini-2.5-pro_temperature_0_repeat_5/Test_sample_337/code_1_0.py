    # Step 1: Analyze the plots and categorize them by stability.
    # The top row of plots (1, 2, 3) show trajectories that settle to a stable steady state.
    # The bottom row of plots (4, 5, 6) show sustained non-steady behavior:
    # - Plots 4 and 5 show stable limit cycles (oscillations).
    # - Plot 6 shows chaotic behavior.
    # The problem states that for each system, one plot has a Lewis number twice as large as the other.
    # This implies the change in Lewis number causes a bifurcation from stable to unstable behavior.

    # Step 2: Determine the effect of the Lewis number (Le).
    # The Lewis number is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity (Le = Î±/D).
    # In exothermic systems, instability is often caused by the inability to dissipate heat effectively.
    # - A high Le (>>1) means heat diffuses away quickly, which is a stabilizing effect.
    # - A low Le (<<1) means heat is trapped while reactants diffuse in, leading to instability.
    # Therefore, the stable plots {1, 2, 3} correspond to the higher Lewis number.
    # The question asks which set has a Lewis number "twice as large".
