    "My plan is to analyze the erasure poem's structure by breaking it down into its constituent words and examining its metrical properties, specifically the number of syllables and the stress pattern. I will use Python with the `pronouncing` library to programmatically determine these properties.\n\n1.  **Extract the Poem's Text**: First, I will identify the words of the poem from the image: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n2.  **Count Syllables**: I will calculate the total number of syllables in the poem by summing the syllables of each word. I'll print this calculation to show the process.\n3.  **Determine Stress Pattern**: I will determine the sequence of stressed (—) and unstressed (u) syllables for the entire line of poetry.\n4.  **Compare with Metrical Definitions**: I will compare the poem's syllable count and stress pattern against the definitions of the provided answer choices.\n    *   **American Sentence**: 17 syllables.\n    *   **Iambic Pentameter**: 10 syllables, with a \"da-DUM\" (u—) rhythm.\n    *   **Alexandrine**: 12 syllables.\n    *   **Sapphic**: A line of 11 syllables with a specific stress pattern: stressed-unstressed, stressed-unstressed, stressed-unstressed-unstressed, stressed-unstressed, stressed-stressed (— u | — u | — u u | — u | — —).\n5.  **Conclude**: Based on the comparison, I will identify the matching metric pattern and print the final analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pronouncing\nimport re\n\ndef analyze_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_text = \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    print(f\"Poem text: \\\"{poem_text}\\\"\\n\")\n\n    # Clean and split the text into words\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', poem_text.lower())\n\n    syllable_counts = []\n    stress_patterns = []\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing each word for syllables and stress.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Handle possessives like \"spider's\" for dictionary lookup\n        lookup_word = word.rstrip(\"'s\")\n        \n        # Get pronunciation and stress info\n        phones = pronouncing.phones_for_word(lookup_word)\n        stresses = pronouncing.stresses_for_word(lookup_word)\n        \n        if not phones or not stresses:\n            print(f\"Could not find phonetic data for '{word}'.
