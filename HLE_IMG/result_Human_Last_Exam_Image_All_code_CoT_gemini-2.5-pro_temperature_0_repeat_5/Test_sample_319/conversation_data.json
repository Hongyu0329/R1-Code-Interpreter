    "My plan is to identify the phenomenon depicted in the image by analyzing its components.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image displays two related plots representing a sound signal.\n    *   The top plot is a **spectrogram**, which shows the frequency content of the sound over time. It begins with a single horizontal line (a pure tone), which is then interrupted by a vertical smudge (a burst of noise), and finally continues as two distinct horizontal lines (two different pure tones).\n    *   The bottom plot is the **waveform**, showing the sound's amplitude over time. It starts as a simple, regular sine wave, becomes chaotic and random during the noise burst, and then transitions to a more complex, repeating pattern, which is the result of two sine waves being added together.\n\n2.  **Identify the Illusion:** The stimulus presented—a tone being interrupted by a burst of noise—is a classic setup used in psychoacoustics to study a specific auditory illusion. The prompt's reference to the Necker Cube's \"bistable ambiguity\" points to how our perception can have two interpretations of the same sensory input. In this auditory case, the brain can perceive the sound as either (a) a tone that stops, is replaced by noise, and then a new sound begins, or (b) a single tone that continues *through* the noise.\n\n3.  **Name the Phenomenon:** The brain typically chooses the second interpretation, \"filling in\" the missing portion of the tone. This perceptual \"filling-in\" is a common and useful ability, helping us, for example, to understand a conversation in a noisy room. This effect is known as the **Auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** As per the instructions, I will provide a Python script that prints the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion\n    represented by the provided image. The image shows a spectrogram and waveform\n    of a tone being interrupted by noise, a classic stimulus for this effect.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n    print(\"The image illustrates the stimulus for a phenomenon known as the:\")\n    print(phenomenon_name)\n\nidentify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
