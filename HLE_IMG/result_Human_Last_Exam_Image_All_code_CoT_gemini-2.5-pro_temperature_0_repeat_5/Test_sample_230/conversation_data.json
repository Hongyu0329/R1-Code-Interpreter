    "I have identified the painting by analyzing its style, subject matter, and composition. The artwork is a classic example of 19th-century Romanticism, characterized by its dramatic and emotional depiction of nature. The central subject is a windmill set against a turbulent, stormy sky, with a fire visible in the background, adding to the scene's intensity.\n\nBased on these elements, the painting is \"The Mill on the Seashore\" by the renowned Russian-Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky, created in the 19th century.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the title of the painting.\n\n```python\ndef get_painting_title():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the title of the identified painting.\n  \"\"\"\n  artist = \"Ivan Aivazovsky\"\n  title = \"The Mill on the Seashore\"\n  century = \"19th\"\n  \n  print(f\"The painting from the {century} century is titled:\")\n  print(title)\n\nget_painting_title()\n```\n<<<The Mill on the Seashore>>>"
