    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which we can rotate the entire pattern so that it maps onto itself. The number of times this can happen in a full 360-degree rotation gives us the order of the rotational symmetry.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will visually inspect the tiling to identify repeating elements and potential centers of rotation.\n2.  The pattern features prominent dark blue regular hexagons. A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n3.  I will choose the center of one of these hexagons as a potential center of rotation for the entire pattern.\n4.  I will then check if rotating the entire pattern by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around this point leaves the pattern unchanged.\n5.  By observing the arrangement of the surrounding tiles (pentagons, squares, and rhombi), I can confirm that a 60-degree rotation maps every tile onto an identical tile in a new position.\n6.  This confirms that the pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry. The code will print out this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A full circle rotation is 360 degrees.\n    full_rotation = 360\n    \n    # By inspecting the image, we can identify a repeating motif.\n    # A clear center for this motif is the center of any of the dark blue, regular hexagons.\n    # A regular hexagon has 6 sides.
