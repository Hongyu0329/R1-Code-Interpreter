def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the airfoil matching problem.

    The analysis is based on the following principles:
    1. Camber vs. Lift: Higher camber results in greater lift. Lift is proportional to the area
       between the upper and lower surface pressure coefficient curves.
    2. Thickness vs. Pressure Peak: Thin airfoils exhibit sharp leading-edge suction peaks,
       while thick airfoils have broader, more rounded pressure distributions.

    The matching is as follows:
    - A (thin, symmetric) -> 2 (lowest lift, sharp peak)
    - B (thin, low camber) -> 1 (low lift, sharp peak)
    - C (thin, medium camber) -> 4 (medium lift, sharp peak)
    - D (thin, high camber) -> 6 (high lift, sharp peak)
    - E (thick, symmetric) -> 5 (lowest lift, rounded peak)
    - F (thick, low camber) -> 8 (low lift, rounded peak)
    - G (thick, medium camber) -> 3 (medium lift, rounded peak)
    - H (thick, high camber) -> 7 (high lift, rounded peak)

    The final sequence for airfoils A-H is the concatenation of these plot numbers.
