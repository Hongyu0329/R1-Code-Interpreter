    This function outlines the reasoning to determine the products of the reaction.
    
    Step 1: The reaction is a tandem 4-pi electrocyclic ring opening and a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.
    Step 2: Working backwards from the product structures (C, D, G, H), the diene required for the Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl acrylate is determined to be 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxybuta-1,3-diene.
    Step 3: The electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene precursor is conrotatory and produces two diastereomeric dienes: a (3E)-isomer and a (3Z)-isomer.
    Step 4: Each diene reacts with ethyl acrylate in an endo Diels-Alder reaction. The facial selectivity of the attack is determined by sterics.
    Step 5: The (3E)-diene preferentially undergoes attack from the less hindered bottom face, leading to product C.
    Step 6: The (3Z)-diene preferentially undergoes attack from the less hindered top face, leading to product H.
    Step 7: The two major products are therefore C and H.
