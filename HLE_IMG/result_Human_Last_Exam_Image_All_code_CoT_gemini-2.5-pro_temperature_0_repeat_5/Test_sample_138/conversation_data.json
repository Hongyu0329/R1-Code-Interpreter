    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will analyze key morphological features that differ between males and females in these groups (Hymenoptera).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** We will examine the shape of the abdomen (gaster). Female cuckoo bees of this type (*Coelioxys*) have a distinctly pointed, conical abdomen for laying eggs in host nests, while males have a blunter abdomen tip, often with several small spines.\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** We will look at the antennae. In many paper wasp species (*Polistes*), males have antennae with curled tips, whereas females have straight antennae.\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The most obvious distinguishing feature is antenna length. Males have conspicuously long antennae, while females have much shorter antennae.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left has a sharply pointed abdomen, characteristic of a female. The insect on the right has a blunter, spiny tip, characteristic of a male. Thus, pair A is (Female, Male), which corresponds to option **4**.\n*   **Pair B:** Both insects exhibit antennae with curled tips. This indicates that both are males. Thus, pair B is (Male, Male), which corresponds to option **1**.\n*   **Pair C:** The insect on the left has very long antennae, identifying it as a male. The insect on the right has short antennae, identifying it as a female. Thus, pair C is (Male, Female), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\nThe final sequence of indices for A, B, and C is 4, 1, 3. The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the sexes for Pair A.\n# The left insect has a pointed abdomen (female Coelioxys bee).\n# The right insect has a spiny abdominal tip (male Coelioxys bee).\n# Pair A is (Female, Male), which is option 4.\nindex_A = 4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the sexes for Pair B.\n# Both wasps have curled antennae tips, a characteristic of male paper wasps.\n# Pair B is (Male, Male), which is option 1.\nindex_B = 1\n\n# Step 3: Determine the sexes for Pair C.\n# The left bee has very long antennae (male long-horned bee).\n# The right bee has short antennae (female bee).\n# Pair C is (Male, Female), which is option 3.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<4, 1, 3>>>"
