    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I can identify its genus. The organism displays a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems, roots, and leaves. It grows in a flat, mat-like form on the tree bark. The thallus is narrow, dark, and exhibits a distinct pattern of repeated forking or dichotomous branching, creating an intricate, web-like appearance. These features are characteristic of a thalloid liverwort from the genus *Metzgeria*, commonly known as forked veilworts.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this identification.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the genus of the epiphytic organism shown in the image.\n# The identification is based on its morphological features.\n\ndef identify_epiphyte_genus():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the genus of the epiphyte based on its visual characteristics.\n  The organism is a thalloid liverwort with a distinctive forked branching pattern.\n  \"\"\"\n  genus_name = \"Metzgeria\"\n  print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species in the image is: {genus_name}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the identification.\nidentify_epiphyte_genus()\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
