    "Here is my plan to identify the runestone:\n1.  First, I will carefully examine the runes in the provided image fragment. The runes are carved in the Younger Futhark alphabet, which was used during the Viking Age.\n2.  I will transliterate the runes from the three visible lines of text into Latin characters. This will give me fragments of the Old Norse inscription.\n3.  The key fragments I will look for are personal names and common runestone formulaic words like \"raised,\" \"stone,\" \"in memory of,\" etc.\n4.  The prompt specifies this is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This is a crucial clue, as it refers to a specific group of about 26 runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition.\n5.  I will use the transliterated text fragments to search through the known inscriptions of the Ingvar runestones.\n6.  By matching the text fragments and the visual layout, I will pinpoint the exact runestone and its official catalog ID.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final ID.\n\n```python\ndef find_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Ingvar runestone in the image by analyzing its runic inscription.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Transliterating the runic inscription from the image.\")\n    print(\"The inscription is in the Younger Futhark alphabet and is read from left to right.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # The visible text fragments are transliterated line by line.\n    # Note: 'x' or ':' are used as word dividers.
