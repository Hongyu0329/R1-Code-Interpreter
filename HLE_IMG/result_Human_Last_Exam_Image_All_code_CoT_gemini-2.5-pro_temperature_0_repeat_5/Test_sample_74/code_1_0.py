    # Step 1 & 2: Deconstruct definitions and analyze figures (mental analysis).
    # Key relationships established:
    # - High NGSC means more evenly distributed variance across principal components.
    # - High NGSC corresponds to high spatial complexity and low synchrony.
    # - NGSC is a non-negative value, typically normalized to a maximum of 1.
    # - Figure 3b (right) shows NGSC values for individual scans for multiple participants.
    #   - Red dots: Psilocybin
    #   - Blue dots: MTP (placebo)
    #   - Grey dots: No drug

    # Step 3: Evaluate each choice. We will focus on the logic for the correct choice.
    # Let's analyze choice K.

    # This statement means that for Participant 4 (P4), the NGSC value of every psilocybin scan
    # is greater than the NGSC value of every scan from the other two conditions (MTP and No drug).

    # Step 4: Verify with data from Figure 3b (right) for P4.
    # We estimate the values visually from the graph.

    # The logic is to check if the minimum value of the psilocybin group is greater
    # than the maximum value of the control group for participant P4.

    # Other choices are eliminated based on contradictions with definitions or visual data.
    # For example, Choice D is incorrect because high NGSC means LOW functional connectivity.
    # Choice G is not directly supported because the figure does not use 'pre/post' terminology.
    # Choice L is incorrect because for P5, the mean psilocybin NGSC is not clearly greater than the max control NGSC.
