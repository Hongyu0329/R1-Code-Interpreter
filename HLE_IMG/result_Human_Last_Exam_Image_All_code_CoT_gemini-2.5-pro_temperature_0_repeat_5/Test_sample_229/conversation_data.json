    "This is a piece of handwritten sheet music for a famous Bossa Nova tune. To identify it, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the musical characteristics:** I'll examine the key signature, time signature, chord progression, and melodic contour to determine the style and narrow down the possibilities. The 4/4 time, syncopated rhythm, and chord choices like C, E7, F, and G7 are strong indicators of a Latin jazz or Bossa Nova style, likely from Brazil.\n2.  **Transcribe the opening melody:** The most unique identifier is the melody itself. I will transcribe the notes of the first few measures. The first measure contains the notes E, G, A, G. The second measure has E, C, D, E.\n3.  **Identify the song:** I will use this melodic fragment (\"E G A G E C D E\") and the chord progression (starting with C, then E7, then F) to search for a match among well-known Bossa Nova standards. This specific melody and chord structure is the iconic opening of \"Samba de Orfeu\" by Brazilian composer Luiz Bonf√°.\n4.  **Confirm the details:** \"Samba de Orfeu\" is a cornerstone of the Bossa Nova and Samba repertoire, originating from Brazil.\n5.  **Format the output:** I will write a Python script to print the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the song based on its musical characteristics and prints the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Samba de Orfeu\"\n    musical_style = \"Bossa Nova / Samba\"\n    country_of_origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Title: Samba de Orfeu\nMusical Style: Bossa Nova / Samba\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
