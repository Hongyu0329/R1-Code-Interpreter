# Step 1: Define the probabilities based on the model and the identified path.
# The path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# P(START -> Appreciation) is given in the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# P(Appreciation -> Solution) must be calculated.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from a state must be 100%.
# From Appreciation, the only given outgoing path is to END with 83% probability.
# The missing probability must be the transition to the Solution state.
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83  # 100% - 83% = 17%

# P(Solution -> END) is 100% as stated in the problem description.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 2: Calculate the total probability of the conversation path.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final rounded result.
print("The path of the conversation is determined to be: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END")
print("\nThe probability of this path is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each transition:")
print(f"Probability = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"Probability = {p_start_to_appreciation:.2f} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end:.2f}")

# Round the result to 4 decimal places (to 0.0001).
final_answer = round(total_probability, 4)
