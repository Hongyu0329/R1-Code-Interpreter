    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then use Ohm's law (I = V/R) to find the total current flowing from the voltage source.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit Layout:** The circuit has a 1V voltage source (V2) and several resistors. We need to determine how the resistors are connected (in series, parallel, or a combination).\n2.  **Simplify the Resistor Network:**\n    *   Let's identify the main nodes. The top wire is connected to the positive terminal of V2 (let's call this potential +1V). The bottom wire is connected to the negative terminal (ground, 0V).\n    *   **Resistors R1, R2, and R3:**\n        *   Resistor R1 is connected between the +1V wire and a node that is wired directly to the 0V wire. Therefore, R1 is in parallel with the voltage source.\n        *   Resistor R3 is connected between the 0V wire and a node that is wired directly to the +1V wire. Therefore, R3 is also in parallel with the voltage source.\n        *   Resistor R2 is connected between the same two nodes as R1 and R3 (one connected to 0V, the other to +1V). Therefore, R2 is also in parallel with the voltage source.\n    *   **Resistors R7 and R8:**\n        *   Resistor R8 is connected from the +1V wire to an intermediate node.\n        *   Resistor R7 is connected from that same intermediate node to the 0V wire.\n        *   This means R7 and R8 are connected in series with each other. This series combination is then connected across the +1V and 0V wires, making it another parallel branch.\n3.  **Calculate Total Current:**\n    *   The circuit simplifies to four parallel branches connected to the 1V source:\n        1.  Branch 1: R1 = 3 Ω\n        2.  Branch 2: R2 = 7 Ω\n        3.  Branch 3: R3 = 9 Ω\n        4.  Branch 4: R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω\n    *   The total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch (I_total = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4).\n    *   We will calculate the current for each branch using I = V/R and then sum them up.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Define the component values from the circuit diagram\nV = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# The circuit has four parallel branches.\n# We calculate the current through each branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\n# Current through R1\nI1 = V / R1\n\n# Current through R2\nI2 = V / R2\n\n# Current through R3\nI3 = V / R3\n\n# Current through the series combination of R7 and R8\nR78 = R7 + R8\nI4 = V / R78\n\n# The total current is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\nI_total = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(\"To find the total current, we sum the currents of the four parallel branches:\")\nprint(\"I_total = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4\")\nprint(\"I_total = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3 + V/(R7 + R8)\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {V}/{R1} + {V}/{R2} + {V}/{R3} + {V}/({R7} + {R8})\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {I1:.4f} A + {I2:.4f} A + {I3:.4f} A + {I4:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"Total current = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n\n# Restore stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n# Print the output to the user\nprint(output)\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = f\"{I_total:.4f}\"\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
