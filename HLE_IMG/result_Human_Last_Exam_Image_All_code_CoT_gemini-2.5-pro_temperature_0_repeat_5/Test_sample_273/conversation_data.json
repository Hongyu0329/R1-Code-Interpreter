    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the main carbon chain and chiral centers:** We will first determine the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (-OH) to establish the IUPAC name and numbering for the chiral centers.\n2.  **Analyze each chiral center (C2, C3, C4):**\n    *   Identify the four different groups attached to the chiral carbon.\n    *   Assign priorities (1, 2, 3, 4) to these groups based on atomic number.\n    *   Determine the 3D orientation of the groups from the provided perspective drawing.\n    *   Determine the configuration (R or S) by observing the sequence of priorities 1-2-3 after orienting the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the step-by-step determination.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration\n    of the molecule shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Naming and Identification of Chiral Centers\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH group is a pentane chain.\")\n    print(\"Numbering the chain to give the -OH group the lowest number (C2), the IUPAC name is: 3-ethyl-4-(aminomethyl)pentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The three chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the configuration at Chiral Center C2\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Groups attached to C2: -OH, -C3, -CH3, -H\")\n    print(\"Priorities (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (Oxygen has the highest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3 (Carbon attached to other carbons)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3 (Carbon attached to hydrogens)\")\n    print(\"4: -H (Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"Orientation: The -OH and -CH3 groups are shown with dashed bonds (pointing back).

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Determine the absolute configuration of the molecule in the picture.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
