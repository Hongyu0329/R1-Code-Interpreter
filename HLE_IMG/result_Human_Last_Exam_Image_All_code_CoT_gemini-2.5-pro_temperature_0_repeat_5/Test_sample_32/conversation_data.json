    "My plan is to first identify the key distinguishing characteristics of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* by consulting botanical knowledge. The species name *curviseta* itself provides a strong clue. I will then formulate a clear explanation of this difference. Finally, I will present this explanation within a Python script that uses the `print()` function, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main sporophyte difference between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    difference_explanation = (\n        \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, which allows for distinction at a glance, is the curvature of the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\\n\\n\"\n        \"1. Grimmia montana: This species has a very short and straight seta. As a result, the capsule is held erect and is typically immersed among the upper leaves.\\n\\n\"\n        \"2. Grimmia curviseta: The specific epithet 'curviseta' literally means 'curved seta'. This species is characterized by a distinctly curved or arcuate seta. This curvature causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or even pendulous, with the mouth often facing downwards or sideways.\"\n    )\n    print(difference_explanation)\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The most significant difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta holding the capsule erect, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved seta causing the capsule to nod or hang.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
