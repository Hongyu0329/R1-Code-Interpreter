    "Based on the visual data provided in the Google Trends graph, we can deduce the country by analyzing the timing of the recurring annual peaks in search interest.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Red Line:** The peaks for the red line consistently occur in mid-to-late January each year. This timing strongly corresponds to **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a major federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the third Monday of January.\n2.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** The peaks for the blue line appear annually at the very end of May. This aligns perfectly with **Memorial Day**, a US federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who have died in service.\n3.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** The peaks for the yellow line happen every year in early September. This matches **Labor Day** in the United States, which is celebrated on the first Monday of September.\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The combination of these three specific annual events—Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January), Memorial Day (May), and Labor Day (September)—is unique to the United States. Therefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that outlines this reasoning and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_country_from_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function deduces the country based on the timing of three\n    historical events shown in a Google Trends graph.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The graph shows three distinct, annually recurring peaks.\n    # We can identify these events based on their timing.\n\n    # Event 1 (Red Line): Peaks occur in mid-January.\n    # This corresponds to a major US federal holiday.\n    event_1 = \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day\"\n    event_1_timing = \"Third Monday in January\"\n\n    # Event 2 (Blue Line): Peaks occur at the end of May.\n    # This corresponds to another major US federal holiday.\n    event_2 = \"Memorial Day\"\n    event_2_timing = \"Last Monday in May\"\n\n    # Event 3 (Yellow Line): Peaks occur in early September.\n    # This also corresponds to a major US federal holiday.\n    event_3 = \"Labor Day\"\n    event_3_timing = \"First Monday in September\"\n\n    # The unique combination of these three holidays points to one country.\n    country = \"United States\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the Google Trends graph:\")\n    print(f\"1. The red line shows annual peaks in January, corresponding to {event_1}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The blue line shows annual peaks at the end of May, corresponding to {event_2}.\")\n    print(f\"3.
