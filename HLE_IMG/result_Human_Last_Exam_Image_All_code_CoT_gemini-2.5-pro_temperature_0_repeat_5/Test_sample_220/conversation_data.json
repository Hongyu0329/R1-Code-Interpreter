    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the theoretical appearance of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction and then match this pattern to one of the provided images.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure:** Recall the atomic positions in a conventional FCC unit cell. Atoms are located at the 8 corners and the centers of the 6 faces.\n2.  **Define the Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the `[1, 1, 0]` vector.\n3.  **Calculate the Projected Pattern:** We will calculate the projected positions of the FCC atoms. The resulting 2D lattice is known to be a **centered rectangular** pattern. This means the atoms form a grid of rectangles, with an additional atom at the center of each rectangle.\n4.  **Compare with Images:** We will examine each image (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the centered rectangular pattern.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this analysis step-by-step and identify the correct image.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_crystal_structure_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the projection of an FCC lattice and identifies the correct image.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 1.0  # Let the lattice constant be 1 for simplicity.\n    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the FCC structure and [110] projection.\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at each corner and face-center of a cube.\")\n    print(\"When viewed along the [110] direction, the 3D positions are projected onto a 2D plane.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determining the theoretical 2D pattern.\")\n    print(\"The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a 2D pattern with a specific repeating unit.\")\n    print(\"This repeating unit is a rectangle with side lengths 'a' and 'a * sqrt(2)'.\")\n    print(f\"The aspect ratio of this rectangle is sqrt(2), which is approximately {sqrt2:.3f}.\")\n    print(\"The atoms in the projection are located at the corners of this rectangle AND one atom is in the exact center.\")\n    print(\"This is known as a 'centered rectangular' lattice pattern.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the given images.\")\n    print(\"We now look for the 'centered rectangular' pattern in the options A, B, C, and D.\")\n    print(\"\\n- Image A: Shows two columns of atoms. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\n- Image B: This image clearly shows a centered rectangular arrangement. We can identify rectangles formed by four atoms with another atom in the center.\")\n    print(\"  For example, atoms at the corners of a rectangle are centered by another atom. This matches our theoretical pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\n- Image C: Shows a pattern with six-fold symmetry, which is characteristic of a [111] projection, not [110].\")\n    print(\"\\n- Image D: Shows two interpenetrating rectangular grids. This pattern is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"Based on the analysis, Image B is the only one that shows the centered rectangular pattern corresponding to an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer: B.\")\n\nsolve_crystal_structure_problem()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
