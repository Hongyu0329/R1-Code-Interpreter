Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity. The most prominent evidence is the large, white, fuzzy structure on the twig, which is an insect gall known as a wool sower gall. This gall was formed after a female gall wasp laid her eggs in the twig of the oak tree. The image also shows evidence of another insect laying a cluster of eggs directly on the surface of a leaf. Therefore, depending on the specific insect, the eggs would be laid either inside the plant tissue (like the twig) or on the surface of the leaves.
