    "Answering this question requires an analysis of the chemical stability of the four iridium(III) complexes, as operational lifetime in light-emitting devices is primarily limited by the chemical degradation of the emitter molecule. All four complexes share the same general structure: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, where Ir is the central iridium(III) ion, C^N is a bidentate cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligand, and N^N is a bidentate 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. The key difference between the four complexes lies in the position of the fluorine substituent(s) on the two C^N ligands.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the common core and variable parts.**\n    *   **Core Metal:** Iridium(III) is used in all four complexes. It forms robust complexes suitable for phosphorescent emission.\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** All four complexes have 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) as the neutral ligand. The electron-donating and sterically bulky tert-butyl groups generally enhance stability. Since this ligand is common to all, it will not be the differentiating factor for their relative lifetimes.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** The two anionic cyclometalating ligands are where the variations occur. These ligands are of the 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) type, with fluorine atoms substituted at different positions. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the strength of the Ir-C and Ir-N bonds formed by these ligands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the effect of fluorine substitution on stability.**\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom, acting as a potent electron-withdrawing group primarily through the inductive effect (-I effect). The position of the fluorine atom determines which part of the complex is affected electronically and sterically.\n    *   **General Principles:**\n        *   Placing electron-withdrawing groups (like F) on the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand strengthens the covalent Ir-C bond. This is because it lowers the energy of the HOMO, which has significant character on this fragment, making the complex more resistant to oxidation and increasing bond strength. This generally leads to higher chemical stability and longer lifetimes.\n        *   Placing electron-withdrawing groups (like F) on the pyridine ring of the ppy ligand weakens the dative Ir-N coordinate bond. This is because the nitrogen atom becomes less electron-rich and thus a poorer Lewis base (electron-pair donor). A weaker Ir-N bond makes the ligand more prone to dissociation, which is a common degradation pathway, leading to shorter lifetimes.\n        *   Placing substituents at positions ortho to the coordinating atoms (e.g., ortho to the Ir-C bond on the phenyl ring) can introduce steric strain, which may weaken bonds and lower stability. It can also introduce new degradation pathways, such as C-F bond activation.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles to each complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1 and Complex 2:**\n        *   In Complex 1, the C^N ligand has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring (at positions meta and para to the Ir-C bond).\n        *   In Complex 2, the C^N ligand has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring (at the para position to the Ir-C bond).\n        *   In both cases, the electron-withdrawing fluorines are on the phenyl ring and are not in a sterically hindered position. They will strengthen the Ir-C bond and are expected to increase the overall stability of the complex. Therefore, Complexes 1 and 2 are expected to have relatively *long* lifetimes.\n\n    *   **Complex 3:**\n        *   The C^N ligand has a fluorine atom on the pyridine ring, at the position ortho to the coordinating nitrogen atom.\n        *   Due to its strong inductive effect, this fluorine atom will withdraw significant electron density from the nitrogen atom, making it a much weaker donor to the iridium center.\n        *   This weakening of the Ir-N(pyridine) bond is a major destabilizing factor, making the complex susceptible to ligand dissociation and degradation. Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to have a *shorter* lifetime.\n\n    *   **Complex 4:**\n        *   The C^N ligand has a fluorine atom on the phenyl ring, at the position ortho to the Ir-C bond.\n        *   There are two potential destabilizing effects here:\n            1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The fluorine atom is close to the iridium center and the adjacent bipyridine ligand, which can cause steric clashes, inducing strain in the complex and promoting ligand dissociation.\n            2.  **C-F Bond Activation:** The C-F bond ortho to a metalated carbon is known to be \"activated\" and can become a reactive site. It can be susceptible to intramolecular reactions (e.g., oxidative addition to the Ir center) or intermolecular attack (e.g., by nucleophiles like water), providing a specific degradation pathway.\n        *   Both factors suggest that Complex 4 will be less stable than Complexes 1 and 2. Therefore, Complex 4 is also expected to have a *shorter* lifetime.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Complexes 1 and 2 have stabilizing fluorine substituents on their C^N ligands and are expected to have longer lifetimes.\n    *   Complexes 3 and 4 have destabilizing features in their C^N ligands: Complex 3 has a weakened Ir-N bond, and Complex 4 is susceptible to steric strain and C-F bond activation. Both are expected to exhibit shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [3] and [4].\n\nFinal Answer is based on selecting the option that includes both Complex 3 and Complex 4.\nThe corresponding answer choice is J.\n\n<<<J>>>"
