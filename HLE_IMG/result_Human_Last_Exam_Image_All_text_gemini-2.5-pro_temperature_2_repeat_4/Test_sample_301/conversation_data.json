    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks.\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1.  **Artwork (Top Left):** The first work shows four fish with humorous, human-like faces. One fish is tempted by a hook. The style is cartoonish and satirical, using simple ink lines and light color washes. This is the unmistakable style of **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄)**, a renowned 20th-century Chinese cartoonist celebrated for his sharp social commentary and unique artistic expression.\n\n2.  **Artwork (Top Middle):** This is a classic Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The brushwork for the stems and leaves is strong and calligraphic, a technique that integrates the principles of calligraphy into painting. This style is a hallmark of **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**, a prominent artist of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic, who was a master of painting, calligraphy, and seal carving.\n\n3.  **Artwork (Top Right):** This is a realistic oil portrait of an elderly woman with a thoughtful expression. The work is executed with great detail and skill, capturing the subject's character. This is a famous masterpiece of modern Chinese art titled \"My Aunt\" (《我的阿姨》), painted in 1954 by **Ai Zhongxin (艾中信)**. It is a prime example of the socialist realism style that was influential in China during that era.\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n4.  **Artwork (Middle Left):** This panel shows Chinese calligraphy in a highly fluid and graceful Cursive Script (草書, caoshu). The style is recognizable for its clarity and structure despite the cursive flow. This is the \"Standard Cursive Script\" (標準草書) pioneered by the modern calligrapher and political figure **Yu Youren (于右任)**. His aim was to create a version of cursive script that was both artistic and relatively easy to read.\n\n5.  **Artwork (Middle Middle):** This artwork is a striking example of modern abstract art fused with traditional Chinese elements. It features a bold red circle over an orange one, set above a landscape rendered in expressive black ink. This combination of geometric abstraction, bold color, and traditional ink wash techniques is the signature style of **Liu Kuo-sung (劉國松, also spelled Liu Guosong)**, a master and pioneer of modern Chinese ink painting.\n\n6.  **Artwork (Middle Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy written in Small Regular Script (小楷, xiaokai). The characters are exceptionally neat, balanced, and elegant. The text is a colophon on the famous Tang Dynasty \"Yuelu Temple Stele\" (岳麓寺碑). This masterful and scholarly calligraphic style is characteristic of **Wen Zhengming (文徵明)**, one of the leading figures and \"Four Masters\" of the Ming Dynasty, renowned for his proficiency in this script.\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n7.  **Artwork (Bottom Left):** This is another example of Cursive Script calligraphy, but its style is wild, energetic, and highly expressive. The characters flow into one another with great force, and the use of ink varies from wet to dry, creating a powerful rhythm. This unrestrained and emotionally charged style is the trademark of the Ming Dynasty artist **Xu Wei (徐渭)**, known for his eccentric personality and avant-garde art.\n\n8.  **Artwork (Bottom Middle):** This is a realist oil painting depicting a pensive young woman with long dark hair. The portrait is characterized by its delicate handling of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), creating a soft, melancholic atmosphere. This is another iconic work of modern Chinese oil painting, \"Youth\" (《青年女歌手》 or 《青春》), painted in 1984 by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚誼)**, a key figure in the \"Neoclassical\" movement in Chinese art.\n\n9.  **Artwork (Bottom Right):** This painting shows a female figure, likely a dancer, in a distinctive style that fuses Chinese ink lines with Western concepts of color and form. The figure is elegant and stylized, with elongated features. The visible signature on the left reads \"林風眠\". This unique artistic language is the signature of **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**, one of the most important pioneers of modern Chinese painting who sought to synthesize Chinese and European artistic traditions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Liao Bingxiong\n2.  Wu Changshuo\n3.  Ai Zhongxin\n4.  Yu Youren\n5.  Liu Kuo-sung (Liu Guosong)\n6.  Wen Zhengming\n7.  Xu Wei\n8.  Jin Shangyi\n9.  Lin Fengmian\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Wu Changshuo, Ai Zhongxin, Yu Youren, Liu Kuo-sung, Wen Zhengming, Xu Wei, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian>>>"
