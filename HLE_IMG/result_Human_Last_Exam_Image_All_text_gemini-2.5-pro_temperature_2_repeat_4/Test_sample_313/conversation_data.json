    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue and the image:** The first part of the question states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy.\n    *   A search for events on June 20, 2019, reveals the NHL Awards ceremony took place on that date.\n    *   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won several awards that night, including the Ted Lindsay Award, which matches the trophy's appearance.\n    *   In ice hockey, a player who scores three goals in a single game achieves a \"hat trick.\" Fans often celebrate by throwing hats onto the ice. An elite goal-scorer like Kucherov, known for scoring hat tricks, can be metaphorically described as a \"hatter.\" Therefore, a \"hatter\" (Nikita Kucherov) is pictured.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** The second part states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This clue points to a historical context involving mercury toxicity.\n    *   Historically, hat makers, or \"hatters,\" used mercury nitrate in a process called \"carroting\" to turn fur into felt for hats.\n    *   Chronic exposure to the mercury vapor caused neurological damage in these workers, a condition known as erethism or \"mad hatter disease.\" This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   Due to the well-documented toxicity of mercury, this practice has long been discontinued.\n    *   So, the profession of a \"hatter\" (in the sense of a felt hat maker using mercury) has \"almost ceased to be used\" in that specific way. The word \"another\" in the clue is key, as it differentiates this historical hatter from the hockey \"hatter\" in the first clue.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the two clues:** The word \"Hatter\" is the common link between the two clues.\n    *   Clue 1: A hockey \"Hatter\" (Nikita Kucherov) is pictured.\n    *   Clue 2: Another kind of \"Hatter\" (the historical felt hat maker) is no longer common due to the dangers of mercury.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The identity of \"X Y\" is \"Hatter.\"\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
