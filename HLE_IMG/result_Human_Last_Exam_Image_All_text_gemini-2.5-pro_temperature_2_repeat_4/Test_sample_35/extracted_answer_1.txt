The protein S100B exhibits strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** and not solely as an adjunct marker. Here is the explanation:
1.  **Adjunct Role:** The protein is involved in multiple neurological and non-neurological diseases (Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinson's, cardiovascular disease, etc.), so it lacks the specificity to be a standalone diagnostic marker. In this context, it serves as an adjunct marker, providing supplementary information alongside other clinical tests.
2.  **Prognostic Role:** However, its role is more significant than just being an adjunct. The provided pathway shows that overexpression of S100B directly activates RAGE, leading to critical pathological outcomes such as **neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis**. The level of S100B would, therefore, directly correlate with the severity and rate of disease progression. A higher concentration of S100B would predict a more aggressive disease course and a poorer prognosis for the patient. This ability to forecast the disease's future outcome makes it a valuable prognostic marker.
