    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   Based on MW=135 and the presence of one N, a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N. (Calculation: 12*9 + 1*13 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   Fragmentation peaks at m/z 91 (tropylium ion, C₇H₇⁺) and m/z 77 (phenyl ion, C₆H₅⁺) are further evidence for a substituted benzene ring.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C(sp²)-H stretching, confirming the aromatic ring.\n*   **~2850-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C(sp³)-H stretching, confirming aliphatic groups.\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad, weak absorption in this region suggests an N-H stretch. This could be a primary (-NH₂) or secondary (-NH-) amine.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ & ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions confirm C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this region (out-of-plane bending) are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C NMR:** Seven distinct carbon signals are observed: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 (aromatic region), and 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 (aliphatic region).\n*   The presence of 4 aromatic signals for 6 carbons confirms a monosubstituted benzene ring (due to symmetry: C1(ipso), C2/C6, C3/C5, C4). The δ 145.1 peak, which is downfield and often weak, is the quaternary ipso-carbon (C1), attached to the substituent. The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 correspond to the CH carbons of the ring.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment reveals the number of hydrogens on each carbon. It shows \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. So, there is **one CH₂ group**.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. There are **five positive signals**.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (like the ipso-carbon at 145.1 ppm) do not appear in DEPT spectra.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT:**\n    *   Of the five positive DEPT signals, three must correspond to the aromatic CH environments (representing 5 carbons total: C2/C6, C3/C5, C4).\n    *   This leaves two positive signals for the three aliphatic carbons. Therefore, the three aliphatic carbons consist of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃. Let's verify the H count for the substituent. From C₉H₁₃N, the substituent attached to the phenyl group (C₆H₅) must be -C₃H₈N. A combination of -CH, -CH₂, -CH₃ has C₃H₆. To get to C₃H₈N, we need two more hydrogens and one nitrogen, which forms a primary amine group (-NH₂). This fits the data.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **~7.0-7.4 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of ~5H confirms the monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.8 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~2H.\n*   **~2.6 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~1H.\n*   **~1.2 ppm:** A doublet integrating to ~3H.\n*   The 3H doublet at 1.2 ppm is a key feature, indicating a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group (-CH-CH₃).\n*   This pattern eliminates isomers like 1-phenylpropan-1-amine (C₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃), which would show a triplet for its CH₃ group.\n*   The remaining likely isomers are:\n    *   A) 2-phenylpropan-1-amine: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   B) 1-phenylpropan-2-amine: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n\n**5. HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) Analysis:**\nThis 2D spectrum correlates directly bonded protons (¹H) and carbons (¹³C).\n*   A correlation exists between the **¹H signal at 1.2 ppm** (3H doublet) and the **¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm**. This confirms this pair as the **CH₃** group.\n*   A correlation exists between the **¹H multiplet at ~2.8 ppm** (2H) and the **¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm**. This confirms this pair as the **CH₂** group.\n*   A correlation exists between the **¹H multiplet at ~2.6 ppm** (1H) and the **¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm**. This confirms this pair as the **CH** group.\n\n**6. Final Structure Determination and IUPAC Name:**\nWe can now assemble the fragments (Ph-, CH₂, CH, CH₃, NH₂) into the final structure. We compare the chemical shifts with what is expected for the two remaining isomers.\n\n*   **Isomer B: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine** (Structure: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃)\n    *   **CH₂ group:** This is the benzylic CH₂ group. Its shifts (¹³C: 43.5 ppm, ¹H: 2.8 ppm) are highly characteristic of a benzylic methylene.\n    *   **CH group:** This CH is attached to the amine group. Its shifts (¹³C: 49.6 ppm, ¹H: 2.6 ppm) are consistent with a carbon attached to an electronegative nitrogen atom.\n    *   **CH₃ group:** Attached to the CH. Shifts (¹³C: 19.2 ppm, ¹H: 1.2 ppm) are typical.\n    *   This assignment is highly consistent.\n\n*   **Isomer A: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine** (Structure: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂)\n    *   In this isomer, the CH group is benzylic and the CH₂ group is attached to the amine. The observed shifts (Benzylic C at 49.6 ppm; C-NH₂ at 43.5 ppm) do not match expected values as well as for isomer B. Generally, a carbon attached to nitrogen (C-N) is more deshielded than a benzylic carbon.\n\nConclusion: The data overwhelmingly supports the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**IUPAC Name:**\nThe parent chain containing the amine functional group is a three-carbon chain (propane). The amine is located on carbon 2, making it a propan-2-amine. A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 1. Therefore, the IUPAC name is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
