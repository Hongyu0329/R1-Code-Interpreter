    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Image Observation:** The image displays a 3D cartoon representation of a protein structure, a common visualization style in structural biology. The structure consists of two distinct polypeptide chains, indicated by different colors: a large domain in dark blue and a smaller chain in light blue. The structure is composed of secondary structure elements such as alpha-helices (coiled ribbons) and beta-sheets (flat ribbons/arrows).\n    2.  **Reverse Image Search:** To identify the protein, a reverse image search is performed. This search leads to various scientific sources, most importantly pointing to a specific entry in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n    3.  **PDB Identification:** The image matches the structure found in the PDB under the accession code **2O2V**.\n    4.  **Analysis of PDB Entry 2O2V:** The description for PDB ID 2O2V identifies the structure as a complex between two proteins from *Homo sapiens* (humans):\n        *   The larger dark blue protein is the C-terminal adenylation domain of **Ubiquitin-activating enzyme 1 (UBA1)**.\n        *   The smaller light blue protein is **Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1)**.\n    5.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question \"What is the name of this protein?\" is presented with an image of a complex. This can be ambiguous. To resolve this, we can look at how this image is typically used and labeled.\n    6.  **Contextual Clues:** The image is widely available on platforms like Wikimedia Commons. Its filename there is \"Protein UFM1 PDB 2o2v.png\". This strongly suggests that the image is intended to be an illustration of the protein UFM1, even though it is shown in complex with its binding partner. The distinct light blue color for the smaller protein likely serves to highlight it as the subject of interest.\n    7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the PDB entry and the contextual information from the image's filename, the most specific and intended answer is the name of the smaller protein, which is Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1, commonly known as UFM1.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   It is crucial to recognize that the image depicts a protein complex, not a single monomeric protein.\n    *   A simple visual inspection is insufficient; a reverse image search is necessary to link the image to its specific PDB entry.\n    *   The PDB entry provides definitive names for both interacting partners.\n    *   In cases of ambiguity (like asking for \"the protein\" when showing a complex), external context such as filenames or captions from the image's source is invaluable for determining the intended subject.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:** The protein highlighted in light blue and identified via its PDB entry (2O2V) and common filename is Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1).\n\n<<<Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1"
