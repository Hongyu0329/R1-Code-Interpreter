    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kenken puzzle to determine the numbers on the top horizontal line.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Rules of Kenken**\nA standard NxN Kenken puzzle is filled with numbers from 1 to N, such that:\n1.  Each row contains each number from 1 to N exactly once.\n2.  Each column contains each number from 1 to N exactly once.\n3.  The numbers within each heavily-outlined \"cage\" must combine to produce the target number using the specified mathematical operation. Numbers can be repeated within a cage only if they are not in the same row or column.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Top Row of the Puzzle**\nThe grid is 4x4. The top row consists of four cells. By observing the thick cage lines, we can see that the top row is divided into two separate 2-cell cages.\n*   **Cage 1:** The leftmost cage covers cells (1,1) and (1,2). The clue is `8+`. This means the sum of the numbers in these two cells must be 8.\n*   **Cage 2:** The rightmost cage covers cells (1,3) and (1,4). The clue is `8*`. This means the product of the numbers in these two cells must be 8.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Standard Rules for a 4x4 Puzzle**\nIf this were a standard 4x4 puzzle, the numbers used would be {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   Let's check Cage 1 (`8+`): We need two distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4} that add up to 8. The largest possible sum is 3 + 4 = 7. It is impossible to achieve a sum of 8.\n*   This immediately creates a contradiction. The puzzle cannot be a standard 4x4 Kenken using the numbers 1 through 4.\n\n**Step 4: Form a Hypothesis about Non-Standard Rules**\nSince the standard rules lead to an impossibility, one of the rules must be different. The most likely variation is the set of numbers used. The grid is 4x4, so it must use a set of four distinct numbers, but perhaps not {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let's try to find a set of four distinct positive integers that would work for the top row.\n\n**Step 5: Deduce the Correct Number Set**\nLet the four numbers used in the puzzle be `{n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄}`. The top row must contain a permutation of these four numbers.\n*   Let the numbers in the top row be `a, b, c, d`.\n*   From Cage 1, we have `a + b = 8`.\n*   From Cage 2, we have `c * d = 8`.\n*   The numbers `a, b, c, d` must be four distinct numbers that make up the entire set for the puzzle.\n\nLet's test possible number sets. Consider the set **{2, 3, 4, 5}**.\n*   Can we find two numbers in this set that sum to 8? Yes, `3 + 5 = 8`. So, `{a, b}` could be `{3, 5}`.\n*   The remaining two numbers in the set are {2, 4}. Can these two numbers multiply to 8? Yes, `2 * 4 = 8`. So, `{c, d}` could be `{2, 4}`.\n\nThis set `{2, 3, 4, 5}` works perfectly for the cages in the top row. The four numbers `{a, b, c, d}` would be `{3, 5, 2, 4}` in some order, which is a permutation of the set {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key was recognizing the impossibility of solving the puzzle with the standard {1, 2, 3, 4} number set.\n*   The properties of the entire row (containing all four distinct numbers) were essential to deducing the correct non-standard number set.\n*   We only need to identify the numbers present, not their specific order in the top row.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe four numbers present on the top horizontal line of the square, once the puzzle is solved, are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nFollowing the requested format, these four numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n2345\n<<<2345>>>"
