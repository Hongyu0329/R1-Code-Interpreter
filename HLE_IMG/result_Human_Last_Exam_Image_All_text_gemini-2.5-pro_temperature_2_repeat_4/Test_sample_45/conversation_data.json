    "**Step-by-step analysis of the tiling pattern:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to identify the rotational symmetry of the tiling. Rotational symmetry of order *n* (or *n*-fold) means the pattern looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360°/*n* around a specific point. We need to find the highest value of *n* for which this is true.\n\n2.  **Identify the Tile Shapes:** The tiling is constructed from several geometric shapes:\n    *   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow squares.\n    *   Orange rhombuses (four-sided figures with all sides equal length).\n\n3.  **Search for Centers of Rotation:** We need to find points in the pattern that can serve as centers for rotation. The most symmetrical points are usually the centers of the regular polygons.\n\n4.  **Test for 6-fold Symmetry:**\n    *   **Candidate Center:** Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons.\n    *   **Analysis:** A regular hexagon, by itself, has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°). We must check if the *entire* tiling also has this symmetry around the hexagon's center.\n    *   **Observation:** The central blue hexagon is surrounded by a ring of 6 yellow squares and 12 orange rhombuses (arranged in 6 pairs). If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° (360°/6) around the hexagon's center, we see that:\n        *   The central hexagon maps onto itself.\n        *   Each yellow square moves exactly into the position previously occupied by the next yellow square.\n        *   Each pair of orange rhombuses moves exactly into the position of the next pair.\n        *   The surrounding hexagons and other shapes also align perfectly with their neighbors' previous positions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The pattern is unchanged by a 60° rotation around the center of any hexagon. This means the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Test for Other Symmetries (for completeness):**\n    *   **4-fold Symmetry:** Consider the center of a yellow square. A square has 4-fold symmetry. The pattern around it (four rhombuses and four hexagons) is arranged symmetrically. A rotation of 90° (360°/4) around the square's center maps the tiling onto itself. So, centers of 4-fold rotation also exist.\n    *   **3-fold Symmetry:** Consider the point where the vertices of two hexagons and two rhombuses meet, between three large \"star\" motifs. Rotating by 120° (360°/3) around this point maps the pattern onto itself. So, centers of 3-fold rotation also exist.\n    *   **2-fold Symmetry:** Consider the center of any orange rhombus. A rotation of 180° (360°/2) maps the pattern onto itself. So, centers of 2-fold rotation also exist.\n\n6.  **Final Determination:** The question asks for *the* rotational symmetry of the tiling. When a pattern has multiple orders of rotational symmetry (in this case, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold), its overall rotational symmetry is defined by the **highest order** present.\n\n7.  **Answer:** The highest order of rotational symmetry found in the pattern is 6.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   Distinguish between the symmetry of a single tile and the symmetry of the entire tiling.\n*   The \"rotational symmetry\" of a pattern usually refers to the highest order of rotation possible.\n*   The pattern is a periodic tiling, and for such tilings, the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold (this is known as the crystallographic restriction theorem). The presence of 6-fold symmetry confirms it's the highest possible for this type of pattern.\n*   Look for the most obviously symmetric arrangements first, which in this case are the star-like figures centered on the hexagons.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
