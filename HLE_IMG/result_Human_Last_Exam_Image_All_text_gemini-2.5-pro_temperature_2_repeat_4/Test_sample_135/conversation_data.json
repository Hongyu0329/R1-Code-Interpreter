    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's medium and style:** The image displays a sculptural relief set within a circular frame (a tondo). The smooth, somewhat glossy surface of the figures and the detailed floral border are characteristic of glazed terracotta, a medium famously perfected and popularized by the della Robbia family workshop in Renaissance Florence. The style of the figures—with their graceful poses, classical features, and expressive drapery—is firmly rooted in the Italian High Renaissance.\n\n2.  **Identify the subject matter:** The scene depicts a priest giving a consecrated host (a communion wafer) to a kneeling communicant, while other figures kneel in prayer. This is a clear representation of the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion or the Sacrament of the Altar.\n\n3.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, on a small scroll or cartouche, is an inscription. Although partially obscured and in an old script, the words can be read as \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\". This is Old French for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which directly confirms the subject matter identified in the previous step. The use of French is a significant clue.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the clues:** We have a glazed terracotta tondo in the Italian Renaissance style, depicting the Sacrament of the Altar, with an inscription in French. This combination points towards a work by the della Robbia workshop made for a French-speaking patron or region.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific artwork and artist:** A search based on these clues—\"della Robbia,\" \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" and the French inscription \"Sacrament de l'autel\"—leads to a specific masterpiece: the **Altarpiece of the Sacraments**. This altarpiece is located in the parish church of Saint-Maurice in Fénis, in the Aosta Valley of Italy, a region with a strong historical connection to the French language. The altarpiece consists of a central scene of the Crucifixion surrounded by seven tondos, each depicting one of the seven sacraments. The image provided is the detail of the tondo representing the Eucharist.\n\n6.  **Confirm the author:** Art historical consensus attributes the Fénis Altarpiece of the Sacraments to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435–1525), the nephew of Luca della Robbia and a master of the glazed terracotta technique in his own right.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Medium:** Recognizing the work as glazed terracotta is key to associating it with the della Robbia family.\n*   **Inscription:** Deciphering the Old French inscription is crucial for identifying the specific subject and provides a vital clue to the artwork's provenance.\n*   **Location:** The French inscription points away from a typical commission in Tuscany and towards a region like the Aosta Valley, which helps pinpoint the exact artwork.\n*   **Attribution:** While the della Robbia workshop involved multiple family members, the style, scale, and period of this particular altarpiece align it most closely with the mature work of Andrea della Robbia.\n\nBy combining these observations, we can confidently identify the artist.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
