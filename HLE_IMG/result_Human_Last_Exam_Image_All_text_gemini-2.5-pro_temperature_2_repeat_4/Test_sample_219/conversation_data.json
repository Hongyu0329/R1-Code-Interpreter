    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot representing the electrical activity of a neuronal culture over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128, indicating different locations in the culture.\n*   Each black dot indicates a neuronal firing event (a spike) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a coordinated, nearly simultaneous fashion. On the raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands where many electrodes show activity in a short time window. We need to scan the graph and identify all such events.\n\n**Step 3: List the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nWe will identify the start time of each major synchronized burst by visually inspecting its leading edge on the x-axis.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major burst begins at approximately **t₂ = 12 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Following that, a burst starts at approximately **t₃ = 17 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** There is a slightly less dense, but still clearly synchronized, event starting at approximately **t₄ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** A very prominent burst starts exactly halfway between 30 and 40 s, at **t₅ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 6:** Another strong burst follows shortly after, starting at approximately **t₆ = 38 s**.\n*   **Burst 7:** The final distinct burst in the recorded interval starts at approximately **t₇ = 47 s**.\n\nThus, the timestamps of the identified synchronized bursts are approximately 2s, 12s, 17s, 24s, 35s, 38s, and 47s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed from the start of one burst to the start of the next. Since we identified 7 bursts, there are 6 inter-burst intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **IBI₁** (between Burst 1 and 2): t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 2 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI₂** (between Burst 2 and 3): t₃ - t₂ = 17 s - 12 s = **5 s**\n*   **IBI₃** (between Burst 3 and 4): t₄ - t₃ = 24 s - 17 s = **7 s**\n*   **IBI₄** (between Burst 4 and 5): t₅ - t₄ = 35 s - 24 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI₅** (between Burst 5 and 6): t₆ - t₅ = 38 s - 35 s = **3 s**\n*   **IBI₆** (between Burst 6 and 7): t₇ - t₆ = 47 s - 38 s = **9 s**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the total number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs** = 10 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 3 + 9 = **45 s**\n*   **Number of intervals** = **6**\n*   **Average IBI** = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 45 s / 6 = **7.5 s**\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the answer to be expressed to two significant figures. Our calculated average, 7.5 s, already has two significant figures (the '7' and the '5'). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is 7.5.\n\n<<<7.5>>>"
