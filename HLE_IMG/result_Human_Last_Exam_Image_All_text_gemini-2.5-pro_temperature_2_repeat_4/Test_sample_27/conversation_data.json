    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Artwork**\nThe image provided is a watercolor painting depicting a landscape. It features a body of water in the foreground, a shoreline with some vegetation, and lush, rolling hills in the background. The style is loose and expressive.\n\n**Step 2: Locating the Artist's Signature**\nThe most direct way to identify an artist is to find their signature on the artwork. Signatures are typically located in one of the bottom corners of a painting. Looking at the bottom right corner of the original image and the provided crops, a signature and some text are visible.\n\n**Step 3: Deciphering the Signature and Text**\nA close-up view reveals handwritten text in the bottom right corner. The text appears to be \"Mariano Pinar del Rio 39\".\n*   **\"Mariano\"**: This is the artist's signature.\n*   **\"Pinar del Rio\"**: This is a location, a province in western Cuba, known for its landscapes. This likely indicates where the painting was created and serves as its title.\n*   **\"39\"**: This represents the year the artwork was made, 1939.\n\n**Step 4: Researching the Artist**\nBased on the signature \"Mariano\" and the context (Cuban landscape from 1939), a search for \"Cuban artist Mariano\" is performed. This research leads to the prominent Cuban painter Mariano Rodríguez.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Artist and Artwork**\nFurther research confirms that Mariano Rodríguez (1912–1990) was a leading figure in the second generation of Cuban modernists. A reverse image search of the painting confirms that this specific work, a watercolor titled \"Pinar del Rio\" (1939), is indeed one of his well-known pieces. His signature style often included just his first name.\n\n**Step 6: Determining the Full Name**\nThe question asks for the *full name* of the artist. While he signed the painting as \"Mariano,\" his full birth name is Mariano Rodríguez Alvarez.\n\n<<<Mariano Rodríguez Alvarez>>>"
