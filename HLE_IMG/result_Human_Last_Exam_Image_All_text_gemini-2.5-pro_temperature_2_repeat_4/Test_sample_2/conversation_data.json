    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function designed to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its logic for `n > 1`:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the first recursive call. It is intended to sort the sub-array `a[0...n-2]`. After this call, we can assume the first `n-1` elements are sorted.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: This checks if the last element of the current sub-array (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the largest element of the now-sorted prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n    *   `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it swaps these two elements. This puts the smaller element into the prefix, but potentially disrupts the sorted order of that prefix.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the second recursive call. It is executed *only if* the swap happened. Its purpose is to re-sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]` which now contains a new element that might be out of place.\n\n2.  **Analyze Best-Case vs. Worst-Case Scenarios:**\n    *   **Best Case:** Consider an array that is already sorted, like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n        - When `sort(a, 4)` is called, it first calls `sort(a, 3)`.\n        - `sort(a, 3)` will sort `[1, 2]`. Then it will check `a[2] < a[1]` (i.e., `3 < 2`), which is false. The second recursive call is skipped.\n        - Back in `sort(a, 4)`, after `a[0...2]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 3]`, it checks `a[3] < a[2]` (i.e., `4 < 3`), which is false. Again, the second recursive call is skipped.\n        - In this scenario, for each `n`, there is only one recursive call on `n-1`. The recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`, which results in a time complexity of `O(n)`.\n    *   **Worst Case:** The worst case will occur when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true as often as possible. This forces the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` to be made at every level of `n`. This happens when the input array is sorted in reverse order, for example, `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n        - Let's trace `sort(a, 4)` with `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n        - It first calls `sort(a, 3)` to sort the `[4, 3, 2]` part. This call itself will be a worst-case scenario. Let's assume it completes and `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n        - Now, the `if` condition `a[3] < a[2]` (`1 < 4`) is true.\n        - A swap occurs: `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n        - The second recursive call `sort(a, 3)` is executed to sort the now-unsorted prefix `[2, 3, 1]`. This is another worst-case call for a size 3 subproblem.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    - The first call `sort(a, n-1)` takes `T(n-1)`.\n    - The `if` statement and `swap` take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    - In the worst case, the `if` is true, and the second call `sort(a, n-1)` is executed, which also takes `T(n-1)`.\n    - Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n      `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n      `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` by expansion (also known as the iterative substitution method):\n    - `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    - `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    - `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    - Following the pattern, after `k` steps:\n      `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n    - Let's expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n      `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n    - The term in the parenthesis is a geometric series sum, which equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n      `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    - Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n      `T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    - The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Big O Complexity:**\n    From the solution of the recurrence relation, `T(n)` grows proportionally to `2^n`. Therefore, the time complexity in the worst case is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The algorithm *does* terminate because the size parameter `n` decreases with every recursive call, eventually hitting the base case `n <= 1`. So, option F is incorrect.\n*   The key to the exponential complexity is the `2 * T(n-1)` term in the recurrence. Unlike efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms like Merge Sort (`T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`), this algorithm makes two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1`, which leads to exponential growth.\n*   This algorithm is a classic example of a very inefficient recursive design, often used for educational purposes to illustrate how a seemingly small change (replacing an iterative loop with a full recursive call) can have a dramatic impact on complexity.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe worst-case time complexity is governed by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
