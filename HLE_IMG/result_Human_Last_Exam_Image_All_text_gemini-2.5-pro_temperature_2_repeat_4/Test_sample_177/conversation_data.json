    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Careful Points & Methodology:**\n1.  **Understanding VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It measures the total miles driven by vehicles. This is different from Person Miles Traveled (PMT), which measures the total miles traveled by people.\n2.  **Mode Share represents Person Trips:** The percentages for each mode of transport in the tables represent the share of *person trips*. For example, in the Baseline scenario, 28% of person trips between 0-3 miles are made by carpool.\n3.  **Converting Person Trips to Vehicle Trips:** To calculate VMT, we need the number of *vehicle trips*.\n    *   For \"car, 1 occupant\" (Single Occupancy Vehicle or SOV), one person trip equals one vehicle trip. Occupancy is 1.\n    *   For \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" (carpool), we must use the provided \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" to convert person trips to vehicle trips. The formula is: `Vehicle Trips = Person Trips / Average Occupancy`.\n4.  **Calculation Structure:** We will calculate a \"VMT Index\" for both scenarios. This index will represent the average VMT per trip across all trips, which allows us to compare the two scenarios without knowing the absolute total number of trips.\n    *   The VMT Index is a sum of the VMT contributions from each of the four distance categories.\n    *   `VMT Index = Î£ [ (Share of total trips)_i * (Avg. trip distance)_i * (Effective share of vehicle trips)_i ]`\n    *   `(Effective share of vehicle trips)_i = (Share of SOV trips)_i + (Share of carpool trips)_i / (Average Carpool Occupancy)`\n\n---\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\n\nWe use the data from Table 1, where the Average Carpool Occupancy is 2.8.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 48%\n    *   Avg. distance: 1 mile\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (25% SOV) + (28% Carpool / 2.8) = 0.25 + 0.10 = 0.35\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.48 * 1 * 0.35 = **0.168**\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 22%\n    *   Avg. distance: 4 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (38% SOV) + (43% Carpool / 2.8) = 0.38 + 0.1536 = 0.5336\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.22 * 4 * 0.5336 = **0.4695**\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 14%\n    *   Avg. distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (40% SOV) + (45% Carpool / 2.8) = 0.40 + 0.1607 = 0.5607\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.5607 = **0.5887**\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 16%\n    *   Avg. distance: 20 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (42% SOV) + (47% Carpool / 2.8) = 0.42 + 0.1679 = 0.5879\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.16 * 20 * 0.5879 = **1.8813**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   `0.168 + 0.4695 + 0.5887 + 1.8813 = 3.1075`\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\n\nWe use the data from Table 2, where the Average Carpool Occupancy is 3.0.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 48%\n    *   Avg. distance: 1 mile\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (1% SOV) + (2% Carpool / 3.0) = 0.01 + 0.0067 = 0.0167\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.48 * 1 * 0.0167 = **0.0080**\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 22%\n    *   Avg. distance: 4 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (8% SOV) + (19% Carpool / 3.0) = 0.08 + 0.0633 = 0.1433\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.22 * 4 * 0.1433 = **0.1261**\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 14%\n    *   Avg. distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (14% SOV) + (27% Carpool / 3.0) = 0.14 + 0.09 = 0.23\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.23 = **0.2415**\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of trips: 16%\n    *   Avg. distance: 20 miles\n    *   Effective share of car vehicle trips: (16% SOV) + (33% Carpool / 3.0) = 0.16 + 0.11 = 0.27\n    *   VMT contribution: 0.16 * 20 * 0.27 = **0.8640**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   `0.0080 + 0.1261 + 0.2415 + 0.8640 = 1.2396`\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in VMT**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction Amount:** Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    *   `3.1075 - 1.2396 = 1.8679`\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (VMT Reduction Amount / Baseline VMT Index) * 100%\n    *   `(1.8679 / 3.1075) * 100% = 60.11%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
