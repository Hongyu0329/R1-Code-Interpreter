The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or swan-necked (cygneous), causing the capsule to be bent over to the side.
