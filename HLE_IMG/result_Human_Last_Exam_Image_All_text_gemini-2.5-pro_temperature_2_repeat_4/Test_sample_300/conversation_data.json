This specific piece is one of his many works depicting the landscapes of his hometown region.\n\n3.  **Top Right Work**:\n    *   **Style**: This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a highly expressive and energetic cursive script (草书, Cǎoshū). The fluidity and power of the brushstrokes are characteristic of a master calligrapher.\n    *   **Artist**: The style is unmistakably that of **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**, one of the most celebrated modern masters of cursive script calligraphy, often referred to as the \"Sage of Cursive Script\" (草圣).\n\n4.  **Middle Left Work**:\n    *   **Style**: This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy.

He is famous for his depictions of the Li River and the Yangtze River Gorges.\n\n9.  **Bottom Right Work**:\n    *   **Style**: An ink wash painting of a single lobster (or large prawn).
