    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\nThe structure shown is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's break it down and count the atoms.\n*   **Bicyclic Core (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one):**\n    *   This core consists of two bridgehead carbons (C1, C4), a one-carbon bridge (C7), and two two-atom bridges (N2-C3 and C5-C6).\n    *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   N2 (nitrogen atom)\n    *   C3 (carbonyl carbon): 1 C, 1 O\n    *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   C5 (vinylic carbon): 1 C, 1 H\n    *   C6 (vinylic carbon)\n    *   C7 (methylene bridge): 1 C, 2 H\n    *   Total for the unsubstituted core: C6H5NO.\n\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is attached to one of the vinylic carbons (let's say C6). This adds 1 C and 3 F atoms.\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom (N2). The formula for a PMB group is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. This group contains:\n        *   Carbons (C): 1 (from CH2) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from OCH3) = 8 C.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 2 (from CH2) + 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from CH3) = 9 H.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from OCH3).\n        *   Formula for PMB group: C8H9O.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15 C.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14 H.\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3 (from CF3).\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1 (core).\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2 O.\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group is cleaved from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Change in atoms:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen atom. The net change is the subtraction of a C8H8O fragment.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Start with C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   Subtract C8H8O.\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in atoms:** One molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added across the double bond.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Add H2.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions correspond to acidic hydrolysis. The lactam (a cyclic amide) in Intermediate 2 is hydrolyzed. The bond between the carbonyl carbon (C3) and the nitrogen atom (N2) is cleaved.\n*   **Change in atoms:** This hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2). This process opens the bicyclic ring system to form a substituted cyclopentane amino acid.\n*   **Formula of the Final Product:** The molecular formula refers to the neutral form of the molecule.\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n    *   Add H2O.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Atomic Changes:**\nStarting Material (C15H14F3NO2) → Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) → Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) → Final Product (C7H10F3NO2).\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
