    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the object's characteristics:** The object is a circular medallion with a tab at the top for suspension or attachment. It features two portraits in profile, a man and a woman, facing opposite directions but closely juxtaposed. The style is one of high relief, characteristic of a cameo. The image is a black-and-white photograph, but the detail and quality suggest a high-value material like a layered gemstone (sardonyx) or precious metal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the iconography:** The most prominent and identifying feature is on the male figure on the left. A large, curved ram's horn emerges from his hair just above the ear. This is the horn of the Egyptian god Ammon. After Alexander the Great visited the oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis and was declared a son of the god, this attribute was adopted by him and subsequent Hellenistic rulers, particularly the Ptolemies in Egypt, to signify divine status and legitimacy. The art style itself, with its blend of realistic portraiture and idealized features, is typical of the Hellenistic period.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artifact:** Based on the unique iconography (the double portrait with the horn of Ammon) and high artistic quality, the object can be identified as the famous **Gonzaga Cameo**. It is one of the most celebrated engraved gems from the ancient world.\n\n4.  **Determine the historical context and dating:** The Gonzaga Cameo is a product of the Ptolemaic court in Alexandria, Egypt. The dominant scholarly consensus identifies the couple as **Ptolemy II Philadelphus** (who reigned from 283 to 246 BC) and his powerful sister-wife, **Arsinoe II**. The creation of such a masterpiece of court art, which served to promote the divine image of the rulers, aligns perfectly with the political and cultural environment of their reign.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Century:** Since the medallion is widely dated to the reign of Ptolemy II, its creation falls squarely within the **3rd century BC** (the period from 300 BC to 201 BC).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Iconography is key:** The ram's horn is the single most important clue, immediately placing the object in a post-Alexander the Great, Hellenistic context, and pointing strongly towards Ptolemaic Egypt.\n*   **Artistic Style:** The style is not archaic Greek, classical Greek, or Roman Imperial. It is distinctly Hellenistic, known for its dynamic compositions, heightened emotionalism, and realistic-yet-idealized portraiture.\n*   **Distinguishing from other periods:** Roman portraits, for example, often trend towards more pronounced realism (verism), especially during the Republic. The idealism in this piece is a hallmark of Hellenistic royal portraiture.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** While alternative identifications for the figures have been proposed (such as Alexander the Great and his mother Olympias), the attribution to Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II and a 3rd-century BC date is the most widely accepted view among archaeologists and art historians. All serious attributions place it in this century.\n\n<<<3rd century BC>>>"
