    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Context:**\n*   **Piece:** Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, \"Pathétique\".\n*   **Movement:** 1st Movement (Grave – Allegro di molto e con brio).\n*   **Key Signature:** The movement is in C minor, which has a key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   **Location:** We need to analyze measure 30. Looking at the score, the measure is clearly labeled and is part of the transition section of the sonata's exposition, which moves from the home key to a new key area.\n\n**2. Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   We first need to identify all the notes being played in this measure to determine the chord.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are G♯4, E5, D♯5, C♯5, B4, G♯4, F♯4, D♯4.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave: E2 and G♯2. These two notes are held for the entire measure.\n*   **Combine the notes:** The primary harmonic notes, strongly emphasized by the left hand and the main beats in the right hand, are E, G♯, and B (the B appears on the third beat). The other notes (D♯, C♯, F♯) are non-chord tones, functioning as passing notes or appoggiaturas within the arpeggiated figure.\n\n**3. Determine the Chord Quality:**\n*   The collection of primary notes (E, G♯, B) clearly spells out an **E major triad**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Chord's Function (Harmonic Analysis):**\n*   **Relation to the Home Key (C minor):** The home key is C minor. An E major chord is not diatonic (naturally occurring) in the key of C minor. The diatonic scale is C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭. The mediant (iii) chord would be E♭ major (E♭-G-B♭). Therefore, the E major chord is a chromatic chord.\n*   **Look at the Surrounding Measures for Context:** To understand a chromatic chord's function, we must look at what comes before and, most importantly, what comes after it.\n    *   **Measure 31:** The E major harmony continues.\n    *   **Measure 32:** The harmony changes to an A minor chord (left hand plays A, right hand plays A-C dyads).\n*   **Identify the relationship:** An E major chord is the dominant (V) chord of A minor. In music theory, when a chord's function is to lead to another chord outside the home key, it is called a secondary dominant or applied dominant.\n*   **Relate the local key to the home key:** The E major chord is V of A minor. Now, we must determine the function of A minor within the home key of C minor.\n    *   In C minor, the sixth scale degree is A♭. The diatonic submediant chord (vi) is A♭ major (A♭-C-E♭).\n    *   The A minor chord uses an A♮ instead of an A♭. This is a common chromatic alteration, often seen as a borrowing from the parallel major key (C major, where A minor is the diatonic vi chord).\n    *   Therefore, the A minor chord functions as a chromatic submediant, written as **vi**.\n*   **Combine the analysis:** The chord in measure 30 (E major) is the dominant of the submediant. In Roman numeral analysis, this is notated as \"V of vi\".\n\n**5. Final Roman Numeral Formulation:**\n*   The chord is a major triad, so we use an uppercase Roman numeral: **V**.\n*   It is functioning as the dominant of the submediant chord, which is minor: **vi**.\n*   The complete and correct Roman numeral is **V/vi**.\n\n<<<V/vi>>>"
