    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the textual prompt:** The prompt describes an illusion that is analogous to the Necker Cube. The Necker Cube is a famous example of bistable perception, where the brain can interpret the same 2D stimulus in two different stable 3D ways. The prompt states the illusion in question also involves a perceptual ambiguity and reveals a common, unconscious perceptual ability. This suggests our brain is \"filling in\" information or making an interpretation rather than just passively receiving sensory data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the image:** The image consists of two graphs, both with time on the x-axis.\n    *   **Top graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of a sound over time. The vertical axis represents frequency, and the brightness represents the intensity of that frequency. We can see a persistent, bright horizontal line, which represents a continuous pure tone of a single frequency. In the middle of the spectrogram, there is a vertical band of bright, broad signal. This represents a short burst of sound containing many frequencies, such as white noise or a click. Crucially, the horizontal line of the tone continues *through* this vertical noise burst. This means that physically, the tone never stops; the noise is simply added on top of it for a brief period.\n    *   **Bottom graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It corresponds to the spectrogram above it. We see a regular sine wave (representing the pure tone), which is then replaced by a complex, irregular waveform (representing the noise burst), and then the sine wave resumes.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the information from the text and image:** The key to the illusion lies in the discrepancy between the physical reality shown in the spectrogram and the typical human perception.\n    *   **Physical reality:** A continuous tone has a burst of noise layered on top of it.\n    *   **Common perception:** When people listen to this sound, they do not hear the tone stopping and being replaced by noise. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* \"behind\" the noise burst. The brain perceptually restores the missing part of the tone, inferring its continuity through the masking noise.\n    *   **Connection to prompt:** This \"perceptual restoration\" is the \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" mentioned. The brain actively constructs a perception of continuity. The analogy to the Necker Cube is that the brain is making an interpretationâ€”choosing the \"continuous tone\" explanation over the \"tone-plus-noise\" explanation, which is physically more accurate but perceptually less plausible.\n\n4.  **Identify the name of the phenomenon:** This well-documented auditory illusion is known as the **continuity illusion** or the **auditory continuity effect**. A specific version of this that involves perceiving missing speech sounds (phonemes) is called the phonemic restoration effect. Given the image shows a simple tone, the more general term, \"continuity illusion,\" is the most accurate answer.\n\nFinal careful points to consider:\n*   The illusion is auditory, not visual.\n*   The core of the illusion is the perception of continuity despite a physical interruption or masking.\n*   The spectrogram is key to understanding the physical stimulus (continuous tone + noise).\n*   The comparison to the Necker Cube highlights the active, interpretive nature of perception.\n\n<<<Continuity illusion>>>"
