    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the seal's characters:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the object**\nThe image shows the face of a seal (chop). The characters are carved in reverse so that when pressed onto paper, they create a correct-reading impression. To decipher the text, we must first mentally mirror the image.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the script style**\nThe characters are engraved in Seal Script (篆書/篆书, zhuànshū), an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy. This style often has different structures from modern characters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the characters on the impression**\nAfter mentally flipping the seal horizontally, the layout on the paper impression would be:\nTop Right: `琴` (qín)\nTop Left: `書` (shū)\nBottom Right: `廬` (lú)\nBottom Left: `主` (zhǔ)\n\nHere's a breakdown of each character:\n*   **琴 (qín):** This character means \"zither\" or a similar stringed instrument. Its seal script form is recognizable.\n*   **書 (shū):** This character means \"book,\" \"writing,\" or \"calligraphy.\" The seal script version clearly shows the `聿` (yù) radical on top (representing a hand holding a brush) and `曰` (yuē) below (representing a document or speech).\n*   **廬 (lú):** This character means \"cottage\" or \"hut.\" The seal script shows the `广` (guǎng) radical, indicating a shelter or building, over a phonetic component.\n*   **主 (zhǔ):** This character means \"master,\" \"owner,\" or \"host.\" The seal script form, resembling a stylized lamp on a stand, is a classic representation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the reading order and meaning**\nChinese four-character seals are typically read in a specific order. The two most common are:\n1.  **Columnar:** Read the right column from top to bottom, then the left column from top to bottom. This would yield `琴廬書主` (Qín Lú Shū Zhǔ). This translates to \"Zither Cottage, Book Master,\" which is a bit disjointed.\n2.  **Zigzag (迴文, huíwén):** Read the top row from right to left, then the bottom row from right to left. This yields `琴書廬主` (Qín Shū Lú Zhǔ).\n\nThe zigzag reading `琴書廬主` makes the most sense. It can be interpreted as \"The Master (主) of the Cottage (廬) of Zither and Books (琴書)\". `琴書` is a very common classical pairing that represents the refined pursuits of a scholar or artist (music and literature). This forms a cohesive and elegant title, which is very typical for a personal seal.\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Simplified Chinese**\nFinally, we convert the traditional characters to their simplified form:\n*   `琴` remains `琴`.\n*   `書` simplifies to `书`.\n*   `廬` simplifies to `庐`.\n*   `主` remains `主`.\n\nThe resulting text is **琴书庐主**.\n\n<<<琴书庐主>>>"
