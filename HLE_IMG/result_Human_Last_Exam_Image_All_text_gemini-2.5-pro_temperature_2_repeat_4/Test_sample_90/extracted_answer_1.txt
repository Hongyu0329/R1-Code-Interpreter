The structures of the three products are as follows:

**Product A:** 
The structure results from a sequence of decarboxylation, N-acetylation, and Michael addition.
 

**Product B:**
The structure is a complex tricyclic system formed by a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by rearrangement and elimination of methanol.
 

**Product C:**
The structure is the result of the N-acetylation of the enamine tautomer of the starting material.
