    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nLet G be the given graph.\n-   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, `n=5`.\n-   **Edges (E):** The edges are E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n-   **Key Features:**\n    - The graph contains two triangles (complete subgraphs K₃): T₁ = {2, 3, 4} and T₂ = {3, 4, 5}.\n    - These two triangles share a common edge (3, 4).\n    - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n    - The graph is not a standard type like a complete graph, cycle, or wheel graph, so we need a general method.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\n\nThe most systematic method for computing the chromatic polynomial is the **Deletion-Contraction Formula**. For any edge `e` in a graph G, the chromatic polynomial `P(G, k)` satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)`\n\nwhere:\n-   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n-   `G / e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and any resulting multiple edges are replaced by a single edge).\n\nWe should choose an edge `e` that simplifies the graph significantly. A good choice is an edge connected to a vertex of low degree, like `e = (1, 2)`.\n\n### Step 3: Compute P(G - e, k)\n\n-   Let `e = (1, 2)`. The graph `G - e` is the original graph without the edge (1, 2).\n-   In `G - e`, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. This makes vertex 1 a \"pendant\" vertex.\n-   To find the chromatic polynomial of `G - e`, we can first color the subgraph `G'` which consists of vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} with their original edges. Then, for each valid coloring of `G'`, we find the number of ways to color vertex 1.\n-   The subgraph `G'` has vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This is the graph formed by two triangles, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, sharing the edge (3,4).\n-   Let's find `P(G', k)`. We can color the vertices in the order 3, 4, 2, 5:\n    1.  Color vertex 3: `k` choices.\n    2.  Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): `k-1` choices.\n    3.  Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n    4.  Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n    So, `P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²`.\n-   Now, we color vertex 1 in `G - e`. Since it is only adjacent to vertex 5, its color must be different from the color of vertex 5. There are `k-1` choices for vertex 1.\n-   Therefore, `P(G - e, k) = P(G', k) × (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² × (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²`.\n\n### Step 4: Compute P(G / e, k)\n\n-   Next, we consider the graph `G / e`, where `e = (1, 2)` is contracted.\n-   The vertices 1 and 2 are merged into a single new vertex, let's call it `v₁₂`. The graph `G / e` has vertices `{v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}`.\n-   The edges in `G / e` are determined by the edges of G:\n    -   Edges not involving 1 or 2 are kept: `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,5)`.\n    -   Edges connected to 1 (like (1,5)) or 2 (like (2,3), (2,4)) are reconnected to `v₁₂`.\n    -   The edge `(1,5)` becomes `(v₁₂, 5)`.\n    -   The edge `(2,3)` becomes `(v₁₂, 3)`.\n    -   The edge `(2,4)` becomes `(v₁₂, 4)`.\n-   The set of edges in `G / e` is `{(v₁₂, 3), (v₁₂, 4), (v₁₂, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}`.\n-   This is the set of all possible 6 edges on 4 vertices. Thus, `G / e` is the complete graph `K₄`.\n-   The chromatic polynomial of `K₄` is a standard formula: `P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n### Step 5: Combine and Simplify\n\nNow we substitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the deletion-contraction formula:\n\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n\nTo simplify, we factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]`\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n`[ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ] = [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]`\n`= k² - 4k + 5`\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the equation:\n\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify graph properties:** Recognizing the structure (two triangles sharing an edge, plus vertex 1) is key.\n2.  **Choose a suitable edge for deletion-contraction:** The edge `(1,2)` is a good choice as it leads to a pendant vertex in `G-e` and a standard `K₄` in `G/e`.\n3.  **Accurately determine the structure of `G-e` and `G/e`:** A common mistake is misidentifying the edges in the contracted graph `G/e`. It's crucial to correctly track all adjacencies.\n4.  **Use known chromatic polynomials correctly:** Knowing `P(K_n,k)` is helpful.\n5.  **Perform algebraic simplification without errors:** Factoring before expanding can reduce the chance of mistakes.\n6.  **Optional check:** One could verify the result using an alternative method, such as a case-based analysis on the colors of two non-adjacent vertices (e.g., vertices 2 and 5), to build confidence in the result.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe chromatic polynomial is `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)>>>"
