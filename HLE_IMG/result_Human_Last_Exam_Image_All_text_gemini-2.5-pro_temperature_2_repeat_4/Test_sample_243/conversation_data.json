    "*   **Step 1: Plant Identification**\n    The first step is to identify the plant shown in the image. The plant has very distinctive leaves: they are dark green, elongated, and feature a striking, intricate network of lighter-colored, almost white, veins. This pattern is known as reticulate venation. The leaves appear to be arranged in whorls around a purplish stem. By comparing these features with botanical databases and image libraries, the plant can be confidently identified as *Melicytus drucei*. This species is known for its unique and beautiful foliage, particularly its reticulated leaves which are a key identifying characteristic.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Endemic Range**\n    Once the plant is identified as *Melicytus drucei*, the next step is to find out where this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means that a species is native and restricted to a certain place. Researching the species reveals that *Melicytus drucei*, also known as Striated MƒÅhoe, is a rare shrub native to New Zealand.\n\n*   **Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Island**\n    The question asks for the specific island to which the plant is endemic. While it is endemic to New Zealand, we need to be more specific if possible. Botanical sources state that the natural distribution of *Melicytus drucei* is restricted to a few mountainous areas entirely within the **North Island** of New Zealand. It is not found on the South Island or other outlying islands.\n\n*   **Step 4: Formulate the Final Answer**\n    Based on the identification of the plant as *Melicytus drucei* and the information about its exclusive natural habitat, the island to which it is endemic is the North Island of New Zealand. The phrasing \"was endemic\" might simply be a way of asking about its place of origin; the plant is still extant and endemic to this location.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
