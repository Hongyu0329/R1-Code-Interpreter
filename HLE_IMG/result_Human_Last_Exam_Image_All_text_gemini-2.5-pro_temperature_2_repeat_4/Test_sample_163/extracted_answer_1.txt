The compounds A and B are the two regioisomers formed from the addition of a benzoate group and a tert-butoxy group across the double bond of styrene. Their structures are:
A: 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate
B: 1-(tert-butoxy)-2-benzoyloxy-1-phenylethane (also known as 2-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate)

Chemically, they are represented as:
A: C₆H₅-CH(OCOC₆H₅)-CH₂(OC(CH₃)₃)
B: C₆H₅-CH(OC(CH₃)₃)-CH₂(OCOC₆H₅)
The assignment of A and B to a specific structure is arbitrary without further data.
