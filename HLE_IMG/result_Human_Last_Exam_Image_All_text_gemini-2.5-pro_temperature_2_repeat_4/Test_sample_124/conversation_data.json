    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the goal and components:** The question asks for the total current supplied by the voltage source V2.\n    *   Voltage source V2 = 1 V.\n    *   Resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, R3 = 9 Ω, R7 = 100 Ω, R8 = 100 Ω.\n    *   Total current (I_total) is given by Ohm's Law: I_total = V2 / R_total, where R_total is the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.\n\n2.  **Analyze the circuit connections (The careful point):** The wiring in this circuit is intentionally tricky and must be traced carefully. Let's define the two main nodes connected to the voltage source.\n    *   Let Node A be the top wire, connected to the positive terminal of V2.\n    *   Let Node B be the bottom wire, connected to the negative terminal (ground).\n    *   The voltage between Node A and Node B is 1 V.\n\n3.  **Analyze the left side of the circuit (R1, R2, R3):**\n    *   Let's examine the connections for each resistor in this section.\n    *   **Resistor R1:** The top of R1 is connected to Node A. The bottom of R1 (at the junction with R2) has a wire that goes up and connects back to Node A. Since both terminals of R1 are connected to the same node (Node A), R1 is short-circuited. No current will flow through a short-circuited resistor.\n    *   **Resistor R2:** R2 is connected between the R1/R2 junction and the R2/R3 junction. As established, the R1/R2 junction is connected to Node A. There is also a wire from the R2/R3 junction that goes up and connects to Node A. Therefore, both terminals of R2 are also connected to Node A, meaning R2 is also short-circuited and carries no current.\n    *   **Resistor R3:** The top of R3 is at the R2/R3 junction, which is connected to Node A by a wire. The bottom of R3 is connected to Node B. Thus, R3 is effectively connected directly across Node A and Node B (in parallel with the voltage source).\n\n4.  **Analyze the right side of the circuit (R7, R8):**\n    *   The top of R8 is connected to Node A.\n    *   The bottom of R8 is connected to the top of R7.\n    *   The bottom of R7 is connected to Node B.\n    *   This means R7 and R8 are connected in series with each other. This series combination is connected across Node A and Node B (in parallel with the voltage source).\n\n5.  **Construct the simplified equivalent circuit:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the complex circuit simplifies to two parallel branches connected to the 1V source.\n    *   **Branch 1:** Contains only resistor R3 (9 Ω).\n    *   **Branch 2:** Contains resistors R7 and R8 in series (100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω).\n    *   Resistors R1 and R2 are short-circuited and can be ignored in the calculation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the current in each branch:**\n    *   The voltage across both parallel branches is 1 V.\n    *   Current through Branch 1 (I₃):\n        I₃ = V2 / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω = 1/9 A.\n    *   Current through Branch 2 (I₇₈):\n        I₇₈ = V2 / (R7 + R8) = 1 V / (100 Ω + 100 Ω) = 1 V / 200 Ω = 1/200 A.\n\n7.  **Calculate the total current:**\n    *   According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current leaving the source is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\n    *   I_total = I₃ + I₇₈\n    *   I_total = (1/9) A + (1/200) A\n    *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9 * 200 = 1800.\n    *   I_total = (200/1800) A + (9/1800) A\n    *   I_total = (200 + 9) / 1800 A = 209/1800 A\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   The exact current is 209/1800 Amperes. Converting this to a decimal gives:\n    *   I_total ≈ 0.116111... A.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the current is 0.116 A.\n\n<<<0.116 A>>>"
