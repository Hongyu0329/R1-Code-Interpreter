    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the input image and the question.**\n    The image is a Google Trends graph showing the relative search interest for three different topics (represented by red, yellow, and blue lines) over time. The time frame is from December 2019 to late 2023. The question states that these three topics are \"historic events\" that all occurred in a single country and that a historian would find the country obvious. The goal is to identify this country.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify patterns in the graph.**\n    The graph clearly shows that all three lines have recurring, sharp peaks that occur at the same time each year. This is a classic signature of annual events, such as holidays, festivals, or anniversaries. Our task is to identify these three annual events to determine the country.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the timing of each event's annual peak.**\n    *   **Red Line:** This line shows a prominent, sharp peak every year around the middle of January. We can see a peak shortly after December 2019 (in Jan 2020), another in Jan 2021, Jan 2022, and Jan 2023.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line has a very sharp peak, and sometimes the highest peak overall (reaching 100 on the scale), at the very end of May each year. This is evident in May 2020, 2021, 2022, and especially around the marked date of \"May 28, 2023\".\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller, but consistent, annual peak in the latter half of February. It appears after the red peak and before the yellow peak each year.\n\n*   **Step 4: Form a hypothesis by matching the timed events to a single country's historic commemorations.**\n    We need to find a country with three major historical events/holidays corresponding to mid-January, late February, and late May. Let's test the hypothesis that the country is the **United States**, given the significant number of federal holidays that commemorate its history.\n\n    *   **Mid-January Event (Red Line): Martin Luther King Jr. Day.** This US federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of January to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader. Its timing perfectly matches the annual peaks of the red line.\n\n    *   **Late February Event (Blue Line): Presidents' Day.** This US federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of February. It originally honored George Washington but is now widely seen as a day to celebrate all U.S. presidents. This timing aligns perfectly with the annual peaks of the blue line.\n\n    *   **Late May Event (Yellow Line): Memorial Day.** This US federal holiday is observed on the last Monday of May. It honors military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. The date \"May 28, 2023\" shown on the graph is the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend 2023 (Memorial Day was Monday, May 29th), which is when search interest would be at its peak. This timing perfectly matches the prominent yellow peaks.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n    The timing of the three distinct annual search peaks strongly corresponds to three major US federal holidays that commemorate significant historical events and figures: Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January), Presidents' Day (February), and Memorial Day (May). No other country has a set of major national historic commemorations that fit this specific annual pattern. Therefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
