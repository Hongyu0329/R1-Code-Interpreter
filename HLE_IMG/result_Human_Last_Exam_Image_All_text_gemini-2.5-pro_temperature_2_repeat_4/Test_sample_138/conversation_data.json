    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect. The primary characteristics used to differentiate sexes in bees and wasps (Order Hymenoptera) are antenna length and segment count, number of abdominal segments, and facial coloration.\n\n**General Rules for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). Male antennae can also be curled at the tips.\n*   **Abdomen:** Males usually have one more visible segment on their abdomen than females (e.g., 7 vs. 6). A female's abdomen ends in a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which can make it look more pointed. A male's abdomen is often blunter.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have more extensive yellow, white, or cream-colored markings on their faces (especially the clypeus, or \"upper lip\") than females, who often have dark faces.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** These are only found on females that are not cuckoo/parasitic. The question states these taxa lack scopae on their legs, guiding us to consider wasps, cleptoparasitic bees (cuckoo bees), or bees with abdominal scopae. Males never have scopae.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees, likely *Coelioxys* (sharp-tailed cuckoo bees). Cuckoo bees are cleptoparasites and lack pollen-collecting scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Left Insect (A):** The antennae are long and the abdomen has 7 visible segments. These are characteristics of a **male** bee.\n*   **Right Insect (A):** This bee has a distinctively long, pointed, and conical abdomen. This is a modified ovipositor characteristic of a **female** *Coelioxys*, used to lay eggs in the nests of other bees.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely genus *Polistes*. Wasps are pollinators and do not have scopae.\n*   **Left Insect (B):** This wasp's antennae are relatively short. Its abdomen is pointed at the tip, concealing a stinger, and appears to have 6 visible segments. These are traits of a **female** wasp.\n*   **Right Insect (B):** This wasp's antennae are noticeably longer than the one on the left and are curled at the tips, a classic feature of **male** wasps. The end of the abdomen is also blunter.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair C:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini).\n*   **Left Insect (C):** This bee exhibits two key male characteristics: very long antennae that extend far behind the head, and a prominent pale yellow/cream-colored patch on its face (the clypeus). This is a **male**.\n*   **Right Insect (C):** This bee has much shorter antennae compared to the one on the left. Its face is dark, lacking the pale markings of the male. These features identify it as a **female**. While females of this group typically have large scopae on their legs (contradicting the prompt's general rule), the sexual dimorphism shown (antennae length, face color) is the most direct and unambiguous evidence for identification in this image.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Compilation:**\n*   Pair A is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   Pair B is F, M, which is index **4**.\n*   Pair C is M, F, which is index **3**.\n\nCombining these gives the final answer.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
