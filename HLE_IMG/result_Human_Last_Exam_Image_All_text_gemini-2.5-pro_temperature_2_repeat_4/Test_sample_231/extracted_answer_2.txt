The final compound C is obtained by taking the structure of A, replacing the central positively charged carbon atom with a carbon atom bonded to a diethylamino group (-N(CH2CH3)2), and replacing all five methoxy groups (-OCH3) with hydroxyl groups (-OH). The core fused ring structure, including the two carbonyl groups, remains intact.
The structure is:
