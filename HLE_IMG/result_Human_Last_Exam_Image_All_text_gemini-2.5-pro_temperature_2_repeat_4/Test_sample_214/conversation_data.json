    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic form.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided information from the question.**\n*   The work is a \"sequence of erasure poems\". An erasure poem is a form of found poetry created by erasing words from an existing text.\n*   The sequence is structured in a \"four-line stanza\". A stanza is a grouped set of lines within a poem, usually set off from others by a blank line.\n*   The attached image represents the **third line** of this stanza.\n*   The final line (the fourth line) consists of the words \"nacreous wavers\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided lines for syllable count, a key feature of many poetic forms.**\n*   **Line 4:** \"nacreous wavers\".\n    *   \"na-cre-ous\" has 3 syllables.\n    *   \"wa-vers\" has 2 syllables.\n    *   Total for Line 4 = 3 + 2 = **5 syllables**.\n*   **Line 3:** The words in the image are \"ghostly\", \"velum\", \"form s[...]\", \"like a\", \"dance\". Assembled, they form the phrase \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\".\n    *   \"ghost-ly\" has 2 syllables.\n    *   \"ve-lum\" has 2 syllables.\n    *   \"forms\" has 1 syllable.\n    *   \"like\" has 1 syllable.\n    *   \"a\" has 1 syllable.\n    *   \"dance\" has 1 syllable.\n    *   Total for Line 3 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **8 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Look for poetic forms that match the observed structure.**\n*   The poem has four lines. The syllable structure of the last two lines is 8, then 5.\n*   The 5-syllable final line is a very strong indicator of a Japanese poetic form, as the 5 and 7 syllable units are its building blocks. Specifically, it matches the final line of a **haiku** (5-7-5) or the first/third line of a **tanka** (5-7-5-7-7).\n*   Since this is the *final* line of the stanza, the haiku is a stronger candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Haiku form against all the given information.**\n*   A traditional haiku has a 5-7-5 syllable structure over **three lines**, not four. This appears to contradict the \"four-line stanza\" mentioned in the question.\n*   **Careful point:** In English-language poetry, it is a common convention to present a three-line haiku as a four-line stanza by splitting the longer middle line of 7 syllables into two shorter lines.\n*   Under this convention, the structure would be:\n    *   Line 1: 5 syllables\n    *   Line 2: A portion of the original 7-syllable line\n    *   Line 3: The remainder of the original 7-syllable line\n    *   Line 4: 5 syllables\n*   Let's check the given information against this four-line haiku structure:\n    *   The fourth line has 5 syllables (\"nacreous wavers\"). This fits perfectly.\n    *   The third line is given in the image. Its syllable count is 8. This does *not* fit the 7-syllable pattern of the middle line. The third line alone has more syllables than the entire middle line should have.\n\n**Step 5: Reconcile the discrepancy.**\n*   **Careful point:** While traditional Japanese haiku have a strict 5-7-5 syllable count, many contemporary poets writing haikus in English (and artists creating found poetry) do not adhere to the strict syllable count. They focus instead on the spirit of the haiku: capturing a single moment, using concrete imagery, and often creating a juxtaposition or \"turn\" between the parts.\n*   The fact that this is an *erasure poem* is crucial. The poet, Mary Ruefle, is limited to the words available in the source text. It may be impossible to find phrases that perfectly match the 5-7-5 syllable structure on every page while still creating a meaningful poem.\n*   Therefore, the poem follows the *form* of a haiku in its three-part structure and imagistic focus, but it is a modern interpretation where syllable count is flexible. The 5-syllable final line is a strong nod to the traditional form, anchoring the poem in that tradition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of a 5-syllable final line, the work being from a sequence of short imagistic poems, and the common practice of presenting haikus in four lines points to one specific form, despite the loose syllable count in the third line.\n\n<<<Haiku>>>"
