The image displays a fungal infection within tissue, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). The microorganism is a dimorphic fungus, characterized by the presence of both **budding yeast** forms (small, oval cells) and **pseudohyphae** (chains of elongated budding cells with constrictions at the septa). This morphology is classic for an infection caused by a species of **Candida**, such as *Candida albicans*.
