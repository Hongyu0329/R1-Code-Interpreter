    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the subject of the image.**\n    The image displays three panels (L, M, N) showing micrographs of a filamentous, multi-cellular structure. This structure is composed of elongated cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The overall morphology is characteristic of a fungal hypha, which is the basic structural unit of most fungi.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the changes depicted across the panels.**\n    The three panels appear to illustrate different stages of a dynamic process.\n    *   In panel **L**, we see a relatively straight hyphal filament. An arrowhead points to a specific septum between two cells.\n    *   In panel **M**, at a location near the septum pointed to in L, a distinct swelling or bulge has appeared on the side of the hypha. The arrowhead in this panel points directly to this nascent bulge.\n    *   In panel **N**, this bulge has clearly developed into a new, smaller filament growing outwards from the parent hypha. This is a new branch. The arrowhead points to the junction where the new branch originates from the main filament. The main filament itself appears to be slightly bent due to this growth.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the observations to identify the process.**\n    The sequence shows the initiation and development of a new hyphal filament from the side of an existing one. This process is a fundamental aspect of fungal growth and colony expansion.\n\n*   **Step 4: Name the biological process.**\n    The formation of a new hypha from an existing one is called **hyphal branching**. The images specifically capture the initiation of a lateral branch, from an initial swelling to the emergence of a distinct new filament. This is a form of vegetative growth that allows the fungus to explore its environment and increase its mass.\n\n*   **Final careful points:**\n    *   The structure is a hypha, not an alga or plant root hair, due to the presence of regular septa and the typical morphology.\n    *   The process is growth by branching, not sexual reproduction (like conjugation or gamete fusion) or spore germination.\n    *   The arrowheads are crucial guides, highlighting the exact point of branch initiation.\n\nCombining these steps, the process depicted is the branching of a fungal hypha.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching (or the formation of a lateral branch from a fungal hypha).>>>"
