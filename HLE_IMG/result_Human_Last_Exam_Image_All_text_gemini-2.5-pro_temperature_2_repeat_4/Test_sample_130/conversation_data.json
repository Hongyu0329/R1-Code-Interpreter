    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the element corresponding to the given spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is produced when the electrons of an atom are excited to higher energy levels (for example, by heat or electricity) and then fall back to lower energy levels, emitting photons of light in the process. Each photon has a specific energy, which corresponds to a specific wavelength (and thus, color) of light. The result is a series of bright, discrete colored lines against a dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Significance of Spectral Lines**\nA crucial point in atomic physics is that every chemical element has a unique set of electron energy levels. Consequently, each element emits a unique and characteristic pattern of spectral lines when excited. This pattern acts as a \"fingerprint\" or \"barcode\" for the element, allowing scientists to identify elements in distant stars, nebulae, or laboratory samples.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Features of the Given Spectrum**\nLet's carefully observe the prominent lines and their colors in the spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer wavelength to shorter wavelength):\n\n*   **Red Region:** There is a strong, bright red line. There are also a couple of other, fainter red lines nearby.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very prominent, bright yellow-orange line. This is one of the most noticeable features.\n*   **Green Region:** There are several lines in the green part of the spectrum. One is particularly bright.\n*   **Blue-Green (Cyan) Region:** A distinct, fairly bright line is visible in this region.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in this area, clustered together. Some are brighter than others.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Observed Pattern with Known Spectra of Common Elements**\nNow, we compare the pattern we've identified with the known emission spectra of some common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a strong red line (H-alpha), a blue-green line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is much more complex, containing many more lines, including a very bright yellow one, which hydrogen lacks. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** Sodium is famous for its spectrum being overwhelmingly dominated by a very strong yellow doublet (two lines extremely close together that often look like a single line). While the given spectrum has a bright yellow line, it also has other very strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The sodium spectrum does not have these other prominent lines. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon gas is known for the bright red-orange color of neon signs. Its spectrum is dominated by a large number of lines in the red and orange parts of the spectrum. The given image shows a more balanced spectrum with significant and strong lines across all colors, not just red-orange. Therefore, it is not neon.\n*   **Helium:** Let's consider the spectrum of helium. It is known to have the following prominent lines in the visible range:\n    *   A bright red line (~667.8 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (~587.6 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~501.6 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-green line (~492.2 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-violet line (~447.1 nm)\n    *   Several other lines in the blue and violet.\nThis description perfectly matches the pattern observed in the provided image: a strong red line, a very distinct and bright yellow line, and several other strong lines in the green, blue-green, and blue-violet regions. The number, position, and relative brightness of the lines in the image are characteristic of helium.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBy comparing the pattern of the spectral lines in the image with the known emission spectra of different elements, the pattern uniquely matches that of Helium. The combination of the strong red, very strong yellow, and other distinct lines in the green and blue parts of the spectrum is the unmistakable fingerprint of helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
