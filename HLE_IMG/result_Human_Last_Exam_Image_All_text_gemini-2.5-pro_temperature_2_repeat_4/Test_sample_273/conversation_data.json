    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereogenic centers (chiral centers) in the molecule. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. We can identify three such centers in the given molecule. Let's number the carbon backbone for clarity. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol (-OH) group has higher priority than the amine (-NH2) group. The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon must be identified.\n\nLet's trace the longest chain containing the carbon bonded to the OH group. Let's call that carbon C2 (as it's the second from the left in the main chain shown). The chain extends from the leftmost methyl group (C1), through C2, C3, C4, and to the carbon of the aminomethyl group (let's call it C5). This is a 5-carbon chain, so it is a derivative of pentanol. The primary amine is on C5.\nLet's use the visual left-to-right numbering C2, C3, C4 for the chiral centers as they appear in the drawing.\n- **C2**: Bonded to a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a hydrogen atom (H), and the rest of the chain (C3). These four groups are different, so C2 is a chiral center.\n- **C3**: Bonded to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (H), and two different parts of the carbon chain (C2 and C4). These four groups are different, so C3 is a chiral center.\n- **C4**: Bonded to a methyl group (CH3), an aminomethyl group (CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (H), and the rest of the chain (C3). These four groups are different, so C4 is a chiral center.\n\nThe task is to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of these three centers: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**2. Assign Priorities using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\nThe priority of the groups attached to a chiral center is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the center. Higher atomic number means higher priority. If there's a tie, we proceed along the chains until the first point of difference is found.\n\n---\n**Analysis of C4 (rightmost chiral center)**\n\n*   **Groups attached**: -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H, and -C3 (rest of the molecule to the left).\n*   **Assigning priorities**:\n    1.  Compare the atoms directly attached to C4: C (in -CH2NH2), C (in -CH3), C (in -C3), and H. Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number, so **-H is priority 4**.\n    2.  To break the tie between the three carbon-containing groups, we look at the atoms they are bonded to:\n        - In **-CH2NH2**: the carbon is bonded to {N, H, H}.\n        - In **-C3(...)**: the carbon C3 is bonded to {C(C2), C(ethyl), H}, so the list is {C, C, H}.\n        - In **-CH3**: the carbon is bonded to {H, H, H}.\n    3.  Comparing these lists based on the highest atomic number atom in each: {N, H, H} vs {C, C, H} vs {H, H, H}. Since N (Z=7) > C (Z=6) > H (Z=1), the priorities are:\n        - **Priority 1: -CH2NH2**\n        - **Priority 2: -C3(...)**\n        - **Priority 3: -CH3**\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    - The molecule is drawn with the -CH2NH2 group on a wedge (out of the page) and the -CH3 group on a dash (into the page).\n    - The bonds to C3 and the implied H are in the plane of the page.\n    - To determine the configuration, we can use the swap method. The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is in the plane. We swap it with the group on the dash (-CH3, priority 3).\n    - After the swap, -H is on the dash (pointing away), and -CH3 is in the plane.\n    - Now we look at the sequence from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -CH2NH2 (wedge) → -C3 (plane) → -CH3 (plane).\n    - This sequence traces a counter-clockwise path.\n    - Since we performed one swap, we must reverse this result. S becomes R.\n*   **Conclusion for C4**: The absolute configuration is **(R)**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of C3 (middle chiral center)**\n\n*   **Groups attached**: -C2(...), -C4(...), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n*   **Assigning priorities**:\n    1.  **-H is priority 4**.\n    2.  Compare the three carbon groups:\n        - In **-C2(...)**: C2 is bonded to {O, C, H}.\n        - In **-C4(...)**: C4 is bonded to {C, C, H} (and one of those Cs is attached to N). To be precise, its list of bonded atoms is {C(of CH2NH2), C(of CH3), H}. The list for the C in CH2NH2 is {N,H,H}. The list for C in C3 is {C,C,H}. The N atom gives the -CH2NH2 group high priority, but when comparing C2 and C4 from C3, we look at the first shell of atoms from C2 and C4. For C2, the list is {O, C, H}. For C4, it's {C,C,H}.\n        - In **-CH2CH3**: The first carbon is bonded to {C, H, H}.\n    3.  Comparing the lists {O, C, H}, {C, C, H}, and {C, H, H}.\n        - The O in the first list gives it the highest priority. So **Priority 1: -C2(...)**.\n        - Comparing {C, C, H} and {C, H, H}: The second atom in the first list is C, while it's H in the second. C > H. So **Priority 2: -C4(...)** and **Priority 3: -CH2CH3**.\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    - The ethyl group (-CH2CH3, priority 3) is on a wedge.\n    - The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. This implies the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) must be on a dash.\n    - Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration from the remaining groups.\n    - The sequence from priority 1 → 2 → 3 is: -C2 (plane, up-left) → -C4 (plane, down-right) → -CH2CH3 (wedge, up-right).\n    - This traces a clockwise path.\n*   **Conclusion for C3**: The absolute configuration is **(R)**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of C2 (leftmost chiral center)**\n\n*   **Groups attached**: -OH, -CH3 (from the leftmost terminal line), -C3(...), and -H.\n*   **Assigning priorities**:\n    1.  The atoms directly bonded to C2 are O, C(CH3), C(C3), H.\n    2.  Based on atomic number: **Priority 1: -OH**, **Priority 4: -H**.\n    3.  To distinguish between -C3(...) and -CH3, we look at what they are bonded to. C3 is bonded to {C, C, H}, while the methyl C is bonded to {H, H, H}. C > H, so **Priority 2: -C3(...)** and **Priority 3: -CH3**.\n*   **Determining Configuration**:\n    - The bonds to the terminal -CH3 and to C3 are drawn as being in the plane of the page (standard zigzag representation).\n    - The -OH group is shown on a dash.\n    - To maintain tetrahedral geometry, the implied -H atom must be on a wedge.\n    - The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). Therefore, we determine the direction of 1 → 2 → 3 and then reverse the result.\n    - The sequence from priority 1 → 2 → 3 is: -OH (dash) → -C3 (plane, down-right) → -CH3 (plane, up-left).\n    - This path from back (1) to down-right (2) to up-left (3) is clockwise.\n    - Since the lowest priority group is on a wedge, we reverse the result. R becomes S.\n*   **Conclusion for C2**: The absolute configuration is **(S)**.\n\n---\n**Final Result**\nBased on the analysis of the three chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\nThe question asks for the absolute configuration of the molecule. This is given by listing the configuration of each chiral center.\n\nFinal Configuration: **(2S, 3R, 4R)**. The question might expect a single letter if it were a multiple choice question about one specific center, but asks for the configuration of \"the molecule\". So providing the configuration for all centers is the most complete answer. Since the format asks for a single answer, this is likely looking for the full designation.\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>>"
