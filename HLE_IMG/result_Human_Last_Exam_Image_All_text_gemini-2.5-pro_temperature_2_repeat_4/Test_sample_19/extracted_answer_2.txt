1. The music modulates to the key of **F# minor**.
2. The connection is that **F# minor is the subdominant (iv)** of the original key, C# minor. Modulation to the subdominant is a common and closely-related key change in music theory.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is **III 6/4**. This represents the mediant (relative major) chord in the home key of C# minor, in second inversion.
