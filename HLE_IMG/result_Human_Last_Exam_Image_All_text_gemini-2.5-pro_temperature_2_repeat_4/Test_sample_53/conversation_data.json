    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image displays a scene painted on an ancient Greek vase in the red-figure style. We see a two-wheeled chariot pulled by a horse (the rear half is visible). Inside the chariot are two figures. One figure on the left is actively driving, holding reins and a goad, and wears a distinctive patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap. The second figure, on the right, is heavily draped and appears to be turning away or stepping out of the chariot. On the ground, in front of the chariot wheel, lies the body of a young, nude male. Above the scene, a large wing is visible, belonging to another figure. The style of painting, the clothing, and the dramatic content suggest a specific mythological scene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological narrative.**\n    The combination of a female figure in exotic (Eastern) dress (the Phrygian cap and patterned garment), a chariot, and dead children on the ground is a classic representation of a specific Greek myth: the escape of Medea from Corinth. According to the tragedy *Medea* by Euripides, after being betrayed by her husband Jason, the sorceress Medea takes revenge by murdering Jason's new wife and then her own two sons. She then escapes from Corinth in a magical chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the individual figures within the narrative.**\n    *   **The Charioteer:** The figure driving the chariot, with the Phrygian cap and patterned sleeve indicating her foreign (Colchian) origin, is Medea herself. She is the central protagonist of the story, actively engineering her escape.\n    *   **The Figure on the Ground:** The dead youth is one of the two sons she has just murdered. Often, both sons are depicted.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** This could be a representation of the magical nature of the chariot (which was sometimes pulled by dragons) or, as some scholars suggest for this particular vase, a Fury (Erinys) pursuing Medea for the crime of filicide.\n    *   **The Second Figure in the Chariot:** The draped figure next to Medea is generally interpreted as a nurse or an attendant, sharing in the horror and the escape.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the specific question: \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\"**\n    The question can be interpreted literally or thematically.\n    *   **Thematic Interpretation:** The entire scene is about Medea *leaving* Corinth after her horrific acts. In this sense, Medea, as the driver and the main character, is \"the figure leaving.\" Her action of driving the chariot away constitutes the act of leaving.\n    *   **Literal Visual Interpretation:** The draped figure on the right is physically positioned as if in motion out of the chariot, with their body turned away. However, in the context of the myth, it is nonsensical for an attendant to be dismounting from a magical flying chariot mid-escape. This pose is more likely a conventional artistic gesture expressing grief, horror, and a desire to turn away from the terrible deeds, while still being part of the departure.\n\n    Given that Medea is the principal agent of the action and the subject of this famous \"leaving,\" she is the most accurate and meaningful answer to the question. The vase depicts *her* escape.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
