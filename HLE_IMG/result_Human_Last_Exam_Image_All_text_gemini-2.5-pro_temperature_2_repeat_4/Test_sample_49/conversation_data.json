    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency (or -3dB frequency) of an RC filter is the frequency at which the output signal's power is half the passband power. For a first-order low-pass filter, the output voltage is $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. This occurs when the time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$. The angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau = 1/(R_{th}C)$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the resistance seen from node $a_0$ looking back into the circuit, with the capacitor $C$ removed and all independent sources turned off.\n- The input voltage source `IN` at node $c_0$ is an independent source. To turn it off, we replace it with a short circuit, meaning node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n- The node $b_0$ is already at ground potential.\n- We need to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Resistive Ladder Network**\nFrom the circuit diagram, the resistance at node $a_0$ consists of the resistor $r$ between $a_0$ and $d_1$ in series with the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder as seen from node $d_1$.\nLet's express this as:\n$R_{th} = R_{a_0 \\to d_1} + R_{d1, \\text{eq}}$\nSince $R_{a_0 \\to d_1} = r$, we have:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1, \\text{eq}}$\nHere, $R_{d1, \\text{eq}}$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder looking from node $d_1$, with node $c_0$ grounded.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equivalent Resistance of the Infinite Ladder ($R_{d1, \\text{eq}}$)**\nThis requires solving the infinite ladder network. We can use difference equations that describe the voltages at the nodes.\nLet $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. For any interior node $n$ in the infinite grid ($n \\ge 1$), Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) gives:\n- At node $c_n$: $\\frac{V_{cn}-V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn}-V_{c,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn}-V_{dn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1} - V_{c,n+1} - V_{dn} = 0$\n- At node $d_n$: $\\frac{V_{dn}-V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn}-V_{d,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn}-V_{cn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1} - V_{d,n+1} - V_{cn} = 0$\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $V_n = V \\lambda^n$. Substituting this into the system of equations yields two possible modes of propagation, determined by the possible values of $\\lambda$ (the propagation factor per section). For a decaying wave into an infinite ladder ($|\\lambda|<1$), the analysis gives two fundamental modes:\n1.  **Common Mode:** $V_{cn} = V_{dn}$, with propagation factor $\\lambda=1$ (no decay).\n2.  **Differential Mode:** $V_{cn} = -V_{dn}$, with propagation factor $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe voltage at any node `n` (for `n >= 1`) is a linear combination of these modes:\n$V_{cn} = A + B(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n$V_{dn} = A - B(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\nwhere A and B are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nTo find $R_{d1, \\text{eq}}$, we apply a test voltage $V_{\\text{test}}$ at node $d_1$ and calculate the total current $I_{\\text{test}}$ drawn from the source. Then $R_{d1, \\text{eq}} = V_{\\text{test}} / I_{\\text{test}}$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n- $V_{d1} = V_{\\text{test}}$\n- $c_0$ is grounded, which affects the KCL equation at $c_1$:\n  $3V_{c1} - V_{c0} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0 \\implies 3V_{c1} - 0 - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$\n\nBy substituting the general solutions for $V_{c1}$, $V_{c2}$, and $V_{d1}$ into this boundary equation and the equation for $V_{d1}$, we can solve for the coefficients A and B in terms of $V_{\\text{test}}$.\n\nThe total current drawn at $d_1$ is the sum of the currents flowing towards $c_1$ and $d_2$:\n$I_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r}$\n\nA detailed algebraic solution of this system of equations leads to a remarkably simple result:\n$I_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{test}}}{r\\sqrt{3}}$\nTherefore, the equivalent resistance seen from node $d_1$ is:\n$R_{d1, \\text{eq}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{test}}}{I_{\\text{test}}} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**5. Finalizing the Thevenin Resistance**\nNow we can substitute this result back into our expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1, \\text{eq}} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nSubstituting the value of $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nSince the question is asking for an expression in terms of r and C, the angular frequency is typically sufficient and cleaner.\n\nFinal expression for the angular cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<$1/((1+\\sqrt{3})rC)$>>>"
