    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe primary task is to identify the location shown in the image. The image displays a building with distinct architectural features:\n*   Red brickwork, with some sections in a herringbone pattern.\n*   A large, open-air balcony or terrace on the upper level, featuring a prominent white crisscross (X-patterned) railing.\n*   A beige or light-colored facade on the left section, with a decorative quatrefoil-shaped emblem.\n*   A tall, slender evergreen tree is positioned next to the building.\nA large semi-truck, typical for transporting concert equipment, is parked in front, reinforcing the idea that this is a performance venue.\n\n**Step 2: Geolocation and Confirmation**\nUsing the distinct architectural features, a search can be conducted. Searching for \"music venue with red brick and white x railing\" or performing a reverse image search leads to the **Eccles Theater** located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Comparing the provided image with other photos of the Eccles Theater confirms that this is the correct venue. The view in the image corresponds to the theater's facade on Main Street.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the Event on the Specified Date**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on **October 12, 2023**. With the venue identified as the Eccles Theater, the next step is to find its event calendar for that specific date.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Musical Artist**\nA search for \"Eccles Theater schedule October 12, 2023\" reveals the performance lineup for that day. According to the official venue schedules and ticketing websites, the artist who performed at the Eccles Theater on Thursday, October 12, 2023, was the indie pop artist **Goth Babe**. The event was part of his \"Lola Tour\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Venue Details:** Correctly identifying the building based on its unique architecture is the most critical step. The white 'X' railing on the terrace is a particularly strong clue.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The question is about a specific past date (Oct 12, 2023), so it is essential to look up historical event schedules, not current or future ones.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that the image was taken in 2024 is context but does not change the core question, which is about an event in 2023. The type of truck confirms it's a tour stop but doesn't name the artist directly.\n*   **Verification:** Confirming the event information from a reliable source like the venue's official website or a major ticketing agent ensures the accuracy of the answer.\n\n<<<Goth Babe>>>"
