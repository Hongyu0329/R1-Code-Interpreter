    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key is either F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   **First Chord:** The first chord is F- (F minor). This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written with numbers, the beaming of the notes (groups of four eighth notes, quarter notes, half notes) implies a 4/4 time signature, which is standard for most jazz tunes.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic Analysis**\n*   The melody begins on the note C, which is the 5th of the F minor tonic chord.\n*   **Bar 1:** The melody starts with two repeated C quarter notes.\n*   **Bar 2:** The melody moves down to a B♭ half note.\n*   **Bar 3:** The melody moves down to a G half note.\n*   **Bar 4:** The melody continues to descend to F and then E natural.\n*   This melodic shape—starting on the 5th, repeating it, and then descending—is a memorable and distinct opening phrase.\n\n**Step 3: Harmonic (Chord Progression) Analysis**\n*   **A Section (Bars 1-8):**\n    *   `F-` | `E-7♭5` | `E♭-6` | `D♭maj7 G7` | `C7` | `F-` | `C7` | ...\n    *   The most significant feature here is the chromatic descending bass line in the first three bars: F → E → E♭. This is a very recognizable harmonic movement in the jazz repertoire.\n*   **B Section (Bridge - Bars 9-16):**\n    *   `D-7♭5` | `G7` | `C7` | `F7` | `B♭-7` | `E♭7` | `A♭` | `G C7` |\n    *   This section features a series of ii-V progressions that modulate through different keys.\n        *   `D-7♭5 - G7` is a ii-V leading to C minor.\n        *   `C7 - F7` is a V-I motion that pivots, with the `F7` becoming the V of B♭.\n        *   `B♭-7 - E♭7` is a ii-V leading to A♭ major.\n    *   This pattern of modulating ii-V's is characteristic of many standards from the Great American Songbook era.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis and Identification**\n*   Combining the melodic and harmonic information, we can search for a jazz standard that matches these features.\n*   The chromatic descending progression (`F-`, `Eø7`, `E♭...`) in F minor is the defining characteristic of the standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n*   The melodic contour (C, C, B♭, G...) also matches the melody of \"Yesterdays\" when played in F minor.\n*   The chord changes for the bridge (`Dø7-G7` | `C7-F7` | `B♭-7-E♭7` | `A♭`) are a classic reharmonization of the \"Yesterdays\" bridge.\n*   Therefore, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n\n**Step 5: Composer Identification**\n*   \"Yesterdays\" was composed for the 1933 Broadway musical \"Roberta\". The music was written by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach. In the context of identifying a jazz standard, Jerome Kern is credited as the composer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the melody and the highly characteristic chord progression in both the A and B sections, the jazz standard is \"Yesterdays\" composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
