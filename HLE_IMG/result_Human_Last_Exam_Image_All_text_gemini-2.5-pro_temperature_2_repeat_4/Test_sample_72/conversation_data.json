    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) and cyclobutene (C4H4). The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv`. The product is a complex tricyclic molecule, specifically 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluoro-7,8-dihydrotricyclo[4.2.0.0^(2,5)]oct-3-ene (a common name, not IUPAC, but descriptive of its connectivity and substitution). The question explicitly states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize the First Pericyclic Reaction:** The reaction involves the combination of two molecules. A common photochemical reaction between two molecules containing pi systems is a cycloaddition. Given that we have two reactants, each with a double bond, a [2+2] cycloaddition is a very likely first step.\n    *   One of the C=C double bonds of hexafluorobenzene reacts with the C=C double bond of cyclobutene.\n    *   This is a [π2 + π2] cycloaddition. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a concerted [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    *   This first step would form a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-diene intermediate. The addition breaks one C=C in benzene and the C=C in cyclobutene, forming a new cyclobutane ring fused to a cyclohexadiene ring. The resulting cyclohexadiene ring would have its double bonds in conjugation (a 1,3-diene system). The six fluorine atoms remain on the carbons of the original benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Visualize the Intermediate:**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene (imagine one Kekulé structure with C=C at 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) reacts with cyclobutene at the C1=C2 bond.\n    *   The product of this first step is a hexafluoro-substituted bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-3,5-diene. This molecule contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety fused to a cyclobutane ring.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Second Pericyclic Reaction:** The intermediate formed in Step 2 is a conjugated diene, a 4π-electron system. Conjugated dienes are known to undergo electrocyclic reactions.\n    *   An electrocyclic reaction is an intramolecular pericyclic reaction where a conjugated pi-system forms a cyclic molecule by creating a new sigma bond between its termini.\n    *   For a 4π-electron system, the reaction is photochemically allowed via a disrotatory ring closure.\n    *   The 1,3-diene system of the intermediate undergoes ring closure to form a new bond, converting the six-membered ring into two fused four-membered rings.\n    *   This transforms the bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-diene skeleton into a tricyclo[4.2.0.0^(2,5)]octene skeleton.\n\n5.  **Verify the Final Product:** The product resulting from the proposed 4π electrocyclization perfectly matches the structure of the final product given in the reaction scheme, including the position of the remaining double bond and the relative stereochemistry of the substituents.\n\n6.  **Summarize the Reaction Types:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** The intermolecular addition of cyclobutene to hexafluorobenzene is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** The intramolecular rearrangement of the resulting diene intermediate is a **4π electrocyclic reaction** (or electrocyclization).\n\n7.  **Consider and Rule Out Alternatives:** One might consider an alternative pathway where hexafluorobenzene first isomerizes to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (an electrocyclic reaction), which then undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with cyclobutene. However, this sequence leads to a different constitutional isomer (tricyclo[4.2.0.0^(2,5)]oct-7-ene) than the one shown, so this pathway can be ruled out.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The transformation occurs in two steps:\n    1.  Intermolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n    2.  Intramolecular photochemical 4π electrocyclization of the resulting intermediate.\n    Therefore, the two pericyclic reactions are [2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclization.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclization>>>"
