    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided information**\nThe question asks to identify the type of isomers for \"the molecules mentioned above\". However, looking at the image provided (\"above\"), it is a solid black, completely blank image. There are no molecules depicted or mentioned.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definitions of the given options**\n*   **(a) Conformers (or conformational isomers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. To identify them, you need to see if one structure can be turned into the other just by rotating bonds.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers (or structural isomers):** These molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded together in a different order). To identify them, you need to determine the molecular formula and the bonding pattern for each molecule.\n*   **(c) Identical:** This means the molecules are the same compound. They might be drawn from different perspectives, but they are superimposable.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but a different three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in space. They are not superimposable and are not conformers. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **(e) None of these:** This option would be correct if the relationship is something else, or if the question cannot be answered from the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the definitions to the problem**\nTo determine the relationship between any set of molecules, we must first have the structures of those molecules. We need to be able to see their atoms, bonds, and spatial arrangement.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the missing information**\nSince the image is blank and provides no molecules for analysis, it is impossible to perform any comparison. We cannot determine their molecular formulas, their connectivity, or their spatial arrangements. Therefore, we cannot determine if they are conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 5: Select the most appropriate answer**\nBecause it is impossible to choose any of the specific relationships described in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) due to the lack of information, the only logically sound answer is (e). The premise of the question (that there are molecules to compare) is not met.\n\n<<<E>>>"
