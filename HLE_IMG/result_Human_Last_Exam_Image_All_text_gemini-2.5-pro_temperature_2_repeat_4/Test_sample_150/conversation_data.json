    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, which facilitates the generation of an electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone. The structure is a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The substituent on the benzene ring is the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). This is an acyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing and deactivating group. It directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta-position (position 3) of the phenyl ring relative to the acyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: m-Br-C₆H₄-CO-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful reduction method.\n    1.  **Reduction of the ketone:** A benzylic ketone (a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring) is reduced completely to a methylene (-CH₂-) group under these conditions (Ar-CO-R → Ar-CH₂-R).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the aryl halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond (Ar-Br → Ar-H).\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** Both the carbonyl group and the bromo group are reduced/removed, resulting in propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH₂CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (Propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (a nonpolar solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is specifically used for bromination at the allylic or benzylic position. In propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the carbon atom of the propyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This C-H bond is the weakest because its cleavage leads to a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n*   The parent alkane chain is propane.\n*   Numbering the chain from the end closer to the substituents gives the bromine atom and the phenyl group at position 1.\n*   The IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
