    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe organism shown in the image is a type of lichen. Key features are:\n*   **Color:** Bright yellow-orange.\n*   **Growth Form (Thallus):** It is foliose, meaning it has a leaf-like, lobed structure.\n*   **Structures:** Small, cup-shaped structures called apothecia (the fruiting bodies of the fungal partner) are visible, particularly in the center-left.\n*   **Habitat:** It is growing on rock (saxicolous).\n*   **Location:** Acadia National Park, where this type of lichen is common.\n\nBased on these characteristics, the lichen can be identified as a member of the genus *Xanthoria*. A very common and widespread species that fits this description is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Protein**\nThe question asks about the protein named \"XPH1\" from this organism. This is a specific scientific designation.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Protein Information in Scientific Databases**\nTo find the specifics of the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina*, we must consult biological databases like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n*   A search for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" reveals that XPH1 is the scientific name for **Phototropin-1**. Phototropins are blue-light photoreceptor proteins involved in light-sensing and responses like phototropism.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Amino Acids**\nWe can now look up the specific protein sequence for *Xanthoria parietina* Phototropin-1 (XPH1) in a protein database.\n*   In the UniProt database, the entry for this protein is under the accession number **C5L1D0**. The database entry explicitly states that the protein from *Xanthoria parietina* has a length of **916 amino acids**.\n*   This can be cross-verified with the NCBI database. The protein sequence, under accession number **CAQ16708.1**, also shows a length of 916 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correct Organism Identification:** Accurately identifying the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is crucial. The combination of color, morphology, habitat, and the specific protein name (XPH1 has been studied in this species) confirms the identification.\n2.  **Using Reliable Sources:** For specific molecular data like protein length, it is essential to rely on primary scientific databases (UniProt, NCBI) rather than general web search results.\n3.  **Specificity of the Protein Name:** The name \"XPH1\" is a specific identifier, which helps to avoid ambiguity and directly locate the correct protein information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and searching for its XPH1 protein (Phototropin-1) in standard biological databases, we can determine its precise length. The confirmed length from multiple reliable sources is 916 amino acids.\n\n<<<916>>>"
