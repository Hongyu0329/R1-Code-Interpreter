    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image displays an insect perched on a bright yellow flower. The insect is the central focus. I will carefully examine its physical characteristics and its environment.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Features**\n*   **Type of Animal:** The creature is an insect, as evidenced by its six legs, segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and a pair of antennae.\n*   **Order:** Its body shape, particularly the presence of hardened forewings (hemelytra) that cover membranous hind wings, and long antennae suggest it belongs to the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is predominantly black and a vibrant orange-red. This type of coloration is often aposematic, warning predators that the insect is unpalatable.\n*   **Head:** The head is black with some small orange markings near the large, dark compound eyes.\n*   **Thorax:** The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment, right behind the head) is primarily orange-red, with a black band or area at the front margin.\n*   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and antennae are long, slender, and black.\n*   **Size:** Without a scale, it is difficult to determine the exact size, but its proportion relative to the small individual flowers of the plant suggests it is a relatively small bug.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Environment**\n*   **Plant:** The insect is on a plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers arranged on a stalk. This plant morphology is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and fall-blooming wildflower. Many insects are attracted to goldenrod for nectar and pollen.\n\n**Step 4: Identification and Species Comparison**\nBased on the characteristics (black and orange true bug on goldenrod), I can narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** While similar in color, the pattern is different. Boxelder bugs typically have orange-red lines outlining their thorax and wings, which is not the pattern seen here.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug has a prominent black band across its orange-red back. The bug in the photo, seen from the side, doesn't perfectly show its back pattern, but the markings on the pronotum (the area behind the head) do not perfectly align with the typical all-orange pronotum of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug is a very strong candidate. It shares the black and orange-red coloration. Crucially, its pronotum is red with a black band along the anterior margin, matching the insect in the photograph. It also has a distinctive red \"X\" pattern on its back, though this is not visible from the side angle in the image. Although called a \"milkweed bug,\" *Lygaeus kalmii* is known to be a generalist feeder that often visits other plants, like goldenrod, for nectar.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe combination of the specific color pattern on the head and pronotum (black head, orange-red pronotum with a black anterior band) and its presence on goldenrod strongly points to the insect being the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\nThe scientific name for the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
