    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n1.  **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown in color. Its most notable feature is its texture, which is highly porous with many visible holes or cavities. This texture is known as vesicular. The rock appears to be fine-grained otherwise (aphanitic groundmass).\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a strong indicator that the rock is an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. These holes (vesicles) are formed by gas bubbles that were trapped in the lava as it cooled rapidly upon eruption.\n3.  **Identification:** Based on the reddish color (indicating iron oxidation) and the highly vesicular texture, this specimen is **Scoria**. Scoria is formed from less viscous, often basaltic or andesitic, lava.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is composed of numerous individual rock fragments (clasts) that have been cemented together. The clasts are of different sizes, shapes, and compositions (some are light, some are dark, one is reddish). Critically, the clasts have sharp, angular edges rather than rounded ones.\n2.  **Interpretation:** A rock made of cemented-together fragments is a clastic rock. The angularity of the clasts is the key diagnostic feature.\n3.  **Identification:** A clastic rock composed of large, angular fragments is called **Breccia**. This could be a sedimentary breccia (formed by landslides or faulting) or a volcanic breccia (formed from an explosive eruption). Without more context, \"breccia\" is the most accurate identification.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is very light in color, appearing white to light gray. Like specimen H, it is also highly vesicular, full of small holes, giving it a frothy appearance. It appears to be very lightweight. The underlying rock material is fine-grained.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The combination of light color and a highly vesicular, low-density structure points to a specific type of extrusive igneous rock.\n3.  **Identification:** This specimen is **Pumice**. Pumice forms from gas-rich, felsic (silica-rich) lava, like rhyolitic lava. Its extreme porosity makes it so low-density that it can often float on water.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of interlocking crystals that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic. The overall color is light, dominated by white, cream, and translucent gray minerals, with a smaller amount of dark, flaky or blocky minerals.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The phaneritic texture indicates the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The predominance of light-colored minerals (likely quartz and feldspar) suggests it is a felsic rock.\n3.  **Identification:** A coarse-grained, felsic, intrusive igneous rock is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
