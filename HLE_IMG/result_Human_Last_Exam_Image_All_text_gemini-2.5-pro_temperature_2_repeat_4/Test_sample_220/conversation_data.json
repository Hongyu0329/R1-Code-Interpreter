    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure:**\n    *   The FCC lattice is a cubic structure with atoms at each corner of the cube and at the center of each face.\n    *   If we define a conventional cubic unit cell with lattice constant 'a', the atom positions (in fractional coordinates) are given by the set:\n        *   (0, 0, 0) - This represents all 8 corner atoms through lattice translations like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc.\n        *   (1/2, 1/2, 0) - This represents face centers on the xy, xz, and yz planes, through permutations like (1/2, 0, 1/2) and (0, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    *   The direction [110] corresponds to a vector along the diagonal of a face of the cubic unit cell.\n    *   Viewing along this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n3.  **Determine the Projected 2D Pattern for FCC along [110]:**\n    *   Let's establish a 2D coordinate system for the projection plane. The plane is normal to [110]. We can choose two perpendicular vectors within this plane as our new axes. Convenient choices are the [1-10] direction and the [001] direction.\n    *   The projected unit cell in this view will be a rectangle. The side lengths of this rectangle are related to the lattice constant 'a'. The side along the [001] direction has length 'a', and the side along the [1-10] direction has length 'aâˆš2'.\n    *   Now, we need to project all the atoms of the FCC structure onto this rectangular cell.\n        *   The atoms at the corners of the cubic cell (like (0,0,0) and (1,1,0)) will project onto the corners of the 2D rectangular cell. Specifically, the atoms in the planes z=0 and z=1 define the vertices of the projected rectangle. For example, the projections of atoms at (0,0,0), (1,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (1,-1,1) form a rectangle in the projection plane.\n        *   The face-centered atom at (1/2, 1/2, 0) lies directly behind the corner atom at (0,0,0) along the [110] viewing direction, so its projection coincides with the corner.\n        *   The face-centered atoms at (1/2, 0, 1/2) and (0, 1/2, 1/2) are crucial. Their projection falls exactly in the center of the 2D rectangular unit cell described above.\n    *   Therefore, the resulting 2D pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction is a **centered rectangular lattice**. The pattern consists of atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the center of the rectangle.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Images:**\n    *   We need to identify which of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) corresponds to a centered rectangular lattice. The images show a cluster of atoms within a perspective box. We should focus on the repeating pattern of the atoms themselves.\n    *   **Image A:** The atoms are arranged in a clear rectangular grid. We can outline a rectangular unit cell using four neighboring atoms as corners. There is no atom in the center of this rectangle. This is a primitive rectangular lattice. This does not match our expected pattern.\n    *   **Image B:** The arrangement of atoms is more complex due to the perspective. However, we can identify a unit cell. If we pick four atoms that form a parallelogram (a rectangle in 2D projection), such as the four outer atoms in the lower and upper groups, we can see another atom located in the center of this parallelogram. This pattern is consistent with a centered rectangular lattice.\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms are not in a rectangular arrangement. The pattern appears staggered, closer to a hexagonal or distorted hexagonal lattice. This is typical of a [111] projection, not [110].\n    *   **Image D:** Similar to image A, the atoms form a primitive rectangular lattice. There are atoms at the corners of rectangular cells, but not in the centers.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction results in a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   Among the given options, only Image B displays a centered rectangular (or parallelogram in perspective) lattice pattern.\n\nTherefore, Image B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
