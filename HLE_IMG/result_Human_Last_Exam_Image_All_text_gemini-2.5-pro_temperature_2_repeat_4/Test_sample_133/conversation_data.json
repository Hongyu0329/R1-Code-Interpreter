    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak and Determine Molecular Weight:**\n    The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) from 258 to 266. This pattern is characteristic of the molecular ion (M⁺) for a compound containing multiple atoms with common isotopes, such as chlorine or bromine. The peak with the highest m/z in this cluster that belongs to the parent ion corresponds to the molecule with the heaviest isotopes. The peak at the lowest m/z of the cluster (m/z=258) represents the molecule composed of the lightest isotopes (e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl). This is often denoted as M_iso. The nominal molecular weight is 258.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern to Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms:**\n    *   The peaks in the molecular ion cluster are spaced by 2 mass units (258, 260, 262, 264, 266), which is characteristic of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes) or bromine (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br isotopes). The ~1:1 intensity ratio for bromine is not observed.\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak in the spectrum, I=100%) is at m/z = 225. Let's analyze its isotope cluster: m/z 223 (I=60.1%), 225 (I=100%), 227 (I=66.7%), 229 (I=22.2%), 231 (I=3.7%).\n    *   The difference between the parent ion M_iso (258) and the M_iso of the base peak cluster (223) is 258 - 223 = 35. This corresponds exactly to the loss of one ³⁵Cl atom. This is a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds. Therefore, the base peak at m/z=225 represents the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   Since the fragment [M-Cl]⁺ results from the loss of one chlorine atom, it must contain one less chlorine atom than the parent molecule.\n    *   Let's determine the number of chlorine atoms in the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment by analyzing its isotope pattern (cluster at m/z 223, 225, 227, 229, 231). For 'n' chlorine atoms, the expected relative intensities of the isotope peaks M, M+2, M+4, ... follow the binomial expansion of (a+b)ⁿ where a:b is the isotope abundance ratio (~3:1 for ³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl).\n        *   For 4 chlorine atoms (Cl₄), the expected peak intensity ratio (M_iso:M_iso+2:M_iso+4:M_iso+6:M_iso+8) is approximately 81:108:54:12:1. Normalized to the most intense peak (M_iso+2), the ratio is roughly 75%:100%:50%:11%:1%.\n        *   The experimental intensities for the base peak cluster (m/z 223, 225, 227, 229, 231) are relative to m/z 225 (100%): 60.1% : 100% : 66.7% : 22.2% : 3.7%.\n        *   Comparing the experimental pattern with the theoretical Cl₄ pattern shows a reasonable match. This strongly suggests the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment contains **4 chlorine atoms**.\n    *   Therefore, the original molecule must contain **5 chlorine atoms**. This is consistent with the molecular ion cluster which has the appropriate number of peaks for a Cl₅ species.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecule contains 5 chlorine atoms. The molecular weight of the molecule with the lightest isotopes (M_iso) is 258 amu.\n    *   The mass of the 5 chlorine atoms (5 x ³⁵Cl) is 5 * 35 = 175 amu.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the non-chlorine part, let's call it 'R') is M_iso - 175 = 258 - 175 = 83 amu.\n    *   Now we need to find the chemical composition of the residue 'R' with a mass of 83. We can test combinations of C, H, O, N.\n        *   If R is only carbon and hydrogen (CₓHᵧ), C₆H₁₁ has a mass of 6*12 + 11*1 = 83. The molecular formula would be C₆H₁₁Cl₅. However, for a stable neutral molecule, the degree of unsaturation (DBE = (2C+2-H-X)/2) would be (12+2-11-5)/2 = -1, which is impossible.\n        *   If R contains oxygen (CₓHᵧO₂), the combination C₄H₃O₂ has a mass of 4*12 + 3*1 + 2*16 = 48 + 3 + 32 = 83. The molecular formula would be C₄H₃O₂Cl₅. Let's check its DBE: (2*4+2-3-5)/2 = (10-8)/2 = 1. A DBE of 1 is perfectly valid (e.g., a double bond or a ring). This is a plausible molecular formula. The presence of two oxygen atoms suggests a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   The presence of a peak at m/z=96, corresponding to a fragment with one Cl atom (from the m/z 98 isotope peak), also supports the C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ formula, as the non-chlorine part of this fragment would have mass 96-35=61 (C₂H₅O₂), which is plausible to form from a parent with two oxygens.\n\n4.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ with a DBE of 1. A likely structure is a butanoic acid with 5 chlorine atoms and 3 hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain.\n    *   Let's construct a plausible structure. Butanoic acid has a 4-carbon chain including the carboxyl carbon. We need to place 5 Cl and 3 H on the remaining 3 carbons and potentially the alpha-carbon.\n    *   A possible isomer is: `Cl₃C-CH(Cl)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's count the atoms: C=4, H=1+2=3, Cl=3+1=4. This is C₄H₃O₂Cl₄, not C₄H₃O₂Cl₅.\n    *   Another possibility: `Cl₃C-CCl(Cl)-CH₂-COOH`. C=4, H=2. Not H=3.\n    *   Let's try: `Cl₃C-CH(Cl)-CHCl-COOH`. C=4, H=1+1=2. Not H=3.\n    *   A structure that fits C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ is **2,3,4,4,4-Pentachlorobutanoic acid**:\n        *   The structure is `Cl₃C-CCl(H)-CH₂-COOH`. Wait, let me name it correctly from the structure. IUPAC naming starts from the carboxyl carbon as C1. So `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Cl)(3)-CCl₃(4)`. This is **3,4,4,4-Tetrachlorobutanoic acid**. Incorrect chlorine count.\n    *   Let's try to build the molecule from the name **2,3,4,4,4-Pentachlorobutanoic acid**. The skeleton is `C-C-C-COOH`. Substituents are Cl at C2, C3, C4, C4, C4. The structure is `Cl₃C-C(Cl)(H)-CH(Cl)-COOH`. Let's check atoms: C₄. H=1+1=2. Cl=5. O₂. Formula is C₄H₂O₂Cl₅. This does not match C₄H₃O₂Cl₅.\n\n    *   There must be an error in isomer construction. Let's rebuild the C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ structure.\n    *   Skeleton: C₁-C₂-C₃-C₄-OOH. 4 Carbons, 2 Oxygens. 3 Hydrogens and 5 Chlorines must be placed on C2, C3, and C4. Total positions = 3*2+1 = 7. H+Cl = 3+5=8. This is not possible for an acyclic saturated chain. Wait, the chain is not saturated due to DBE=1 (C=O bond).\n    *   Total valencies to fill on C2, C3, C4 are 2+2+3=7. We have 3H and 5Cl to place. 3+5=8. One too many. Let's recheck everything.\n    *   R = 83. Let's re-verify mass of C₄H₃O₂. 4*12+3+32=48+35=83. OK.\n    *   Formula C₄H₃O₂Cl₅. DBE= (2*4+2-3-5)/2 = 1. OK.\n    *   Maybe the problem lies in the structure itself being unusual. However, based on the deduction, the molecular formula is almost certainly C₄H₃O₂Cl₅. Naming a specific valid isomer is the final step. Let's choose a name that corresponds to a valid structure.\n    *   For example, **2,2,3,4,4-Pentachlorobutanoic acid**: `Cl₂CH-CCl(H)-CCl₂-COOH`. C₄, H=1+1=2. Doesn't fit.\n\n    Let's return to the C₅H₇OCl₅ hypothesis, as it might be simpler to form a valid structure, even if fragments are less consistent.\n    *   Formula: C₅H₇OCl₅. DBE=0. Saturated acyclic. Can be a pentachloropentanol isomer.\n    *   Structure **2,3,4,5,5-Pentachloropentan-1-ol**: `CH₂(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH(Cl)-CH(Cl)-CCl₂H`.\n    *   Let's count atoms: C=5. H=2(OH)+1+1+1+1 = 7 (H on C's) + 1 (H on O) = Total 7 H's, fine. O=1. Cl=1+1+1+2=5. Formula `C₅H₇OCl₅`. This is a valid structure and name.\n\nConsidering the ambiguity, there may not be one single correct answer without more information. However, a logical path has been followed. Given the difficulty in finding a perfectly matching common compound and the inconsistencies in advanced fragmentation analysis, sticking to the most robust initial deductions (M⁺, number of Cl, possible empirical formulas) is the safest approach. The C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ formula seems more strongly supported by a wider range of fragments. Let's go with that.\nLet's name a simple isomer: **3,4,4-trichloro-2-(dichloromethyl)butanoic acid**. This structure is `(Cl₃C-CHCl)-CH(COOH)-CH₃`, let's check it. C=5, no.\n\nFinal conclusion remains difficult. Let's stick with the most plausible chemical formula from mass analysis. The IUPAC name `2,3,4,4,4-Pentachlorobutanoic acid` refers to C₄H₂Cl₅O₂, not the derived C₄H₃Cl₅O₂. The error may lie in the interpretation, but providing a plausible IUPAC name is requested. Given the analysis, C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ seems most likely. A valid, if complex, structure would be something like 3-chloro-2-(trichloromethyl)propanoic acid `Cl₃C-CH(COOH)-CH₂Cl`. Let's check this: C=4, H=1+2=3, Cl=4. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my very first step, the MW. Let's check known compounds whose spectrum looks like this.\nThis spectrum is a textbook example of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)**, a common herbicide. Let's check this hypothesis.\n*   Formula: C₈H₆Cl₂O₃\n*   Molecular Weight (using average masses): ~221.0\n*   M_iso = 8*12 + 6*1 + 2*35 + 3*16 = 96+6+70+48 = 220.\n*   M⁺ cluster starts at 220. Peaks at 220, 222, 224. This **does not match** the spectrum shown at all (M⁺~262, base peak 225).\n\nLet's try another one. **Pentachlorophenol (PCP)**.\n*   Formula: C₆Cl₅OH\n*   M_iso = 6*12+1*1+16+5*35 = 72+1+16+175 = 264.\n*   The M⁺ cluster starts at 264. Close, but our cluster starts at 258. The M⁺ of PCP is also the base peak. Our base peak is at 225. Not a match.\n\nThe deductions pointing to `C₄H₃O₂Cl₅` remain the most logical path despite the naming difficulty. Let's go with the name derived from that analysis, even if the structure proposed was slightly off on the atom count. The intended compound is likely an isomer of pentachlorobutanoic acid. Let's propose the name that fits the atom count.\n**Isomer for C₄H₃O₂Cl₅:** For instance, `CH₂Cl-CH(Cl)-CCl₂-COOH` -> `2,2,3,4-tetrachlorobutanoic acid` needs one more Cl. Let's put it on C3 -> `CH₂Cl-C(Cl)₂-CCl₂-COOH` has H=2. No. `CHCl₂-CH(Cl)-CCl₂-COOH`. H=2. No. It seems hard to build a structure for C₄H₃O₂Cl₅.\n\nLet's go back one last time to **C₅H₇OCl₅**. We found a valid structure: **2,3,4,5,5-Pentachloropentan-1-ol**. Let's assume this is the answer. It fits the MW, Cl count, and is a valid chemical. The fragmentation can be complex, so relying on the parent ion data is often the most reliable method.\n\nFinal decision based on most reliable evidence:\n1. Molecular ion cluster gives M_iso=258 and suggests 5 Cl atoms.\n2. These facts lead to possible formulas like C₅H₇OCl₅ (DBE=0) or C₄H₃O₂Cl₅ (DBE=1).\n3. We were able to construct a valid structure for an isomer of C₅H₇OCl₅: **2,3,4,5,5-Pentachloropentan-1-ol**.\n4. We had trouble constructing a simple, valid structure for C₄H₃O₂Cl₅.\n5. Therefore, despite some fragment inconsistencies, C₅H₇OCl₅ is the more tenable conclusion for which a systematic name can be confidently provided.\n\n<<<2,3,4,5,5-Pentachloropentan-1-ol>>>"
