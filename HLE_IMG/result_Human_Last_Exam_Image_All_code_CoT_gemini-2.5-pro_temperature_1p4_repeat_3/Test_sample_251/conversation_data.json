    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Grid:** The ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec. The grid is made of 1 mm small squares. Therefore, the time duration for one small square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we can identify the longest pause between two consecutive R-waves. This pause is most evident in the fourth strip down from the top.\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** We will count the number of small horizontal squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define this longest interval. Careful counting reveals the distance to be 40 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time:** We will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of each square to get the total time in seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the parameters from the ECG strip.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25  # The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\nsmall_square_mm = 1          # Each small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time duration of a single small square.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = small_square_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Step 3: Measure the longest R-R interval in terms of small squares.\n# By visual inspection of the fourth rhythm strip, the longest interval\n# between two consecutive R-waves spans 40 small squares.\nnum_small_squares_for_longest_rr = 40\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = num_small_squares_for_longest_rr * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Output the calculation and the result.\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is determined by counting the number of small squares and multiplying by the time per square.\")\nprint(f\"Number of small squares for the longest interval: {num_small_squares_for_longest_rr}\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square: {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {num_small_squares_for_longest_rr} squares * {time_per_small_square_sec} sec/square\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is: {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n<<<1.60>>>"
