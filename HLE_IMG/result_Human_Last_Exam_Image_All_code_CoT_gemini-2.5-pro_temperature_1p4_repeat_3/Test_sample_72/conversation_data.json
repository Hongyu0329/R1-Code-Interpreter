    "Of course, I can help you with this chemistry problem. Here is my analysis and the corresponding Python code to provide the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** The reaction shown is between hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆) under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`, light energy). The product is a single, complex tricyclic molecule. The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n2.  **Identify Potential Pericyclic Pathways:** Pericyclic reactions include cycloadditions, electrocyclizations, and sigmatropic rearrangements. We need to find a sequence of two such reactions that converts the reactants to the product.\n3.  **Evaluate Pathway 1 (Initial Electrocyclization):** One possibility is that cyclobutene first undergoes a photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening to form 1,3-butadiene. This reactive diene could then react with hexafluorobenzene in a second pericyclic step, likely a cycloaddition. However, this pathway leads to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene skeleton, which does not match the known product for this reaction.\n4.  **Evaluate Pathway 2 (Initial Cycloaddition):** Another possibility is an initial intermolecular cycloaddition between the two reactants. The most well-established mechanism for the photochemical addition of alkenes to benzene rings, which leads to the observed tricyclic product skeleton, is the **meta-photocycloaddition**.\n5.  **Step 1: Meta-Photocycloaddition:** This reaction, also known as a [1,3]-cycloaddition, is a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction. It is a type of **cycloaddition**.\n6.  **Step 2: Rearrangement:** The initial adduct from the meta-cycloaddition is a strained molecule containing a vinylcyclopropane unit. This intermediate readily undergoes a rearrangement to form the more stable final product. This rearrangement is a **[1,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement**, another type of photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The two reactions involved are a cycloaddition (specifically, meta-photocycloaddition) and a sigmatropic rearrangement.\n8.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that states this conclusion and prints the names of the two reaction types.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the two types of pericyclic reactions in the\n    photochemical transformation of hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The reaction proceeds via a well-established two-step mechanism for\n    # the photochemical addition of alkenes to benzene derivatives.\n\n    # The first step is a meta-photocycloaddition, where the alkene adds across\n    # the 1 and 3 positions of the benzene ring. This is a type of cycloaddition.\n    reaction_1_name = \"Cycloaddition\"\n    reaction_1_specifics = \"meta(1,3)-photocycloaddition\"\n\n    # The second step is the rearrangement of the vinylcyclopropane intermediate\n    # formed in the first step. This is a [1,3]-sigmatropic shift.\n    reaction_2_name = \"Sigmatropic rearrangement\"\n    reaction_2_specifics = \"[1,3]-shift (vinylcyclopropane rearrangement)\"\n\n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n    print(f\"1. {reaction_1_name} (specifically, a {reaction_1_specifics})\")\n    print(f\"2. {reaction_2_name} (specifically, a {reaction_2_specifics})\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<The two reactions are a cycloaddition and a sigmatropic rearrangement.>>>"
