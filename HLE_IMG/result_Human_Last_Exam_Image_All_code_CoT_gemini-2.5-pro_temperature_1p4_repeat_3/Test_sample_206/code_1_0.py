# Based on the analysis of the graph, the correct conclusions are 1 and 4.
# Let's map the statements to numbers and then the numbers to the answer choices.
conclusion_1 = True  # Interpreted as qualitatively similar structuring
conclusion_2 = False # Ethanol peaks are lower, not higher
conclusion_3 = True  # Methanol peaks are higher, but this is a nuance if we accept 1
conclusion_4 = True  # H-bond orientation is clearly similar
conclusion_5 = False # No obvious 3rd shell for ethanol
conclusion_6 = False # No obvious 3rd shell for methanol

# Answer choices are:
# A: 2
# B: 3
# C: 1, 6
# D: 1, 4
# E: 4, 6
# F: 2, 5
# G: 4

# The most comprehensive and plausible answer is D, which combines the statement about
# the approximate similarity of structure (1) and the clear similarity in orientation (4).
# This provides a better overall picture than just focusing on one aspect.
