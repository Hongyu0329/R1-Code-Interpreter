    "To determine which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we need to analyze their chemical stability. The operational lifetime of such emitters is often limited by the degradation of the complex, which is heavily influenced by the strength of its chemical bonds.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures:** All four complexes share the same core structure: a central Iridium(III) ion, two cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, and one ancillary bipyridine (N^N) ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The key difference between the complexes lies in the substitution on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Both C^N ligands are 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. They are both fluorinated.\n    *   **Complex 2:** It has one fluorinated C^N ligand (2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine) and one non-fluorinated C^N ligand (2-phenylpyridine).\n    *   **Complex 3:** Both C^N ligands are 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. They are both fluorinated.\n    *   **Complex 4:** It has one fluorinated C^N ligand (2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine) and one non-fluorinated C^N ligand (2-phenylpyridine).\n\n2.  **Relate structure to stability and lifetime:** The stability of these complexes, and thus their lifetime in a device, is strongly dependent on the strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of the C^N ligands.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it exerts a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This withdrawal of electron density strengthens the Ir-C bond. Stronger bonds lead to greater molecular stability and resistance to degradation under electrical stress. Complexes with fluorinated C^N ligands are therefore generally more robust and exhibit longer lifetimes.\n    *   **The \"Weak Link\":** The unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand, present in complexes 2 and 4, lacks the stabilizing effect of fluorine atoms. The Ir-C bond is relatively weaker, and the C-H bonds on the phenyl ring are more prone to undesirable reactions (e.g., oxidative addition) compared to the very strong C-F bonds. This makes the unsubstituted ligand a \"weak link,\" providing a pathway for the complex to degrade.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The complexes containing the unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand are expected to be the least stable and therefore have the shortest lifetimes.\n    *   Complexes 1 and 3 contain only fluorinated C^N ligands, so they are expected to be more stable and have longer lifetimes.\n    *   Complexes 2 and 4 each contain one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand, making them more susceptible to degradation.\n\nTherefore, complexes [2] and [4] are expected to show shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes\n    to determine which ones are expected to have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the ligands for each complex.
