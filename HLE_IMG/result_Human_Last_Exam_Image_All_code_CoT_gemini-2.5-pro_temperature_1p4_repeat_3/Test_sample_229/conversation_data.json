    "I will identify the song from the sheet music provided and then present the information about its title, musical style, and country of origin in a Python script.\n\n1.  **Melody and Chord Analysis:** I will examine the notes and chords in the sheet music. The melody begins with the notes E-G-A-G over a C chord, followed by C-C, then E-G-A-G over an E7 chord, followed by F-F. This melodic phrase is highly distinctive. The chord progression includes C, G7, F, E7, Am, and Dm, which is common in popular and folk music. The rhythm is syncopated with many eighth notes, suggesting a lively, dance-like character.\n2.  **Song Identification:** The opening melodic phrase is instantly recognizable as the main theme of the famous Brazilian song \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\".\n3.  **Gathering Information:**\n    *   **Title:** \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\", which translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal\". It is often known simply as \"Tico-Tico\".\n    *   **Musical Style:** The song is a \"Choro\", a vibrant and virtuosic instrumental music genre from Brazil. It is characterized by fast tempos and syncopated rhythms and is a precursor to Samba and Bossa Nova.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The song originates from Brazil. It was composed by Zequinha de Abreu in 1917.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to display the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song.\n\n```python\ndef song_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the information about the song from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\"\n    musical_style = \"Choro\"\n    country_of_origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nsong_information()\n```\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치, Musical Style: Choro, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
