# Function to identify the key species and its significance
def identify_atlantic_indicator_species():
    """
    Analyzes the faunal assemblage in the photo to determine the geographic indicator species.

    1.  Image Analysis: The photo shows a rocky intertidal community with barnacles and several species of marine snails (periwinkles).
    2.  Species Identification: The most prominent and identifiable snail is the one with distinct spiral bands. This is the Common Periwinkle.
    3.  Geographic Distribution:
        - Scientific Name: Littorina littorea
        - Native Range: European Atlantic coast.
        - North American Range: It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now one of the most common and widespread intertidal snails from Canada to Virginia.
        - Pacific Coast Status: It is NOT native to the Pacific coast. While a few isolated, introduced populations exist, it is not a common or characteristic species of the Pacific intertidal zone.
    4.  Conclusion: The presence of this species, a dominant grazer in the North Atlantic, definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast.
