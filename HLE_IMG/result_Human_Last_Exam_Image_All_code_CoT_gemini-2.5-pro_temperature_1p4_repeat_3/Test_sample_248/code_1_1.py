    # Step 1: Identify the key organisms in the image. The image displays a classic
    # rocky shore community with barnacles and marine snails (periwinkles).

    # Step 2: Focus on the most identifiable species with a distinct geographic range.
    # The large snail with visible spiral bands is morphologically consistent with
    # the Common Periwinkle.

    # Step 3: Research the geographic distribution of this species.
    # The Common Periwinkle is native to the European Atlantic. It was introduced
    # to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-1800s and is now ubiquitous
    # there.

    # Step 4: Compare its distribution with the Pacific Coast.
    # The Common Periwinkle is NOT native to the Pacific Coast of North America.
    # While some small, isolated populations have been introduced, it is not a
    # characteristic or widespread species of the Pacific intertidal zone.
    # Native Pacific periwinkles (e.g., Littorina scutulata) have a different appearance.

    # Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence. The presence of this specific snail
    # strongly indicates an Atlantic coast location.
