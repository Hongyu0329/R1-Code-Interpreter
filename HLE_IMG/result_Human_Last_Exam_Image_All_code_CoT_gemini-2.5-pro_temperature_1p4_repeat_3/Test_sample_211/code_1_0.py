# The task is to identify the individual bird from the target image
# among the provided options (A-I).
# This requires a careful visual comparison of the unique feather patterns.

# Step 1: Analyze the features of the bird in the 'Target' image.
# The bird has a distinct scalloped pattern on its back and wing coverts.
# The larger flight feathers have sharp, white edges.
# The overall pose is from the back, angled slightly to its right.

# Step 2: Compare the target's features with each option.
# After comparing the intricate feather patterns, which act as a unique identifier,
# image B shows a perfect match.
# - The posture is nearly identical.
# - The scalloped pattern on the back, including specific swirls and arrangements,
#   is consistent with the target.
# - The white lines on the folded wing feathers match in number, curvature, and spacing.

# Step 3: Conclude the identification.
# Based on the direct visual evidence, the bird in image B is the same
# individual as the bird in the target image.

# Step 4: Print the result.
