# Step 1: Determine m and n from visual inspection.
# Based on the visual analysis of the path between adjacent pentagons,
# we identified a path of 5 steps, a turn, and 3 steps.
# Given the hint m > n, we set:
m = 5
n = 3

# Step 2: Determine the number of pentagonal faces, P.
# All Goldberg polyhedra have 12 pentagonal faces.
P = 12

# Step 3: Calculate the number of hexagonal faces, H.
# The formula for H is 10 * (T - 1), where T = m^2 + m*n + n^2.

# First, calculate the triangulation number T.
T = m**2 + m * n + n**2

# Then, calculate H.
H = 10 * (T - 1)

# Step 4: Output the results.
# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The parameters determined from the image are m = {m} and n = {n}.")
print(f"The number of pentagonal faces P is always 12.")
print(f"The number of hexagonal faces H is calculated as follows:")
print(f"T = m^2 + m*n + n^2 = {m}^2 + {m}*{n} + {n}^2 = {int(m**2)} + {int(m*n)} + {int(n**2)} = {int(T)}")
print(f"H = 10 * (T - 1) = 10 * ({int(T)} - 1) = {int(H)}")

# Final answer in the specified format: m,n,H,P
print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"{m},{n},{int(H)},{P}")
