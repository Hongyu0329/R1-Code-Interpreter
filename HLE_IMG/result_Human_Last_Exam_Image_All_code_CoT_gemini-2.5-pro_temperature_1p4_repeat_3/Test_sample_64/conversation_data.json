    "The image displays a series of micrographs (L, M, N) showing a time sequence of a specific cellular process in a filamentous organism, which appears to be a fungal hypha.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1.  **Panel L:** This panel shows two adjacent cells in the filament, separated by a cross-wall called a septum. The arrowhead points to this septum. The hypha is relatively straight.\n2.  **Panel M:** This panel shows the same region at a later time. A small, hook-like outgrowth, indicated by the arrowhead, has started to form from the upper cell, near the septum, and is growing backward. This is the initial stage of the formation of the key structure.\n3.  **Panel N:** In this final panel, the hook-like structure has elongated and curved back towards the lower cell. This fully-formed structure is known as a clamp connection.\n\nThis process, the formation of a **clamp connection**, is a characteristic feature of many fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a mechanism that ensures each new cell in the growing hypha maintains a dikaryotic state, meaning it contains two genetically distinct nuclei, one from each \"parental\" hypha that fused to form the mycelium.\n\n<<<The formation of a clamp connection in a fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
