    # Step 1: Identify the verse based on the analysis of the manuscript's text.
    # The key recognizable words in the Arabic transcription are:
    # بيوم (bywm) -> ביום (in the day)
    # شاح (shāḥ) -> ושח (and...bowed down)
    # عام (ʿām) -> עם (people) or a substitute for אנשים (men)
    # This combination points strongly to Isaiah chapter 2.

    # Step 2: Provide the Hebrew text from the identified verse.
    # The verse is isa. 2:11: "The lofty looks of man shall be humbled,
    # and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone
    # shall be exalted in that day."
    # The transcription should be without vowel points or accents.
    hebrew_text = "עיני גבהות אדם שפל ושח רום אנשים ונשגב יהוה לבדו ביום ההוא"

    # Step 3: Format the output as requested.
    # Format: "book. chapter:verse, hebrew_text"
