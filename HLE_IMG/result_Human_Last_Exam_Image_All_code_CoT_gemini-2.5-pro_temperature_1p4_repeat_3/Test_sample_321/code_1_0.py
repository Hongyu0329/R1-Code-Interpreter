    # of changing the quarantine start time (q_s).

    # corresponds to varying the quarantine length (q_l).

    # Plot 9 is an increasing S-curve (like cumulative deaths) with a kink. The *slope* during this
    # kink varies between curves. This matches the effect of varying quarantine effectiveness (q_f).

    # Plot 7 is the only plot where the three curves appear to be perfect scaled versions of one
    # another. This happens only when varying a cost parameter (c_l or c_h), which acts as a simple
    # multiplier on its respective cost function. The plot number 7 matching the parameter id for c_l
    # is a likely hint to resolve the ambiguity.
    p[7] = param_map['c_l']

    # Plot 8 shows curves that are very close together, implying a parameter with a small overall impact.

    # strongest candidate for this plot.

    # final outcome. This matches the effect of the incubation period (a_i). A longer incubation period
    # (higher a_i) slows the epidemic, resulting in a lower final count (fewer total deaths/recovered).
    p[5] = param_map['a_i']

    # During quarantine, community transmission is reduced, so hospital transmission (β_h) becomes
    # relatively more important. Varying β_h would cause exactly this visual effect.
    p[6] = param_map['β_h']

    # Plot 1 shows a large, clean change in the steepness of a decreasing curve (likely Susceptibles, S). This
    # suggests a parameter that strongly influences the overall infection rate. The mortality rate for
    # normally symptomatic individuals (μ_n) affects the largest pool of infectives (I_n) and thus has a
    # significant impact on the epidemic's course.
