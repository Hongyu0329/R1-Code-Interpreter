    "The primary and most easily distinguishable feature in the sporophyte that separates *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* is the **seta**, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana** (as likely depicted in the image), the seta is **short and straight**. This causes the spore capsule to be held erect and emergent from the leaves.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, as its name implies (*curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk), the seta is **distinctly curved or S-shaped (arcuate to cygneous)**. This curvature causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or pendulous (hanging down), often tucked beside the stem rather than sitting upright on top of it.\n\nTherefore, you can tell them apart at a glance by the orientation of the capsule: erect in *G. montana* vs. nodding/hanging in *G. curviseta*.\n\nI will generate a Python script that prints this explanation.\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main sporophyte difference between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    feature1 = \"a short and straight seta (stalk)\"\n    result1 = \"an erect capsule held upright among the leaves\"\n\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    feature2 = \"a distinctly curved or S-shaped seta\"\n    result2 = \"a nodding or hanging capsule\"\n\n    print(f\"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule).\\n\")\n    print(f\"1.
