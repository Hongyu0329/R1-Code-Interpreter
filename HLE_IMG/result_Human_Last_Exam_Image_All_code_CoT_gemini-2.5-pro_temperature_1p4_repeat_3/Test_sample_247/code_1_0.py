    """
    Analyzes potential causes for heart failure based on echocardiogram findings.

    The echocardiogram shows clear signs of massive pericardial effusion leading
    to cardiac tamponade. Key findings include:
    1. A large anechoic (black) space surrounding the heart, indicating fluid.
    2. A "swinging" motion of the heart within the fluid-filled pericardial sac.
    3. Electrical alternans on the ECG (alternating QRS complex amplitude),
       which is pathognomonic for cardiac tamponade.

    The resulting heart failure is due to diastolic dysfunction, as the heart
    cannot fill adequately due to external compression.

    This function evaluates the provided choices to determine the most likely
    underlying cause of this massive pericardial effusion.
