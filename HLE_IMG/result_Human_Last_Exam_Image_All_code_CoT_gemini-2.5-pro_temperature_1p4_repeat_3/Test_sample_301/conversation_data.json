The red seal in the upper right corner reads \"白石\" (Báishí), the art name of **Qi Baishi**, one of the most celebrated masters of modern Chinese painting.\n3.  **Top-Right:** This is a portrait of an ethnic minority woman. The style, which combines traditional Chinese ink line with Western watercolor techniques, is a hallmark of **Ye Qianyu**, a prominent 20th-century Chinese painter.\n4.  **Middle-Left:** This is a piece of \"wild cursive\" (狂草) script calligraphy.

He is a key figure in the modernization of Chinese ink painting, often incorporating abstract and cosmic themes.\n6.  **Middle-Right:** This piece of calligraphy is in the elegant and refined Regular Script (楷書).
