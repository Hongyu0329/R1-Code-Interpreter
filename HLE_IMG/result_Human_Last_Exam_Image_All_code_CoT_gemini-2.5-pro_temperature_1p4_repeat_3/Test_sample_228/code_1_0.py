    Identifies the early 20th-century theorist whose ideas are reflected in the image.
    
    Thinking Steps:
    1.  Analyze the visual elements and style of the artwork. It is a collage with disparate, dream-like elements.
    2.  Identify key motifs: a hybrid human-animal figure, illogical juxtapositions (postcard, mountain, mythology), and fragmented, poetic text.
    3.  Recognize the style as Surrealism, an art movement that flourished in the early 20th century.
    4.  Recall the primary theoretical influence on Surrealism. The Surrealists were famously inspired by psychoanalysis and the exploration of the subconscious, dreams, and repressed desires.
    5.  The foundational theorist for these ideas is Sigmund Freud. His work on "The Interpretation of Dreams" (1899) and theories of the unconscious were a direct source for Surrealist artists like André Breton, Salvador Dalí, and Max Ernst.
    6.  The artwork's content—hybrid creatures, dreamscapes, mythological symbolism (Persephone)—are all classic examples of Surrealist artists visually interpreting Freudian concepts.
    7.  Therefore, the theorist is Sigmund Freud.
