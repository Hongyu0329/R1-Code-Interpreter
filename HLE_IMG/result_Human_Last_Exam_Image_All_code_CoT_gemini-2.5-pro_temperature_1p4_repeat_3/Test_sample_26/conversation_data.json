    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, we need to perform a harmonic analysis.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The piece is in the key of C minor, which has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** Find measure 30 in the provided sheet music. It's the measure that is circled.\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** Analyze the notes played in measure 30 across both staves.\n    *   The left hand plays G in octaves (G2 and G3). This establishes G as the bass note and root of the harmony.\n    *   The right hand plays an arpeggio consisting of the notes G4, B♮4, D5, and F♯5.\n4.  **Assemble the Chord:** The complete set of notes in the measure is G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n5.  **Analyze the Chord's Function:**\n    *   The root of the chord is G, which is the fifth scale degree of C minor. In Roman numeral analysis, the chord built on the fifth degree is the **dominant**, represented by the numeral **V**.\n    *   In a minor key, the dominant chord is typically major to create a stronger pull to the tonic. This is achieved by raising the third of the chord to create a leading tone. Here, the third of the G chord (B) is raised from B♭ (diatonic to C minor) to B♮, which confirms its function as a proper dominant. Therefore, we use an uppercase Roman numeral: **V**.\n    *   The full chord is G-B♮-D-F♯, which is a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7). While the F♯ makes the chord sonority unusual (a Vmaj7), its fundamental role in the harmonic progression is that of the dominant. In standard functional analysis, the F♯ is often treated as a chromatic coloration or a non-chord tone, and the core harmony is identified as the dominant chord.\n6.  **Final Roman Numeral:** Based on its function as the dominant chord in the key of C minor, the correct Roman numeral is **V**.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the harmonic analysis of measure 30\n    of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st movement, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure_number = 30\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the notes in the measure\n    notes_lh = [\"G2\", \"G3\"]\n    notes_rh = [\"G4\", \"B-natural4\", \"D5\", \"F-sharp5\"]\n    all_notes = \"G, B-natural, D, F-sharp\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the root and function of the chord\n    root_note = \"G\"\n    scale_degree = 5\n    function = \"Dominant\"\n    numeral_base = \"V\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the quality of the chord\n    # The triad G-B(natural)-D is a major triad.\n    # In a minor key, the dominant is typically major, so we use an uppercase V.\n    quality = \"Major\"\n    final_numeral = \"V\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final answer\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st Mvt, Measure {measure_number}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
