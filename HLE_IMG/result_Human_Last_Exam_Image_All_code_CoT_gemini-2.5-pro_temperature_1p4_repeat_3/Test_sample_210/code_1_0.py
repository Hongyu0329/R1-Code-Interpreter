    This function solves the visual identification task.

    The identification is based on comparing unique features of the nyala:
    1. Horn Shape: The target nyala has long horns with a distinct outward sweep and light-colored tips.
    2. Stripe Pattern: The target has a series of thin, white vertical stripes.
    3. Spot Pattern: A unique cluster of white spots is visible on the rear flank.

    Comparison:
    - A: Incorrect. Younger male with smaller horns.
    - B: A possible match based on spots, but horn comparison is difficult.
    - C: Incorrect. Different coloration and thicker stripes.
    - D: A perfect match. The horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot cluster on the flank are all identical to the target. The viewing angle is also very similar, allowing for a confident comparison.
    - E: Incorrect. Different horn shape and a white band on the leg not seen on the target.
    - F: Incorrect. Horns appear different, and the animal is partially obscured.

    The most conclusive match is image D.
