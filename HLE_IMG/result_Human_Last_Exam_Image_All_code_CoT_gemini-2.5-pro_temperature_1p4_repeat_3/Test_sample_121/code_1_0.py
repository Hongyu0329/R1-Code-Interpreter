# The user wants to select the best answer from a list of choices.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, multiple statements (G, J, T) are correct.
# Therefore, the answer choice "L. More than one answer is correct." is the most appropriate response.

# Let's outline the supporting logic for the key correct statements:
# Statement G: "The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely an ortholog of CG14879..."
# - Support: The D. melanogaster gene has "consistent tissue expression". In D. willistoni, the right element's RNA-Seq pattern is broad and consistent, while the left element's is highly tissue-specific. The right element is a better match to the ancestral pattern, making it the ortholog.

# Statement J: "It’s likely that the 'left' element... has a function which is further away from the genes’s original function, whereas the 'right' element... has a function closer to the original gene’s function."
# - Support: This statement describes the evolutionary process of neofunctionalization, which explains the findings that support statement G. It is a valid interpretation of the evidence.

# Statement T: "1a and 1b are alternatives within a single element, and CDS 2 is in a different element"
# - Support: The text describes isoforms as combining (1a or 1b) with 2. More importantly, the stark difference in RNA-Seq coverage and tissue specificity between the (1a/1b) region and the (2) region strongly implies they are separate transcriptional units, i.e., different elements/genes.

# Conclusion: Since multiple choices are demonstrably correct based on the provided data, the correct option is L.

print(f"The evidence supports multiple conclusions from the list. For example:")
print(f"- Statement G is supported by comparing the 'consistent' expression pattern in D. melanogaster to the RNA-seq data in D. willistoni, which shows the right element has a more consistent pattern than the specialized left element.")
print(f"- Statement T is supported because the differential RNA-seq expression between the region containing CDS 2 and the region containing CDS 1a/1b indicates they are separate elements.")
print(f"- Statement J correctly describes the evolutionary mechanism (neofunctionalization) that would lead to the outcome described in G.")
print(f"Since multiple statements (G, T, J) are correct, the most accurate answer is L.")
