    print("The task is to choose the most suitable Knowledge Management (KM) model(s) for a virtual assistant company's sales process.")
    print("\nAnalysis of the Models:")
    print("\n1. DIKW Model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom):")
    print("   - This model fits the sales pipeline structure perfectly.")
    print("   - Data: The 'VA Sales List' starts as raw data.")
    print("   - Information: 'Qualifying Leads' turns the data into useful information.")
    print("   - Knowledge: 'VA Sales Script' and 'Work Manuals' represent the actionable knowledge of how to proceed.")
    print("   - Conclusion: DIKW is highly applicable for structuring the sales process information flow.")

    print("\n2. SECI Model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization):")
    print("   - This model is ideal for creating the knowledge assets the company needs.")
    print("   - The main challenge for a company new to KM is capturing the experience (tacit knowledge) of its skilled employees.")
    print("   - Externalization (Tacit -> Explicit): Creating a 'VA Sales Script' from an expert salesperson's experience is the core of this model.")
    print("   - This allows valuable, unwritten knowledge to be documented and shared, boosting the entire team's performance.")
    print("   - Conclusion: SECI is essential for generating and sharing the required sales knowledge.")
    
    print("\n3. Bloom's Taxonomy:")
    print("   - This is a framework for individual learning and educational design, not organizational knowledge management.")
    print("   - It's useful for *training* staff on the new system, but not for designing the system itself.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Less relevant for the primary goal of implementing a company-wide KM system.")

    print("\nFinal Recommendation:")
    print("Combining DIKW and SECI provides the most comprehensive solution.")
    print("- DIKW provides the 'what': the structure and flow of information in the sales pipeline.")
    print("- SECI provides the 'how': the process for creating and sharing the critical knowledge (like scripts and manuals) to make the pipeline effective.")
    print("\nTherefore, the best choice is D. DIKW and SECI.")
