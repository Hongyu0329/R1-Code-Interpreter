    "Yes, there is an animal in this image. It is an insect, specifically a longhorn beetle.\n\nMy plan to identify the animal's scientific name is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Key Features:** I will examine the beetle's distinct characteristics visible in the image, such as its coloration, pattern, body shape, and antennae length. The most prominent features are its black body, a large, bright red/orange patch across the top of its wing covers (elytra), and its long, segmented antennae.\n2.  **Narrow Down the Family:** The long antennae are a classic trait of the Cerambycidae family, commonly known as longhorn beetles.\n3.  **Identify the Species:** I will search for longhorn beetle species that match the specific color pattern. The red marking is particularly distinctive; it's located at the \"shoulders\" of the elytra and the two patches on either side come close together, resembling a heart shape when viewed from above. This feature strongly points to the species *Stictoleptura cordigera*, whose common name is the Heart-marked Longhorn Beetle.\n4.  **Formulate the Output:** I will write a Python script that prints a statement confirming the presence of the animal and providing its identified scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  animal_present = \"Yes\"\n  animal_type = \"longhorn beetle\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura cordigera\"\n\n  print(f\"{animal_present}, the animal in the image is a {animal_type}.\")\n  print(f\"Based on its distinctive heart-shaped red markings, its scientific name is {scientific_name}.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
