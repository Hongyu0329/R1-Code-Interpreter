    "My plan to identify this alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure provided in the image to identify its key functional groups and ring system.\n2.  The structure is a tetracyclic (four-ring) system containing two nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of a quinolizidine alkaloid.\n3.  A carbonyl group (C=O) is present within one of the rings, forming a lactam.\n4.  I will search chemical databases using these structural features (tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid lactam) to find a match.\n5.  This specific structure matches that of Lupanine, an alkaloid commonly found in lupin beans.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of the compound.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid compound from its structure.\n    The compound is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid containing a lactam group.\n    Based on these features, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
