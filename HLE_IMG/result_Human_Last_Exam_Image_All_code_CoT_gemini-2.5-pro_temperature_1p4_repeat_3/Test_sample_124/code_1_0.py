# Define the component values from the circuit diagram

R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms
R8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms

# Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the first branch (R1, R2, R3)
# A wire bypasses R1 and R2, connecting the top node directly to the point
# between R2 and R3. This short-circuits R1 and R2.
# Therefore, the resistance of this branch is just R3.
R_branch1 = R3

# Step 2: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the second branch (R7, R8)
# R7 and R8 are connected in series.

# Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit
# The two branches are in parallel.
# The formula is 1 / R_total = 1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2
R_total = 1 / (1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2)
print("Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance.")

print(f"1 / (1/{R_branch1} + 1/{R_branch2}) = {R_total:.4f} Ω.\n")

# Step 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V / R)
I_total = V2 / R_total
