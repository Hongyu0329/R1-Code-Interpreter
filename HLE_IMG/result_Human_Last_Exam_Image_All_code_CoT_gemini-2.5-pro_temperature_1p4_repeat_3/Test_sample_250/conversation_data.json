    "This is a classic jazz standard. Based on the key signature (F minor), the opening melodic line, and the characteristic chord progression, I can identify the piece.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the identification:\n1.  **Key and Melody**: The key is F minor. The opening melody starts on the root (F), repeats, then goes up a minor third (Ab), which is a very distinctive opening for this tune.\n2.  **Chord Progression**: The A section's progression starting with `F- | E-7b5 | ...` and the bridge's cycle of secondary dominants (`D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab ...`) are hallmarks of this specific standard.\n\nThese elements conclusively identify the tune. The following Python code will print the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef get_jazz_standard_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the title and composer of the jazz standard\n    identified from the provided sheet music.\n    \n    The identification is based on musical analysis of the melody and harmony.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
