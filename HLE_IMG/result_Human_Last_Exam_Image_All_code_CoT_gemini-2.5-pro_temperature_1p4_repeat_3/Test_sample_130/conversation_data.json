    "An emission spectrum is a unique fingerprint for each element. By analyzing the pattern of colored lines (their position, color, and intensity), we can identify the element that produced it.\n\nI will write a Python script that contains a small database of characteristic spectral lines for a few elements. By comparing the prominent lines visible in the image—especially the very bright green line, the blue line, and the violet line—to this database, the script will identify the matching element.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its known spectral lines\n    to the pattern observed in the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small database of prominent visible spectral lines for some elements (in nanometers).\n    spectral_database = {\n        \"Hydrogen\": [410.2, 434.1, 486.1, 656.3],\n        \"Helium\": [447.1, 471.3, 492.2, 501.6, 587.6, 667.8],\n        \"Mercury\": [404.7, 435.8, 546.1, 577.0, 579.1]\n    }\n\n    # Description of the spectrum from the image.\n    # The image shows a very distinct pattern, most notably:\n    # 1.
