    "This problem requires us to trace the movement of substituents during an acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a triterpenoid. The starting material is friedelan-3Î²-ol, which upon treatment with hot acid, undergoes dehydration and a series of concerted [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts (a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement) to form a more stable alkene product with an oleanane skeleton.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a complex carbocation rearrangement, specifically the well-documented friedelane-oleanane rearrangement.\n2.  **Trace the movement of atoms:** I will follow the step-by-step mechanism of the rearrangement, keeping track of which group (H or CH3) moves from which carbon and to where.\n3.  **Identify the substituents at the labeled positions:** By comparing the final arrangement of atoms in the oleanane product with the labels (1-5) in the provided image, I will determine whether each position is occupied by a hydrogen (H) or a methyl group (CH3).\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that encapsulates this logic to determine the final substituents and prints the answer in the specified format.\n\nHere is the step-by-step chemical reasoning:\n*   **Initial Step:** The alcohol at C-3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n*   **Rearrangement Cascade:**\n    1.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-4 to C-3. The carbocation moves to C-4. One of the original methyls at C-4 remains. This means **Position 1** is a **CH3**.\n    2.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-5 to C-4. The cation moves to C-5.\n    3.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-10 to C-5. The cation moves to C-10.\n    4.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-9 to C-10. This means the original C-10 methyl group is gone, replaced by a hydrogen. **Position 2** is therefore **H**.\n    5.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-8 to C-9. The cation moves to C-8.\n    6.  A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-14 to C-8. This means the original C-8 methyl group is gone, replaced by the methyl group from C-14. **Position 3** is therefore **CH3**.\n    7.  A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-13 to C-14. This means the original C-14 methyl group is gone (it moved to C-8), and it is replaced by the hydrogen from C-13. **Position 4** is therefore **H**.\n    8.  The cation is now at C-13. Finally, a proton is eliminated from C-12 to form the stable C-12=C-13 double bond.\n*   **Position 5:** This label points to the substituent at C-17. This part of the molecule is not involved in the backbone rearrangement. Therefore, the methyl group originally at C-17 remains in place. **Position 5** is **CH3**.\n\nThe following Python code deduces and prints the final answer based on this chemical reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the labeled positions in the product of the\n    acid-catalyzed rearrangement of friedelan-3-ol to an oleanane derivative.\n\n    The logic is based on tracking the known Wagner-Meerwein [1,2] shifts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary to store the final substituent at each numbered position.\n    substituents = {}\n\n    # Position 1 (at C-4): One of the two original methyl groups at C-4 remains\n    # after the other migrates to C-3.\n    substituents[1] = 'CH3'\n\n    # Position 2 (at C-10): The original methyl group at C-10 migrates to C-5,\n    # and a hydrogen atom migrates from C-9 to C-10.\n    substituents[2] = 'H'\n\n    # Position 3 (at C-8): The original methyl group at C-8 migrates to C-9,\n    # and a methyl group migrates from C-14 to C-8.\n    substituents[3] = 'CH3'\n\n    # Position 4 (at C-14): The original methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8,\n    # and a hydrogen atom migrates from C-13 to C-14.\n    substituents[4] = 'H'\n\n    # Position 5 (at C-17): The methyl group at C-17 is not involved in the\n    # backbone rearrangement and remains in its original position.\n    substituents[5] = 'CH3'\n\n    # Format and print the output as requested.\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituents[position]}\")\n\n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
