    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will follow the reaction step-by-step, calculating the molecular formula for each intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is 7-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n*   **Bicyclic core**: The `7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one` core consists of:\n    *   6 Carbon atoms (C)\n    *   5 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   1 Nitrogen atom (N)\n    *   1 Oxygen atom (O)\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   **CF₃ group**: 1 Carbon (C), 3 Fluorine (F) atoms.\n    *   **PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group** (-CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃): 8 Carbon (C), 9 Hydrogen (H), 1 Oxygen (O) atoms.\n*   **Total atoms in Starting Material**:\n    *   C: 6 (core) + 1 (CF₃) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n    *   H: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n    *   F: 3 (CF₃) = 3\n    *   N: 1 (core) = 1\n    *   O: 1 (core) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reaction**: CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate) is used for the oxidative deprotection of the PMB group from the nitrogen atom. The PMB group (-C₈H₉O) is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Change in atoms**: -C₈, -H₉, -O, +H  =>  -C₈H₈O\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1**:\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reaction**: Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H₂) reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). This reaction adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. Standard conditions for this reaction are selective for the alkene over the ketone.\n*   **Change in atoms**: +H₂\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2**:\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 2, a strained bicyclic amino-ketone, is treated with strong acid (4N HCl) at high temperature. This condition typically promotes skeletal rearrangement (like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement) to a more stable isomer, rather than fragmentation or hydrolysis. A rearrangement is an isomerization process, meaning the number and type of atoms do not change.\n*   **Change in atoms**: None.\n*   **Formula of the Product**: The product has the same molecular formula as Intermediate 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final formula based on this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the composition of the starting material\n    # Core: 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one -> C6 H5 N O\n    # CF3 group -> C1 F3\n    # PMB group: p-methoxybenzyl (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) -> C8 H9 O\n    start_material = {\n        'C': 6 + 1 + 8,\n        'H': 5 + 9,\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 1 + 1,\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction with CAN.
