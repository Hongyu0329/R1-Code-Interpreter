    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will analyze the key morphological differences (sexual dimorphism) visible in the images.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. The primary feature for sex determination in this genus is the shape of the abdominal tip. Females have a sharply pointed, cone-shaped abdomen used for egg-laying, while males have a blunter tip with multiple spines.\n    *   The bee on the left (A-left) has a very sharp, tapered abdomen, indicating it is a **female**.\n    *   The bee on the right (A-right) has a less pointed abdomen, characteristic of a **male**.\n    *   This pair is Female, Male (F, M), which is option **4**.\n\n2.  **Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. A common way to differentiate sexes in these wasps is by looking at the tips of the antennae.\n    *   The wasp on the left (B-left) has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic of **male** wasps.\n    *   The wasp on the right (B-right) has straight antennae, indicating it is a **female**. Females also possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), giving the abdomen a more pointed appearance.\n    *   This pair is Male, Female (M, F), which is option **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). As their name suggests, the most dramatic difference between sexes is the length of the antennae.\n    *   The bee on the left (C-left) has very long antennae, a hallmark trait of the **male**. Male bees in many families also have a yellow or pale patch on their face (clypeus), which is visible here.\n    *   The bee on the right (C-right) has significantly shorter antennae, which is typical for a **female**.\n    *   This pair is Male, Female (M, F), which is option **3**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Pair A is F, M (4)\n*   Pair B is M, F (3)\n*   Pair C is M, F (3)\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices: 4, 3, 3. The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sex identification puzzle.\n    \n    A: Left bee has a pointed abdomen (female Coelioxys ovipositor). Right has a spined abdomen tip (male). -> F, M (4)\n    B: Left wasp has curled antennae tips (male). Right has straight antennae (female). -> M, F (3)\n    C: Left bee has very long antennae (male long-horned bee). Right has short antennae (female). -> M, F (3)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices corresponding to the analysis for pairs A, B, and C\n    index_A = 4\n    index_B = 3\n    index_C = 3\n    \n    # Format and print the final answer as a comma-separated string\n    print(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```"
