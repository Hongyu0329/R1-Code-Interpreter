    Solves the puzzle by deducing the properties of the four simulations.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The energy dispersion relations for graphene with hopping 't' and overlap 's' are analyzed.
    2. The four plots are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to determine the sign of 's' and the total bandwidth at the Gamma point, which is proportional to 't'.
    3. Simulation 4 is identified as having a unique sign for 's' (s > 0), as it's the only one where the conduction band is wider than the valence band. So, it satisfies condition 3.
    4. The problem states a logical structure where one simulation is a reference (R) and three others are modifications (A: diff t, B: diff |s|, C: diff sign). The simulation with a different sign (C) must have the same total bandwidth as the reference (R).
    5. The bandwidth of Sim 4 (W=25 eV) matches the inferred bandwidth of Sim 1 (W=25 eV). This identifies Sim 1 as the reference R.
    6. The simulation with the minimum hopping parameter 't' must be the one with the smallest bandwidth (W=15 eV), which is Sim 2. This simulation is the one with a modified t (A). So, it satisfies condition 1.
    7. This leaves Sim 3 to satisfy the remaining condition (minimum |s|). This is the simulation with a modified |s| (B). So, it satisfies condition 2.
    8. The final condition 'maximum s' clashes with 'unique sign(s)' as both point to Sim 4. To ensure a permutation, this condition is interpreted as identifying the reference simulation, R=1, which is not otherwise selected.
    
    Therefore, the final mapping from conditions to simulations is:
    - Condition 1 (min t): Sim 2
    - Condition 2 (min |s|): Sim 3
    - Condition 3 (unique sign(s)): Sim 4
    - Condition 4 (max s, interpreted as Reference): Sim 1
    
    The resulting ordered list of simulation indices is 2341.
