The structure of C is the diethylamine adduct of compound A (where the diethylamino group is attached to the central carbon of A's core) in which all five methoxy groups (-OCH3) present in A have been converted to hydroxyl groups (-OH). Based on related literature, the chemical name would be 9-(diethylamino)-9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-9H-xanthene-2,4,5,7-tetrol, though the exact structure of A in the image might differ slightly from the standard literature compound. The key transformation is the conversion of all Ar-OCH3 to Ar-OH.
