    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided graph to locate the synchronized bursts. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of firing events (black dots) occurring across many electrodes (y-axis) at nearly the same time (x-axis), appearing as vertical bands. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bands.\n2.  **List Timestamps:** I will list the estimated timestamps of these bursts in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of identified burst timestamps. These are the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final average will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the process step-by-step, including the final equation and the result.\n\nBased on my analysis of the graph, the synchronized bursts are centered at approximately the following timestamps: 3 s, 17 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 1. Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\nburst_timestamps = [3, 17, 24, 36, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# 2. Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\ninter_burst_intervals = []\nfor i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n  interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n  inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n# 3. Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# 4. Print the final calculation and result.\n# Create the sum part of the equation string\nsum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n# Get the number of intervals\nnum_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"Average = ({sum_str}) / {num_intervals}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {num_intervals}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {average_ibi:.3f} s\")\n\n# 5. Round the result to two significant figures.\n# A simple way to round to 2 significant figures for a number >= 10 is to round to the nearest integer.\n# For a number < 10, it would be rounding to one decimal place.\n# Since 11.5 >= 10, we round to zero decimal places.\nfinal_answer = round(average_ibi)\nprint(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is {final_answer} s.\")\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
