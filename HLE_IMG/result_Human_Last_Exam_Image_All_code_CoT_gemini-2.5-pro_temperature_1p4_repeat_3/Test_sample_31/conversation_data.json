    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I need to identify the knot shown in the picture. By examining its structure and number of crossings, I can determine its identity from standard knot tables. The knot has 7 crossings and its specific arrangement corresponds to the knot known as **7₄** in the Alexander-Briggs notation.\n\n2.  **Understand the Rasmussen Invariant:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer value derived from a sophisticated algebraic tool called Khovanov homology. One of its most important properties is its behavior with respect to \"slice\" knots.\n\n3.  **Relate the Invariant to Knot Properties:** A knot is called \"slice\" if it forms the boundary of a smooth, non-self-intersecting disk in 4-dimensional space. The Rasmussen invariant provides a powerful test for sliceness: **if a knot K is slice, then its Rasmussen invariant s(K) must be 0.**\n\n4.  **Apply the Property:** The knot `7₄` is a well-known example in knot theory. It is famous for being the lowest-crossing non-trivial knot that is, in fact, a slice knot.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Code Formulation:** Since the knot is `7₄`, and `7₄` is a slice knot, its Rasmussen invariant must be 0. I will write a Python script that codifies this logical deduction, explaining each step and printing the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef solve_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the image\n    by identifying the knot and applying a key theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot from the image.\n    # The knot diagram provided is a standard representation of the 7_4 knot.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the knot: {knot_name}\")\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant mathematical property.\n    # A fundamental property of the Rasmussen s-invariant relates to slice knots.\n    # A knot K is 'slice' if it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball.\n    # Theorem: If a knot K is a slice knot, then its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is 0.\n    print(\"\\nRelevant Property: The Rasmussen invariant s(K) of any slice knot K is 0.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the property to the identified knot.\n    # The 7_4 knot is a known slice knot in knot theory.\n    print(f\"Fact: The knot {knot_name} is known to be a slice knot.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Deduce the invariant's value.\n    # Based on the theorem, we can conclude the value.\n    invariant_value = 0\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, because {knot_name} is a slice knot, its Rasmussen invariant must be 0.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {invariant_value}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
