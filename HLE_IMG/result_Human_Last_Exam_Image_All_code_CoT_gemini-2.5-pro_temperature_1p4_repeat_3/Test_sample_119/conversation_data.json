    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Mass Spectrum (MS) and IR Spectrum**\n*   **MS:** The molecular ion (M+) peak is at m/z 135. The odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule). Assuming one nitrogen, the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. A plausible molecular formula is C9H13N (9×12 + 13×1 + 14 = 135). The degree of unsaturation for C9H13N is 4, which is characteristic of a benzene ring. The mass spectrum shows a prominent peak at m/z 91 (tropylium/benzyl cation) and a base peak at m/z 44 ([CH3CH=NH2]+), which strongly suggests a 1-phenylpropan-2-amine structure.\n*   **IR:** The spectrum shows a doublet of sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2). Absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C-H), just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (aliphatic C-H), and at ~1600 & ~1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C) support the presence of a substituted benzene ring. Strong peaks around 700-750 cm⁻¹ suggest a monosubstituted ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze $^{13}C$ NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   The $^{13}C$ NMR shows 7 distinct signals, indicating some carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, consistent with the symmetry of a monosubstituted phenyl group.\n*   The signals are: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   Aromatic carbons (δ 100-150): The four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 correspond to the 6 carbons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary ipso-carbon and three pairs of equivalent CH carbons).\n*   Aliphatic carbons (δ 0-70): The three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 correspond to the 3-carbon side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** We are given one negative signal (CH2) and five positive signals (CH and CH3).\n    *   The quaternary carbon (δ 145.1) is invisible in DEPT.\n    *   The negative signal must correspond to a CH2 group. From the aliphatic shifts, this is δ 43.5.\n    *   The five positive signals are the three aromatic CH groups, plus one aliphatic CH and one CH3. Based on their shifts, δ 19.2 is the CH3, and δ 49.6 is the aliphatic CH.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $^1H$ NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **$^1H$ NMR:**\n    *   δ ~7.2 ppm (5H, multiplet): Protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n    *   δ ~2.9 ppm (1H, multiplet): An aliphatic CH proton.\n    *   δ ~2.7 ppm (2H, multiplet): An aliphatic CH2 group.\n    *   δ ~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet): A CH3 group adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   H(~1.2 ppm) correlates with C(19.2 ppm), confirming the -CH3 group.\n    *   H(~2.7 ppm) correlates with C(43.5 ppm), confirming the -CH2 group.\n    *   H(~2.9 ppm) correlates with C(49.6 ppm), confirming the -CH group.\n\n**Step 4: Structure Determination and IUPAC Name**\n*   The combined data indicates a structure with a phenyl group, a primary amine, a CH2 group, a CH group, and a CH3 group.\n*   The $^1H$ NMR shows a CH-CH3 fragment (1H multiplet and 3H doublet). The remaining fragment is a CH2.\n*   Two isomeric structures are possible: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3) and 2-phenylpropan-1-amine (C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2).\n*   The HSQC data is key to distinguish them. In 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, the CH carbon is bonded to the electron-withdrawing NH2 group, while the CH2 carbon is benzylic. In 2-phenylpropan-1-amine, the roles are reversed. Typically, a carbon bonded to nitrogen is more deshielded (higher ppm) than a benzylic carbon.\n*   Our data shows C(CH) = 49.6 ppm and C(CH2) = 43.5 ppm. Since the CH carbon has a higher chemical shift, it is the one attached to the nitrogen atom.\n*   This confirms the structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The longest chain with the principal functional group (amine) is a 3-carbon chain (propane). The amine is on carbon 2 (propan-2-amine). The phenyl substituent is on carbon 1. Therefore, the name is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the determined IUPAC name of the compound.\n    The structure was determined to be 1-phenylpropan-2-amine based on the analysis of\n    MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    iupac_name = \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\"\n    print(iupac_name)\n\nsolve_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
