    print("This points to a historical industrial process that involved mercury and is now considered unsafe.")
    print("The traditional method of making mirrors, from the 16th to the 19th century, involved coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam.")

    print("The word 'Mirror' successfully connects both parts of the riddle:")
    print("1. A reflective, mirror-like object (the trophy) is pictured.")
