    "Here is my plan to solve the riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will analyze the image and the date to identify the object or person represented by \"X Y\". The image shows a shiny, reflective award trophy being presented. A highly reflective surface is a key characteristic of a mirror.\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" I will research historical processes involving mercury salts that are now obsolete due to toxicity.\n3.  **Synthesize the clues:** I will find the word \"X Y\" that satisfies both clues. The historical process of making mirrors involved using a toxic tin-mercury amalgam. This process was hazardous and has been replaced by modern methods.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The word that fits both the visual clue (a reflective trophy) and the historical/chemical clue (an obsolete process using mercury salts) is \"Mirror\".\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to print this step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind the solution to the riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Redirect stdout to capture print output for the final display\n    old_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the first clue\")\n    print(\"The first clue is: 'X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.'\")\n    print(\"The image shows an awards ceremony where a man is receiving a shiny trophy.\")\n    print(\"The surface of the trophy is highly polished and reflective, much like a mirror.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the 'X Y' pictured could be described as a 'Mirror'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the second clue\")\n    print(\"The second clue is: 'Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.'\")\n    print(\"This points to a historical industrial process that involved mercury and is now considered unsafe.\")\n    print(\"The traditional method of making mirrors, from the 16th to the 19th century, involved coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam.\")\n    print(\"This process was extremely toxic to the workers due to mercury exposure and has been replaced by modern, safer methods like silvering.\")\n    print(\"So, the 'X Y' that used mercury salts is the 'Mirror'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"The word 'Mirror' successfully connects both parts of the riddle:\")\n    print(\"1. A reflective, mirror-like object (the trophy) is pictured.\")\n    print(\"2. The historical process of making mirrors used toxic mercury salts and is now obsolete.\")\n    \n    # Restore stdout\n    sys.stdout = old_stdout\n    \n    # Print the captured output\n    output_string = captured_output.getvalue()\n    print(output_string)\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    final_answer = \"Mirror\"\n    print(f\"The X Y is: {final_answer}\")\n    \nsolve_riddle()\n<<<Mirror>>>\n```"
