    "The plant in the image is most likely *Bencomia exstipulata*, a rare plant from the rose family. The most striking feature is the intricate, net-like pattern of the veins on the leaves. This particular species is critically endangered. My task is to identify the specific island to which this plant is endemic. Based on botanical records, *Bencomia exstipulata* is found exclusively on one of the Canary Islands. I will write a script to provide the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef find_endemic_island():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the plant and prints the name of the island \n  to which it is endemic.\n  The plant in the image is identified as Bencomia exstipulata.\n  This species is endemic to a single island in the Canary Islands archipelago.\n  \"\"\"\n  island_name = \"La Palma\"\n  print(island_name)\n\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<La Palma>>>"
