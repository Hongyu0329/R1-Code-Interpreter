    "My analysis of the chemical reaction is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Reagent A (Reaction 1 → 2):**\n    *   I will examine the structural change between compound **1** and compound **2**.\n    *   The most significant change is the formation of a new heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   This N-amino functional group (`-N-NH2`) is characteristic of a reaction involving hydrazine (`H2N-NH2`). Hydrazine is a common reagent used to introduce an N-amino group into heterocyclic systems, often by reacting with a suitable precursor like a xanthylium salt (which compound **1** resembles) or a diketone. Therefore, I identify reagent **A** as hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Identify Reagent B (Reaction 2 → 3):**\n    *   I will examine the transformation from compound **2** to compound **3**. Two distinct changes occur in a single step:\n        *   The N-amino group on one nitrogen atom is converted to an N-H group (deamination).\n        *   The N-H group on the other ring nitrogen is converted to an N-propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`).\n    *   A single reagent that can cause both transformations is an aldehyde. Specifically, a three-carbon aldehyde is required to add a propyl group.\n    *   The reagent is **propanal** (also known as propionaldehyde, `CH3CH2CHO`). The reaction proceeds via the formation of a hydrazone intermediate with the N-amino group, which then undergoes a complex rearrangement and fragmentation to alkylate the other nitrogen and cleave the N-N bond, eliminating the extra nitrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Construct the Final Output:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to print the names and chemical formulas of the identified reagents, clearly associating each reagent with its respective reaction step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    reagent_B_name = \"Propanal (Propionaldehyde)\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CHO\"\n\n    print(\"The required reagents for the reaction scheme are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    \n    # Description for the conversion of compound 1 to 2\n    print(\"For the reaction from compound 1 to compound 2:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A_name} (Formula: {reagent_A_formula})\")\n    \n    print(\"\") # for spacing\n    \n    # Description for the conversion of compound 2 to 3\n    print(\"For the reaction from compound 2 to compound 3:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B_name} (Formula: {reagent_B_formula})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is Propanal>>>"
