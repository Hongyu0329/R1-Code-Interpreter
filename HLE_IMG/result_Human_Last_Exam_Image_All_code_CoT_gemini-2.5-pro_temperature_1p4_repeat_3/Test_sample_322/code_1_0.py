  This function prints the 16-letter sequence corresponding to the analysis

  # The sequence is determined by analyzing each of the 16 plots.
  # For each plot, we identify the unique vortex by its color (R, G, B)
  # and relative strength (twice=Uppercase, half=lowercase).
  # My step-by-step analysis is as follows:
  # 1: G (Green, twice)
  # 2: B (Blue, twice)
  # 3: r (Red, half)
  # 4: b (Blue, half)
  # 5: R (Red, twice)
  # 6: G (Green, twice)
  # 7: b (Blue, half)
  # 8: r (Red, half)
  # 9: G (Green, twice)
  # 10: R (Red, twice)
  # 11: g (Green, half)
  # 12: b (Blue, half)
  # 13: B (Blue, twice)
  # 14: b (Blue, half)
  # 15: g (Green, half)
  # 16: B (Blue, twice)
