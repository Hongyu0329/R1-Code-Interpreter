    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected two-dimensional atomic pattern when a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal is viewed along the [110] direction. This involves projecting the atomic positions onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the FCC [110] projection:**\n    *   The FCC lattice has atoms at the corners and face centers of a cube.\n    *   Viewing along the [110] direction means we are looking at planes of atoms defined by the equation `x + y = constant`.\n    *   The projection of the 3D FCC lattice onto the plane normal to [110] (the (110) plane) results in a **centered rectangular** lattice.\n    *   The sides of this rectangle are defined by the lattice vectors in the plane, which are along the [001] and [1-10] directions. The lengths of the sides of the primitive rectangle are `a` and `a√2`, giving a side ratio of `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the given images:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows two columns of atoms. The atoms in the middle are shifted inwards, not forming a simple or centered rectangle. This pattern does not match.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows atoms arranged in a **centered parallelogram** pattern. A parallelogram is a general projection of a rectangle. We need to check if the properties match the FCC [110] projection.\n        *   Let's identify the unit cell. An atom at approximately `(3, 6)` acts as a center of symmetry.\n        *   Atoms at `(1, 3)` and `(5, 9)` are opposite corners of a parallelogram, with `(3, 6)` as their midpoint `((1+5)/2, (3+9)/2) = (3, 6)`.\n        *   Atoms at `(1, 5)` and `(5, 7)` are the other pair of corners, also with `(3, 6)` as their midpoint `((1+5)/2, (5+7)/2) = (3, 6)`.\n        *   The vertices of the parallelogram are therefore `(1, 3)`, `(1, 5)`, `(5, 9)`, and `(5, 7)`.\n        *   Let's calculate the side vectors and their lengths to check the ratio.\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms do not form a centered rectangular or parallelogram pattern. The arrangement appears somewhat hexagonal, which is characteristic of an FCC [111] projection.\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern has a rectangular unit cell with two atoms inside, instead of one at the center. This is the characteristic [110] projection of a **diamond cubic** structure (like Silicon or Germanium), which consists of two intertwined FCC lattices.\n\n3.  **Confirm Image B with calculations:**\n    I will write a Python script to calculate the lengths of the side vectors of the parallelogram identified in Image B and find their ratio. If the ratio is close to `√2`, it confirms that B is the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_pattern_b():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the properties of the crystal lattice pattern in image B.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From visual inspection of image B, we can identify a parallelogram unit cell\n    # with a centering atom.\n    # The four vertices of a unit parallelogram are at approximately:\n    P1 = (1, 3)\n    P2 = (1, 5) # One side vector is P2 - P1\n    P4 = (5, 7) # Another side vector is P4 - P1.
