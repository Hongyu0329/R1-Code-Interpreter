    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps to distinguish both species at a glance is the **curvature of the seta**.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **straight seta**. This means the stalk that supports the capsule is erect. The capsules themselves are ovoid, brown, and notably lack stomata at their base.\n\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by an **arcuate, or curved, seta**. This gives the capsule a bent or nodding appearance. The capsule is also described as being nearly always gymnostomous, meaning it lacks the tooth-like structure (peristome) around the mouth.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward feature to tell these two species apart when they have sporophytes is to observe whether the seta is straight or curved. Identification keys for the genus *Grimmia* often use the straight versus curved nature of the seta as a primary diagnostic character to separate species.\n\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
