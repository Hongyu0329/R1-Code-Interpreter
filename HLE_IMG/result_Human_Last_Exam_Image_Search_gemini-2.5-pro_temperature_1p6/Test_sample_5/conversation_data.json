    "This sheet music is from the song \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\". It is the theme song for the character Flandre Scarlet from the sixth Touhou Project game, *Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*. The song was composed by ZUN, who has implied it was his favorite from that game's soundtrack. The title, along with one of Flandre's spell cards in the game, is a reference to Agatha Christie's novel *And Then There Were None*. The theme is incredibly popular and has been rearranged numerous times, particularly for complex and energetic piano versions.\n\n<<<U.N. Owen Was Her?>>>"
