    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified by the designation **Sö 281**.\n\nThis runestone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were erected to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription on Sö 281 is fragmented but mentions Ingvar and \"Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens), which was the destination of the expedition. The distinctive grid pattern seen in the image is a notable feature of this particular stone.\n\nThe fragment is part of the runestone that is now embedded in the wall of the Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. The runes visible in the provided image include `IKUARI`, the name \"Ingvar\" in Old Norse.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
