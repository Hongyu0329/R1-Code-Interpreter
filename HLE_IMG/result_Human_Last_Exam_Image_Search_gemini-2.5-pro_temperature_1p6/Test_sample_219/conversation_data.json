    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, here are the identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts and the calculation of the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**1. Identification of Synchronized Bursts**\n\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense vertical lines of firing activity across a large number of electrodes. From the graph, we can identify four distinct bursts.\n\n**2. Timestamps of Bursts**\n\nBy examining the x-axis (Time in seconds), the approximate start times of these synchronized bursts are:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~35 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~48 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals**\n\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time difference between the onsets of consecutive bursts.\n*   **IBI 1:** 16 s - 2 s = 14 s\n*   **IBI 2:** 35 s - 16 s = 19 s\n*   **IBI 3:** 48 s - 35 s = 13 s\n\n**4. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval**\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of the calculated intervals.\n*   **Average IBI** = (14 s + 19 s + 13 s) / 3 = 46 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives **15 s**.\n\n<<<15>>>"
