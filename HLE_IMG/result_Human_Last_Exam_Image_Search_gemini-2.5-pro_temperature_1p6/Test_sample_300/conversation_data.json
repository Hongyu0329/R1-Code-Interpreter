    "Based on my analysis of the artworks and the search results, here are the authors of the nine works, from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n***\n\n1.  **He Jiaying (何家英):** The first painting is in the *gongbi* style, a meticulous realist technique in Chinese painting. The artist is known for his contemporary take on this traditional form, often depicting elegant female figures. This specific style and subject matter are characteristic of He Jiaying.\n2.  **Pan Tianshou (潘天寿):** This expressive, abstract ink wash landscape is characteristic of Pan Tianshou, a master of 20th-century Chinese painting. He was known for his powerful brushwork and dynamic compositions that balanced opposing forces. His work often included landscapes as well as flower-and-bird paintings.\n3.  **Lin Sanzhi (林散之):** This piece is an example of cursive script calligraphy. Lin Sanzhi was a renowned 20th-century master of this style, often referred to as the \"contemporary grass saint.\" His calligraphy is noted for its strength, variation in speed, and magnificent, bold style.\n4.  **Mao Zedong (毛泽东):** This calligraphy is a famous work by Mao Zedong. It features his poem \"Ode to the Plum Blossom,\" written in December 1961. Mao's calligraphy style, known as \"Mao-style\" (Maoti), is distinctive and has become popular in its own right.\n5.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊):** This oil painting is a well-known work from 1984 by the artist Jin Shangyi, titled \"The Young Singer\" (or \"Giovane Cantante\"). The model for the painting was Peng Liyuan, who would later become the First Lady of China. The work is considered a significant piece in the development of Chinese neoclassical oil painting.\n6.  **He Jiaying (何家英):** This painting of a woman with an elaborate headdress, surrounded by birds, is another work by He Jiaying. His art often blends traditional Chinese themes and techniques with a modern aesthetic, a style evident in this piece.\n7.  **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中):** The vibrant, colorful depiction of a rural courtyard with hanging gourds and laundry is a signature work of Wu Guanzhong. He was a master of integrating Western oil painting techniques with traditional Chinese ink painting, and his works often feature the landscapes and scenery of the Jiangnan region.\n8.  **Li Keran (李可染):** While the initial search results for \"landscape painting with red boats\" pointed to Claude Monet, the style is definitively Chinese. This landscape, with its layered ink washes, dramatic mountains, and fleets of red-sailed boats, is characteristic of the 20th-century master Li Keran. He is famously associated with this subject matter and style, which revitalized Chinese landscape painting.\n9.  **Lou Shibai (娄师白):** The final painting of a lobster is by Lou Shibai, a student of the great master Qi Baishi. While Qi Baishi was famous for his depictions of shrimp, Lou Shibai was known for his paintings of ducklings and also adeptly painted other subjects in the style of his teacher, including shrimp and lobsters.\n\n<<<1.
