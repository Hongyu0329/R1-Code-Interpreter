    "Based on the analysis of the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify and count the distinct splice species. Each unique band in the PCR gels represents a different messenger RNA (mRNA) splice variant.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the species identified from each experiment:\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This experiment reveals two bands (190 bp and 159 bp). This indicates the presence of **two** distinct splice species in the early region between the E1 and E4 genes.\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). Since the same forward primer (E1F1) is used as in panel B, and the size difference between the bands is consistent (31 bp), these bands likely represent the same two splice species identified in Panel B, amplified with a reverse primer further downstream. Therefore, this panel confirms the existence of the first two species but does not add new ones.\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This experiment uses a splice-specific forward primer (E1F2) and shows one band (551 bp). This identifies **one** new splice species containing the specific 929^3465 splice junction.\n4.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** The single band of 1,005 bp represents **one** additional, distinct splice species that spans from the E1 to the L2 region.\n5.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** The single band (972 bp) is amplified with the splice-specific E1F2 primer. It represents a transcript containing the 929^3465 splice junction that extends into the L2 region, making it distinct from the species in Panel D (which terminates earlier) and Panel E (which uses a different splice). This accounts for **one** more species.\n6.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This experiment uses another splice-specific primer (E1F3 for the 929^3506 junction) and yields two bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). These represent **two** distinct species that share the 929^3506 splice but differ in a subsequent splicing event.\n7.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This more sensitive assay reveals the full complexity of late transcripts. It shows four distinct bands (450, 419, 378, and 187 bp). Each band represents a unique late splice species. This adds **four** more species to our count. (Panel H is a less sensitive version of this experiment and is superseded by Panel I).\n\nTallying the unique species identified from these experiments:\n*   Panel B: 2 species\n*   Panel D: 1 species\n*   Panel E: 1 species\n*   Panel F: 1 species\n*   Panel G: 2 species\n*   Panel I: 4 species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 distinct splice species identifiable from the provided image.\n\n<<<11>>>"
