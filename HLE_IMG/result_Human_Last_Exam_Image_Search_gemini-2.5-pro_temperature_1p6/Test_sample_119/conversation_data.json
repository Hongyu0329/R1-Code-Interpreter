    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrum (MS)\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a compound with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   A plausible molecular formula that matches this mass is **C₉H₁₃N**: (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135.\n*   The **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2950 cm⁻¹:** Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from aliphatic (saturated) carbons.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹, ~1495 cm⁻¹, ~1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Bending vibrations in this region often suggest a mono-substituted benzene ring.\n*   A weak, somewhat broad signal is barely visible around 3400 cm⁻¹, which could be an N-H stretch from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, ~5H):** This is a classic signal for the five protons on a mono-substituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   The remaining protons (13 - 5 = 8) belong to the C₃H₈N side chain. Let's analyze the aliphatic region:\n    *   **~2.7-2.9 ppm (complex multiplet, total integration ~3H):** This region likely contains signals for a methine (-CH) proton and methylene (-CH₂) protons.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** The splitting pattern (doublet) and integration (3H) strongly suggest a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   The signals are consistent with a **1-phenyl-2-propyl** fragment: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n    *   **C₆H₅- (5H):** Signal at 7.2 ppm.\n    *   **-CH₃ (3H):** Signal at 1.2 ppm. It is a doublet because it's coupled to the adjacent -CH proton.\n    *   **-CH- (1H):** This single proton is coupled to both the -CH₂ group and the -CH₃ group, resulting in a complex multiplet. This signal is part of the multiplet around 2.7-2.9 ppm.\n    *   **-CH₂- (2H):** These two protons are coupled to the -CH proton, also resulting in a complex multiplet in the 2.7-2.9 ppm region.\n    *   **-NH₂ (2H):** The remaining two protons belong to the amine group. These protons are often broad and may not be clearly visible or integrated, which accounts for the discrepancy in total integration (5+3+1+2=11 vs 13 total H).\n\n### 4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra\n*   **¹³C Signals:** Seven signals are provided: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   The molecular formula C₉H₁₃N has nine carbons, but only seven signals are observed. This indicates that some carbons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. For a mono-substituted phenyl group, the *ortho* carbons and *meta* carbons often have very similar chemical shifts and may overlap, reducing the expected six aromatic signals to four. (6 carbons -> 4 signals) + (3 aliphatic carbons) = **7 signals total**. This matches the data.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** One negative signal (indicating one -CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating five -CH or -CH₃ groups).\n    *   **Negative signal:** The proposed structure has one -CH₂ group. The carbon at **43.5 ppm** can be assigned to this group. This matches the data.\n    *   **Positive signals:** The discrepancy (5 positive signals reported vs. 7 expected from the structure: 5 aromatic CH + 1 aliphatic CH + 1 aliphatic CH₃) is likely due to an error in the provided data or unusual signal overlap, as all other spectral data points strongly to this structure.\n*   **HSQC Spectrum:** This 2D spectrum confirms the connections between protons and the carbons they are attached to:\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-128 ppm).\n    *   The multiplet protons (~2.7-2.9 ppm) correlate with the aliphatic carbons at ~50 ppm (the CH group) and ~43 ppm (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The doublet protons (~1.2 ppm) correlate with the aliphatic carbon at ~19 ppm (the CH₃ group).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll spectroscopic evidence points towards a single structure. The mass spectrum and ¹H NMR confirm a mono-substituted phenyl ring attached to a C₃H₈N chain. The splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR and the carbon data from ¹³C, DEPT, and HSQC are all consistent with the same isomer.\n\nThe structure is:\n*   A propane chain.\n*   An amine group on carbon 2 (-propan-2-amine).\n*   A phenyl group on carbon 1 (1-phenyl-).\n\nCombining these parts gives the IUPAC name.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
