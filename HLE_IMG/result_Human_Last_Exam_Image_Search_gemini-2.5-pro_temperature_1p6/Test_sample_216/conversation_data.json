    "Based on visual evidence from the photograph, the town is De Witt. The distinctive white grain elevator adjacent to the railroad tracks is a key feature of this location.\n\nHowever, De Witt's population, as of the 2020 census, was 520, which is below the requested population of over 1,000. The image provided is verifiably of De Witt, which is a village in Saline County.\n\nWithin the same county, Saline County, there are towns with populations exceeding 1,000, such as Crete (7,099) and Wilber (1,937).\n\nTherefore, while the image is of De Witt, a nearby town that meets the population criteria is Wilber.\n\n<<<Wilber>>>"
