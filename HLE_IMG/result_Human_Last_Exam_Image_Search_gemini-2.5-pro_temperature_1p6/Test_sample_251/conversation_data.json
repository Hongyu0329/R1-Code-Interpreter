    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, a systematic approach is required:\n\n**1. Understand the ECG Paper Speed:**\nThe ECG strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. On a standard ECG grid, this means:\n*   Each small square (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large square (5 mm) represents 0.20 seconds.\n\n**2. Identify the R-waves and R-R Intervals:**\nThe R-wave is the most prominent upward spike in the QRS complex, which represents ventricular contraction. The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n**3. Locate the Longest R-R Interval:**\nVisually scanning the entire rhythm strip reveals several pauses. The most significant pause occurs on the fourth line of the tracing, starting after the first QRS complex on that line.\n\n**4. Measure the Longest Interval:**\nTo measure this interval, we count the number of large squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define the pause.\n\n*   The R-wave before the pause and the R-wave after the pause are separated by approximately 9 large squares.\n*   The first R-peak on that line aligns almost perfectly with a heavy vertical grid line, and the next R-peak also aligns closely with a heavy grid line 9 large squares away.\n\n**5. Calculate the Duration:**\nThe duration in seconds is calculated by multiplying the number of large squares by the time per large square.\n*   Calculation: 9 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.8 seconds.\n\nThe longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is therefore 1.8 seconds.\n\n<<<1.8>>>"
