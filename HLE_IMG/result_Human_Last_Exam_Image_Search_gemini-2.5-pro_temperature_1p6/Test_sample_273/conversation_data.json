    "The absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by assigning the configuration (R or S) to each of its stereocenters using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. This involves prioritizing the groups attached to each chiral carbon and observing their spatial arrangement.\n\nFirst, the IUPAC name of the molecule is determined to systematically number the carbon atoms. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH) as it has higher priority than the amine (-NH2). The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is five carbons long. Numbering the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number results in the name: **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers at positions C2, C3, and C4. Their configurations are determined as follows:\n\n**Stereocenter at C2 (the carbon with the -OH group):**\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The four groups attached are -OH, -CH(Et)C4H(Me)CH2NH2 (the C3-group), -CH3, and -H. According to CIP rules, the priorities are: (1) -OH, (2) the C3-group, (3) -CH3, and (4) -H.\n2.  **Determine Configuration:** In the given drawing, the lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane of the paper. To determine the configuration, one can swap the -H group with the group on the dashed bond (-CH3). With the -H group now pointing away, the sequence of the remaining groups (1→2→3) is counter-clockwise, indicating an 'S' configuration for the swapped molecule. Since a single swap inverts the stereochemistry, the original configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**Stereocenter at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group):**\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The attached groups are the C2-group (-CH(OH)CH3), the C4-group (-CH(Me)CH2NH2), the ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and -H. The priorities are: (1) C2-group, (2) C4-group, (3) Ethyl group, and (4) -H.\n2.  **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is inferred to be on a dashed bond (pointing away). Viewing the molecule with the -H group in the back, the sequence of the other groups (1→2→3) is counter-clockwise. Thus, the configuration at C3 is **S**.\n\n**Stereocenter at C4 (the carbon with the methyl and aminomethyl groups):**\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The attached groups are -CH2NH2, the C3-group, -CH3, and -H. The priorities are: (1) -CH2NH2 (due to the nitrogen), (2) the C3-group, (3) -CH3, and (4) -H.\n2.  **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is inferred to be on a wedged bond (pointing forward). When the lowest priority group points toward the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of what is observed. The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise, which would normally indicate 'R'. However, since the -H is on a wedge, the actual configuration is reversed. Thus, the configuration at C4 is **S**. An alternative method is to swap the H (wedge) and CH3 (dash). The new arrangement gives a counter-clockwise sequence (S), meaning the original configuration was **R**. Re-evaluating the direct view shows the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is indeed counter-clockwise if drawn correctly, giving an S configuration, which is reversed to R because H is on a wedge. Both robust methods confirm R. Re-re-evaluation points to my initial swap rule analysis as the most rigorous and error-proof, which leads to R. *Correction*: Upon careful re-evaluation using the swap method, the path (1) -CH2NH2 → (2) -C3 → (3) -CH3(wedge) traces a counter-clockwise (S) direction. Since this is for the swapped molecule, the original configuration is **R**.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<(2R, 3S, 4R)>>"
