    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node \\\\(a_0\\\\), we must first find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, \\\\(R_{th}\\\\), seen by the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency, \\\\(f_c\\\\), for this RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n\n\\\\(f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C}\\\\)\n\nIn terms of angular frequency, \\\\(\\omega_c\\\\):\n\n\\\\(\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}\\\\)\n\nTo find the Thevenin resistance, the input voltage source `IN` at node \\\\(c_0\\\\) is set to zero, which means node \\\\(c_0\\\\) is grounded. We then need to calculate the resistance between node \\\\(a_0\\\\) (also labeled \\\\(d_0\\\\)) and ground (node \\\\(b_0\\\\)). Since \\\\(c_0\\\\) is now also at ground potential, this is equivalent to finding the input resistance of the infinite ladder network between terminals \\\\(a_0\\\\) and \\\\(c_0\\\\).\n\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder composed of repeating sections. Each section consists of a resistor `r` on the top rail (e.g., between \\\\(c_{n-1}\\\\) and \\\\(c_n\\\\)), a resistor `r` on the bottom rail (e.g., between \\\\(d_{n-1}\\\\) and \\\\(d_n\\\\)), and a shunt resistor `r` connecting the two rails (e.g., between \\\\(c_n\\\\) and \\\\(d_n\\\\)).\n\nLet \\\\(R_L\\\\) be the characteristic resistance of this infinite ladder, as seen looking into any pair of terminals (\\\\(c_n\\\\), \\\\(d_n\\\\)) towards the rest of the network. Due to the infinite and repeating nature of the ladder, this resistance remains the same regardless of which section we look into. We can write a self-consistency equation for \\\\(R_L\\\\): the resistance looking into one section is equal to the resistance of the first shunt resistor `r` in parallel with the series combination of the top rail resistor `r`, the bottom rail resistor `r`, and the rest of the ladder (which has a resistance of \\\\(R_L\\\\)).\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\\\[ R_L = r \\parallel (r + r + R_L) = r \\parallel (2r + R_L) \\\\]\n\nThis parallel combination can be written as:\n\\\\[ R_L = \\frac{r(2r + R_L)}{r + (2r + R_L)} = \\frac{2r^2 + rR_L}{3r + R_L} \\\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\\\(R_L\\\\):\n\\\\[ R_L(3r + R_L) = 2r^2 + rR_L \\\\]\n\\\\[ 3rR_L + R_L^2 = 2r^2 + rR_L \\\\]\n\\\\[ R_L^2 + 2rR_L - 2r^2 = 0 \\\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for \\\\(R_L\\\\). Using the quadratic formula, \\\\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\):\n\\\\[ R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} \\\\]\n\\\\[ R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} \\\\]\n\\\\[ R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\]\n\\\\[ R_L = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}) \\\\]\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n\\\\[ R_L = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) \\\\]\n\nThis characteristic resistance \\\\(R_L\\\\) is the Thevenin equivalent resistance \\\\(R_{th}\\\\) seen at node \\\\(a_0\\\\).\n\\\\[ R_{th} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) \\\\]\n\nFinally, we can determine the cutoff frequency. The question asks for the cutoff frequency without specifying angular (radians per second) or ordinary (Hertz) frequency. Typically, the expression is given in terms of angular frequency \\\\(\\omega_c\\\\) as it is mathematically simpler.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency \\\\(\\omega_c\\\\) is:\n\\\\[ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)C} \\\\]\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, \\\\(f_c\\\\), is:\n\\\\[ f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)C} \\\\]\n\nBoth expressions are valid representations of the cutoff frequency. We will provide the angular frequency.\n\n<<<\\\\(\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{C r (\\sqrt{3}-1)}\\\\)>>>"
