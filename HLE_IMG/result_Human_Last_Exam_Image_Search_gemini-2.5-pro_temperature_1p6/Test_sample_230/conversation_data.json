    "The title of the 19th-century painting, a fragment of which is presented, is \"The Burning Mill\" (also known as \"A mill on fire on a riverbank, by moonlight\") by the Dutch artist Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate.\n\nThe artwork depicts a dramatic nighttime scene where a windmill is engulfed in flames under a dark, cloudy sky, with a visible patch of lighter sky. The fire illuminates the surrounding buildings and landscape. Ten Cate, a 19th-century artist, was well-known for his cityscapes under the moonlight.\n\nSeveral artists have painted scenes of burning windmills. For instance, the 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painter Egbert van der Poel was known for his depictions of fires, including \"A Burning Mill At Night With Villagers Scrambling To Extinguish The Fire\". Another artist, Adriaen Lievensz. van der Poel, also painted a piece titled \"The windmill fire\" in the 17th century. However, the specific style and composition of the provided fragment align most closely with the work of Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate.\n\nIt is worth noting that the famous Flemish painter Jan Brueghel the Elder, who was active in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, was also known for his detailed landscapes, and his brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was nicknamed \"Hell Brueghel\" for his depictions of fire, though some of these works are now reattributed to Jan. While Jan Brueghel the Elder did paint windmills, such as in \"The Mill by the Landing Stage,\" the style is distinct from the image in question.\n\n<<<The Burning Mill>>>"
