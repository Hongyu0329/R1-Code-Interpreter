    "The figure leaving the chariot is Eriphyle, being murdered by her son, Alcmaeon. This specific scene is depicted on an Apulian red-figure pelike (a type of jar) dated to around 360â€“350 B.C. and attributed to the Painter of the Dublin Situla.\n\nThis dramatic vase painting illustrates a tragic episode from Greek mythology concerning the expedition of the Seven Against Thebes. Eriphyle was the wife of Amphiaraus, a seer who knew the military campaign against Thebes was doomed to fail and therefore refused to participate. However, Polynices, who was leading the expedition, bribed Eriphyle with the cursed Necklace of Harmonia to persuade her husband to join the war.\n\nKnowing his wife's treachery would lead to his death, Amphiaraus instructed his sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus, to avenge him by killing their mother. After Amphiaraus died in battle as he had foreseen, Alcmaeon fulfilled his father's command and killed Eriphyle.\n\nIn the vase painting:\n*   **The figure leaving the chariot** is Eriphyle.\n*   **The driver of the chariot** is her son, Alcmaeon, enacting his revenge.\n*   **The figure on the ground** is likely a casualty in Alcmaeon's matricidal rage.\n*   **The winged figure above** is Nike, the goddess of Victory, symbolizing the grim fulfillment of Alcmaeon's vow to his father.\n\nFor the act of matricide, Alcmaeon was famously tormented by the Erinyes (the Furies).\n\n<<<Eriphyle>>>"
