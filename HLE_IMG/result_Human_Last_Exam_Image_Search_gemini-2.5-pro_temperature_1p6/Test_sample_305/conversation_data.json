    "The product with a French-derived name is **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring World War II, the British cosmetics company Bourjois, which has French origins, launched an advertising campaign for its face powder. The campaign, which included the \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" slogan, targeted the millions of women who had joined the workforce to support the war effort. The advertisements acknowledged that war work required more from women than they were used to and claimed that using Bourjois cosmetics would help them \"overcome this inherent limitation\" by giving them \"the full confidence and poise\" needed for their new roles.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
