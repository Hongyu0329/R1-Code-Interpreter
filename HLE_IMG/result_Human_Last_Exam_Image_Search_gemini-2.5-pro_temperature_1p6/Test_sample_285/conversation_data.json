    "A Delaunay triangulation is a specific way of connecting a set of points to form triangles. Its defining characteristic is the **empty circle property**. This property states that for any triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (the circumcircle) must not contain any other points from the set in its interior. An equivalent way to check this, particularly for two adjacent triangles, is that the fourth vertex must not lie inside the circumcircle of the first triangle.\n\nBased on this property, we can analyze the given triangulations:\n\n*   **Triangulation A:** This triangulation violates the empty circle property. Consider the four points in the center that form a convex quadrilateral. The horizontal edge connects two opposite vertices. If you were to draw the circumcircle for the lower central triangle, the top vertex of the upper central triangle would lie inside it. This means the triangulation is not Delaunay.\n\n*   **Triangulation B:** This triangulation appears to be a valid Delaunay triangulation. For every triangle, the circumcircle seems to be empty of any other points. The triangles are relatively \"well-shaped,\" which is a common characteristic of Delaunay triangulations as they tend to maximize the minimum angle of all triangles.\n\n*   **Triangulation C:** This triangulation clearly violates the empty circle property. Notice the large triangle formed by the top vertex and the two bottom vertices. Another point from the set is visibly located inside this triangle. Since the point is inside the triangle, it must also be inside the triangle's circumcircle. Therefore, this is not a Delaunay triangulation.\n\n*   **Triangulation D:** This is not a valid triangulation. A triangulation is a planar graph, meaning its edges cannot cross. In this image, multiple edges intersect.\n\nTherefore, both triangulations A and C violate the empty circle property.\n\n<<<A,C>>>"
