    "This reaction is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically the friedelane-oleanane backbone rearrangement. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the molecular shifts to determine the final substituents.\n\n1.  **Initiation**: The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the starting material (friedelan-3β-ol) by the catalytic acid (HCl). This forms a good leaving group, water (H₂O).\n2.  **Carbocation Formation**: The water molecule leaves, generating a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n3.  **Cascade of Shifts**: This initial carbocation triggers a cascade of seven consecutive shifts of neighboring methyl groups (CH₃) and hydride ions (H⁻). The rearrangement proceeds in a way that moves the positive charge across the carbon skeleton, ultimately leading to a more stable tertiary carbocation from which a stable alkene can be formed.\n\nThe sequence of shifts is as follows:\n*   A methyl group shifts from C-4 to C-3.\n*   A methyl group shifts from C-5 to C-4.\n*   A hydride (H) shifts from C-10 to C-5.\n*   A methyl group shifts from C-9 to C-10.\n*   A hydride (H) shifts from C-8 to C-9.\n*   A methyl group shifts from C-14 to C-8.\n*   A methyl group shifts from C-13 to C-14.\n\n4.  **Final Carbocation**: This cascade ends with the positive charge located at the C-13 position.\n5.  **Elimination**: A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-18, forming a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18. This final product is known as olean-13(18)-ene.\n\nBy tracking the original positions of the methyl groups and hydrogens through this rearrangement, we can determine the substituents at the indicated positions in the final product:\n\n*   **Position 1**: This corresponds to the methyl group at C-4. In the starting material, C-4 had two methyl groups. During the rearrangement, one of them moves to C-3, but the other remains. This position thus retains a methyl group. So, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2**: This is the group at C-10. The original hydrogen at C-10 migrated away. However, C-10 receives a methyl group that shifts from C-9. Therefore, this position is occupied by a methyl group. So, **2 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 3**: This is the group at C-8. C-8 initially has a hydrogen, which migrates to C-9. Subsequently, a methyl group shifts from C-14 to C-8. So, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4**: This is the group at C-14. The original methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8. It is then replaced by a methyl group shifting from C-13. Thus, this position is occupied by a methyl group. So, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5**: This is the group at C-9. The original methyl group at C-9 migrates to C-10. This position then receives a hydrogen that migrates from C-8. Therefore, the substituent at this position is a hydrogen atom. So, **5 = H**.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
