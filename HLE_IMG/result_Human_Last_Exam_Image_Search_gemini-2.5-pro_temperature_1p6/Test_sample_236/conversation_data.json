    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is a Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis insect is also known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It is a common species of soldier beetle found throughout North America, particularly in the Midwest. The name comes from its frequent presence on goldenrod flowers and its red and black coloration, which was thought to resemble 17th and 18th-century British military uniforms.\n\nAdult Goldenrod Soldier Beetles are active in the late summer and early fall, which coincides with the blooming period of goldenrod. They are beneficial insects that feed on pollen, nectar, and various garden pests like aphids. They are considered important pollinators and are harmless to humans and plants.\n\n<<<Chauliognathus pensylvanicus>>>"
