    "The image displays a leafy liverwort characterized by its small size and intricately structured, overlapping leaves. This particular appearance, often described as scaly, is a hallmark of the genus *Frullania*.\n\nKey features that point to this identification include:\n*   **Leaf Arrangement:** *Frullania* species have two rows of larger dorsal leaves and a third, smaller row of underleaves on the ventral side. The larger leaves are bilobed, with a bigger upper lobe and a smaller, often helmet-shaped, lower lobule that can store water.\n*   **Appearance:** The plants typically grow in dense, often reddish-brown or green mats, closely pressed against surfaces like tree bark. The overlapping, rounded leaves give them a distinctive scaly look.\n*   **Habitat:** *Frullania* are commonly found as epiphytes on trees and rocks in a variety of environments, from tropical forests to temperate woodlands.\n\nWhile other leafy liverworts like *Radula* also have overlapping leaves, they are distinguished by the absence of underleaves. The bryophyte in the picture clearly exhibits the complex, three-ranked leaf structure that is characteristic of the *Frullania* genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
