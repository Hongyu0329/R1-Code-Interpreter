    "This image displays the crystal structure of the **Invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB)** from the bacterium *Shigella flexneri*.\n\nIpaB is a key virulence factor for *Shigella*, the bacterium responsible for causing shigellosis, a form of severe dysentery. This protein plays a crucial, multifunctional role in the infection process. It is a central component of the bacterium's type III secretion system (T3SS), a molecular syringe used to inject bacterial proteins directly into human cells.\n\nKey functions of IpaB include:\n*   **Forming a translocon pore:** Along with another protein, IpaC, IpaB inserts itself into the host cell membrane, creating a channel through which other bacterial effector proteins are delivered into the host cell's cytoplasm.\n*   **Host cell invasion:** It is essential for the initial invasion of epithelial cells.\n*   **Phagosome escape:** After being engulfed by immune cells like macrophages, IpaB helps the bacteria escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm.\n*   **Inducing cell death:** IpaB can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in macrophages by interacting with caspase-1. This process contributes to the intense inflammation characteristic of shigellosis.\n\nThe structure shown, with its distinct domains, is crucial for these functions. The protein's N-terminal region is important for its stability and proper structure. The image provided corresponds to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1P9S, which details the crystallographic structure of this protein.\n\n<<<Invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB)>>>"
