    "The Ancient Greek word in the manuscript is **αὔριον**.\n\nThis word is an adverb that means \"tomorrow\" or \"soon\". It is a common word found in Ancient Greek literature. The accent on the first syllable is a circumflex, which in later Greek pronunciation would have been pronounced as a simple high pitch, but in the classical period indicated a rising and then falling pitch on the diphthong. The form in the manuscript is a minuscule script, which became common in Byzantine manuscripts from the 9th century onwards.\n\n<<<αὔριον>>>"
