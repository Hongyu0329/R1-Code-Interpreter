    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the checkmate in two moves:\n\n**Move 1: White plays Rook captures pawn on f4, delivering a check (Rxf4+).**\n\nThis first move forces Black into one of two possible responses, both of which lead to checkmate on the next turn. The Rook on f3 captures the black pawn on f4.\n\nBlack has two legal moves to get out of check:\n\n*   **Variation 1: Black King captures the Rook (Kxf4)**\n    If Black's King captures the white Rook on f4, the King is now positioned on f4. White's second move is:\n    *   **Move 2: Queen to d1, checkmate (Qd1#).**\n        The white Queen moves to d1, placing the black King in check. The King has no escape squares:\n        *   e3 and f5 are covered by the Queen on d1.\n        *   g3 is covered by the Bishop on g2.\n        *   g4 is covered by the white King on h4.\n        *   g5 is covered by the Rook on h5.\n        *   e5 is blocked by Black's own pawn.\n\n*   **Variation 2: Black King moves to d3 (Kd3)**\n    If the Black King evades the check by moving to d3, White's second move is:\n    *   **Move 2: Queen to d4, checkmate (Qd4#).**\n        The white Queen moves from a4 to d4, checking the black King. The King on d3 has no escape squares:\n        *   c2, c4, d2, and e2 are all covered by the Queen on d4.\n        *   c3 is covered by the Bishop on g2.\n        *   d4, e3, and e4 are all covered by the Rook on f4.\n\nIn both variations, White delivers a checkmate on the second move.\n\n<<<1. Rxf4+\nIf 1...Kxf4, 2. Qd1#\nIf 1...Kd3, 2. Qd4#>>>"
