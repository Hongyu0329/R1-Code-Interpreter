    "The erasure poem sequence adheres to the form of an **American Haiku**.\n\nThe image is a page from the book *A Little White Shadow* by poet Mary Ruefle. In this book, Ruefle creates poems by \"erasing\" or whiting out most of the text of an obscure 19th-century novel of the same name. The creative process is erasure, but the resulting poem has its own distinct form.\n\nThe four-line stanza, or quatrain, in question reads:\n\n> a vortex\n> form's like a dance\n> ghostly velum\n> nacreous wavers\n\nWhile this poem is a four-line stanza (quatrain), its poetic characteristics align with those of a modern American Haiku. Here is a breakdown of the form:\n\n*   **Structure:** Traditional Japanese haiku consists of three phrases with a 5, 7, 5 syllable pattern. This poem deviates from that with four lines and a syllable count of 3, 4, 4, 4. However, contemporary American haiku often prioritizes capturing a fleeting moment over adhering to a strict syllable count.\n*   **Content and Imagery:** The poem focuses on a single, evocative image from natureâ€”the movement of a jellyfish, described with words like \"velum,\" \"dance,\" and the iridescent \"nacreous.\" This focus on a natural moment is a core tenet of haiku.\n*   **Juxtaposition and Brevity:** Like a traditional haiku, which often uses a \"cutting word\" (*kireji*) to create a pause or juxtaposition, Ruefle's line breaks create distinct, layered images that build upon one another to form a single, complex perception. Critics note that Ruefle's short, sparse erasure poems recall the conciseness of haiku.\n\n<<<American Haiku>>>"
