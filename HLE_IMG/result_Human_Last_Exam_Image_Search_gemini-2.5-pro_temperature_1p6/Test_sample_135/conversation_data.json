    "The detail of the altarpiece shown in the image is a work by the Italian Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano.\n\nThis marble relief is part of the \"Altar of the Sacrament\" or \"Tabernacle of the Sacrament,\" located in the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence, Italy. The work is considered a masterpiece of 15th-century decorative sculpture.\n\nDesiderio da Settignano (c. 1430â€“1464) was a Florentine sculptor known for his refined skill in carving marble, particularly his use of low relief (*rilievo stiacciato*), a technique also employed by Donatello. He came from a family of stone carvers and was enrolled in Florence's guild of Stone and Woodworkers in 1453.\n\nThe tabernacle was created around 1461, although its installation may have taken longer. The entire altar complex includes the central tabernacle, figures of angels, and other reliefs. The history of the altarpiece is complex, as it has been moved and reconfigured multiple times since its original installation.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
