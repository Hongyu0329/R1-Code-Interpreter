    "The two clues lead to the \"Ted Lindsay Award.\"\n\n**The Event:** The man pictured receiving the award is Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. In the photo, he is receiving the Ted Lindsay Award, which is given annually to the \"Most Outstanding Player\" in the NHL as voted by fellow players.\n\n**The Historical Process:** The clue about a process using toxic mercury salts refers to the daguerreotype, an early form of photography invented by Louis Daguerre in 1839. This process used heated mercury vapor to develop the image on a silver-plated copper sheet. Due to the high toxicity of mercury, this process is no longer in common use.\n\nThe \"X Y\" that links these two facts is the name \"Lindsay.\" In the prompt, \"X\" is Ted and \"Y\" is Lindsay, but the core linking word is Lindsay, a name that is part of both the person's name (Ted Lindsay) and the daguerreotype inventor's name (Louis Daguerre). However, the intended puzzle answer connects the award name with a similar-sounding historical name tied to a mercury process.\n\n<<<Ted Lindsay Award>>>"
