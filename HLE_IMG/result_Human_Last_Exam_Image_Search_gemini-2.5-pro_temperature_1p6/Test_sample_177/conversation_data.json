    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### 1. Understanding VMT Calculation\nVehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is calculated by multiplying the number of trips by the average distance of those trips. To find the total VMT, we will calculate a weighted average VMT based on the data provided for each distance category.\n\nFor each distance category, the calculation is:\n*Relative VMT = (Share of Total Trips) × (Car Mode Share) × (Average Trip Distance)*\n\nThe \"Car Mode Share\" is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n### 2. Calculate Baseline Car VMT\nUsing the data from **Table 1 (Baseline)**:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Relative Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### 3. Calculate Proposed Car VMT\nUsing the data from **Table 2 (Proposed)**:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Relative Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n*((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100*\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction in Car VMT is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
