    "The image illustrates the process of vegetative cell fusion, a wound-healing mechanism, in a filamentous alga, likely a red alga from the genus *Griffithsia*.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process as seen in the panels:\n*   **Panel L:** Shows the initial state of two adjacent, healthy cells in the filament, separated by a cross-wall or septum (indicated by the arrowhead).\n*   **Panel M:** Following an injury or death of a nearby cell (not pictured), the process begins. The arrowhead points to the bulging of the shared cell wall between the two cells. This indicates the initiation of the fusion process.\n*   **Panel N:** The septum between the two cells has dissolved, allowing their protoplasts (the cell contents) to merge. The bulging has created a cytoplasmic bridge, and the two formerly separate cells are now fusing into one larger, continuous cell to repair the filament.\n\nThis type of somatic cell fusion is a well-documented repair mechanism in many filamentous red algae. When an intercalary (non-terminal) cell is damaged or dies, the adjacent cells are induced to form specialized repair cells. These repair cells grow towards each other, guided by chemical signals, and fuse to restore the integrity of the filament. In some cases, as depicted here, adjacent vegetative cells fuse directly without forming distinct repair shoots first. This remarkable process ensures the survival and structural continuity of the organism in response to physical damage.<<<Vegetative cell fusion in a filamentous alga.>>>"
