    "Based on the chemical transformations shown in the provided image, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe first step of the reaction converts the tetracyclic oxonium salt **1** into the N-amino acridinium salt **2**. This transformation involves the replacement of the ring oxygen atom in the xanthenium core with a nitrogen atom that is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂). This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium-type salts with hydrazine, which acts as the nitrogen source to form the corresponding N-amino pyridinium-type product.\n\n**Reagent B: Butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO) followed by an acid-catalyzed cyclization**\n\nThe second step converts the N-amino acridinium derivative **2** into the N-propyl dimethoxyquinacridinium salt **3**. This is a multi-step process that can be achieved in one pot:\n1.  **Condensation:** The N-amino group of compound **2** reacts with an aldehyde, in this case, butyraldehyde (also known as butanal), to form a hydrazone intermediate.\n2.  **Cyclization:** This intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular electrophilic substitution reaction. The reaction involves the cyclization of the hydrazone onto the adjacent methoxy-substituted benzene ring. This process, often catalyzed by acid and heat, leads to the elimination of methanol and the formation of the new pyridinone ring.\n3.  **Rearrangement/Aromatization:** Subsequent rearrangement and aromatization lead to the final pentacyclic quinacridinium structure, with a propyl group attached to one of the nitrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, reagent B represents the reactant that introduces the N-propyl group and enables the ring formation, which is butyraldehyde. The entire process is a complex annulation reaction.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine, and B is Butyraldehyde.>>>"
