    "The image and the user's description point to a well-known auditory illusion. The top part of the image, a spectrogram, shows a continuous tone at a single frequency that is interrupted by a burst of wide-band noise. The bottom part shows the corresponding waveform. This stimulus setup is used to elicit what is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis perceptual phenomenon occurs when a sound is interrupted by another sound, such as noise. If the interrupting noise is sufficiently loud and shares the right characteristics, the brain fills in the missing portion of the original sound, leading to the perception that the original sound continued uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise. This constructive aspect of hearing helps maintain a stable perception of sounds in noisy environments. The illusion is a fundamental example of auditory scene analysis, where the brain organizes ambiguous sound mixtures into coherent auditory streams.\n\nA specific and well-studied example of this is the **phonemic restoration effect**, where missing phonemes (the basic units of sound in speech) within a word are perceptually restored by the listener when replaced by noise. For this to occur, the noise must be loud enough to have plausibly masked the missing sound. This unconscious process is crucial for understanding speech in everyday situations where sounds are often obscured by other noises.\n\nThe phenomenon is analogous to the bistable ambiguity of the Necker Cube because the brain resolves an ambiguous sensory input into a stable and continuous perception. Research has shown that this illusion is not just a high-level cognitive \"guess\" but is reflected in the neural activity within the auditory cortex and even in the brainstem, suggesting it is a fundamental part of auditory processing.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
