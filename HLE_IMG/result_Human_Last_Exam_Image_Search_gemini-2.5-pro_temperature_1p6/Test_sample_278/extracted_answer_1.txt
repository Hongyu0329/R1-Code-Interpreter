The image displays a dimorphic fungus, consistent with *Candida albicans*, showing a mixture of three distinct morphologies: budding yeast cells, pseudohyphae (chains of elongated cells with constrictions), and true hyphae (parallel-sided filaments). The staining method is characteristic of a Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which colors the fungal elements magenta against a blue-green counterstained background.
