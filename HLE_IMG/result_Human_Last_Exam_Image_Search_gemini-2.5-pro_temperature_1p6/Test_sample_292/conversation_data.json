    "Based on the distinctive architectural features in the image, the picture was taken in the **Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC)**.\n\nThe key identifiers are the ceiling's unique diagrid structure and the patterned glass, which are signatures of the BCEC's design. The building, designed by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects in a joint venture with HNTB Architecture, features a large, curving roof with clerestory windows that allow significant daylight into the main exhibition hall. This design creates the noticeable light and shadow patterns visible in the photograph.\n\n<<<Boston>>>"
