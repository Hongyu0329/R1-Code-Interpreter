    "To determine the time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its structure and formulate a recurrence relation for its runtime.\n\nThe algorithm's pseudocode is as follows:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # Recursive call on the first n-1 elements\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    \n    # Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      \n      # Another recursive call on the first n-1 elements\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's define T(n) as the time taken by the algorithm to sort an array of size `n`.\n\n*   The line `sort(a, n - 1)` is a recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`, so its cost is `T(n-1)`.\n*   The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the potential `swap` operation take constant time, which can be denoted as O(1).\n*   The final `sort(a, n - 1)` is another recursive call that is executed only if the `if` condition is true.\n\nTo find the **worst-case** time complexity, we need to consider the input that maximizes the runtime. The runtime is maximized when the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed at every step of the recursion (for `n` from the initial size down to 2). This happens when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true. An example of such an input is a reverse-sorted array.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant for the O(1) operations)\n\nThe base case for the recursion is `T(1)`, which is a constant value, O(1), as the function does nothing when `n` is not greater than 1.\n\nLet's solve this recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n`= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n`= 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n...\nAfter k steps:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0) * c`\n\nLet `k = n - 1`, which means `n - k = 1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n\nSince `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity `T(n)` is proportional to `2^n`.\n\nThus, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`. Recurrence relations of the form `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + C` lead to an exponential complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\nThis type of algorithm is highly inefficient and serves more as an educational example of bad algorithm design. It is even less efficient than other notoriously slow algorithms like Stooge Sort, which has a complexity of `O(n^2.709)`, or Bogosort, which has an average-case complexity of `O(n*n!)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
