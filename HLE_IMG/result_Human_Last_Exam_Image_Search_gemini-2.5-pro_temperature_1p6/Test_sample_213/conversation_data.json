    "The piece of sheet music shown is the opening of the second act of the opera *Der Rosenkavalier* by Richard Strauss.\n\nThe score features a large orchestra typical of Strauss's work, including parts for flutes (\"2 gr. Fl.\"), oboe (\"I. Hob.\"), English horn (\"engl. Horn\"), bassoon (\"I. Fag.\"), and a full string section with specific German instructions like \"(die übrigen)\" (the others) and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute). The prominent German instruction \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates that the curtain rises at this point, signifying the start of the act. The energetic and complex musical style is characteristic of the introduction to Act II, which depicts the bustling preparations in the house of the wealthy Herr von Faninal.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
