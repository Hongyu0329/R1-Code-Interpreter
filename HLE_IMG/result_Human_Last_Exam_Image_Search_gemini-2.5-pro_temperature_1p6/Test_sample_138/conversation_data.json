    "Here is the identification of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n\nThe insects in this pair belong to the genus *Coelioxys*, also known as cuckoo bees. A key distinguishing feature between the sexes is the shape of the abdomen.\n\n*   **Left (A1):** This bee has a distinctly pointed, cone-shaped abdomen. This is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*, who uses this pointed tip to pierce the nest cells of her host (typically leafcutter bees) to lay her eggs.\n*   **Right (A2):** This bee has a broader abdomen that terminates in multiple spines or prongs. This is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n\nTherefore, the pairing is **Female, Male (4)**.\n\n**Pair B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n\nThese wasps are identifiable as *Polistes*, or paper wasps. In this genus, males can be distinguished from females primarily by their antennae.\n\n*   **Left (B1):** This wasp displays long antennae that are noticeably curled or hooked at the tip. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Right (B2):** This wasp has shorter, straighter antennae, which is typical for a female.\n\nTherefore, the pairing is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\n**Pair C: Solitary Bees**\n\nThis pair consists of two different types of solitary bees, which are being presented together for comparison. The prompt notes that the collected taxa are without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. This is true for all male bees, as they do not collect pollen, and for females of certain groups like leafcutter bees who carry pollen on their abdomens instead.\n\n*   **Left (C1):** This bee is likely a male from a long-horned bee genus such as *Melissodes*. It is hairy, has noticeably long antennae, and a patch of pale hair on its face (clypeus), all of which are common traits for males of this group. As a male, it lacks pollen-collecting scopae.\n*   **Right (C2):** This bee is a female leafcutter bee (*Megachile*). The key identifying feature is the dense patch of golden hairs visible on the underside of her abdomen; this is the abdominal scopa used for carrying pollen. Female leafcutter bees carry pollen on their abdomen rather than their legs.\n\nTherefore, the pairing is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\n4, 3, 3\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
