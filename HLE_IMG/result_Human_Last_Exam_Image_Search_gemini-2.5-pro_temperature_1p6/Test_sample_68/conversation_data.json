    "This coin is a 9 Deniers from the reign of Louis XV, specifically minted for the French colonies in America.\n\nThe visible text \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" on the reverse side is a clear indicator of its intended use. The obverse of the coin, though less clear in the image, features the crowned double-L monogram of King Louis XV.\n\nThese copper coins were minted in 1721 and 1722 in La Rochelle (mint mark H) and Rouen (mint mark B). According to an edict from June 1721, these coins were produced for circulation in \"our Colonies of America and other places of our domination outside of Europe\".\n\nInitially, a large quantity was sent to Canada in 1722, but the colonists were reluctant to use them. Consequently, most of these coins were returned to France in 1726 and later shipped to Louisiana, where they circulated at a value of 6 deniers. Some were also sent to Île Bourbon (modern-day Réunion). Therefore, this coin was intended for and circulated in several French colonies, most notably **French Louisiana** and **Canada (New France)**.\n\n<<<French Louisiana/New France>>>"
