    "Based on the annually recurring peaks in the Google Trends data, the country in question is Iran. The three historic events correspond to major national commemorations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events represented by each colored line on the graph:\n*   **The Red Line** shows a prominent spike in late January and early February each year. This corresponds to the anniversary of the **Iranian Revolution**. Celebrations, known as the Ten Days of Dawn, begin on February 1st, marking Ayatollah Khomeini's return from exile in 1979, and culminate on February 11th, the day the monarchy was officially toppled.\n\n*   **The Blue Line** has smaller, consistent peaks in late May. This represents the anniversary of the **Liberation of Khorramshahr** on May 24, 1982. This event was a significant turning point in the Iran-Iraq War and is celebrated annually in Iran.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line** displays peaks in early June. These spikes align with the anniversary of the **death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini**, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, on June 3, 1989. This is a solemn national occasion that gathers large crowds and significant public attention each year.\n\nThese three events are cornerstones of the modern history of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and their anniversaries consistently generate significant public interest, as reflected in the Google Trends data.\n\n<<<Iran>>>"
