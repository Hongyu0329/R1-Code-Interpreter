    "The knot depicted in the image is known as the 9_42 knot. Its Jones polynomial, V(t), is given by the expression:\n\nt⁴ - t³ + t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻²\n\nThis can be determined from the coefficients of its Kauffman polynomial, which is related to the Jones polynomial. The knot 9_42 is a notable example in knot theory as it is one of the first knots, along with its mirror image, whose chirality is not distinguished by the Jones or Kauffman polynomials.\n\nThe Jones polynomial is a significant invariant in knot theory, meaning it is the same for equivalent knots. However, it is not a complete invariant, as different knots can sometimes share the same Jones polynomial.\n\n<<<t⁴ - t³ + t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻²>>>"
