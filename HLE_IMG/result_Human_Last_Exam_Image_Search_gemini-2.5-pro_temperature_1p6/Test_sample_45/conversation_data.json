    "The tiling shown in the image has **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be determined by observing the arrangement of the tiles. The pattern is constructed around central blue heptagons (seven-sided polygons). If you pick the center of any of these blue heptagons as a point of rotation, the entire tiling can be rotated by an angle of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) and it will map onto itself, looking exactly the same.\n\nThis type of tiling is an example of an aperiodic tiling, meaning it does not have translational symmetry (it doesn't repeat in a regular grid). Such tilings are a subject of mathematical study and can exhibit rotational symmetries, like 7-fold, that are not possible in periodic, crystalline structures. There are various known aperiodic tilings with 7-fold symmetry, often constructed from rhombi, pentagons, or other polygons. These complex and beautiful patterns are related to the mathematical concept of quasicrystals.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
