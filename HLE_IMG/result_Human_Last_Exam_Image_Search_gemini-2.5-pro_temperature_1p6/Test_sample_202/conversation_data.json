    "Based on the visual analysis and the information from the search results, here is the identification of each rock specimen:\n\n*   **Specimen H: Scoria**\n    This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Its dark color and porous nature are characteristic of scoria. Scoria is formed from gas-rich lava that cools rapidly.\n\n*   **Specimen I: Conglomerate**\n    This specimen is composed of numerous rounded to sub-rounded pebbles and smaller rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is typical of a clastic sedimentary rock known as conglomerate. The rounding of the clasts suggests they were transported by water over a distance before being deposited and lithified.\n\n*   **Specimen J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock. Its frothy appearance is due to a very high percentage of gas bubble holes. Unlike scoria, pumice is typically light in color (white, grey, or tan) and has a very low density, often allowing it to float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K: Pegmatite**\n    This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock that cooled very slowly, allowing for the growth of large crystals. The visible minerals appear to be light-colored, likely quartz and feldspar, with some darker minerals, which is a common composition for a granitic pegmatite.\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Conglomerate, J is Pumice, K is Pegmatite>>>"
