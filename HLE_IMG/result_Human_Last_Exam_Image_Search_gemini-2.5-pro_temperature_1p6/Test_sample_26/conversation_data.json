    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\nIn measure 30, the notes played are:\n*   **Right Hand:** E-natural, G-sharp, B-natural, and D-natural.\n*   **Left Hand:** An octave E-natural.\n\nThese notes combine to form an E dominant seventh chord (E, G#, B, D). This chord functions as a secondary dominant. It resolves to an A minor chord in the following measure (measure 31), which is the submediant (vi) of the home key of C minor.\n\nTherefore, the E dominant seventh chord in measure 30 is the dominant of the submediant, and its Roman numeral is **V7/vi**.\n\n<<<V7/vi>>>"
