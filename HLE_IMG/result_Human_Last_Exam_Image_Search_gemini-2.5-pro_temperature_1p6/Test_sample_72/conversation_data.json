    "This transformation occurs through two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that happen in sequence.\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\n*   An electrocyclic reaction.\n*   A [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n**Step 1: Electrocyclic Reaction**\n\nFirst, hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This type of reaction is an electrocyclic reaction, specifically a 4Ï€-electron disrotatory ring closure which is allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The photolysis of benzene and its derivatives to form \"Dewar\" isomers is a known process in photochemistry.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gK2T3Rz.png\" alt=\"Step 1: Electrocyclic Reaction of Hexafluorobenzene\" width=\"500\"/>\n\n**Step 2: [2+2] Cycloaddition**\n\nThe newly formed hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene then reacts with cyclobutene. This second step is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. One of the double bonds of the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of the cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final tricyclic product. This reaction is also photochemically allowed.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kS5z3Hn.png\" alt=\"Step 2: [2+2] Cycloaddition with Cyclobutene\" width=\"600\"/>\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation combines an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition, both initiated by light.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
