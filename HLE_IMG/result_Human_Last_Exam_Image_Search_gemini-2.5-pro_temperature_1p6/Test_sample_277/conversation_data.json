    "Due to a technical issue, the image containing the molecules is not visible. To answer the question \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\", it is essential to see the chemical structures of the molecules in question.\n\nWithout the image, it is impossible to determine the relationship between the molecules. However, I can provide the definitions of the different types of isomers listed in the options, which will help you identify the correct relationship once you can see the molecules.\n\n### Guide to Identifying Isomers:\n\nTo determine the relationship between two molecules, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check the Molecular Formula:** Determine the molecular formula for each molecule (the count of each type of atom, e.g., C₆H₁₂O₆).\n    *   If the formulas are different, the molecules are not isomers.\n\n2.  **Check the Connectivity:** If the molecular formulas are the same, examine how the atoms are connected to each other.\n    *   **Constitutional (or structural) isomers** have the same molecular formula but a different sequence of atom connections. You can often identify them because their IUPAC names will be fundamentally different (e.g., 1-butanol vs. 2-butanol).\n    *   If the connectivity is the same, they are stereoisomers.\n\n3.  **Check the 3D Arrangement (for Stereoisomers):** Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and the same atom connectivity but differ in their three-dimensional arrangement.\n    *   **Identical Molecules:** If you can superimpose one molecule on top of the other perfectly, simply by rotating the whole molecule in space (without breaking any bonds), they are identical.\n    *   **Conformational Isomers (Conformers):** These are versions of the same molecule that can be interconverted simply by rotating around one or more single bonds. An example is the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of cyclohexane. They are generally not separable at room temperature.\n    *   **Stereoisomers (Configurational):** If the molecules are not identical and cannot be interconverted by simple bond rotation (i.e., you would have to break and re-form bonds), they are configurational isomers. This is a broad category that includes:\n        *   **Enantiomers:** Stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like a left and right hand.\n        *   **Diastereomers:** Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Geometric isomers (like *cis* and *trans*) are a common example of diastereomers.\n\n**In summary, to answer your question, you will need to apply this logic to the specific molecules shown in the image.**"
