    "The best move for white in this position is I. Nh6+. This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence known as a smothered mate.\n\nHere is the winning sequence of moves:\n1.  **Nh6++** This is a double check from the knight and a discovered check from the queen. In a double check, the king must move. The only legal square for the black king is h8.\n2.  **Kh8** Black is forced to move the king to the corner.\n3.  **Qg8+** White sacrifices the queen. Black cannot capture with the king because the queen is protected by the knight on h6. The only legal move is to capture the queen with the rook.\n4.  **Rxg8** This move is forced. By capturing the queen, the black rook now \"smothers\" the king by blocking its only escape square.\n5.  **Nf7#** The white knight delivers checkmate. The black king is trapped by its own pieces and cannot move.\n\nThis specific pattern is a classic example of a smothered mate, a well-known checkmating combination in chess.\n\n<<<I>>>"
