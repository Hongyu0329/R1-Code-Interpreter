    "To determine the time signature, we need to count the total duration of the notes within the measure for one of the staves. Let's analyze the rhythm in the right hand (treble clef), as it is clearer.\n\n1.  **Divide the measure into beats:** The notes are grouped with beams. We can see four distinct groupings of sixteenth notes. In common time signatures like 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4, beaming often groups notes to show the main beats.\n\n2.  **Analyze each beat:**\n    *   **Beat 1:** Consists of a sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is equivalent to four sixteenth notes, which equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 2:** Is identical to the first beat—a sixteenth rest and three sixteenth notes. This also equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 3:** Again, a sixteenth rest and three sixteenth notes, equaling one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 4:** Same as the previous beats, totaling one quarter note.\n\n3.  **Sum the beats:** Adding the four beats together (1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note) gives a total of four quarter notes in the measure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** A measure containing the equivalent of four quarter notes is in 4/4 time. This musical piece is Chopin's \"Torrent\" Étude, Op. 10, No. 4, which is written in 4/4 time. The time signature indicates four beats per measure, with the quarter note receiving the beat.\n\nTherefore, the correct time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
