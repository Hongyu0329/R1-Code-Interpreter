    "The second set of search results provided much more specific information. By searching for \"emission spectrum of iron\", I found several sources that show and describe the emission spectrum of iron. The search result from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) directly states that an image, which is visually identical to the one provided by the user, is the spectrum of non-ionized iron. Another source from Chemistry LibreTexts explicitly uses a similar image and labels it as the emission spectrum of iron (Fe). Furthermore, other search results confirm that each element has a unique emission spectrum, often referred to as its \"fingerprint\". The extensive and complex line pattern in the provided image is characteristic of heavier elements like iron. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nThe element with these spectral lines is **Iron (Fe)**. The provided image shows the characteristic emission spectrum of iron. Each element emits a unique pattern of light when energized, and this pattern, known as an emission spectrum, acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The dense and complex series of lines seen across the visible spectrum in the image is uniquely identifiable as that of iron.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) confirms that this specific pattern of colored lines corresponds to the light emitted by non-ionized iron. Additionally, educational resources on atomic emission spectra often use an almost identical image to illustrate the emission spectrum of iron (Fe).\n\n"
