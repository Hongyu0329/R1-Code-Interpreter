The protein S100B shows a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an adjunct marker, due to its lack of specificity for any single disorder, and as a prognostic marker, because its levels correlate with the severity of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, thus predicting patient outcomes.
