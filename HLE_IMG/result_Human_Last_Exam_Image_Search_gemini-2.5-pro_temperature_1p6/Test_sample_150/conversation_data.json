    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene, propanoyl chloride, and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acyl group (in this case, a propanoyl group) is attached to the benzene ring, forming an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene + Propanoyl chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or ethyl phenyl ketone)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination. The acyl group (C=O) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n\nIntermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation will reduce the ketone group. While sometimes requiring specific conditions, H₂/Pd can reduce a ketone to a methylene group (CH₂). This reaction also causes hydrogenolysis, which will remove the bromine atom from the aromatic ring, replacing it with a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 3-Bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-3 (propylbenzene) is reacted with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The reaction exclusively places a bromine atom on the benzylic carbon.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene (Intermediate-3)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Product:** 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\nThus, the final product of the reaction sequence is 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n\n<<<1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
