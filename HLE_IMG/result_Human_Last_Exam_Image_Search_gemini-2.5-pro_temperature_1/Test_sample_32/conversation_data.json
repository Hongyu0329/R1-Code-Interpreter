    "**The primary visual distinction between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the curvature of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.** This feature allows for a straightforward differentiation of the two species when their sporophytes are present.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by an arcuate, or curved, seta, which gives the capsule a bent or arching appearance relative to the stalk. This difference in the seta's form is a reliable characteristic for telling the two mosses apart at a glance.\n\nBoth species have capsules that are exserted, meaning they are elevated above the leaves. However, the orientation of the capsule, dictated by the straight versus curved nature of the seta, remains the most evident distinguishing feature of the sporophyte. While capsules of *Grimmia montana* are noted as occasionally being slightly asymmetric, the straightness of the seta is a consistent characteristic.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
