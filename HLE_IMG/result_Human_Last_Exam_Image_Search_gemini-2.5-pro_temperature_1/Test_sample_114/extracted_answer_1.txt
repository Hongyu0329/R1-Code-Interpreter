The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is because the cyclic structure of the N-acetylproline starting material prevents the formation of a symmetrical intermediate, which would allow for the scrambling of substituents. This ensures that only a single, unique m√ºnchnone intermediate is formed, which then reacts with high regioselectivity in the cycloaddition step. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish the principle that such scrambling *does* occur with structurally similar, acyclic starting materials (like N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine), thereby explaining the apparent lack of regioselectivity in the labeling experiment (Reaction 2) and highlighting the importance of the proline ring's rigidity in ensuring the selectivity of Reaction 3.
