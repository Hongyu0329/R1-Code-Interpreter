Based on the image and supporting information, the protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an **adjunct marker**, due to its non-specific elevation in various neurological and non-neurological conditions, and as a **prognostic marker**, because its levels often correlate with the severity of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and clinical outcome.
