    "Based on the visual evidence, this image was taken at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline, Washington.\n\nThe key features in the image that lead to this conclusion are:\n\n*   **The View:** The photograph captures a sunset over Puget Sound, with the characteristic dark, gravelly beach and a dense treeline in the background. This is a hallmark view from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.\n*   **The Bonfire:** Small beach fires are a known activity at this park, which has a designated fire ring near the picnic shelter. While beach fires have been prohibited at times due to dry conditions, they are a feature of the park.\n*   **The Fence:** The perspective through a black chain-link fence is consistent with views from the upper bluff areas of the park or from the footbridge that crosses the train tracks to get to the beach. The park has multiple viewpoints and trails on a hillside overlooking the water.\n\nThe combination of the Puget Sound sunset, the specific type of beach, the allowance of fires, and the presence of a chain-link fence at a viewpoint strongly indicates the location is Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline, WA.\n\n<<<Shoreline, Washington>>>"
