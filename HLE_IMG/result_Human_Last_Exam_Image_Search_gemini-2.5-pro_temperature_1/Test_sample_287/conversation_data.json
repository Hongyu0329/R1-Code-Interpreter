    "## Digitally Altered Cityscape: Seoul Towers Brought Together\n\nThe city depicted in the provided image, which the user stated was taken in 2024, is a digitally altered representation of Seoul, South Korea. The image is a composite that brings together two iconic skyscrapers of the South Korean capital: the Jongno Tower and the POSCO Center.\n\nThe building on the left of the image is the **Jongno Tower**, easily identifiable by its distinctive concrete grid facade with recessed windows. Located in the Jongno District (Jongno-gu), it was designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly and completed in 1999. A notable feature of the tower is its top floors, which are designed to appear as if they are floating.\n\nThe sleek, curved glass skyscraper on the right is the **POSCO Center**. Situated in the Gangnam District (Gangnam-gu), the headquarters of the steel company POSCO is a landmark of modern architecture in Seoul.\n\nWhile both are prominent structures in Seoul's skyline, they are located in different districts of the city and are not adjacent to each other as depicted in the image. The distance between Jongno-gu and Gangnam-gu confirms that the photograph is a composite, skillfully blending two separate views of the city into one.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
