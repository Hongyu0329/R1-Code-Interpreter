    "The knot in the image is identified as the prime knot 9₄₂, which is also known as the 9n4 knot in Dowker-Thistlethwaite notation.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is given by:\n\n$t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2$\n\nIn decreasing degree order, the polynomial is:\n\n$t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the 9₄₂ knot is that it is one of the first knots whose chirality is not detected by the Jones polynomial, meaning the knot and its mirror image have the same Jones polynomial.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
