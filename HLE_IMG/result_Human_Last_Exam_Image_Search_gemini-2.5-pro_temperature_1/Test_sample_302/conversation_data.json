    "The characters on the seal, read in the traditional Chinese order (top to bottom, right to left), are 萬壽無疆 (wàn shòu wú jiāng).\n\nThis is a common and auspicious phrase, wishing the recipient boundless longevity. Such phrases were often used on items created for emperors, such as on porcelain, and are also a common motif for seals.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are:\n*   萬 becomes 万\n*   壽 becomes 寿\n*   無 becomes 无\n*   疆 is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the content on the seal in simplified Chinese is \"万寿无疆\".\n\n<<<万寿无疆>>>"
