    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone. This stone is one of approximately 26 runestones raised in memory of those who participated in Ingvar the Far-Travelled's Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea region.\n\nThe inscription on this particular stone was commissioned by a woman named Tola in memory of her son, Harald, who was the brother of Ingvar. The text states that they \"travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave food to the eagle\" is a kenning, a poetic metaphor in Old Norse, for winning battles and killing enemies. Serkland is believed to refer to the land of the Saracens, the area around the Black and Caspian Seas.\n\nThis well-known runestone is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden. It was discovered in the 1820s, having been used as a threshold stone in the castle's cellar, covered in tar. It wasn't until around 1930 that the stone was removed from the floor and placed in its current location.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
