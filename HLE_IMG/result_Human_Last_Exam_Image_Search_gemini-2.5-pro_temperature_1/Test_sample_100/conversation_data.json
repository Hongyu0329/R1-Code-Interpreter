    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction scheme to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a complex bicyclic structure. It features a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core. The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The bicyclic system also contains a ketone (C=O) group and a carbon-carbon double bond substituted with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The first reagent is Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in aqueous acetonitrile (ACN/H2O). CAN is a common and effective oxidizing agent used specifically for the deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. In this reaction, the PMB group is oxidatively cleaved from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is the N-deprotected version of the starting material: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Reaction 2:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a standard catalyst for the reduction of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds. The C=C double bond within the bicyclic ring system is reduced to a C-C single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms. Ketones can also be reduced under these conditions, but the reduction of an alkene is typically faster and more favorable.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product, Intermediate 2, is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Its molecular formula is C7H8F3NO.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction and Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) and heated to 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic amino ketone. The 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring system is known to be quite stable and generally does not undergo ring-opening under these moderately acidic conditions. Therefore, the main reaction is the protonation of the basic nitrogen atom of the amine by the strong acid (HCl) to form a hydrochloride salt. When isolating the final product, a basic workup would typically be performed to neutralize the salt and yield the free amine. No structural rearrangement or other transformation is expected under these conditions.\n*   **Product:** The final organic product is the same as Intermediate 2, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.\n\n**Determination of the Molecular Formula**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we count the atoms in 5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbon atoms in the bicyclic core and 1 carbon atom in the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, for a total of 7 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** There are 7 hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon framework and 1 hydrogen atom on the nitrogen, for a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the CF3 group.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the bicyclic bridge.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** There is 1 oxygen atom in the ketone group.\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H8F3NO.\n\n<<<C7H8F3NO>>>"
