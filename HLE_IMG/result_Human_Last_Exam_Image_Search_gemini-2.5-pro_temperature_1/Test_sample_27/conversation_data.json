    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is Fausto Pacheco Hern치ndez.\n\nFausto Pacheco Hern치ndez (1899-1966) was a renowned Costa Rican painter, photographer, and engraver, celebrated primarily for his watercolor landscapes. He is considered a prominent figure of the \"Generaci칩n del 30\" (1930s Generation) and is credited with capturing the essence of Costa Rica's national identity through his depictions of the country's scenic beauty, particularly the landscapes of his native Heredia and the Central Valley.\n\nHis work is characterized by its luminous quality and rich, varied colors, often featuring traditional adobe houses set against lush, natural backdrops. While his paintings rarely include human figures, they evoke a human presence through the objects and environments he chose to represent. The signature \"Pacheco 38\" visible on the painting is consistent with the artist's active period. Pacheco's work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and is held in significant collections, including that of the Museum of Costa Rican Art.\n\n<<<Fausto Pacheco Hern치ndez>>>"
