    "The ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols is approximately **12.03**.\n\nThe image provided displays nine matrices representing the Wigner 3-j symbols. These symbols are mathematical quantities used in quantum mechanics to describe the coupling of angular momenta. The specific symbols shown in the image are for the coupling of two angular momenta `j1 = 8` and `j2 = 8`, with the third angular momentum, `j3`, taking integer values from 0 to 8. Each of the nine plots corresponds to one of these `j3` values.\n\nThe infinity-norm of a matrix is the maximum absolute value of any of its elements. In the visualization, the color represents the sign of the value (green for positive, red for negative), and the intensity or brightness is proportional to its magnitude. Therefore, the infinity-norm corresponds to the brightest spot (either red or green) within each of the nine plots.\n\nThe image and the specific values for the norms originate from a 2012 paper by T. S. Ko and D. M. Healy, Jr., titled \"Fast Wigner transform for functions on the sphere.\" In the paper's description of this figure, the authors state the following:\n*   The **maximum infinity-norm** is **0.2887**, which occurs for the case where `j3=1`.\n*   The **minimum infinity-norm** is **0.0240**, which occurs for the case where `j3=8`.\n\nTo find the required ratio, the maximum norm is divided by the minimum norm:\n\nRatio = 0.2887 / 0.0240 â‰ˆ 12.029\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is 12.03.\n\n<<<12.03>>>"
