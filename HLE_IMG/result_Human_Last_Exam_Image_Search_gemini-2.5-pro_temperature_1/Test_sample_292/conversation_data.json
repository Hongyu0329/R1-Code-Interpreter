    "This picture was taken in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe photograph shows the interior of the new main terminal at Portland International Airport (PDX), which officially opened in August 2024. The terminal's most prominent feature is its nine-acre, mass-timber roof, constructed from Douglas fir sourced from the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe design of the roof, with its intricate lattice structure and numerous skylights, is intended to evoke the feeling of a walk in a forest, with dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. This unique wooden ceiling is a key element of the airport's $2.15 billion renovation project. The architectural firm ZGF designed the new terminal, which also features an abundance of live plants and large windows to enhance the connection to the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n<<<Portland, Oregon>>>"
