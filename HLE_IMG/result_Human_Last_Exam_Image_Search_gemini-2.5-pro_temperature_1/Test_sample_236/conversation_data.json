    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis insect belongs to the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. It is characterized by its distinct orange or red and black markings, which serve as a warning to predators about its toxicity, acquired from its diet. The Small Milkweed Bug is about half an inch long and has a black head, a reddish-orange band across the area behind the head (pronotum), and a reddish-orange \"X\" on its back.\n\nAlthough its name suggests a diet limited to milkweed, *Lygaeus kalmii* is known to feed on a variety of plants, including the goldenrod (*Solidago sp.*) it is pictured on. It is found throughout North America.\n\n<<<*Lygaeus kalmii*>>>"
