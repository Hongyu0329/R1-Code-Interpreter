    "The reaction sequence shown in the image involves four key transformations to arrive at the final product. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathway:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The initial reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride using aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n    The first intermediate, propiophenone, then undergoes bromination with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. This means the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the position meta to the acyl group on the benzene ring. This yields **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one** as Intermediate-2.\n\n*   **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n    Intermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This step accomplishes two reductions: the ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), and the bromo group is removed from the aromatic ring (hydrogenolysis). This type of reduction is a known method for converting acylbenzenes to alkylbenzenes. The resulting molecule, Intermediate-3, is **propylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n    The final step is the reaction of propylbenzene with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, which acts as a radical initiator. NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring that also has hydrogen atoms. The reaction selectively replaces a hydrogen atom at this benzylic position with a bromine atom.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
