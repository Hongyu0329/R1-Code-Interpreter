    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at an m/z of 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 u.\n*   The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the nitrogen rule.\n*   A plausible molecular formula that fits this weight and other data is C₉H₁₃N (9×12.01 + 13×1.01 + 1×14.01 ≈ 135.23).\n*   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4. This value is consistent with the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   A significant fragment is visible at m/z 106, which corresponds to the loss of a mass of 29 (135 - 106 = 29). This loss is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**2. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows a total of 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the proposed formula is C₉H₁₃N, this implies some symmetry in the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Four signals appear in the typical aromatic range (δ 126-146 ppm): 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This pattern (4 signals for 6 carbons) is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-), where the ipso-carbon is distinct, and the ortho, meta, and para carbons give three other signals (due to symmetry, the two ortho and two meta carbons are equivalent).\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon attached to the side chain.\n    *   The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are the CH carbons of the benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals appear at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:** This experiment helps determine the type of each carbon atom.\n    *   It shows one negative signal, which corresponds to a CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   It shows five positive signals, which correspond to CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   Combining the ¹³C and DEPT data: The three aromatic CH carbons account for three of the positive signals. Therefore, the three aliphatic carbons must consist of one CH₂ group (the negative signal), one CH group (positive), and one CH₃ group (positive).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** A multiplet between δ 7.1 and 7.3 ppm integrates to 5 protons, confirming the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   A triplet at ~1.2 ppm integrates to 3 protons. A 3H triplet is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl group.\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.8 ppm integrates to ~2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH₂- group.\n    *   A multiplet at ~2.7 ppm integrates to ~1 proton. This corresponds to the -CH- group.\n\n**4. HSQC Spectroscopy**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with the carbon signals they are directly attached to.\n    *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm (3H) correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm (confirms -CH₃).\n    *   ¹H at 2.8 ppm (2H) correlates with ¹³C at 43.5 ppm (confirms -CH₂-).\n    *   ¹H at 2.7 ppm (1H) correlates with ¹³C at 49.6 ppm (confirms -CH-).\n\n**Structure Determination**\nBased on the analysis of all the spectral data:\n1.  The molecule contains a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n2.  The aliphatic side chain is composed of a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, and a -CH₃ group.\n3.  The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n4.  The fragments are therefore: a phenyl group, a CH group, an NH₂ group (to satisfy the formula C₉H₁₃N), and an ethyl group.\n5.  Assembling these pieces, the only possible structure is the phenyl group and the amino group attached to the CH, which is then attached to the ethyl group.\n\nThis leads to the following structure:\nC₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃\n\n**IUPAC Name**\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain it is attached to is a three-carbon chain (propane). Numbering from the end closest to the amine group gives the amine at position 1. The phenyl group is also on position 1.\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
