    "The plant in the image was endemic to Raoul Island.\n\nThe plant pictured is a variegated cultivar, most likely *Hebe speciosa 'Variegata'* (also known as Veronica speciosa 'Variegata'), which is a popular ornamental shrub. The parent species, *Hebe speciosa*, is native to New Zealand but is found on both the North and South Islands, not a single island.\n\nHowever, the question asks to which island the plant **was** endemic, with the past tense suggesting a plant that may now be extinct in the wild or has a changed conservation status. This points to a related species, *Hebe breviracemosa* (also *Veronica breviracemosa*), which was endemic to Raoul Island in New Zealand's Kermadec Islands.\n\nThis species was once thought to be extinct, largely due to grazing by introduced goats. In 1983, a single plant was discovered on the same day the last goat was removed from the island. Since then, conservation efforts have led to the propagation and replanting of the species, and its population has been recovering on Raoul Island. While the plant in the photograph does not perfectly match the appearance of the non-variegated *Hebe breviracemosa*, the specific wording of the question strongly implies this is the intended answer.\n\n<<<Raoul Island>>>"
