    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we must first identify the chiral centers and then assign the configuration (R or S) to each one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### 1. Identify the Chiral Centers and IUPAC Name\nThe molecule has three chiral centers. To systematically refer to them, let's first determine the IUPAC name of the structure.\nThe principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so it receives the highest priority for numbering the main carbon chain. The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is a pentane chain. Numbering from the left to give the C-OH the lowest possible number (position 2):\n\n          Et   Me\n          |    |\n    Me¹ - C² - C³ - C⁴ - C⁵H₂NH₂\n          |\n          OH\n\nThe IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n### 2. Assign Priorities to Substituents for Each Chiral Center\n\n**For C2:**\n1.  **-OH** (highest atomic number, O)\n2.  **-C3H(Et)C4H(Me)CH₂NH₂** (carbon attached to other carbons)\n3.  **-CH₃** (carbon attached to hydrogens)\n4.  **-H** (implicit, lowest priority)\n\n**For C3:**\n1.  **-C2H(OH)CH₃** (The carbon at C2 is attached to an Oxygen, which outranks the atoms attached to C4)\n2.  **-C4H(Me)CH₂NH₂**\n3.  **-CH₂CH₃** (ethyl group)\n4.  **-H** (implicit)\n\n**For C4:**\n1.  **-CH₂NH₂** (The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen, which outranks the atoms attached to the carbons of the other groups)\n2.  **-C3H(Et)C2H(OH)CH₃**\n3.  **-CH₃**\n4.  **-H** (implicit)\n\n### 3. Determine the R/S Configuration for Each Chiral Center\n\nWe will interpret the provided image as a 3D perspective drawing. The wedged bonds point out of the screen, and the dashed bonds point into the screen. The implicit hydrogen atoms are placed to complete the tetrahedral geometry at each chiral center.\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n*   The substituents are: -OH (wedge, front), -CH₃ (dash, back), -C3 (back), and -H (which must be front/up).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer.\n*   We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -OH → -C3 → -CH₃.\n*   Viewing from the front, this path is counter-clockwise.\n*   Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the assignment. Counter-clockwise becomes **R**.\n*   **C2 is (R)**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n*   The substituents are: -Ethyl (wedge, front), -C2 (back), -C4 (front), and -H (which must be back/down).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away from the viewer.\n*   We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -C2 → -C4 → -Ethyl.\n*   Viewing from the front, this path is clockwise.\n*   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, the assignment is **R**.\n*   **C3 is (R)**.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n*   The substituents are: -CH₂NH₂ (wedge, front), -CH₃ (dash, back), -C3 (back), and -H (which must be front/up).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer.\n*   We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -CH₂NH₂ → -C3 → -CH₃.\n*   Viewing from the front, this path is clockwise.\n*   Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the assignment. Clockwise becomes **S**.\n*   **C4 is (S)**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<**(2R, 3R, 4S)**>>>"
