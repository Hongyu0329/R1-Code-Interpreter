    "The erasure poem sequence adheres to the poetic form of a tanka.\n\nThis conclusion is based on analyzing the structure of the four-line stanza created by the sequence of erasure poems by the poet Mary Jo Bang from her collection \"The Last Two Seconds.\" The full stanza, of which the image and user prompt provide the last two lines, reads:\n\n> a clock face, a hand\n> a far far and a near near\n> ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex\n> nacreous wavers\n\nTo determine the poetic form, we can count the syllables in each line:\n*   **Line 1:** a clock face, a hand (5 syllables)\n*   **Line 2:** a far far and a near near (7 syllables)\n*   **Line 3:** ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex (10 syllables)\n*   **Line 4:** nacreous wavers (5 syllables)\n\nThis syllabic structure does not immediately align with common Western poetic forms. However, considering the poet's engagement with various forms and the specific syllable count, it points toward a modified Japanese form.\n\nThe Japanese tanka consists of five units, often translated as lines, with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5-7-7. While the poem in question is a four-line stanza, the sequence of syllables in the first two and the fourth lines (5-7-5) mirrors the structure of a haiku (a 5-7-5 syllable poem). A tanka is a slightly longer version of a haiku, adding two seven-syllable lines.\n\nThe third line, with its 10 syllables, is a noticeable deviation from the traditional tanka form. This is a common practice for poets like Mary Jo Bang, who are known for adapting and experimenting with forms. English-language poets often vary from the strict 31-syllable rule of the tanka. The poem maintains the lyrical and evocative quality of a tanka, which aims to capture a moment and a reflection. The first three lines of a tanka typically present an image, while the last two offer a reflection, a structure that can be seen in this stanza's progression from a concrete image to a more abstract one.\n\nTherefore, the poem is best described as a modified tanka, using the characteristic 5-7-5 syllable sequence for three of its four lines.\n\n<<<tanka>>>"
