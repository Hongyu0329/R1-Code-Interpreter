    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element Uranium. The complex pattern of numerous fine lines across the visible spectrum is characteristic of Uranium's atomic emission spectrum.\n\n<br>\nUranium has a very complex spectrum with a large number of emission lines due to its many electrons and available energy levels. Scientific studies often analyze these spectral features to identify uranium and its compounds. For instance, a strong emission line for atomic uranium is found at 591.5 nm.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
