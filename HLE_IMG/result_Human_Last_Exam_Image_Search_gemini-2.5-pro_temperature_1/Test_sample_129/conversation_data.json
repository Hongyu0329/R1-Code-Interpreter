    "This image displays the solution structure of the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of the human protein Parkin.\n\nParkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme crucial for tagging other proteins with ubiquitin, often marking them for degradation. Mutations in the gene that codes for Parkin are a major cause of an inherited form of Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe protein has a modular structure, and the image specifically shows two parts:\n\n*   **The ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain:** Depicted in light blue, this domain is structurally similar to ubiquitin itself. It plays a role in regulating Parkin's activity and in its interaction with other proteins, such as subunits of the proteasome.\n*   **Another domain of Parkin or an interacting protein:** The larger, dark blue portion represents another part of the Parkin protein or a protein it is bound to. For example, Parkin's Ubl domain is known to interact with the SH3 domain of endophilin-A.\n\nThe overall structure shown is often studied to understand how Parkin is activated. In its inactive state, the Ubl domain helps to auto-inhibit the protein. Activation involves processes like phosphorylation, which cause conformational changes and release this inhibition, allowing Parkin to perform its function.\n\nThe specific image corresponds to the structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID 1Iyf.\n\n<<<Parkin>>>"
