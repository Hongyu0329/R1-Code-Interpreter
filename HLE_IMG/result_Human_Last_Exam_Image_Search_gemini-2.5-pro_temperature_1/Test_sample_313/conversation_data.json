    "The two-word phrase is **Felt Hat**.\n\nThe image features Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner presenting an award to rapper Basta at the GQ Russia \"100 Most Stylish\" event on June 20, 2019. This provides a conceptual link to the answer.\n\nThe phrase \"Felt Hat\" is connected to the clues in two ways:\n\n1.  **Toxicity of Mercury Salts**: For centuries, hat makers used mercuric nitrate in a process called \"carroting\" to transform animal fur into felt for hats. This process was hazardous, as inhaling the mercury vapors led to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism. This condition caused tremors, dubbed the \"Danbury shakes,\" along with behavioral changes like anxiety and paranoia. The use of mercury in the hat-making industry was eventually banned in the United States in 1941 due to its severe health effects.\n\n2.  **Pictured at the Event**: A felt hat, such as a fedora or homburg, is a classic accessory and a symbol of style. The man presenting the award, Vladimir Pozner, is a prominent figure at an event celebrating the \"Most Stylish Men.\" His surname is a homophone for the Russian word \"позёр\" (pozyor), which translates to \"poseur\" or \"dandy.\" A felt hat was a quintessential item for a well-dressed dandy of a bygone era. Therefore, the \"Felt Hat\" is conceptually \"pictured\" through the presence of a \"dandy\" at an event dedicated to fashion and style.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
