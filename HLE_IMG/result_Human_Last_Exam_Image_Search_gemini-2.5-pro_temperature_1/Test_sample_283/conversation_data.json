    "The Google Trends graph displays recurring annual peaks in search interest for three distinct topics, indicated by the red, yellow, and blue lines. These peaks strongly suggest the commemoration of annual historical events. A close examination of the dates of these peaks points toward a specific country.\n\nThe three historical events are:\n*   **Giorno della Memoria (Holocaust Remembrance Day):** Represented by the red line, this event is commemorated in Italy on January 27th each year to remember the victims of the Holocaust. The graph shows a significant spike in interest for the red line at the end of January each year.\n*   **Festa della Liberazione (Liberation Day):** Indicated by the blue line, this is an Italian national holiday celebrated on April 25th. It commemorates the end of the Nazi occupation and the fascist regime in 1945. The graph consistently shows a peak for the blue line around this date.\n*   **Festa della Repubblica (Republic Day):** The yellow line, which shows the most prominent peaks, corresponds to Italy's National Day on June 2nd. This holiday celebrates the day in 1946 when Italians voted in a referendum to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. The graph shows a major spike for the yellow line at the beginning of June each year.\n\nThese three events are cornerstones of modern Italian history and civic identity. The consistent alignment of their anniversaries with the peaks in the Google Trends data makes it evident that the country in question is Italy.\n\n<<<Italy>>>"
