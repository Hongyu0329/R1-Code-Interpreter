    "The phenomenon shown in the image is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Perceptual Restoration of Sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a brief period of another sound, like a burst of noise. If the interrupting noise is sufficiently loud and shares frequency content with the original sound, the human brain perceives the original tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The image provided illustrates this: the top panel (a spectrogram) shows a tone that is interrupted by a broadband noise burst, and the bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform.\n\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" of the missing sound segment is a common and typically unconscious ability of our auditory system. It is a crucial mechanism for understanding speech and music in noisy environments, where important sounds are often briefly obscured by other noises. The brain essentially restores the missing information based on the context provided by the sounds present before and after the gap.\n\nThe phenomenon is compared to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity because there are two possible perceptions of the auditory event:\n1.  The illusory, and more common, perception: The original tone continues seamlessly behind the interrupting noise.\n2.  The physical reality: The tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then starts again.\n\nA specific and well-known example of this effect involving speech is called the phonemic restoration effect, first demonstrated by Richard M. Warren. In these cases, if a phoneme (a basic unit of speech) in a sentence is removed and replaced by a cough or static, listeners often report hearing the missing phoneme, believing the sentence to be intact.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
