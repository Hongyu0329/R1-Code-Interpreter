    "The image provided is completely black and does not contain any molecules to compare. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the relationship between them.\n\nTo answer your question, I would need to see the structures of the molecules. Based on their structures, I could determine their relationship according to the following definitions:\n\n*   **Constitutional isomers** have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms.\n*   **Stereoisomers** have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This category includes several subtypes:\n    *   **Conformational isomers (conformers)** are stereoisomers that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds.\n    *   **Enantiomers** are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Identical** molecules have the same molecular formula, connectivity, and spatial arrangement. They are the same compound.\n\nSince I cannot see the molecules, I cannot select an answer. Please provide the image with the molecules for me to analyze."
