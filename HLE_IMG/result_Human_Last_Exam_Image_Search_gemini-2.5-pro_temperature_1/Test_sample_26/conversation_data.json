    "The chord in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata is an augmented sixth chord. Specifically, it is an Italian augmented sixth chord.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmony in that measure:\n\n*   **Key Context:** The piece is in C minor. This section is a transition, moving towards the dominant key of G minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Right Hand:** The arpeggiated figure spells out the notes F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n    *   **Left Hand:** The broken chord contains the notes D, F♯, A, and C.\n*   **Chord Analysis:** While the collection of notes (D, F♯, A, C, E♭) strongly resembles a D dominant 7th chord with a flat 9 (V7♭9 of G minor), in classical analysis, the function of the F♯ against the E♭ points to an augmented sixth interval. This interval is characteristic of augmented sixth chords, which are chromatic chords used to lead to the dominant. In this context, the chord functions as a pre-dominant, resolving to the dominant (V), which is G in this case.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for an Italian augmented sixth chord in C minor that leads to the dominant (G) is It⁺⁶. Some analyses might also interpret this chromatically altered chord as V⁶₅/v, indicating a secondary dominant in first inversion leading to the minor dominant (G minor).\n\nTherefore, the most precise Roman numeral designation for the chord in measure 30 is It⁺⁶.\n\n<<<It⁺⁶>>>"
