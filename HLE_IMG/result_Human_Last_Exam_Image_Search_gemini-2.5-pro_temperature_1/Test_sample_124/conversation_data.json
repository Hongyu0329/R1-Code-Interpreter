    "To determine the total current flowing through the circuit, one must first calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then apply Ohm's law.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Component Identification:** The circuit is powered by a 1 V voltage source (V2) and contains five resistors: R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), R3 (9 Ω), R7 (100 Ω), and R8 (100 Ω).\n2.  **Connection Analysis:**\n    *   A wire connects the positive terminal of the voltage source directly to both terminals of resistor R1. This creates a short circuit across R1, meaning R1 is bypassed and can be ignored for the calculation.\n    *   Resistor R2 is connected between the positive terminal and a central node (let's call it Y).\n    *   Resistor R8 is also connected between the positive terminal and another central node (let's call it Z).\n    *   A wire connects node Y and node Z. This means that the other ends of R2 and R8 are connected, placing them in parallel with each other.\n    *   Resistor R3 is connected between node Y and the ground terminal.\n    *   Resistor R7 is connected between node Z and the ground terminal.\n    *   Because nodes Y and Z are connected, R3 and R7 are also in parallel with each other.\n3.  **Simplified Circuit Structure:** The circuit simplifies to two parallel resistor groups connected in series with each other.\n    *   **Group 1:** Resistor R2 (7 Ω) in parallel with Resistor R8 (100 Ω).\n    *   **Group 2:** Resistor R3 (9 Ω) in parallel with Resistor R7 (100 Ω).\n\n### Calculation of Equivalent Resistance\n\nThe equivalent resistance for each parallel group is calculated using the formula `1/R_p = 1/R_a + 1/R_b`, or for two resistors, `R_p = (R_a * R_b) / (R_a + R_b)`.\n\n1.  **Equivalent Resistance of Group 1 (R_p1):**\n    *   R_p1 = (R2 * R8) / (R2 + R8)\n    *   R_p1 = (7 Ω * 100 Ω) / (7 Ω + 100 Ω)\n    *   R_p1 = 700 / 107 Ω ≈ 6.54 Ω\n\n2.  **Equivalent Resistance of Group 2 (R_p2):**\n    *   R_p2 = (R3 * R7) / (R3 + R7)\n    *   R_p2 = (9 Ω * 100 Ω) / (9 Ω + 100 Ω)\n    *   R_p2 = 900 / 109 Ω ≈ 8.26 Ω\n\nThe total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit is the sum of the resistances of the two groups, as they are in series.\n\n3.  **Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq):**\n    *   R_eq = R_p1 + R_p2\n    *   R_eq = (700/107) + (900/109) Ω\n    *   R_eq ≈ 6.54 Ω + 8.26 Ω = 14.80 Ω\n\n### Calculation of Total Current\n\nUsing Ohm's Law, `I = V / R`, the total current (I_total) flowing from the voltage source can be calculated.\n\n*   I_total = V2 / R_eq\n*   I_total = 1 V / 14.80 Ω\n*   I_total ≈ 0.06757 A\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is approximately **0.068 A** or **68 mA**.\n\n<<<0.068 A>>>"
