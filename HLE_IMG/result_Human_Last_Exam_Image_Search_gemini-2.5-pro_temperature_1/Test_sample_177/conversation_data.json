    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\nThe Car VMT can be calculated by summing the contributions from each trip distance category. For each category, the VMT is the product of the share of total trips, the average trip distance, and the combined mode share for cars (car, 1 occupant + car, with more than 2 occupants).\n\n### 1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n\nWe use the data from Table 1 (Baseline) to calculate a weighted VMT.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (Share of Trips) × 1 (Avg. Distance) × 0.53 (Car Share) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 4 × 0.81 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.85 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 20 × 0.89 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### 2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n\nNext, we use the data from Table 2 (Proposed) to calculate the new weighted VMT.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 1 × 0.03 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 4 × 0.27 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.41 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 20 × 0.49 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the VMT values from the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction of Car VMT is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
