    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe first step is a thermal 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the substituted cyclobutene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal electrocyclic reaction involving 4π electrons proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion. This means the substituents on the breaking C-C sigma bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\nThe starting material is a single enantiomer of a chiral cyclobutene, with a stereocenter at C4 (methyl group with a wedge, methoxy group with a dash). A conrotatory ring opening is a stereospecific process. The two possible conrotatory modes (both groups rotating clockwise vs. both rotating counter-clockwise) are not equivalent for a chiral starting material and will lead to two different, diastereomeric, chiral dienes.\n\nBased on the rules for stereochemistry in conrotatory openings, a cyclobutene with *trans* substituents on the breaking sigma bond (here, the Me and OMe at C4 are *trans*) will lead to dienes where the substituents have an E,E or Z,Z relationship. The two modes of conrotatory opening will thus produce two diastereomeric dienes, one with an (E)-like geometry and one with a (Z)-like geometry at the newly formed double bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe second step is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene intermediates formed in Step 1 and the dienophile, ethyl acrylate. The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion.\n\nThe endo rule dictates the stereochemistry of the dienophile's substituent (the -CO₂Et group) relative to the diene. In the transition state, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile is positioned under the π-system of the diene.\n\n**Identifying the Products**\n\n1.  **Formation of Two Dienes:** The two modes of conrotatory ring opening of the single enantiomer starting material produce two diastereomeric dienes (let's call them Diene-E and Diene-Z).\n2.  **Formation of Two Products:** Each of these dienes then undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   Diene-E reacts to form one major endo product.\n    *   Diene-Z reacts to form another major endo product, which is a diastereomer of the first product.\n3.  **Analyzing the Product Structures:** The products labeled A, B, C, and D are potential endo products (with E, F, G, and H likely being the corresponding exo products).\n    *   Products **A** and **B** have a *trans*-like geometry in the cyclohexene double bond, which would arise from an (E)-diene.\n    *   Products **C** and **D** have a *cis*-like geometry in the cyclohexene double bond, which would arise from a (Z)-diene.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The starting material has the stereochemistry Me(wedge) and OMe(dash) at the quaternary center. The reaction sequence is stereospecific, so we expect this relative stereochemistry to be reflected in the products. Products **A** and **C** both show the Me group as a wedge and the OMe group as a dash. Products B and D have the opposite configuration. Therefore, the products must be A and C.\n    *   Product **A** is the endo adduct from the (E)-diene.\n    *   Product **C** is the endo adduct from the (Z)-diene.\n\nThus, the two products formed from the reaction sequence are the diastereomers A and C.\n\nThe correct final answer is **A and C**.\n\n<<<A and C>>>"
