    "Based on the melody and chord progression provided in the sheet music, the jazz standard is \"Ceora,\" composed by the trumpeter Lee Morgan.\n\nThe piece was first released in 1967 and is commonly played in the key of Ab major, although the A-section, as shown in the image, is in the relative key of F minor. The distinctive opening melody of C, F, G, Ab over an F minor chord is a signature element of the tune. The subsequent chord progression in the provided music also aligns with the known changes for \"Ceora.\"\n\n<<<Ceora by Lee Morgan>>>"
