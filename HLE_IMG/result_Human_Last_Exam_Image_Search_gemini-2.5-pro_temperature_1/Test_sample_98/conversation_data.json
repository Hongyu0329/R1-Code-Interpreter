    "Based on the visual characteristics of the medallion, archaeologists would most likely ascribe it to the Roman Imperial period, specifically from the 1st to the 3rd century AD.\n\nThe figure on the left with ram's horns is identifiable as Jupiter Ammon, a deity that combined the Roman Jupiter with the Egyptian god Ammon. This syncretic god was worshipped in various parts of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe practice of depicting facing busts on medallions was also common during the Roman Imperial period, often featuring the emperor and a family member. For instance, a medallion with the busts of Emperor Severus Alexander and his mother, Julia Mamaea, dates to around 230 AD.\n\nMore specifically, a large marble medallion, or *clipeus*, of Jupiter-Ammon discovered in the Roman provincial forum of Tarraco, Spain, is dated to the 1st century AD. Other Roman artifacts depicting Jupiter Ammon have been dated to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. Given the stylistic similarities to these examples, the medallion in question can be confidently placed within this broader timeframe.\n\nWithout a specific inscription or archaeological context for this particular medallion, a more precise date is difficult to determine. However, the iconography is consistent with artifacts from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD.\n\n<<<1st to 3rd century AD>>>"
