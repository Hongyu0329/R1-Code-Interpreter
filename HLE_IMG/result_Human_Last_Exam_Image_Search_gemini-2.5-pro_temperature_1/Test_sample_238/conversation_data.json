    "The black organism in the photo is a type of parasitic fungus known as pin mold, most likely *Spinellus fusiger*. This fungus is characterized by its tiny, pin-like structures that grow on the caps of other mushrooms.\n\nThese structures are actually sporangiophores, which are reproductive stalks that bear spores in a small, spherical case at the tip. *Spinellus fusiger*, also called Bonnet Mould, is a common parasite and appears as pale brownish-yellow, erect stalks. It is known to be a facultative parasite, particularly on mushroom species like *Mycena* and *Collybia*. The larger fungus it is growing on in the photo is a type of bracket fungus, which are also known hosts for parasitic molds.\n\nThe life cycle of *Spinellus fusiger* begins when its spores land on a suitable host mushroom. The spores then germinate, and their hyphae (fungal threads) penetrate the host to draw nutrients. This eventually leads to the growth of the visible pin-like sporangiophores.\n\n<<<Spinellus fusiger>>>"
