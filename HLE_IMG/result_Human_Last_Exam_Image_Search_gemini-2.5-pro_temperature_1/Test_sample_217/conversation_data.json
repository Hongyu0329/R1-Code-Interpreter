    "The cuneiform sign depicted in the image represents \"house\" or \"temple\".\n\nThe sign is known as √â in Sumerian. An image from a relief found in Ur, dating to 2500 BCE, shows an early form of this sign that is a very close match to the one in the question. This pictograph represents a building. Over time, the sign evolved and became more abstract, but its core meaning remained. The term √â was used for both a house and a temple, and it formed the basis for other related words, such as √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), meaning \"palace\" or literally \"big house\". This sign was fundamental in the administrative and religious texts of the third millennium BCE.\n\n<<<D>>>"
