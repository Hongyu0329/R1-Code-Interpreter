    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece minted under King Louis XV for the French colonies in America. Specifically, these coins were intended for circulation in Louisiana, Acadia, and Canada (New France).\n\nThe coin shown in the image, identifiable by the \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" inscription and the likeness of Louis XV, was part of an issue struck in 1721 and 1722. These copper coins were minted in La Rochelle and Rouen. An edict in June 1721 authorized their production.\n\nThe introduction of these coins was managed by the Company of the Indies, a private trading company. However, the colonists in New France were reluctant to use this denomination, leading to the return of a large portion of the coinage to France in 1726. Subsequently, many of these coins were sent to Louisiana to circulate at a lower value of 6 deniers.\n\n<<<New France (specifically Canada, Acadia, and Louisiana)>>>"
