    "Based on the visual evidence and common flag conventions, the flag snippet belongs to Yemen.\n\nThe image displays a flag with horizontal stripes in the order of black, white, and red from top to bottom. While no current country has this as its official flag, the flag of Yemen uses the exact same Pan-Arab colors in the reverse order: red, white, and black. It is a common trope in guessing games to present a slightly altered or tricky version of the subject. In this case, the Yemeni flag is shown upside down.\n\nThe flag of Yemen, a simple tricolor, was adopted on May 22, 1990, upon the unification of North and South Yemen. The red stripe is said to represent the blood of martyrs and unity, the white stripe symbolizes a bright future, and the black stripe stands for the dark past.\n\nOther nations, such as Egypt and Syria, also use a red, white, and black tricolor, but their flags include additional symbols like the Eagle of Saladin or green stars. The clean appearance of the snippet makes the simple tricolor of Yemen the most likely candidate, albeit inverted.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
