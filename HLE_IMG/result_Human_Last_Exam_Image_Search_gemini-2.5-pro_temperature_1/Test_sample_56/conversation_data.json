    "The artist of the painting is Safet Zec, a Bosnian painter and graphic designer. The artwork is often titled \"La Vocation\" or \"The Vocation.\"\n\nBorn in Rogatica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1943, Safet Zec graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Sarajevo and later from the University of Fine Arts in Belgrade. In the 1970s, he became a prominent figure in a movement known as \"Poetic Realism.\" Due to the Bosnian War, he left Sarajevo in 1992 and relocated to Italy.\n\nZec's work is characterized by a blend of traditional techniques with deep emotional resonance. His paintings often explore themes of memory, home, and the passage of time, frequently featuring interiors with open windows and doors that lead to disparate landscapes, much like in the painting provided. He has had over 70 solo exhibitions worldwide, and his art is featured in major international galleries and private collections. Today, he lives and works between Venice, Sarajevo, Paris, and Poƒçitelj.\n\n<<<Safet Zec>>>"
