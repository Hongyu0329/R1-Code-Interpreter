    "The sheet music provided is for the song \"After You've Gone\".\n\n**Title:** After You've Gone.\n\n**Musical Style:** The song is a popular Tin Pan Alley tune that has become a prominent jazz standard. It was originally conceived with a blues tempo and feel, but its structure has proven adaptable to various interpretations, including foxtrot, Dixieland, swing, and bebop. The composition is noted for its harmonically active nature and a 20-measure chorus, which was unusual for its time.\n\n**Country of Origin:** \"After You've Gone\" is an American song. It was composed in 1918 by Turner Layton, with lyrics by Henry Creamer, both of whom were African American performers and songwriters from the United States. The song was first introduced to audiences at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York and was popularized by a recording from Marion Harris in the same year.\n\n<<<After You've Gone, Jazz/Blues, United States>>>"
