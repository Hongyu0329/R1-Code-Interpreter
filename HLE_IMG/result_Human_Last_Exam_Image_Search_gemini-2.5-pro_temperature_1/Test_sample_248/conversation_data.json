    "The image displays several species of invertebrates in a rocky intertidal zone. To determine whether the photograph was taken on the Atlantic or Pacific coast, it is necessary to identify a species that is exclusive to one of these regions.\n\nThe photograph includes acorn barnacles, small dark-colored snails, and a larger, light-colored snail. The small, dark snails are identifiable as the common periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*). This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It is now abundant on rocky shores from New Jersey north to Newfoundland, Canada. While there are mentions of *Littorina littorea* on the west coast of the United States, its established and abundant invasive range is along the North Atlantic coast.\n\nThe larger snail is consistent in appearance with the Atlantic dog whelk (*Nucella lapillus*). This predatory sea snail is found on the rocky shores of the North Atlantic, including Europe and the North American coast. Like the common periwinkle, its range in North America is on the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe presence of a dense population of *Littorina littorea*, a dominant herbivore in the North Atlantic intertidal zone, is a strong indicator of the photograph's origin. This species is a diagnostic species for the North Atlantic rocky intertidal ecosystem. Since *Littorina littorea* is a well-established invasive species on the Atlantic coast and not a native or established species on the Pacific coast, its presence definitively indicates the photograph was taken on the Atlantic coast.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
