    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Based on the reactants and the final product, the reaction sequence can be deduced as follows:\n\n1.  **Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene:** The first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). Benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo such isomerizations upon UV irradiation. This reaction can be classified as a photochemically allowed intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. The fluorination of the benzene ring is known to promote this specific isomerization pathway towards the Dewar-benzene structure.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The second step is the reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, where one of the double bonds of the Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring. This type of reaction is photochemically allowed and proceeds in a concerted fashion. The resulting product is the tetracyclic compound shown.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a valence isomerization (intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition) and an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A valence isomerization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
