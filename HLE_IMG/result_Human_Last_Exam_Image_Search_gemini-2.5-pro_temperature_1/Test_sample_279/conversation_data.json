    "Based on the location of the lesion shown in the image, it corresponds to a G.V. Black Class I classification.\n\nThe image displays a molar tooth with a dark lesion in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (biting) surface, surrounding an existing amalgam filling. According to the G.V. Black classification system, one of the most widely used methods for categorizing carious lesions, a Class I cavity is defined as one that affects the pits and fissures of the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars.\n\nThe decay seen around the existing filling is known as recurrent or secondary caries. However, the classification is based on the anatomical location of the lesion. Since the caries is confined to the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface, it is categorized as Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
