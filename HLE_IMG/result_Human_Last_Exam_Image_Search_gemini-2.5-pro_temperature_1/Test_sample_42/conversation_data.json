    "The icon in question is a fresco located in the Sopoćani Monastery in Serbia, a foundation of King Uroš I built in the second half of the 13th century. The monastery's frescoes are considered a high point in Serbian and Byzantine art of the period.\n\nBased on information about the frescoes within the Sopoćani Monastery, the figure depicted is the Prophet Moses. Historical and art historical sources confirm the presence of a fresco of the Prophet Moses on the south wall of the chapel, alongside figures of the prophets Solomon and Aaron.\n\nIn Orthodox iconography, the Prophet Moses is typically depicted as an elderly, white-bearded man. While he is most famously shown holding the Tablets of the Law, depictions of him holding a prophetic scroll also exist, which is consistent with the image provided. The style of the fresco, with its tall figures that appear both physically strong and spiritually wise, is characteristic of the Sopoćani school.\n\n<<<D>>>"
