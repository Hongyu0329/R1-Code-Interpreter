    "There are several contradictions in the provided Kakuro puzzle's clues which make it logically unsolvable as presented.\n\n1.  **Impossible Sum:** The clue \"28\" points to a row with only three empty cells. The highest possible sum for three distinct digits from 1 to 9 is 9 + 8 + 7 = 24. Therefore, a sum of 28 is impossible in three cells.\n2.  **Contradictory Clues:** In the right part of the puzzle, there is a column of two cells that must sum to 5 (from the \"/ 5\" clue). Let's call these cells R2C5 and R3C5. So, R2C5 + R3C5 = 5. The row to the right of the central black square also consists of two cells (R3C4 and R3C5) and must sum to 15 (from the \"\\ 15\" clue). So, R3C4 + R3C5 = 15.\n    *   For the sum of 5, the possible values for R3C5 are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n    *   If R3C5 is 1, R3C4 must be 14 (impossible).\n    *   If R3C5 is 2, R3C4 must be 13 (impossible).\n    *   If R3C5 is 3, R3C4 must be 12 (impossible).\n    *   If R3C5 is 4, R3C4 must be 11 (impossible).\n    This section of the puzzle is also impossible to solve.\n\nDue to these flaws in the puzzle's design, a valid solution cannot be reached through logical deduction.\n\nHowever, if we only consider the topmost clue, which is independent of the flawed sections, we can determine the numbers involved. The clue for the top two white squares is 17. The only pair of unique, single-digit numbers that sum to 17 is 8 and 9. Without a solvable puzzle, it is impossible to determine their correct order (whether it is 8, 9 or 9, 8).\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n<<<8,9>>>"
