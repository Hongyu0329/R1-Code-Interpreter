    "The knot in the picture is the **8₁₉ knot** in the Rolfsen table. Comparing the provided image with standard diagrams of the 8₁₉ knot confirms its identity.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as *s(K)* for a knot *K*, is an integer invariant derived from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot. For the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **-6**.\n\nIt is worth noting that a different famous knot, the Conway knot (11n34), has a Rasmussen invariant of 0. The Conway knot was famously proven to be not smoothly slice by Lisa Piccirillo using its relationship to another knot whose Rasmussen invariant was non-zero. However, the knot in the image is the 8-crossing knot 8₁₉, not the 11-crossing Conway knot.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
