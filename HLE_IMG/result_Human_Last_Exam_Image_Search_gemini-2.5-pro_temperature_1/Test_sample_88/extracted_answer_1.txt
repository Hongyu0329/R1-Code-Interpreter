Product B, with the molecular formula C12H14N2O3, is formed through a sequence of reactions beginning with the decarboxylation of the starting material to an azomethine ylide. This is followed by a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, and subsequent aromatization and oxidation of the initial adduct.
