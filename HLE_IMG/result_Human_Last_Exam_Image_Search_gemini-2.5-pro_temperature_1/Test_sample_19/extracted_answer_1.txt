1. In measure 11, the music modulates to **E major**, and then in measure 12, it begins to move towards **B minor**.
2. The modulation to E major is justified because it is the **relative major** of the home key, C-sharp minor. They share the same four-sharp key signature, making it a closely related and smooth transition.
3. The complete Roman numeral for the first beat of measure 11 is **III** (in the key of C-sharp minor).
