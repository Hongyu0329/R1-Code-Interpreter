    "The correct sequence for a mate in 2, without moving the black queens, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Ng3+**: This first move by the black knight from f1 to g3 results in a \"double check.\" The white king is simultaneously checked by the knight on g3 and, in a discovered check, by the black queen on b1 (whose path to the king was previously blocked by the knight on f1). When a king is in double check, the only legal response is to move the king. White cannot capture either checking piece or block the checks, as moving to do so would still leave the king in check from the other piece.\n\n    The white king's only available escape square is f1, as all other potential squares are controlled:\n    *   h1 is attacked by the queen on b1.\n    *   h2 is attacked by the knight on g3.\n    *   g2 is attacked by the bishop on h3.\n    *   f2 is attacked by the queen on a2.\n\n    Therefore, white is forced to play Kf1.\n\n2.  **Bg2#**: With the white king now on f1, black's bishop moves from h3 to g2, delivering the final checkmate. The king on f1 is now in check from the bishop and has no escape squares:\n    *   g1 and e1 are attacked by the queen on b1.\n    *   f2 and e2 are attacked by the queen on a2.\n    *   g2 is attacked by the bishop that just moved there.\n\n    The checking bishop cannot be captured, and the check cannot be blocked, resulting in a checkmate.\n\nThe sequence of black's moves is:\n<<<Ng3+, Bg2#>>>"
