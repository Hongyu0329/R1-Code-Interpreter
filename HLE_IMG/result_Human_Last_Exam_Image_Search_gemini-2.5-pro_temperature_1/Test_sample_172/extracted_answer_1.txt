The total power delivered to the grid is formulated as:
$P_{grid} = (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_{c}) - 0.01 \times (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_{c})^2$

The optimal compensation power required to meet the grid demand of at least 12 MW while minimizing cable losses, assuming maximum wave power generation, is:
$P{c}^{\text{opt}} \approx -1.06 , \text{MW}$

The total power delivered to the grid under these optimal conditions is:
$P_{grid} = 12.0 , \text{MW}$
