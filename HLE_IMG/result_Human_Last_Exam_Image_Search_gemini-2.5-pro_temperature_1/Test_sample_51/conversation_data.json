    "The word written in the Byzantine Greek manuscript is **μᾶλλον**.\n\nA detailed analysis of the script reveals the following letters:\n*   **μ** (mu)\n*   **α** (alpha) with a circumflex accent ( ͂ )\n*   **λ** (lambda)\n*   **λ** (lambda)\n*   **ο** (omicron)\n*   **ν** (nu)\n\nWhen transcribed, these letters form the word **μᾶλλον** (`mâllon`). This is a very common Ancient Greek adverb meaning \"more\" or \"rather\".\n\nIt appears there may have been some confusion in identifying the letters, as is common with the variations in Byzantine minuscule script. The letter combination in the middle of the word, which might have been misread, correctly forms a double lambda (λλ). The final two letters are a standard omicron (ο) and nu (ν). The circumflex accent is correctly placed over the alpha.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
