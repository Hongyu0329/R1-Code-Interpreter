    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided raster plot, the synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval are identified as follows:\n\n*   **Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts:** The synchronized bursts, which appear as dense vertical columns of firing activity across many electrodes, are centered at approximately **3 s, 17 s, 36 s, and 49 s**.\n\n*   **Inter-Burst Interval Calculation:**\n    *   The interval between the first and second burst is: 17 s - 3 s = 14 s.\n    *   The interval between the second and third burst is: 36 s - 17 s = 19 s.\n    *   The interval between the third and fourth burst is: 49 s - 36 s = 13 s.\n\n*   **Average Inter-Burst Interval:** The average of these intervals is (14 s + 19 s + 13 s) / 3 = 46 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s.\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 15 s.\n\n<<<15 s>>>"
