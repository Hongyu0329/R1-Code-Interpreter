    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper. The strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. At this standard speed, each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds. The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves, which are the prominent upward spikes of the QRS complex.\n\nBy visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, a noticeable pause, which represents the longest R-R interval, can be identified in the fourth row of the tracing, near the time mark 0:06:08.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval, the number of large squares between the peaks of the two R-waves surrounding the pause is counted. The R-wave at the beginning of the pause and the R-wave at the end of the pause are each situated on a thick vertical line of the grid. Counting the large squares between these two points reveals there are exactly 8 large squares.\n\nThe duration in seconds is calculated as follows:\n8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
