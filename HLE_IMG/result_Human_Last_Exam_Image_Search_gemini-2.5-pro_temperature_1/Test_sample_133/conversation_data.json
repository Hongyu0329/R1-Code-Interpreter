    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the compound can be identified through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion. In the spectrum, there is a prominent cluster of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. The relative intensities are approximately 34.8%, 29.0%, 12.9%, and 3.22% respectively. This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing three chlorine atoms, which has theoretical isotope peak ratios of M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) close to 27:27:9:1. While not a perfect match, it strongly suggests the presence of three chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 260 represents the molecule where all three chlorine atoms are the ³⁵Cl isotope.\n\n2.  **Base Peak and Fragmentation:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (100% relative intensity). The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•), a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds.\n\n3.  **Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak:** The fragment at m/z 225 would contain two chlorine atoms. The expected isotope pattern for a dichlorinated species is peaks at m/z 225, 227 (M+2), and 229 (M+4) with an intensity ratio of approximately 9:6:1. The provided table shows intensities for m/z 225 (100%) and m/z 227 (66.7%). The ratio 100 / 66.7 is ~1.5, perfectly matching the expected 9/6 ratio. This confirms that the base peak is a fragment containing two chlorine atoms.\n\n4.  **Sequential Fragmentation:** The spectrum also shows other significant peaks that correspond to further sequential losses of chlorine atoms:\n    *   A peak at **m/z 190** (48.4%) corresponds to the loss of a second chlorine atom from the base peak (225 - 35 = 190). This fragment, [M-2Cl]⁺, contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   A peak at **m/z 155** (16.1%) corresponds to the loss of the third chlorine atom (190 - 35 = 155). This is the core hydrocarbon fragment, [M-3Cl]⁺.\n\n5.  **Molecular Formula Determination:** The fragmentation pattern (M⁺ -> [M-Cl]⁺ -> [M-2Cl]⁺ -> [M-3Cl]⁺) confirms the presence of three chlorine atoms attached to a hydrocarbon skeleton with a mass of 155 u. The formula for a CₓHᵧ fragment with mass 155 is C₁₂H₁₁. Therefore, the molecular formula of the original compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n6.  **Structure and IUPAC Name:** The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ has six degrees of unsaturation, suggesting the presence of aromatic and/or other ring structures and double bonds. A plausible structure that fits this formula and fragmentation pattern is an isomer of trichlorophenylcyclohexene.\n\nA possible systematic IUPAC name for a compound with this formula is:\n\n**1-(2,4,5-Trichlorophenyl)cyclohex-1-ene**\n\n<<<1-(2,4,5-Trichlorophenyl)cyclohex-1-ene>>>"
