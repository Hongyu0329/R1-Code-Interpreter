    "The figure leaving the chariot is **Hippodameia**.\n\nThis South Italian red-figure vase depicts the conclusion of the myth of Pelops and Hippodameia. The scene illustrates the moment after Pelops has won a chariot race against Hippodameia's father, King Oenomaus of Pisa.\n\nThe key elements identifying the scene are:\n*   **The Fallen Figure**: The naked man lying on the ground is King Oenomaus, who would challenge and kill all of his daughter's suitors in a chariot race. According to the myth, Pelops won by sabotaging the king's chariot, causing it to crash and kill him.\n*   **The Charioteer**: The figure driving the chariot, identifiable by his ornate, patterned sleeve and Phrygian-style cap, is Pelops. Pelops was a prince from Lydia, and this \"eastern\" attire is a common attribute in Greek art.\n*   **The Figure Leaving the Chariot**: The woman being carried away in the chariot is Hippodameia, whose hand in marriage was the prize of the race. Her dynamic pose reflects the drama of her father's violent death and her own \"abduction\" by Pelops.\n*   **The Wing**: The large wing visible above the horses alludes to the divine aid Pelops received. In some versions of the myth, the sea god Poseidon, who was Pelops' lover, gave him a chariot with winged horses to ensure his victory.\n\nThe vase's ornate style is characteristic of Apulian pottery from the 4th century BCE, a region where mythological scenes, particularly those featured in Greek tragedies, were popular subjects.\n\n<<<Hippodameia>>>"
