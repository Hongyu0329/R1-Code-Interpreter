    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided images and supporting information from search results, the rock specimens can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and forms when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano. Its frothy texture comes from gas bubbles trapped as the rock rapidly cooled. While similar to pumice, scoria has thicker vesicle walls and is denser. The red color is often due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption.\n\n*   **Specimen I is Breccia.** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks that have been cemented together in a finer matrix. This distinguishes it from conglomerate, which has rounded fragments. The angular nature of the clasts indicates that the broken pieces did not travel far before being lithified into a new rock. Given the context of the other volcanic specimens, this is likely a volcanic breccia, formed from explosive volcanic activity.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This specimen is a light-colored, porous volcanic rock. It forms from frothy, gas-filled lava that cools very quickly. Its high number of vesicles gives it a very low density, and some pumice is so light it can float on water. It is typically white to gray in color.\n\n*   **Specimen K is Pegmatite.** This rock is an igneous rock characterized by its very large, coarse-grained crystals. Igneous rocks that cool slowly deep within the Earth's crust develop large, visible crystals. Pegmatites are known for having exceptionally large crystals, often containing minerals like feldspar, quartz, and mica. The interlocking, large-crystal texture of specimen K is indicative of this slow cooling process, forming a phaneritic (coarse-grained) rock.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
