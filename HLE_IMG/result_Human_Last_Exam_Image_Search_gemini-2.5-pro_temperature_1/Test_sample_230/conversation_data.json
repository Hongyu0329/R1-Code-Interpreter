    "The title of the 19th-century painting is **\"A windmill burning, by night\"** by the Dutch artist **Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate** (1803-1856).\n\nHendrik Gerrit ten Cate was a painter known for his dramatic, moonlit cityscapes and landscapes, a popular genre during the Romantic period. His works often featured fires, creating a strong contrast between light and shadow. Multiple auction records and art dealership listings confirm the existence of a painting with the title \"A windmill burning, by night\" or the Dutch title \"Brandende molen bij nacht\". One version of this painting is noted as being signed and dated 1851. While several of his paintings depict windmills and nighttime scenes, the specific combination of a burning windmill under a dark, cloudy sky aligns with the provided image fragment.\n\n<<<A windmill burning, by night>>>"
