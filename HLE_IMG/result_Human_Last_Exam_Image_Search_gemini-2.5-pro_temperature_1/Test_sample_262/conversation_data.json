    "The operational lifetime of light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is a critical performance parameter, strongly influenced by the chemical and photochemical stability of the emitter complex. In the case of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes, the key structural difference lies in the fluorination pattern of the 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) cyclometalating ligands.\n\nA well-established degradation pathway for such complexes, particularly for those emitting in the blue to green region of the spectrum, involves the C-H bond located at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring relative to the Ir-C bond. This bond can be susceptible to cleavage under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. A common and effective strategy to enhance the stability and, consequently, the lifetime of these emitters is to replace this vulnerable ortho C-H bond with a much stronger C-F bond. This substitution blocks the aforementioned degradation pathway.\n\nAnalyzing the four complexes:\n*   **Complex 1 and Complex 2:** Both lack a fluorine atom at the crucial ortho-position of the phenyl ring. They possess a C-H bond at this location, making them more susceptible to degradation.\n*   **Complex 3 and Complex 4:** Both feature a fluorine atom at the ortho-position, replacing the weaker C-H bond. This ortho-fluorination is known to enhance the stability of the complex.\n\nTherefore, complexes that do not have the stabilizing ortho-fluorine substituent are expected to be less stable and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes. While general fluorination can have complex and sometimes detrimental effects on lifetime in LECs due to other potential degradation mechanisms, the targeted substitution at the ortho-position of the ppy ligand is a known strategy to improve intrinsic molecular stability against specific degradation routes.\n\nBased on this analysis, Complexes 1 and 2 are expected to have shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 3 and 4.\n\n<<<E>>>"
