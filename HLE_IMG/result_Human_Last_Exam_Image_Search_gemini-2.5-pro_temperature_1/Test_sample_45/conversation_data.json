    "An analysis of the provided image reveals that the tiling possesses multiple orders of rotational symmetry. This type of tiling is known as an aperiodic tiling, as it lacks translational symmetry.\n\nSpecifically, the following rotational symmetries can be observed in the pattern:\n\n*   **7-fold rotational symmetry:** The centers of the dark blue heptagons serve as points of 7-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the pattern by 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) around the center of any of these heptagons leaves the tiling unchanged. Such symmetry is a known feature in some aperiodic tilings.\n\n*   **5-fold rotational symmetry:** There are distinct clusters formed by five yellowish rhombi meeting at a single point. These points are centers of 5-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 360/5, or 72 degrees, around these centers maps the tiling onto itself. Aperiodic tilings with five-fold symmetry are famously demonstrated by Penrose tilings.\n\nThe presence of rotational symmetries other than 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold is a definitive characteristic of non-periodic or aperiodic tilings. The tiling in the image is a complex example that incorporates both 7-fold and 5-fold rotational symmetries. Such tilings are constructed from a set of prototiles, in this case including heptagons, hexagons, and rhombi, that can cover a plane without gaps but only in a non-repeating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the tiling exhibits both 7-fold and 5-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold and 5-fold>>>"
