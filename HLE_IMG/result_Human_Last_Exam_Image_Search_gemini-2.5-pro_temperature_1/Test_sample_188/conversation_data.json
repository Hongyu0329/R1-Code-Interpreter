    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph shown in the figure, we can use a combination of graph decomposition and the deletion-contraction method. Let's denote the chromatic polynomial of the graph G as P(G, k), which counts the number of proper colorings of G using k colors.\n\n### Graph Structure Analysis\nThe given graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. We can observe that the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge between vertices 2 and 5 removed. This subgraph is often called a diamond graph. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Method 1: Deletion-Contraction\nA powerful technique for calculating chromatic polynomials is the deletion-contraction principle. It states that for any graph G and any edge *e* in G, the following recurrence relation holds:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nwhere:\n*   **G - e** is the graph G with the edge *e* deleted.\n*   **G / e** is the graph G with the edge *e* contracted.\n\nLet's choose the edge e = (3, 4).\n\n1.  **Contraction (G / e)**: When we contract the edge (3, 4), vertices 3 and 4 are merged into a single new vertex, let's call it '34'. This new vertex '34' is connected to the neighbors of 3 and 4, which are vertices 2 and 5. The original edges (1, 2) and (1, 5) remain. The resulting graph G / e has vertices {1, 2, 5, '34'} and edges {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, '34'), (5, '34')}. This forms a 4-cycle (C4). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph Cn is P(Cn, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1). For C4, this is:\n    P(C4, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1) = k(k-1)(k² - 3k + 3).\n\n2.  **Deletion (G - e)**: The graph G - e is the original graph without the edge (3, 4). This graph can be further simplified using deletion-contraction on another edge, for example f = (2, 3). This process, while valid, involves several steps.\n\n### Method 2: Direct Calculation by Decomposition\nA more direct method for this particular graph is to analyze the coloring based on the relationship between the colors of vertices 2 and 5. Let H be the subgraph induced by {2, 3, 4, 5}, which is a K4 minus the edge (2, 5). The chromatic polynomial for H is known to be P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n\nThe number of ways to color the full graph G, P(G, k), depends on how we color vertex 1, which in turn depends on the colors of its neighbors, 2 and 5.\n\n*   **Case 1: C(2) = C(5)** (Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color).\n    The number of ways to color the subgraph H such that C(2) = C(5) is equivalent to the chromatic polynomial of H with vertices 2 and 5 identified. This new graph is a K3 (triangle) on vertices {'25', 3, 4}. The polynomial is P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2). In this case, vertex 1 has k-1 color choices (any color except the one used for 2 and 5).\n    So, the number of colorings in this case is P(K3, k) × (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2).\n\n*   **Case 2: C(2) ≠ C(5)** (Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors).\n    The number of ways to color H with C(2) ≠ C(5) is P(H, k) - (Number of ways with C(2) = C(5)).\n    This is [k(k-1)(k-2)²] - [k(k-1)(k-2)] = k(k-1)(k-2)[(k-2) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3). In this case, vertex 1 has k-2 color choices (it must be different from the two distinct colors of 2 and 5).\n    So, the number of colorings is k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) × (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3).\n\nAdding the counts from both cases gives the total chromatic polynomial for G:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k² - 5k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis can be expanded to:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chromatic number of the graph is the smallest integer k for which P(G, k) > 0.\n*   P(G, 1) = 1(0)... = 0\n*   P(G, 2) = 2(1)(0)... = 0\n*   P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(3² - 4(3) + 5) = 6(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12.\nSince P(G, 3) is positive, the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)>>>"
