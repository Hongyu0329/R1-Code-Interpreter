    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, key morphological differences between males and females of these species are considered. The initial prompt specifies these are pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs on the legs) and where both sexes feed on nectar. This points towards wasps, cuckoo bees, or male bees.\n\n**Pair A: F, F**\nThe insects in pair A are cuckoo bees, which are cleptoparasites and thus females lack scopae.\n*   **A (Left):** This is a sharp-tailed cuckoo bee (*Coelioxys*). The female is characterized by a distinctly pointed, conical abdomen, which she uses to pierce the nests of host bees to lay her eggs. The individual in the image clearly displays this feature, identifying it as a **female**.\n*   **A (Right):** This is a cuckoo bee from the genus *Triepeolus*. In many *Triepeolus* species, a key difference between sexes is the coloration of the face and eyes; males often have pale or greenish eyes and sometimes yellow facial markings, while females have dark eyes and lack these markings. The bee in the photo has dark eyes and a dark face, which is characteristic of a **female**.\n\n**Pair B: M, F**\nThe insects in pair B are paper wasps (*Polistes*). While both sexes are pollinators, they exhibit clear sexual dimorphism.\n*   **B (Left):** A primary indicator of sex in *Polistes* wasps is the antennae. Males have antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. The wasp on the left clearly shows these curled antennae, identifying it as a **male**.\n*   **B (Right):** In contrast, female *Polistes* wasps have shorter, straight antennae. The wasp on the right has straight antennae, indicating it is a **female**. Females also have a stinger, which contributes to the pointed appearance of their abdomen.\n\n**Pair C: M, M**\nThe bees in pair C are from groups where males are notably different from females. Male bees do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae.\n*   **C (Left):** This bee is a long-horned bee (*Melissodes*). A definitive characteristic of males in this genus is their exceptionally long antennae, which gives them their common name. The bee pictured has the characteristically long antennae of a **male**.\n*   **C (Right):** This bee also displays male characteristics. It is very hairy, and its abdomen is rounded at the tip. Male bees lack a stinger and often have an extra abdominal segment compared to females. They also lack the pollen-collecting scopae found on females of non-parasitic species. This individual is a **male**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct sequence of indices is:\n*   **A:** F, F (2)\n*   **B:** M, F (3)\n*   **C:** M, M (1)\n\n<<<2, 3, 1>>>"
