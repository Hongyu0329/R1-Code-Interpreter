    "The four specimens can be identified based on their physical characteristics, and then ordered by the increasing complexity of their silicate structures.\n\n### Specimen Identification\n\n*   **Specimen C (Olivine):** This specimen shows a granular, olive-green aggregate of crystals. This appearance is characteristic of olivine.\n*   **Specimen A (Tourmaline):** This is a dark, prismatic crystal with a somewhat triangular cross-section and striations along its length. This crystal habit is a defining feature of tourmaline.\n*   **Specimen B (Mica/Chlorite):** This mineral is greenish and has a platy or flaky habit, breaking into thin sheets. This is characteristic of sheet silicates like mica or chlorite.\n*   **Specimen D (Quartz):** This is a translucent, terminated crystal that lacks cleavage. This appearance is typical for quartz.\n\n### Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nSilicate minerals are classified based on how their fundamental building blocks, the silica tetrahedra (SiOâ‚„), are linked together. The complexity of the structure increases as more oxygen atoms in each tetrahedron are shared with neighboring tetrahedra.\n\nThe order from least to most complex is as follows:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** The silica tetrahedra are isolated and linked only by metal cations. Olivine (Specimen C) is a nesosilicate, representing the simplest structure.\n2.  **Cyclosilicates (Ring Silicates):** Tetrahedra are linked to form rings. Tourmaline (Specimen A) is a cyclosilicate, typically forming six-membered rings. This structure is more complex than isolated tetrahedra.\n3.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheet Silicates):** Tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms, forming two-dimensional sheets. Mica (Specimen B) is a classic example of a phyllosilicate, which explains its perfect basal cleavage into thin sheets.\n4.  **Tectosilicates (Framework Silicates):** Each tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra, creating a continuous three-dimensional framework. Quartz (Specimen D) is a tectosilicate, which results in a very strong and stable structure.\n\n### Final Order\n\nBased on the identification and the hierarchy of silicate structures, the correct order from least to most complex is:\n\n**C, A, B, D**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
