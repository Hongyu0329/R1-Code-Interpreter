    "The image displays the emission spectrum of an element. Each colored vertical line corresponds to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element's electrons as they transition between energy levels. To identify the element, we must match this unique pattern of lines to the known spectrum of an element.\n\nBy comparing the pattern in the image—which shows multiple strong lines in the blue, green, yellow, and red parts of the spectrum—to the known emission spectra of various elements, we can identify a match. The specific pattern of prominent lines at approximately 447 nm (blue-violet), 471 nm (blue), 492 nm (blue-green), 502 nm (green), 587 nm (yellow-orange), and 668 nm (red) is the characteristic signature of Helium.\n\nThe following Python code defines these characteristic spectral lines for Helium and prints them to demonstrate the match.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element based on its characteristic spectral lines.\n    The provided image shows the emission spectrum for Helium.\n    This function stores and prints the prominent visible lines for Helium\n    to confirm the identification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the prominent visible emission lines of Helium (He I)\n    # Wavelengths are in nanometers (nm).\n    helium_spectra = {\n        \"element\": \"Helium\",\n        \"lines\": [\n            {\"wavelength\": 447.1, \"color\": \"Blue-Violet\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Strong\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 471.3, \"color\": \"Blue\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Faint\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 492.2, \"color\": \"Blue-Green\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Medium\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 501.6, \"color\": \"Green\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Strong\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 587.6, \"color\": \"Yellow-Orange\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Very Strong\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 667.8, \"color\": \"Red\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Very Strong\"},\n            {\"wavelength\": 706.5, \"color\": \"Red\", \"relative_intensity\": \"Strong\"}\n        ]\n    }\n\n    element_name = helium_spectra[\"element\"]\n    print(f\"The spectral lines in the image belong to the element: {element_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is confirmed by matching the image to Helium's known prominent spectral lines in the visible range:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"{'Wavelength (nm)':<20} | {'Color':<15} | {'Relative Intensity'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    for line in helium_spectra[\"lines\"]:\n        # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\", \n        # which is interpreted here as showing the data used for identification.\n        print(f\"{line['wavelength']:<20.1f} | {line['color']:<15} | {line['relative_intensity']}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
