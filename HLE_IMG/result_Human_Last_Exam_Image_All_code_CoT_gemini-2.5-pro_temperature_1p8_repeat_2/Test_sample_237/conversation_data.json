    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle. My plan is to identify the specific species based on its distinct markings and then provide its scientific name using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Analyze visual features:** The insect is a beetle with long antennae, characteristic of the Cerambycidae family (longhorn beetles). It has a black body and a prominent reddish-orange band across the top part of its elytra (wing covers).\n2.  **Identify the species:** Based on these features—the elongated body, long antennae, and the specific heart-shaped reddish marking at the base of the black elytra—the beetle is identified as *Stictoleptura cordigera*.\n3.  **Create Python script:** I will write a Python script to print a confirmation that an animal is present and then state its scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the provided image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  common_name = \"Heart-marked Longhorn Beetle\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura cordigera\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in the image.\")\n    print(f\"It appears to be a {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The animal's scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal could be identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
