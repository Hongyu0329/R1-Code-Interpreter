    description = """
The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L to M to N) of a process called cytorrhysis in a filamentous cell, likely a fungal hypha.

Cytorrhysis is the inward collapse of a cell's wall resulting from a critical loss of turgor pressure (the internal pressure of water against the cell wall).

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:
1.  Panel L: The filament is mostly straight and the cells appear turgid (full of water). The arrowhead points to a specific subapical cell which is about to undergo collapse.
2.  Panel M: The indicated cell has lost turgor pressure. As a result, its walls can no longer support its structure and have begun to buckle inward.
3.  Panel N: The cell has completely collapsed, causing the entire filament to bend sharply at that weakened point.

This process demonstrates the critical role of turgor pressure in maintaining the structural integrity of cells with cell walls.
