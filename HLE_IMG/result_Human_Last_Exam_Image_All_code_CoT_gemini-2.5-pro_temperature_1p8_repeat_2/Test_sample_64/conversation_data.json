    "This image depicts a biological process in a filamentous organism, likely a fungal hypha. I will write a Python script to print the step-by-step description of this process.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image panels (L, M, N):** The panels show a sequence of events over time. The subject is a series of cells forming a filament. An arrowhead points to a specific location in each panel.\n2.  **Observe the changes:**\n    *   In panel **L**, the filament is relatively straight. The cell indicated by the arrow appears normal and turgid, although a slight constriction is visible.\n    *   In panel **M**, the cell wall at the arrow's location has started to collapse inward. The filament begins to bend.\n    *   In panel **N**, the collapse is much more severe. The cell has buckled significantly, causing a sharp bend in the filament.\n3.  **Identify the process:** This inward collapse of the cell wall is caused by a rapid and catastrophic loss of internal water pressure, known as turgor pressure. This specific phenomenon, where the cell wall itself collapses, is called **cytorrhysis**. It is a consequence of severe water stress leading to a loss of cell rigidity.\n4.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will use a `print` statement to output a clear and structured explanation of the observed process.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the biological process depicted in the image panels L, M, and N.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Process Depicted: Cytorrhysis (Cell Collapse due to Turgor Loss)\"\n    description = \"\"\"\nThe image displays a time-lapse sequence (L to M to N) of a process called cytorrhysis in a filamentous cell, likely a fungal hypha.\n\nCytorrhysis is the inward collapse of a cell's wall resulting from a critical loss of turgor pressure (the internal pressure of water against the cell wall).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sequence:\n1.  Panel L: The filament is mostly straight and the cells appear turgid (full of water). The arrowhead points to a specific subapical cell which is about to undergo collapse.\n2.  Panel M: The indicated cell has lost turgor pressure. As a result, its walls can no longer support its structure and have begun to buckle inward.\n3.  Panel N: The cell has completely collapsed, causing the entire filament to bend sharply at that weakened point.\n\nThis process demonstrates the critical role of turgor pressure in maintaining the structural integrity of cells with cell walls.\n\"\"\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"-\" * len(title))\n    print(description)\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Cytorrhysis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
