    "Based on the chemical structure provided, I will identify the name of the alkaloid compound. The molecule is a tetracyclic alkaloid containing two nitrogen atoms and a ketone functional group. This structure is a known derivative of matrine. I will write a simple python script to print its common name.\n\n```python\n# The chemical structure provided is that of an alkaloid compound.\n# This compound is an oxidized derivative of matrine.\n# The script will print the name of this compound.\n\ncompound_name = \"Oxomatrine\"\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Oxomatrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
