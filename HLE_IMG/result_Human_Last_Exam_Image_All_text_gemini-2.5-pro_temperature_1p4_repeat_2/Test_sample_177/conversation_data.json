    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = ((Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT) * 100%\n\n### Step 1: Understand the calculation for VMT\nVehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is the total mileage driven by vehicles. To calculate the total Car VMT, we need to consider the number of car trips in each distance category and multiply it by the average distance for that category. Since the total number of trips is constant between scenarios, we can calculate a representative VMT value for an average set of 100 trips.\n\nThe formula to calculate the representative VMT for each scenario is:\nVMT = Σ [ (Share of total trips for category) × (Car mode share for category) × (Average trip distance for category) ]\nwhere the sum (Σ) is over all four distance categories.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Car VMT:** We must sum the mode shares for both car categories: `car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`.\n*   **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** The question is about VMT, not Person Miles Traveled. This means the number of occupants in the car is irrelevant to the calculation. A 10-mile trip is 10 vehicle-miles regardless of occupancy. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** We must use the data for each distance category separately and then sum them. Simply using the \"Total\" column would be incorrect as it doesn't account for the different mileages of each trip category.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT\nFirst, we find the total car mode share for each distance category in Table 1.\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53% (or 0.53)\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT contribution from each category:\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** (48% of trips) × (53% by car) × (1 mile avg. distance) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544 miles\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** (22% of trips) × (81% by car) × (4 miles avg. distance) = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128 miles\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** (14% of trips) × (85% by car) × (7.5 miles avg. distance) = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925 miles\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** (16% of trips) × (89% by car) × (20 miles avg. distance) = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480 miles\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077 miles** (per average set of trips).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT\nFirst, we find the total car mode share for each distance category in Table 2.\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n\nNow, we calculate the VMT contribution from each category:\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** (48% of trips) × (3% by car) × (1 mile avg. distance) = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144 miles\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** (22% of trips) × (27% by car) × (4 miles avg. distance) = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376 miles\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** (14% of trips) × (41% by car) × (7.5 miles avg. distance) = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305 miles\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** (16% of trips) × (49% by car) × (20 miles avg. distance) = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680 miles\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505 miles** (per average set of trips).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT\nUsing the VMT values calculated in the previous steps:\n*   **Baseline Car VMT** = 4.7077\n*   **Proposed Car VMT** = 2.2505\n\n**VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n**Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100%\nPercentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
