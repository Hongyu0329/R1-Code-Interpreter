    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue is: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy.\n*   A reverse image search or recognition of the person identifies the man on the right as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n*   Searching for \"Nikita Kucherov award June 20 2019\" confirms that he was at the NHL Awards ceremony on June 19, 2019 (the date can vary slightly depending on the source and time zone).\n*   At this ceremony, Kucherov won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players).\n*   In sports terminology, winning three significant achievements or awards in a single season is often metaphorically called a \"hat-trick.\" Thus, the picture depicts a person who has achieved a \"hat-trick\" of awards. So, X Y could be \"Hat-trick\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical or scientific fact. We need to find a connection between \"Hat-trick\" and mercury salts.\n*   The key word in \"hat-trick\" is \"hat\".\n*   Historically, mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) were used in the process of making felt hats. This process was called \"carroting.\"\n*   The workers who made these hats, known as \"hatters,\" were often exposed to mercury vapors, which led to mercury poisoning. This poisoning caused severe neurological damage, with symptoms including tremors, irritability, and mental confusion. This is the origin of the English idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   The use of mercury in hat-making was eventually banned in many countries during the 20th century due to its toxicity. Therefore, this manufacturing process has \"almost ceased to be used.\"\n\n**Step 3: Combine the analyses of both clues.**\n*   The term \"Hat-trick\" perfectly connects both clues.\n*   Clue 1: The image shows the celebration of Nikita Kucherov's figurative \"hat-trick\" of NHL awards in 2019.\n*   Clue 2: The term \"hat-trick\" contains the word \"hat.\" The historical process of making felt hats involved mercury salts and was performed by hatters. This process has been discontinued due to its toxicity, fitting the description \"has almost ceased to be used.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe term \"X Y\" that satisfies both parts of the riddle is \"Hat-trick\".\n\n<<<Hat-trick>>>"
