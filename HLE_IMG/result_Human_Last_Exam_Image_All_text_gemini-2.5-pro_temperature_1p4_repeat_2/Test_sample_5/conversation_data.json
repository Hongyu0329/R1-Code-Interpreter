    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Form:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected), which is standard for piano music.\n2.  **Key Signature:** There are three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The piece begins and centers around C minor chords (C-E♭-G), strongly suggesting the key is C minor.\n3.  **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time). The tempo marking is a metronome speed of quarter note = 80.\n4.  **Dynamics:** The piece exhibits dramatic changes in volume. It starts quietly (*p*, piano), then suddenly becomes loud (*f*, forte) in measure 3. It then drops to *mp* (mezzo-piano) in measure 4 and rises to *mf* (mezzo-forte) in measure 8. Such extreme dynamic contrast is a hallmark of Romantic-era music.\n5.  **Melodic and Rhythmic Features:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, memorable, and somber descending melodic line in the right hand: G-F-E♭-D-C. The left hand provides a simple C minor chordal accompaniment.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is an abrupt change in character. Both hands play loud, fast, and rhythmically driving figures. The right hand plays rapid descending arpeggios, while the left hand plays powerful broken octaves and chords.\n    *   **Overall Style:** The combination of a lyrical, melancholic theme with subsequent bursts of virtuosic, passionate, and chordal passages is highly characteristic of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n6.  **Identification:** The key of C minor, the distinct descending five-note opening melody, and the subsequent virtuosic explosion are defining features of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C minor, Op. 23, No. 7**. A comparison of this sheet music excerpt with the known score confirms that they are the same piece.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C minor, Op. 23, No. 7>>>"
