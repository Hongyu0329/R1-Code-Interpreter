    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right as C2, C3, and C4 for clarity, corresponding to the IUPAC name (which we'll confirm later).\n*   **C2 (leftmost):** This carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (H, implicit), and the rest of the carbon chain (starting with C3). These are four different groups, so C2 is a chiral center.\n*   **C3 (middle):** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), the C2 part of the chain, the C4 part of the chain, and an implicit hydrogen atom (H). These are four different groups, so C3 is a chiral center.\n*   **C4 (rightmost):** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), the C3 part of the chain, and an implicit hydrogen atom (H). These are four different groups, so C4 is a chiral center.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the groups attached to each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\nPriority is determined by the atomic number of the atoms directly attached to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C2 (leftmost):**\n1.  **Groups and Priorities:**\n    *   -OH: Oxygen (O, atomic number 8) gets the highest priority. **Priority 1**.\n    *   -C3H(Et)...: This is a carbon attached to two other carbons (in C4 and the ethyl group) and a hydrogen. **Priority 2**.\n    *   -CH3: This is a carbon attached to three hydrogens. **Priority 3**.\n    *   -H (implicit): Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number. **Priority 4**.\n2.  **3D Arrangement and Configuration:**\n    *   The drawing style implies the main carbon backbone is in the plane of the paper.\n    *   The -OH group (Priority 1) is shown on a dash, meaning it points away from the viewer.\n    *   The implicit -H atom (Priority 4) must therefore be on a wedge, pointing towards the viewer.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we look at the sequence 1 → 2 → 3. From the front, this traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) path.\n    *   **Rule:** When the lowest priority group (4) points towards the viewer, the configuration is the *opposite* of what the direction indicates. Counter-clockwise normally means S, so we assign **R**.\n    *   **Conclusion for C2: (R) configuration.**\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C3 (middle):**\n1.  **Groups and Priorities:**\n    *   -C2H(OH)CH3: The C2 atom is attached to an Oxygen (O), giving this group the highest priority among the carbon-based substituents. **Priority 1**.\n    *   -C4H(CH3)CH2NH2: The C4 atom is attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen. It has higher priority than the ethyl group because one of its branches contains a Nitrogen atom (-CH2NH2). **Priority 2**.\n    *   -CH2CH3 (ethyl): The first carbon is attached to one other carbon and two hydrogens. **Priority 3**.\n    *   -H (implicit): **Priority 4**.\n2.  **3D Arrangement and Configuration:**\n    *   The ethyl group (Priority 3) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    *   The implicit -H atom (Priority 4) must be on a dash (pointing away from the viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (4) points away, we can directly determine the configuration from the sequence 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   The path from C2 (1, left) to C4 (2, right) to the ethyl group (3, up/forward) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   **Rule:** When the lowest priority group (4) points away, counter-clockwise means S.\n    *   **Conclusion for C3: (S) configuration.**\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C4 (rightmost):**\n1.  **Groups and Priorities:**\n    *   -CH2NH2: The carbon is bonded to a Nitrogen atom (N, atomic number 7). This gives it the highest priority. **Priority 1**.\n    *   -C3H(Et)...: The C3 carbon is bonded to other carbons (C2 and ethyl group). **Priority 2**.\n    *   -CH3: The carbon is bonded only to hydrogens. **Priority 3**.\n    *   -H (implicit): **Priority 4**.\n2.  **3D Arrangement and Configuration:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 (Priority 1) is on a wedge (forward).\n    *   -CH3 (Priority 3) is on a dash (away).\n    *   The C3-C4 bond (Priority 2) and the C4-H bond (Priority 4) lie in the plane.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (H, 4) is in the plane, we can mentally rotate the molecule or use the swap method. Let's use the swap method.\n    *   Swap the positions of H (4, in plane) and CH3 (3, on dash). Now, H is on a dash (away).\n    *   In this new, imaginary arrangement, trace the path 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   The path from -CH2NH2 (1, wedge) to the -C3 group (2, plane left) to the new position of -CH3 (3, plane down) is clockwise (CW).\n    *   **Rule:** For the swapped molecule with H away, clockwise means R.\n    *   Because we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   **Conclusion for C4: (S) configuration.**\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\nThe absolute configurations of the three chiral centers, from left to right in the drawing, are R, S, and S. Based on systematic IUPAC naming (6-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylhexan-2-ol), these centers correspond to C2, C3, and C4, respectively.\n*   C2: **R**\n*   C3: **S**\n*   C4: **S**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<< (2R, 3S, 4S) >>>"
