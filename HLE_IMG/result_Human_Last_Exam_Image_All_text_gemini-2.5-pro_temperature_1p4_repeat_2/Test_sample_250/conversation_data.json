    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard's title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The first chord written is F- (F minor), and the last chord is also F, confirming that the piece is in the key of **F minor**.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, also known as \"common time,\" as indicated by the 'C' symbol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   Let's transcribe the melody of the first few measures to get a recognizable melodic phrase.\n    *   **Measure 1:** The notes are C, A♭, C, B♭. The rhythm is a quarter note followed by two eighth notes and another quarter note.\n    *   **Measure 2:** The notes are E♭ and C.\n    *   **Measure 3:** The notes are D♭ and B natural.\n    *   **Measure 4:** The notes are C and B natural.\n*   This opening melodic line is highly distinctive and is the main theme (or \"head\") of the bebop standard **\"Hot House\"**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression and Form**\n*   The piece follows a 32-bar AABA form, which is very common in jazz standards.\n    *   **A Section (first 8 bars):** F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | C7 | F- (with a 1st/2nd ending structure leading back or onward). This progression is a reharmonization, a common practice in jazz. The descending root motion from F to E to Eb to Db is a characteristic feature.\n    *   **B Section (Bridge, bars 9-16 of the chorus):** Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |. This progression is a sequence of ii-V and dominant chords moving through a cycle of fourths (D-G-C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab). This is a classic bebop bridge progression and a well-known reharmonization for the bridge section of tunes based on Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\".\n*   \"Hot House\" is famously a **contrafact** (a new melody written over an existing harmonic structure) of \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\". The chord progression in this lead sheet, especially the bridge, is a typical bebop reharmonization of that original standard, which strongly supports the identification.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Composer**\n*   The composer of \"Hot House\" is the influential bebop pianist, composer, and arranger **Tadd Dameron**. He wrote the tune in 1945, and it was famously recorded by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the unmistakable melody and the characteristic bebop-style chord reharmonization of the AABA form, the jazz standard is \"Hot House\" composed by Tadd Dameron.\n\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
