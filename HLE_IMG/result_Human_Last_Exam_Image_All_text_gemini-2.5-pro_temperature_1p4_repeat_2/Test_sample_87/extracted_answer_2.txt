The structures of the three products are:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A is the result of the main Huisgen cycloaddition product undergoing C-acetylation followed by reduction. Its structure is a tetrahydropyrrolizine core, substituted with the original amidine group on the nitrogen, a methoxycarbonyl group, and an acetyl group.
 

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
B is an oxidized version of the main Huisgen cycloaddition product. A methylene group in the pyrrolidine portion of the dihydropyrrolizine intermediate is oxidized to a carbonyl group, forming a lactam.
 

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
C is the mixed anhydride formed from the reaction of the carboxylic acid of the starting material with acetic anhydride.
