I will inspect the image, particularly the corners, to find a signature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locate and decipher the signature.**\n    In the bottom right corner of the painting, a signature is visible. Using the original image and the cropped detail images, I can discern the name \"Picasso\" followed by what appears to be a date, \"'38\".\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the artist.**\n    The signature \"Picasso\" points to the world-renowned Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso. The style of the watercolor landscape is also consistent with some of his works from that period.\n\n*   **Step 5: Fulfill the specific request for the artist's full name.**\n    The question asks not just for the common name, but the *full name*.
