    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions.**\n*   **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), a 6π-electron aromatic system, and cyclobutene, a cyclic alkene with a 2π-electron system.\n*   **Product:** A complex tetracyclic molecule. If we look closely at its structure, we can identify substructures related to the reactants. It appears to be formed by the fusion of the hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene frameworks.\n*   **Conditions:** The reaction is promoted by light (hv), indicating that it proceeds through photochemical pathways. This is a critical clue, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a Plausible Two-Step Reaction Mechanism.**\nThe question states that two pericyclic reactions occur. A direct reaction between the two starting materials to form the complex product in a single step is highly unlikely. A more plausible mechanism involves the initial transformation of one of the reactants into a reactive intermediate, which then reacts with the other molecule.\n\n*   **First Reaction:** A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to form \"Dewar benzene\". In this case, hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical reaction to form Dewar hexafluorobenzene (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction creates a strained bicyclic structure containing two isolated double bonds. This transformation involves the reorganization of the π electrons within a single molecule to form a new σ bond. This type of reaction is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**. It is a photochemically allowed process for a 6π-electron system. (It can also be described more precisely as an intramolecular [π2+π2] cycloaddition, but \"electrocyclic reaction\" is a common classification for this type of valence isomerization).\n\n*   **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, Dewar hexafluorobenzene, is highly reactive due to its strain. It possesses two double bonds. It can react with cyclobutene, which acts as an alkene. The product shows a new four-membered ring has been formed, connecting the two molecules. This is a characteristic feature of a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, a π-bond from Dewar hexafluorobenzene (a 2-electron system) reacts with the π-bond of cyclobutene (another 2-electron system) to form two new σ-bonds and a four-membered ring. This type of reaction is called a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner, which is sterically feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Types of Pericyclic Reactions.**\nBased on the two-step mechanism, we can identify the two pericyclic reactions:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** The photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar hexafluorobenzene.\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The photochemical reaction between the Dewar hexafluorobenzene intermediate and cyclobutene to form the final tetracyclic product.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Photochemical Conditions:** The 'hv' is crucial. It dictates that we must consider photochemically allowed pericyclic pathways. For example, a thermal [2+2] cycloaddition is forbidden (suprafacially), but a photochemical one is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate Recognition:** Recognizing the formation of the Dewar benzene intermediate is key to solving this problem. The structure of Dewar benzene is a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene. The final product clearly retains a modified version of this core structure.\n*   **Classification of Reactions:** Pericyclic reactions are broadly classified into electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. The two steps of this transformation fit neatly into the first two categories.\n*   **Product Structure Analysis:** The final product's connectivity confirms the proposed mechanism. It shows a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane skeleton (from Dewar benzene, with one double bond reacted) fused to a cyclobutane ring (from cyclobutene).\n\nThe two types of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<Electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
