    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling:\n\n1.  **Understand Rotational Symmetry:** Rotational symmetry describes how a shape or pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360° turn. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°.\n\n2.  **Identify the Tiles:** The tiling is composed of several distinct geometric shapes (tiles) in different colors:\n    *   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow squares.\n    *   Orange rhombi (a quadrilateral with four equal sides).\n    *   Light yellow non-regular hexagons (with two long parallel sides, two short parallel sides, and two other sides, sometimes called a \"shield\" or \"boat\" shape).\n\n3.  **Locate Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the overall symmetry of the tiling, we need to find points around which we can rotate the entire pattern and have it look unchanged. The best places to check are the centers of the most symmetrical tiles or the vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n4.  **Test for Different Orders of Symmetry:**\n    *   **2-fold symmetry (180° rotation):** We can find several points of 2-fold symmetry. For instance, the center of any orange rhombus is a point of 2-fold rotation. If you rotate the pattern 180° around the center of a rhombus, the rhombus maps onto itself, and the surrounding hexagons and squares map onto their counterparts on the opposite side.\n    *   **3-fold symmetry (120° rotation):** Look for a point where three identical features meet. There are points where the \"blunt\" ends of three of the light-yellow, non-regular \"shield\" hexagons meet. If you rotate the pattern 120° around this point, each shield hexagon rotates into the position of the next, and the entire surrounding pattern aligns perfectly. So, the tiling has 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **4-fold symmetry (90° rotation):** The most obvious candidate for a 4-fold rotation center is the center of a light-yellow square. However, if we rotate the pattern 90° around the center of a square, the adjacent orange rhombi would rotate into the positions of the light-yellow \"shield\" hexagons. Since a rhombus is not the same shape as a \"shield\" hexagon, the pattern does *not* have 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **6-fold symmetry (60° rotation):** Let's examine the center of one of the dark blue regular hexagons. A single regular hexagon has 6-fold symmetry. We need to check if the entire tiling also has 6-fold symmetry around this point.\n        *   If we rotate the pattern by 60° (360°/6) around the center of a blue hexagon, the blue hexagon itself maps perfectly onto its original position.\n        *   Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six of the light-yellow \"shield\" hexagons. A 60° rotation moves each of these \"shield\" hexagons into the position of its neighbor. Since they are all identical and oriented in the same way relative to the center, this part of the pattern also matches.\n        *   Observing the next layer of tiles (the orange rhombi and light yellow squares), we see that they also rotate perfectly into the positions of identical tiles.\n        *   This holds true for the entire infinite pattern. The tiling looks exactly the same after a 60° rotation.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The tiling has points of 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. The rotational symmetry of a pattern is defined by the highest order of rotation it possesses. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
