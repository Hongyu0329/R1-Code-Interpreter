The result should be considered invalid. Although the signal crosses the threshold within the assay's cycle cut-off (Ct = 30.8 < 40), the amplification curve is not sigmoidal. It lacks a clear exponential phase, showing a slow, linear-like drift instead. This indicates that the result is not due to true, specific amplification and is likely an artifact. Therefore, the assay for this sample failed and should be repeated.
