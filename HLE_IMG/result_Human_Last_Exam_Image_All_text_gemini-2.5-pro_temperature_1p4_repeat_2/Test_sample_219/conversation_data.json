    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph.**\nThe image displays a raster plot of neuronal activity.\n*   The **x-axis** represents time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the electrode number, from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a different recording site (or neuron).\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential (a \"firing\" or \"spike\") recorded by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify synchronized bursts.**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons fire together in a short amount of time. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical columns of black dots that span a significant portion of the y-axis. We need to identify these events and estimate their center time (timestamp).\n\nBy carefully examining the graph from left to right, we can identify six such events. While four are very prominent, two are less dense but still represent clear, synchronized activity compared to the sparse background firing. It is more thorough to include all six.\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** A prominent burst occurs near the beginning. It starts around 1.5 s and ends around 3.5 s. The center timestamp is approximately **2.5 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** Another strong burst is visible. It starts around 14.5 s and ends around 16.5 s. The center timestamp is approximately **15.5 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** A less dense, but still clear, synchronized event occurs. It starts around 22.5 s and ends around 24.5 s. The center timestamp is approximately **23.5 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A similar, less dense burst follows. It starts around 29.5 s and ends around 31.5 s. The center timestamp is approximately **30.5 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** A very strong and dense burst occurs. It starts around 36 s and ends around 38 s. The center timestamp is approximately **37.0 s**.\n6.  **Burst 6:** The final prominent burst is near the end of the recording. It starts around 45 s and ends around 47 s. The center timestamp is approximately **46.0 s**.\n\nSo, the identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are: 2.5 s, 15.5 s, 23.5 s, 30.5 s, 37.0 s, and 46.0 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs).**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of consecutive bursts. We have five such intervals between our six identified bursts.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 15.5 s - 2.5 s = **13.0 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 23.5 s - 15.5 s = **8.0 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 30.5 s - 23.5 s = **7.0 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 37.0 s - 30.5 s = **6.5 s**\n*   **IBI 5:** Time between Burst 6 and Burst 5 = 46.0 s - 37.0 s = **9.0 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average Inter-Burst Interval.**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals (which is 5).\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 13.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 6.5 + 9.0 = 43.5 s\n*   Number of intervals = 5\n*   Average IBI = 43.5 s / 5 = **8.7 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to two significant figures.**\nThe calculated average is 8.7 s.\n*   The first significant figure is 8.\n*   The second significant figure is 7.\nThe number 8.7 already has exactly two significant figures. No further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is 8.7 s.\n\n<<<8.7>>>"
