    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.**\nThe image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus of the photograph. The question asks for the scientific name of this animal.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the key physical characteristics of the insect.**\n*   **Order:** The insect has a distinct head, thorax, and abdomen, along with long antennae and piercing-sucking mouthparts (a beak, though not clearly visible), which are characteristic of the order Hemiptera, or \"true bugs\".\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking color pattern of black and bright orange-red. This type of coloration is often aposematic, warning potential predators that the insect is distasteful.\n*   **Pattern:**\n    *   The head is entirely black.\n    *   The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment, just behind the head) is orange-red with a black marking in the center.\n    *   The wings (hemelytra) are mostly black but are marked with a distinct orange-red \"X\" or cross-like pattern.\n    *   The legs and antennae are black.\n*   **Habitat:** The insect is seen on a yellow flower, which appears to be a species of goldenrod (*Solidago*). This indicates it might be feeding on nectar.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed characteristics with known insect species.**\nThe combination of the black and orange-red coloration, the specific \"X\" pattern on the back, and the overall body shape are highly distinctive. These features strongly point to the **Small Milkweed Bug**.\n\n*   This bug belongs to the family Lygaeidae (seed bugs).\n*   While its primary host plants are milkweeds (genus *Asclepias*), where they feed on seeds, adults are also known to feed on nectar from various other flowering plants, including goldenrod. This is consistent with the scene in the photograph.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the scientific name.**\nThe scientific name is the formal, binomial name used in taxonomy.\n*   Common Name: Small Milkweed Bug\n*   Genus: *Lygaeus*\n*   Species: *kalmii*\n*   Scientific Name: *Lygaeus kalmii*\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification.**\nA quick search for *Lygaeus kalmii* confirms that the appearance and patterns match the insect in the image perfectly. The typical red-orange \"X\" mark on the back is a key identifier for this species.\n\nTherefore, the scientific name of the animal depicted is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
