    "This question asks for the name of a specific chemical compound shown in a structural diagram.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of compound:** The structure is a polycyclic molecule containing nitrogen atoms integrated into the rings. Such naturally occurring nitrogenous compounds are classified as alkaloids.\n2.  **Analyze the core structure (skeleton):** The molecule consists of four fused six-membered rings. Two of these rings share a nitrogen atom, forming a quinolizidine system on the right side. The overall framework is a tetracyclic system containing two nitrogen atoms. This skeleton is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids, which are typically found in plants of the *Lupinus* (lupin) genus. The parent tetracyclic system without any double bonds or oxygen atoms is called sparteine.\n3.  **Identify the functional groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in one of the rings. This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom, making it an amide functional group contained within a ring. A cyclic amide is called a lactam.\n4.  **Combine the observations to find the specific name:** The compound is an oxo-derivative of the sparteine skeleton, specifically a lactam. This particular structure, including the position of the lactam group, corresponds to a well-known lupin alkaloid named **lupanine**.\n5.  **Consider the stereochemistry:** The use of wedged and dashed bonds indicates a specific stereoisomer. The relative stereochemistry shown in the diagram corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer, often referred to simply as lupanine (or more formally as (-)-lupanine).\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   Recognize that the compound is an alkaloid due to the presence of nitrogen in a heterocyclic system.\n*   Identify the tetracyclic quinolizidine-based skeleton, which is a key feature of lupin alkaloids.\n*   Note the presence and position of the lactam (cyclic amide) functional group. The parent compound without this oxygen is sparteine.\n*   The specific connectivity and stereochemistry define the compound as lupanine, distinguishing it from other isomers like Î±-isolupanine.\n\nThe final answer is the common name for this specific alkaloid.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
