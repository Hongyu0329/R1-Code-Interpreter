    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image provided is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase, specifically a South Italian (Campanian) red-figure pelike, dating to approximately 360-350 BC. The scene depicted is a dramatic mythological event involving a chariot.\n    *   **The Chariot and Driver:** A two-wheeled chariot is central to the composition. The driver is a female figure wearing a distinctive Phrygian cap and a long-sleeved, patterned garment. This \"oriental\" attire is a key iconographic marker in Greek art for figures from the East, most famously the sorceress Medea. A large white wing is visible above and behind her, suggesting the chariot is supernatural and capable of flight, which is consistent with the chariot given to Medea by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n    *   **The Passenger:** The driver, Medea, is holding another figure who is slumped over and draped in white cloth. This figure appears lifeless and is generally identified as one of Medea's murdered sons.\n    *   **The Figure Leaving the Chariot:** A nude male figure is depicted in a contorted position, bent backward over the chariot's wheel and lying on the ground. His posture is dynamic, suggesting a violent fall or ejection from the chariot. He is the most logical answer to the question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\".\n    *   **Other Elements:** Part of a white horse (or winged serpent, which are often interchangeable as draft animals for Medea's chariot) is visible on the left. Decorative palmettes frame the scene on the right, and a wave pattern runs along the bottom.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological context.**\n    The key figure, the woman in the Phrygian cap driving a flying chariot, is unmistakably **Medea**. The scene depicts her dramatic and tragic escape from Corinth after she has taken revenge on her unfaithful husband, Jason. Her revenge included murdering their two sons. The vase paintings of this period, particularly from Southern Italy, frequently depicted scenes from Greek tragedies, and Euripides' play *Medea* was extremely popular.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the specific figure in question.**\n    The question asks to identify the \"figure leaving the chariot.\" As established in Step 1, this refers to the nude male figure falling or lying on the ground, whose body is draped over the wheel. In the context of the Medea myth, this figure must be one of the victims of her rage.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Jason.** While Jason is left alive to grieve, some vases show him collapsed on the ground in despair as Medea escapes. However, he is not typically shown falling *from* the chariot. The pose here is one of violent ejection.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Creon.** The king of Corinth, also killed by Medea's magic, died inside his palace and is not part of the chariot escape scene.\n    *   **Possibility 3: Talos.** The bronze giant Talos was killed by Medea on Crete. Some scholars have suggested this identification, but the narrative context doesn't fit well with the Corinthian escape scene which is strongly implied by the dead children.\n    *   **Possibility 4: Medea's son.** This is the most widely accepted and logical identification. Medea murdered both of her sons. Vase paintings of this scene often show her escaping with their bodies, with one son held in the chariot and the other falling out. The fact that the figure is depicted as a muscular adult male rather than a child is a common artistic convention in South Italian vase painting, meant to increase the pathos and heroic quality of the tragic victim.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the specific name of the figure.**\n    The sons of Medea and Jason are named **Mermerus** and **Pheres**. While not always distinguished, on other similar South Italian vases that include inscriptions, the son who is falling from the chariot is explicitly labeled as **Pheres**. Therefore, we can identify the figure with this specific name.\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\n    The scene depicts Medea escaping Corinth in her flying chariot. The figure leaving the chariot is her murdered son, shown falling to the ground. Based on comparable inscribed vases, this son can be identified by the name Pheres.\n\n<<<Pheres>>>"
