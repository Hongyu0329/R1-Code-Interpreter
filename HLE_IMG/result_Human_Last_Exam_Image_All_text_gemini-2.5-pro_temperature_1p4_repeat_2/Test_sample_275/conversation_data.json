    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to identify and count the total number of distinct splice species (unique mRNA molecules resulting from splicing) based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Method:** Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is used to amplify specific segments of mRNA transcripts. The size of the amplified DNA product depends on the distance between the primers on the *spliced* mRNA.\n    *   **Genome Map (Panel A):** Shows the layout of genes (ORFs) on a 7,857 bp genome. Key genes are E1, E2, E4, E5, L1, L2.\n    *   **Primers:** Different forward (F) and reverse (R) primers are used to target different regions and splice junctions.\n    *   **Key Primers:**\n        *   `E1F1`: A general forward primer in the E1 gene.\n        *   `E1F2`: A splice-junction specific primer that only works if nucleotide 929 is spliced to nucleotide 3465 (joining E1 to E4).\n        *   `E1F3`: Another splice-junction specific primer for the 929^3506 splice (also joining E1 to E4, but at a different acceptor site).\n    *   **Gel Panels (B-I):** Each panel shows the results of a specific PCR reaction. Each band represents a PCR product of a certain size. The presence of multiple bands in a single lane indicates that the primer pair amplified products from different splice species.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Panel to Identify Unique Splice Species:** We will count each unique PCR product as evidence for a distinct splice species. We will be careful not to double-count species that are detected by multiple different primer pairs.\n\n    *   **Panel B (Primers: E1F1/E4R):** This reaction amplifies a region from E1 to E4.\n        *   Band 1 (190 bp) and Band 2 (159 bp) are visible.\n        *   This indicates the existence of **two distinct splice species** that both contain parts of exon E1 and exon E4. Let's call them **Species 1** and **Species 2**.\n\n    *   **Panel C (Primers: E1F1/E5R):** This reaction amplifies a region from E1 to E5.\n        *   Two bands (584 bp and 553 bp) are visible.\n        *   These correspond to Species 1 and Species 2, respectively, just amplified with a more downstream reverse primer. This confirms these species extend to E5 but does not identify new species.\n\n    *   **Panel D (Primers: E1F2/E5R):** This reaction uses the splice-junction primer `E1F2` (specific for the 929^3465 splice).\n        *   One band (551 bp) is visible.\n        *   This confirms that one of the species (likely Species 2, based on relative abundance and size comparisons with other panels) uses the 929^3465 splice. This provides detail but does not add a new species to our count of 2.\n\n    *   **Panel F (Primers: E1F2/L2R):** This uses the same `E1F2` forward primer but a reverse primer in L2.\n        *   One band (972 bp) is seen.\n        *   This shows that the species with the 929^3465 splice (Species 2) extends to the L2 region. Still no new species identified.\n\n    *   **Panel G (Primers: E1F3/L2R):** This reaction uses the splice-junction primer `E1F3` (specific for the 929^3506 splice).\n        *   Band 1 (1,003 bp) and Band 2 (931 bp) are visible.\n        *   Since `E1F3` is specific for a splice junction not previously confirmed (929^3506), and it produces two different sized products, this identifies **two new, distinct splice species**. The size difference between these two bands must be due to an additional splicing event downstream of the E1-E4 junction. Let's call them **Species 3** and **Species 4**.\n        *   *Current Count: 2 (from B) + 2 (from G) = 4 species.*\n\n    *   **Panel H (Primers: E1F1/L1R):** This reaction uses a general E1 primer and a primer in the late gene L1. This detects transcripts where E1 is spliced to L1, bypassing the intervening region.\n        *   Band 1 (450 bp) and Band 2 (419 bp) are visible.\n        *   These represent two different ways E1 can be spliced to L1. These are \"late\" transcripts, distinct from the \"early\" transcripts seen before. This adds **two new splice species** to our count. Let's call them **Species 5** and **Species 6**.\n        *   *Current Count: 4 + 2 = 6 species.*\n\n    *   **Panel I (Primers: E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same reaction as H, but run for more cycles to detect less abundant products.\n        *   Four bands are visible: 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp.\n        *   Bands 1 and 2 (450, 419 bp) are the same as Species 5 and 6 identified in Panel H.\n        *   Bands 3 (378 bp) and 4 (187 bp) are new products not clearly visible at 20 cycles. They represent two more unique ways E1 can be spliced to L1. This adds **two more new splice species** to our count. Let's call them **Species 7** and **Species 8**.\n        *   *Current Count: 6 + 2 = 8 species.*\n\n4.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   Species 1 & 2: Early transcripts detected in Panel B (E1->E4).\n    *   Species 3 & 4: Early transcripts with a different E1-E4 splice (929^3506) detected in Panel G.\n    *   Species 5, 6, 7, & 8: Late transcripts with four different E1->L1 splice patterns, all detected in Panel I.\n\nTotal number of distinct splice species identified = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
