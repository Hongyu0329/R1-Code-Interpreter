    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song's title, musical style, and country of origin from the provided sheet music.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Musical Notation Analysis:**\n    *   **Format:** The music is written as a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the melody on a single staff with chord symbols written above. This format is very common in jazz and popular music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), indicated by the 'C' symbol after the clef.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which indicates the key is C major or its relative minor, A minor. The frequent use of the C major chord and the melody's resolution to C suggest the key is **C major**.\n    *   **Tempo:** A partially visible tempo marking at the top appears to be \"MOD. T.\" (Moderate Tempo) with a metronome mark around ‚ô©=128, which is a lively, swinging tempo.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chords used (C, E7, F, G7, Dm, Am) are standard in jazz. The use of secondary dominants (like E7, which is the V7 of A minor, used here to lead to an F chord) and syncopated harmonic changes are characteristic of jazz.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth and sixteenth notes, dotted rhythms, and tied notes. It is heavily based on arpeggios that outline the underlying chords (e.g., in the second measure, the melody outlines an E7 arpeggio). This virtuosic, arpeggio-driven style is a key feature of a specific jazz subgenre.\n    *   **Structure:** The piece uses standard musical navigation signs, including repeat signs (at the beginning), a *Dal Segno* sign (ùÑã), and instructions like \"To go out take D.S. to CODA\". This AABA-like structure with repeats and codas is typical for jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Musical Style and Origin:**\n    *   The combination of a swing rhythm (implied by the style), acoustic instrumentation (typically associated with this style), virtuosic arpeggiated melody, and specific harmonic vocabulary strongly points to **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as **Jazz Manouche** or **Sinti Swing**).\n    *   This style was pioneered in the 1930s by guitarist **Django Reinhardt**, a Belgian-born Romani musician, and violinist **St√©phane Grappelli**.\n    *   Gypsy Jazz emerged in and around Paris, making its country of origin **France**.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Song Title:**\n    *   To find the title, we can transcribe the opening melody. The first full measure over the C chord plays the notes: **G - G - G - G | A - G - E - C**.\n    *   The second measure over the E7 chord plays: **C# - C# - C# - C# | E - D - B - G#**.\n    *   This distinctive opening melody is the main theme of the famous Gypsy Jazz composition **\"Douce Ambiance\"** by Django Reinhardt, composed in 1941. The sheet music provided is a lead sheet for this piece, written in its common key of C major.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Title:** The song is \"Douce Ambiance\".\n*   **Musical Style:** The style is Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche).\n*   **Country of Origin:** The style originated in France.\n\n<<<Title: Douce Ambiance, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: France>>>"
