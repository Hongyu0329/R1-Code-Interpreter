    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the fundamental principle governing emitter lifetime.**\nThe operational lifetime of an emitter in a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is closely related to its chemical and photophysical stability. For organometallic complexes like the ones shown, a major degradation pathway involves the cleavage of metal-ligand bonds. The strength of these bonds is a key determinant of the complex's stability and, consequently, its operational lifetime. In these iridium(III) complexes, the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand (C^N ligand) is often the most susceptible to cleavage.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structures of the four complexes.**\nAll four complexes share the same general structure: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-.\n*   The central metal ion is Iridium(III).\n*   The neutral diimine ligand (N^N) is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine in all four cases. Since this ligand is identical across all complexes, it does not account for differences in their lifetimes.\n*   The cyclometalating ligands (C^N) are substituted 2-phenylpyridines, and this is where the four complexes differ. The Ir atom is bonded to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring. The substitution is on the phenyl ring:\n    *   **Complex 1:** 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms, one at the ortho-position (C2') and one at the para-position (C4').\n    *   **Complex 2:** 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom at the para-position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom at the ortho-position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** 2-phenylpyridine. It has no fluorine substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the structural differences to the Ir-C bond strength and stability.**\nThe stability of the complex, and thus its lifetime, can be enhanced by strengthening the Ir-C bond. This is achieved by introducing electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand.\n*   Fluorine (F) is a highly electronegative atom and acts as a potent EWG via the inductive effect.\n*   By withdrawing electron density from the phenyl ring, the fluorine substituents make the carbon atom of the Ir-C bond more electron-deficient, which leads to a stronger, more covalent, and more stable bond with the iridium center.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the complexes based on expected stability.**\nWe can rank the stability of the complexes based on the number and position of the fluorine substituents.\n\n*   **Complex 4:** Has no fluorine atoms. The Ir-C bond is the weakest among the four. Therefore, Complex 4 is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n*   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorine atoms. The combined electron-withdrawing effect of two fluorines will strengthen the Ir-C bond the most. Therefore, Complex 1 is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n*   **Complexes 2 and 3:** Both have a single fluorine atom, so they will be more stable than Complex 4 but less stable than Complex 1. To compare them, we must consider the position of the fluorine atom.\n    *   In **Complex 3**, the fluorine is at the ortho-position, right next to the Ir-C bond. This position has two key advantages:\n        1.  A strong inductive effect due to its proximity to the bond.\n        2.  Steric shielding of the Ir-C bond, which can physically protect it from attack by other molecules, preventing degradation.\n    *   In **Complex 2**, the fluorine is at the para-position. It still exerts an electron-withdrawing effect, but it is weaker than at the ortho-position due to the greater distance. Critically, it offers no steric protection to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to be significantly more stable than Complex 2.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude which complexes have shorter lifetimes.**\nBased on the analysis, the stability (and thus lifetime) ranking is:\n**Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2 > Complex 4**\n\nThe question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". This corresponds to the least stable complexes in the series. The two least stable complexes are Complex 4 (the least stable) and Complex 2. The lack of an ortho-fluoro substituent in both Complex 2 and Complex 4 makes them substantially less stable than Complex 1 and Complex 3, which both benefit from this feature. Therefore, Complexes 2 and 4 are expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\nThis corresponds to the answer choice that includes both [2] and [4].\n\n<<<I>>>"
