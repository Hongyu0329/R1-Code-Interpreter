The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In Grimmia montana, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent among the leaves and stand upright. In contrast, Grimmia curviseta has a long, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves (exserted) in a nodding or hanging position.
