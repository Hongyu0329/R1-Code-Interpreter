    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe provided algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.\n-   **Input:** An array `a` and an integer `n` which represents the size of the prefix of the array to be considered (from index `0` to `n-1`).\n-   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array with 0 or 1 element is inherently sorted.\n-   **Recursive Step (for `n > 1`):**\n    1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first recursively sorts the first `n-1` elements of the array, i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n    2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the current scope, `a[n-1]`, with the element just before it, `a[n-2]`. Since `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that subarray.\n    3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, it swaps them. This places the smaller element into the prefix `a[0...n-2]`, which may disrupt the sorted order of that prefix.\n    4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the previous swap might have messed up the sorted order of `a[0...n-2]`, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort this prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function in the worst case.\n- The base case `T(1)` is a constant amount of time, `O(1)`, as it just performs the check `n > 1`.\n- For `n > 1`, the time taken is the sum of the time taken by its components:\n    - The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    - The comparison `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    - The `swap` operation, if executed, takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    - The second call `sort(a, n - 1)`, if executed, takes `T(n - 1)`.\n\nThe crucial part is analyzing the worst-case scenario. The worst case will occur when the `if` condition is true, as this triggers the expensive second recursive call.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Worst Case\n\nThe worst case happens when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true for every level of recursion `n, n-1, ..., 2`.\nConsider a reverse-sorted array, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`.\n-   `sort(a, 3)`:\n    -   Calls `sort(a, 2)` on `[3, 2]`. This call will sort the first two elements, making the array `[2, 3, 1]`.\n    -   Compares `a[2]` (which is `1`) with `a[1]` (which is `3`). The condition `1 < 3` is true.\n    -   Swaps them. The array becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n    -   The `if` block is executed, so it calls `sort(a, 2)` again on `[2, 1]`. This will re-sort the prefix to `[1, 2]`, making the final array `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\nIn this scenario, for each `sort(a, k)`, the second recursive call `sort(a, k-1)` is triggered. Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = d` (another constant). We can expand the relation:\n-   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n-   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n-   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n-   ... continuing this pattern for `k` steps ...\n-   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nLet `k = n - 1`.\n-   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series which sums to `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n-   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n-   `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n-   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nFor large `n`, the dominant term is `(d + c) * 2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, we ignore constants. The complexity is determined by `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is exponential. It is not a practical sorting algorithm but serves as a good example of how a seemingly small change (the second recursive call) can lead to a drastic increase in computational time.\n\n-   The algorithm does terminate because `n` decreases in each recursive call.\n-   `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, `O(n^2)`, and `O(n^3)` are all incorrect as the complexity grows exponentially.\n\nThe correct time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
