The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to steric hindrance in the rigid, fused bicyclic münchnone intermediate derived from proline. The C4 position of this intermediate is a sterically crowded bridgehead carbon, while the C2 position is less hindered. Consequently, the bulky methoxycarbonyl group of the methyl propiolate dipolarophile preferentially adds to the less sterically demanding C2 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B).

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial as they provide a control case. The münchnone formed in these reactions is derived from an acyclic amino acid and has methyl groups at both the C2 and C4 positions. Since this intermediate is not conformationally constrained in a rigid ring system, the steric environments at C2 and C4 are very similar. The labeling experiment in Reaction 2 confirms that without a strong steric directing influence, the cycloaddition is not regioselective ("no regioselectivity observed"). This lack of selectivity in the acyclic system highlights that the conformational rigidity imposed by the proline ring is the determining factor for the high regioselectivity seen in Reaction 3.
