The image displays a tissue sample stained with PAS, revealing a fungal infection. The microorganism is dimorphic, exhibiting two distinct morphological forms: 1) round-to-oval budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and 2) filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are characterized by constrictions at the septa, giving them a "sausage-link" appearance. This combination of budding yeast and pseudohyphae is characteristic of an infection by a *Candida* species.
