    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern corresponding to a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FCC Structure:**\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n    *   Key atomic positions in one unit cell (with lattice constant `a`) include (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), etc., for the corners, and (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2), etc., for the face centers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    *   Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector from the origin to the point (1,1,0). This is the (110) plane.\n    *   When we project all the atoms of an FCC lattice onto this plane, they form a specific 2D pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    *   Let's consider the arrangement of atoms on planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These are the {110} planes.\n    *   In an FCC lattice, the {110} planes are stacked in an \"ABAB...\" sequence.\n    *   Plane A contains atoms that form a rectangular grid. The rectangle has side lengths of `a` and `a√2`.\n    *   Plane B also contains atoms forming an identical rectangular grid, but it is shifted relative to Plane A such that its atoms lie in the center of the rectangles of Plane A.\n    *   When these two layers are projected onto a single 2D plane, the result is a **centered rectangular** lattice pattern. The pattern consists of atoms at the corners of a rectangle and another atom in the center of the rectangle. This unit repeats to form the entire lattice pattern.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Images:**\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular pattern. We see two layers of atoms arranged in a rectangle, and one layer is directly behind the other. This is not a centered rectangular pattern. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along the [100] direction.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image shows a small cluster of six atoms. The perspective is highly skewed, making it difficult to definitively identify the underlying lattice pattern. While the arrangement might be consistent with a local configuration in an FCC [110] view (showing zig-zag rows from edge-on {111} planes), it does not clearly represent the repeating unit of the overall lattice, which is the key characteristic of a \"lattice pattern\".\n\n    *   **Image C:** This image displays a three-dimensional unit cell with atoms at the corners of a cuboid and one atom in the very center of the body. This is a classic representation of a **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) unit cell**, not a 2D projection of a lattice pattern.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular** pattern. There are two sets of interpenetrating rectangular grids. One grid forms the corners of rectangles (e.g., atoms at `x=2, y=6`; `x=5, y=6`; `x=2, y=8`; `x=5, y=8`), and the second grid has atoms located in the center of these rectangles (e.g., atom at `x≈3.5, y≈7`). This pattern perfectly matches the theoretical prediction for an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction. The aspect ratio of the rectangles (width:height ≈ 3:2 = 1.5) is also close to the theoretical ratio of `√2:1 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction produces a centered rectangular lattice pattern.\n    *   Image D is the only option that clearly and accurately depicts a centered rectangular lattice pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
