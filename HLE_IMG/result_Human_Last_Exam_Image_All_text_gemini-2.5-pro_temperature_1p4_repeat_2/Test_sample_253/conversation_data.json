    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism:** The image displays a bright yellow, leafy organism growing on a rock. This is a type of lichen. Based on its distinct yellow-orange color, foliose (leafy) structure, and the presence of small, cup-like reproductive structures (apothecia), the organism can be identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow scale. This species is commonly found in coastal regions like Acadia National Park.\n\n2.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this specific lichen.\n    *   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina* (the fungal partner, or mycobiont, of the lichen).\n    *   **Protein:** XPH1. This is the designation for a specific protein produced by the organism. The name XPH1 stands for ***X**anthoria **p**arietina* **H**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins found in filamentous fungi that help them interact with their environment, such as adhering to surfaces like rocks.\n\n3.  **Acquire Protein Information:** To find the length of this protein, we must consult a biological protein database. The most common and reliable sources are UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n\n4.  **Search the Database:**\n    *   A search in the UniProt database for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" leads to a specific entry for this protein.\n    *   The accession number for this protein is **P87031**, and its entry name is **HYP1_XANPA**.\n    *   The entry confirms the protein name is \"Hydrophobin-1\", the gene name is *XPH1*, and the organism is *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Amino Acids:**\n    *   The UniProt entry for P87031 provides the full amino acid sequence of the protein.\n    *   The database also explicitly states the length of the protein sequence. For Hydrophobin-1 (XPH1) from *Xanthoria parietina*, the length is listed as **118 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The accuracy of the answer hinges on correctly identifying the lichen in the photo. The visual characteristics strongly point to *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Understanding Protein Nomenclature:** It's important to recognize that XPH1 is a specific gene/protein name associated with *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Using Reliable Databases:** Scientific data like protein sequences and lengths should be sourced from authoritative databases like UniProt or NCBI to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Distinguishing Gene from Protein:** The question asks about the protein encoded by the *XPH1* gene. The number of amino acids refers to the final protein product after translation.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nFollowing the steps, we identified the organism as *Xanthoria parietina*. We then searched for its XPH1 protein in the UniProt database, which confirmed the protein is Hydrophobin-1 and is composed of 118 amino acids.\n\n<<<118>>>"
