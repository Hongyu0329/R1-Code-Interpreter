    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Reactant 1: A substituted cyclobutene (1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene). The stereochemistry at C4 is specified: Methyl (Me) is wedge (pointing out/up), and Methoxy (OMe) is dash (pointing in/down). This is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-CO2Et), a dienophile.\n    *   Conditions: Heat (Δ).\n    *   The reaction sequence is described as a 4π electrocyclic ring opening followed by a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Electrocyclic Ring Opening:**\n    *   The first step is a thermal (Δ) 4π electrocyclic reaction. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π system undergoes a **conrotatory** ring opening.\n    *   The cyclobutene ring consists of carbons C1(with OMe), C2, C3, and C4(with Me, OMe). An electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene breaks the σ-bond opposite the π-bond to form a 1,3-butadiene. Here, the π-bond is C1=C2, so the σ-bond that breaks is C3-C4.\n    *   The breaking of the C3-C4 bond results in a linear chain with the connectivity C4-C1-C2-C3.\n    *   The resulting diene will have double bonds at C4=C1 and C2=C3.\n    *   Let's determine the structure of the diene based on the substituents:\n        *   C4 has a Me and an OMe group.\n        *   C1 has an OMe group.\n        *   C2 has an H atom.\n        *   C3 is a CH2 group.\n    *   The structure of the diene is: (Me)(OMe)C=C(OMe)-CH=CH2. This is 2-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxybuta-1,3-diene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Ring Opening:**\n    *   The conrotatory ring opening can occur in two directions (both ends rotate clockwise or both counter-clockwise). Starting from a single enantiomer of the cyclobutene, these two pathways lead to two diastereomeric dienes. These dienes will have different stereochemistry (E/Z) at the newly formed C1=C4 double bond. We will have Diene-E and Diene-Z.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Diels-Alder Cycloaddition:**\n    *   Diene: 2-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxybuta-1,3-diene (electron-rich).\n    *   Dienophile: Ethyl acrylate (electron-poor due to the -CO2Et group).\n    *   This is a normal electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** We need to determine how the diene and dienophile align. We match the termini of the diene (C1' and C4', which are C3 and C4 from our original numbering) with the carbons of the dienophile double bond (Cα and Cβ). A retro-Diels-Alder analysis of the products (A-H) reveals the connectivity. The quaternary center (C4 of the diene) is attached to a CH2 group (from the dienophile), which is then attached to the CH(CO2Et) group. This corresponds to the \"meta\" regioisomer. This happens when C4 (diene) bonds to Cβ (CH2 of acrylate) and C1 (CH2 of diene) bonds to Cα (CH-CO2Et of acrylate).\n    *   A re-evaluation of the diene structure from the product connectivity shows that the quaternary carbon (from C4 of cyclobutene) must be at one end of the diene, and the C=C(OMe) bond is adjacent. This confirms our diene structure: (Me)(OMe)C(4)=C(1)(OMe)-C(2)H=C(3)H2. The termini that react in the Diels-Alder are C4 and C3.\n    *   Regioselectivity re-evaluated: C4 of the diene is highly electron-rich. C3 is a terminal CH2. The Cβ of the acrylate (CH2) is the more electrophilic carbon. Therefore, the major product will arise from the bond forming between C4 of the diene and Cα of the acrylate, and C3 of the diene and Cβ of the acrylate. This contradicts the product structure. Let's trust the product structure as a guide. The regiochemistry is C4(diene) attacks Cβ(acrylate) and C3(diene) attacks Cα(acrylate). This gives the observed \"meta\" substitution pattern in products A-H.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction (\"endo\" rule):**\n    *   The question specifies an **endo** reaction. In the endo transition state, the electron-withdrawing group (EWG) of the dienophile (the -CO2Et group) is oriented on the same face of the forming cyclohexene ring as the \"inside\" substituents of the s-cis diene conformer. This maximizes secondary orbital overlap.\n    *   Let's analyze the s-cis diene. The bulkiest substituent on the diene's termini, the Me group on C4, will prefer to occupy the less sterically hindered \"outside\" (convex) position. The OMe on C4 will therefore be on the \"inside\" (concave) position.\n    *   Since the endo transition state places the CO2Et group cis to the \"inside\" substituents, the CO2Et group will be cis to the OMe group at C4.\n    *   The starting material has Me as wedge (up) and OMe as dash (down). In the product, the stereocenter at C1 (from C4 of the diene) will have Me(wedge) and OMe(dash).\n    *   Because the CO2Et group is cis to the OMe group, it must also have a dash stereochemistry.\n    *   Therefore, the endo product has the stereochemistry: C1(Me-wedge, OMe-dash), C3(CO2Et-dash). This corresponds to structure **A**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Second Product:**\n    *   The question asks for **two** products. We have determined that the endo reaction of the diene derived from the given enantiomer of cyclobutene should give product A.\n    *   Where does the second product come from?\n        *   **Exo product?** The question specifies \"endo fashion\", ruling out exo products. (For reference, the exo product would have CO2Et trans to the OMe group at C1, so it would be product C).\n        *   **Other regioisomer?** All choices A-H have the same connectivity (regioisomer).\n        *   **Diastereomeric dienes?** As analyzed previously, both Diene-E and Diene-Z, when reacting in an endo fashion, lead to products with the same relative stereochemistry between C1 and C3, which is determined by the \"in/out\" nature of substituents at C4. My detailed analysis concluded both diastereomeric dienes lead to product A.\n        *   **Racemization/Epimerization:** The most plausible explanation is that under the thermal conditions (Δ), the chiral center at C4 epimerizes. This can happen if the electrocyclic ring opening is reversible. This means the reaction effectively proceeds from a racemic mixture of the cyclobutene.\n    *   If we start with a racemic mixture:\n        *   The (4R)-enantiomer (as drawn, Me-wedge, OMe-dash) gives the endo product **A**.\n        *   The (4S)-enantiomer (Me-dash, OMe-wedge) will go through the same process. The resulting endo product will be the enantiomer of A.\n    *   The enantiomer of A [C1(Me-W, OMe-D), C3(CO2Et-D)] is the molecule where all stereocenters are inverted: C1(Me-D, OMe-W), C3(CO2Et-W). This is structure **D**.\n    *   Thus, the two endo products formed from the reaction are **A** and **D**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction of the chiral cyclobutene leads to a chiral diene intermediate. Under thermal conditions, epimerization at the C4 center is likely, leading to a racemic mixture. The endo Diels-Alder reaction of the two enantiomeric dienes with ethyl acrylate will produce a pair of enantiomeric products, A and D.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Product A: C1(Me-W, OMe-D), C3(CO2Et-D). Relative stereochemistry Me/CO2Et is trans. Let's define this as the endo product.\n*   Product D: C1(Me-D, OMe-W), C3(CO2Et-W). Relative stereochemistry Me/CO2Et is trans. This is also an endo product. A and D are enantiomers.\n*   This is a consistent result if the starting material is treated as a racemate. The two endo products are A and D.\n\nFinal Answer is the pair of structures A and D.\n\nLooking at the options provided in the format, they are single letters. The question asks for \"the two products\". This implies the answer format should be something like \"A and D\". Since there is no such option, I must choose the option that correctly represents the set {A, D}. It seems I am expected to identify the pair of molecules from the list A-H.\n\nThe final products are A and D.\n\n<<<A and D>>>"
