    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 \"Pathétique\". The main key of this movement is C minor. The key signature at this point in the score is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to C minor (or its relative major, E♭ major). The surrounding context strongly confirms C minor as the tonic.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The measure is the third measure on the second system of the provided musical score. It is the first measure within the circled area.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Bass Line:** In the left hand (bass clef), the note G is played as an octave and sustained throughout the entire measure. G is the fifth scale degree in C minor, making it the dominant. This sustained G in the bass is known as a dominant pedal point, indicating that the overall harmony of the measure is dominant in function.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Right Hand Harmony:** The harmony in the right hand (treble clef) changes within the measure.\n    *   **Beats 1 and 2:** The notes played are G, B♮, D, and F. This constitutes a G dominant seventh chord (G7). In the key of C minor, this is the dominant seventh chord, represented by the Roman numeral **V7**. The B♮ is the raised leading tone to C.\n    *   **Beats 3 and 4:** The notes played are F♯, A, C, and E♭. These notes form a fully diminished seventh chord built on F♯ (F♯°7).\n\n5.  **Determine the Function of the F♯°7 Chord:**\n    *   We need to understand how this F♯°7 chord functions over the G pedal in the bass.\n    *   An F♯°7 chord is the leading-tone seventh chord of the key of G (major or minor). The note F♯ is the leading tone to G.\n    *   In the context of our home key, C minor, the G chord is the dominant (V). Therefore, the F♯°7 chord is functioning as the leading-tone seventh chord *of the dominant*.\n    *   Such a chord is called a secondary or applied dominant (in this case, an applied leading-tone chord). It heightens the tension and strengthens the pull towards the dominant chord it precedes or embellishes.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a leading-tone diminished seventh chord is **vii°7**.\n    *   Since this chord is functioning in relation to the dominant (V), we use a slash to indicate this secondary function.\n    *   The correct Roman numeral for the F♯°7 chord in this context is **vii°7/V** (read as \"seven diminished seven of five\").\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion for Measure 30:** While the measure begins as a simple V7 chord, the most distinct and harmonically significant event is the introduction of the vii°7/V chord in the second half. In a detailed harmonic analysis, this is the most accurate Roman numeral to describe the harmony that defines this specific measure. The entire measure serves to prolong the dominant, but the vii°7/V is the specific harmonic device used.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
