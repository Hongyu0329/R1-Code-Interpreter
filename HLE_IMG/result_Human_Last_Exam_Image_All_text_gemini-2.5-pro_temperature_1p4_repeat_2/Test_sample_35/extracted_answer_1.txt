The specific receptor domain for which the S100B protein exhibits strong affinity is the extracellular portion of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), composed of the V, C1, and C2 immunoglobulin-like domains.

This protein could be used as a prognostic marker. The pathway shows that S100B activation leads directly to key pathological events such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B would not just indicate the presence of disease (like an adjunct marker) but would also correlate with the severity and predict the future progression of the neurodegenerative process, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
