    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Circuit and the Goal**\nThe given circuit is a type of RC filter. It consists of an infinite resistive ladder network connected to a capacitor `C` at the bottom. The input signal is at node `c_0`, and the output is the voltage at node `a_0`, across the capacitor. The presence of the capacitor `C` connected between the signal path and ground indicates that this is a low-pass filter. The goal is to find the cutoff frequency of this filter.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Cutoff Frequency in an RC Filter**\nFor a first-order RC low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ (or -3 dB) of its passband (DC) value. This frequency is determined by the time constant of the circuit, which depends on the capacitance `C` and the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) seen by the capacitor. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} $$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. We will calculate the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance looking into the terminals `a_0` and `b_0` (which is ground). To do this, we must deactivate all independent sources. The input source \"IN\" at `c_0` is a voltage source, so we deactivate it by replacing it with a short circuit to ground. Therefore, node `c_0` is connected to ground.\n\nThe resistance looking into node `a_0` is the sum of the resistor `r` between `a_0` and `d_1`, and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the network seen from node `d_1` to ground.\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1\\_gnd}$\nCalculating $R_{d1\\_gnd}$ by simple series/parallel combinations is not feasible due to the complexity of the infinite ladder. A systematic approach using nodal analysis is required.\n\n**Step 4: Nodal Analysis to find $R_{th}$**\nLet's apply a test voltage $V_t$ at node `a_0` and calculate the current $I_t$ that flows from the test source. Then, $R_{th} = V_t / I_t$. We keep node `c_0` grounded ($V_{c0} = 0$).\n\nThe node voltages for the infinite ladder portion ($k \\ge 1$) can be written as $V_k^c$ (at node $c_k$) and $V_k^d$ (at node $d_k$). For the infinite ladder to have finite voltages that decay towards infinity, the solutions to the node equations must be of the form $V_k \\propto \\lambda^k$ where $|\\lambda|<1$.\n\nThrough analysis of the difference equations governing the node voltages, the general solution for the voltages for $k \\ge 1$ is found to be:\n$V_k^c = A + B \\lambda^k$\n$V_k^d = A - B \\lambda^k$\nwhere $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is the characteristic decay constant for the ladder.\n\nNow, we use the boundary conditions at nodes `c_1` and `d_1` to find the constants A and B in terms of our test voltage $V_t$.\nThe node equation at `c_1` (with $V_{c0}=0$) is:\n$\\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{d1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c2}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{c1} - V_{d1} - V_{c2} = 0$\n\nThe node equation at `d_1` is:\n$\\frac{V_{d1}-V_{t}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{d1} - V_{c1} - V_{d2} = V_t$\n\nSubstituting the general solutions for $V_1$ and $V_2$ into these two equations, we can solve for A and B:\n1.  From the `c_1` equation: $A+B = 0 \\implies A = -B$.\n2.  From the `d_1` equation: $A-B = V_t$.\n\nSolving this system of two equations gives:\n$A = V_t / 2$\n$B = -V_t / 2$\n\nNow we can determine the voltage at any node. We are interested in $V_{d1}$ to find the current $I_t$:\n$V_{d1} = A - B \\lambda = \\frac{V_t}{2} - (-\\frac{V_t}{2})\\lambda = \\frac{V_t}{2}(1+\\lambda)$\n\nThe current $I_t$ flowing from the test source is the current through the resistor between `a_0` and `d_1`:\n$I_t = \\frac{V_t - V_{d1}}{r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_t - \\frac{V_t}{2}(1+\\lambda) \\right) = \\frac{V_t}{2r}(1-\\lambda)$\n\nNow, we calculate $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_t}{I_t} = \\frac{V_t}{\\frac{V_t}{2r}(1-\\lambda)} = \\frac{2r}{1-\\lambda}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of `r` and `C`.\n\n<<<$1/(r(1+sqrt(3))C)>>>"
