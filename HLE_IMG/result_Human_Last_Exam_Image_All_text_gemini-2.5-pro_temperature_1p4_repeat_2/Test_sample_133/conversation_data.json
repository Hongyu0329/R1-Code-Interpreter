    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) peak and Isotope Pattern**\n1.  We look at the highest mass-to-charge (m/z) region in the spectrum. There is a prominent cluster of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This is likely the molecular ion cluster.\n2.  Let's examine the relative intensities of these peaks from the table:\n    *   m/z 260: 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262: 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: 3.22%\n3.  The presence of multiple peaks separated by 2 mass units strongly suggests the presence of chlorine atoms. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), in an approximate 3:1 ratio.\n4.  Let's compare the observed pattern with theoretical patterns for multiple chlorine atoms:\n    *   For 2 Cl atoms: M:(M+2):(M+4) ratio is ~9:6:1 or ~100:67:11. This doesn't match.\n    *   For 3 Cl atoms: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ratio is ~27:27:9:1 or ~100:98:33:4.\n5.  Let's normalize the observed intensities to the peak at m/z 260 (assuming it's the M peak with all ³⁵Cl):\n    *   Ratio: 34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22\n    *   Normalized ratio: 100 : 83.3 : 37.1 : 9.25\n6.  This observed ratio (100:83:37:9) is a good match for the theoretical ratio for **three chlorine atoms** (100:98:33:4). The small discrepancies are common in experimental spectra.\n7.  Therefore, we conclude the molecule contains three chlorine atoms. The nominal molecular weight (the mass with the lightest isotopes, ³⁵Cl) is 260 u. The peak at m/z 260 is the M⁺ peak.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n1.  The nominal molecular weight (M) is 260. The molecule contains 3 Cl atoms.\n2.  The mass contributed by the three chlorine atoms is 3 × 35 = 105 u.\n3.  The mass of the rest of the molecule (composed of C, H, O, N...) is 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n4.  Let's find a plausible chemical formula for a fragment with mass 155. Assuming it's a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ):\n    *   Divide by the mass of carbon: 155 / 12 ≈ 12.9. So, let's try 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   If C = 12, the mass is 12 × 12 = 144 u.\n    *   The remaining mass is 155 - 144 = 11 u. This corresponds to 11 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   So, the hydrocarbon part is C₁₂H₁₁. Other combinations (e.g., containing O or N) are less plausible for mass 155.\n5.  The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n6.  Nitrogen Rule Check: The molecular weight (260) is an even number, which is consistent with the formula containing zero nitrogen atoms.\n7.  Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃: DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + 1 = 12 - 11/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. A DoU of 6 indicates a highly unsaturated or polycyclic structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak is at m/z 225. This peak corresponds to the most stable fragment ion. The loss from the molecular ion is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This is the characteristic loss of a chlorine radical (·Cl).\n    *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃]⁺· → [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ + ·Cl\n    *   Let's check the isotope pattern for the base peak at m/z 225. It has partners at m/z 227 (66.7%) and m/z 229 (22.2%). The ratio of 225:227 is 100:66.7, which is a perfect fit for a fragment containing two chlorine atoms (theoretical ratio ~100:67). This confirms our analysis.\n2.  **Peak at m/z 190:** The loss from the base peak (225) is 225 - 190 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a second chlorine atom.\n    *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ → [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺ + ·Cl\n3.  **Peak at m/z 155:** The loss from the m/z 190 fragment is 190 - 155 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of the third and final chlorine atom.\n    *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺ → [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺ + ·Cl\n4.  **Peak at m/z 47:** There is a significant peak at m/z 47 (18.4%) with an isotope peak at m/z 49 (6.24%). The intensity ratio is 18.4 / 6.24 ≈ 2.95, which is a near-perfect 3:1 ratio. This confirms the fragment contains one chlorine atom. The fragment with m/z 47 must be [C³⁵Cl]⁺. This strongly suggests the presence of a carbon atom bonded to at least one chlorine atom that can be easily fragmented, likely from a -CCl₃ or -CHCl₂ group.\n5.  **Peak at m/z 143:** There is a strong peak at m/z 143 (27.8%). This can be explained by another key fragmentation pathway. A structure similar to DDT often loses the trichloromethyl group (·CCl₃).\n    *   Mass of ·CCl₃ radical (nominal) = 12 + (3 × 35) = 117 u.\n    *   Loss from M⁺: 260 - 117 = 143 u.\n    *   This fragmentation pathway [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃]⁺· → [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺ + ·CCl₃ is plausible and explains the peak at m/z 143. Note that this is a different ion than the [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺ ion at m/z 155, which is formed by sequential loss of three Cl atoms. The ion at m/z 143 is likely [(C₅H₅)₂CH]⁺ from the structure proposed below.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n1.  The formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and the fragmentation suggests a structure with a CCl₃ group attached to a C₁₁H₁₁ framework. A structure analogous to the insecticide DDT is a strong candidate.\n2.  Let's propose the structure: **1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopentadienyl)ethane**.\n    *   Let's check the formula: The CCl₃ group is C₁Cl₃. The CH group is C₁H₁. The two cyclopentadienyl groups (C₅H₅) are C₁₀H₁₀. Total: C(1+1+10)H(1+10)Cl₃ = **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**. The formula matches.\n    *   Let's check the DoU: Each cyclopentadienyl ring has two double bonds and one ring, giving a DoU of 3. Two such rings give a total DoU of 6. This matches our calculated DoU.\n3.  This structure perfectly explains the fragmentation:\n    *   The molecule is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ (M=260).\n    *   Loses ·Cl to form the very stable cation [C₁₂H₁₀Cl₂-CH=C(C₅H₅)]⁺ or similar rearranged ion at m/z 225 (base peak).\n    *   Contains a -CCl₃ group, explaining the [CCl]⁺ fragment at m/z 47.\n    *   Loses the ·CCl₃ radical to form the [(C₅H₅)₂CH]⁺ fragment at m/z 143.\n4.  **Systematic IUPAC Name:** The parent chain is ethane. The substituents are three \"chloro\" groups on carbon 1, and two \"cyclopentadienyl\" groups on carbon 2. The standard representation for the cyclopentadienyl substituent is cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl.\n    *   Final Name: **1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl)ethane**\n\n<<<1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl)ethane>>>"
