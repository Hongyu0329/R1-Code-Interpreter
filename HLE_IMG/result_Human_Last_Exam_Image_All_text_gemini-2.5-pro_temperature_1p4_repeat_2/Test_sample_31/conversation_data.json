    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The first step is to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. We can analyze its features, such as the number of crossings and their arrangement.\n    *   **Counting Crossings:** By carefully tracing the single continuous loop, we can count the number of times it crosses over or under itself. There are a total of 9 crossings in this diagram.\n    *   **Knot Identification:** This particular diagram, with its characteristic central \"ladder\" of four crossings, is a well-known representation of the knot denoted as **9₄₂** in the Alexander-Briggs notation. We can confirm this by comparing the image with standard knot tables or online resources like the Knot Atlas or KnotInfo.\n\n2.  **Understand the Rasmussen Invariant (s-invariant):** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer-valued invariant for a knot `K`. It is a powerful tool in modern knot theory, derived from a structure called Khovanov homology. For this problem, we don't need to perform the full complex calculation, but we need to know some of its fundamental properties.\n    *   **Property under Mirroring:** A crucial property of the Rasmussen invariant is how it behaves with respect to the mirror image of a knot. If `mirror(K)` denotes the mirror image of knot `K`, their Rasmussen invariants are related by the equation:\n        `s(mirror(K)) = -s(K)`\n\n3.  **Investigate the Properties of the 9₄₂ Knot:** Now we look up the specific properties of the 9₄₂ knot from reliable sources in knot theory.\n    *   **Amphicheirality:** The 9₄₂ knot is known to be an **amphicheiral** (or **achiral**) knot. An amphicheiral knot is one that is ambient isotopic (i.e., deformable into) its own mirror image. This means that the 9₄₂ knot and its mirror image are fundamentally the same knot.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Value of the Rasmussen Invariant:** We can now combine the property of the Rasmussen invariant with the property of the 9₄₂ knot to find its value.\n    *   Let `K = 9₄₂`.\n    *   Since `K` is an amphicheiral knot, it is equivalent to its mirror image, `mirror(K)`.\n    *   Because the Rasmussen invariant is a knot invariant, equivalent knots must have the same value. Therefore, `s(K) = s(mirror(K))`.\n    *   From the property of the invariant, we also have `s(mirror(K)) = -s(K)`.\n    *   By combining these two facts, we get the equation: `s(K) = -s(K)`.\n    *   Adding `s(K)` to both sides gives `2 * s(K) = 0`.\n    *   The only integer solution to this equation is `s(K) = 0`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correct Knot Identification:** The entire analysis hinges on correctly identifying the knot as 9₄₂. The visual structure is quite distinct, making the identification reliable.\n*   **Understanding Amphicheirality:** It is key to understand that an amphicheiral knot is not just visually symmetric, but topologically equivalent to its mirror image.\n*   **Properties of Invariants:** Remembering or looking up the correct properties of the Rasmussen invariant, especially its relation to mirror images, is essential. Not all invariants behave this way (e.g., the Jones polynomial of an amphicheiral knot is not necessarily trivial).\n*   **Avoiding Direct Calculation:** The Rasmussen invariant is notoriously difficult to compute from its definition. The strategy used here—combining known properties of the knot and the invariant—is far more efficient and less error-prone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis that the knot is the amphicheiral knot 9₄₂, its Rasmussen invariant must be zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
