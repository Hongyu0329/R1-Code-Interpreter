    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the cover fragment:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image fragment:** The image displays a section of a book cover. The central figure is a creature that is white, ethereal, and has a single horn on its forehead. This is unmistakably a unicorn. The unicorn appears to be in motion, possibly running, which is suggested by the blurred, dynamic posture. The background is dark, suggesting a nighttime or forest setting. To the right, there is a portion of an architectural element, like a pillar or an archway, which is colored in warmer tones of gold and brown.\n\n2.  **Identify the art style:** The painterly style is distinctive and characteristic of illustrations found in popular fantasy series, particularly those aimed at young adult readers. The combination of a unicorn, a dark forest, and ornate framing strongly suggests a fantasy novel.\n\n3.  **Connect the art style to a known illustrator/series:** The specific style of this illustration is strongly reminiscent of the artwork by Mary GrandPré, who created the iconic covers for the US editions of the *Harry Potter* series.\n\n4.  **Recall the content of the relevant books:** In the *Harry Potter* series, unicorns feature prominently in the first book, where a unicorn is killed in the Forbidden Forest. The title of the first book is *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* in the UK and *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the US.\n\n5.  **Locate the specific book cover:** A search for the US cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* illustrated by Mary GrandPré reveals the complete artwork. The full cover depicts Harry Potter on his broomstick playing Quidditch, with various elements from the story in the background. On the far left of this cover, through an archway, a white unicorn is shown running in the Forbidden Forest.\n\n6.  **Confirm the match:** Comparing the provided image fragment with the unicorn on the cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* confirms a perfect match. The fragment shows the exact depiction of the unicorn, the dark background behind it, and the edge of the pillar to its right.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Fragmentary Evidence:** The image is only a small part of the full cover, so the analysis relies on recognizing a specific, distinctive detail.\n*   **Multiple Editions/Titles:** This book is known by two different titles (*Sorcerer's Stone* and *Philosopher's Stone*). The specific artwork shown is from the US edition, which is titled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n*   **Art Style as a Key Clue:** Recognizing the art style of the illustrator, Mary GrandPré, is the most direct path to identifying the book series.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the fragment is from the cover of the first book in the Harry Potter series.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
