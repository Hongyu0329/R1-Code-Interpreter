The final product is a spiro-ether formed by the hydrolysis of all six methoxy groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by the intramolecular attack of an ortho-hydroxyl group onto the central carbocation, resulting in a neutral molecule with a new five-membered ring containing an ether linkage. Its molecular formula is C19H14O6. The structure is depicted below.
