    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation of the cuneiform sign.**\n    The provided image is a line drawing of an early cuneiform sign. The sign has a clear pictographic origin, meaning it was originally a simplified picture of a real-world object. It consists of a rectangular base with internal lines and a triangular top, resembling a simple structure with a gabled roof.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider the historical context.**\n    The question specifies the \"third-millennium form\" of the sign. During the third millennium BCE (c. 3000-2000 BCE), cuneiform writing was evolving from its purely pictographic origins into a more abstract system of wedges. The sign shown is typical of this earlier, more representational stage.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the visual and historical context.**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Cuneiform signs for specific tools (like a plow, APIN, or an adze, N√çG.GUL) were also pictographic but looked like the tools they represented. This sign does not resemble a common tool.\n    *   **B. Guard:** The sign for \"guard\" (Sumerian: enun) is a different, more complex sign.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for \"bread\" or \"food ration\" (Sumerian: ninda; sign form GAR) was typically represented by a pictograph of a bowl, sometimes with a conical bread loaf inside. This does not match the image.\n    *   **D. Home:** The sign is a clear pictograph of a building or a house. The rectangular base represents the floor plan or walls of a reed house, and the triangular top represents the roof. This sign is known to be the archaic form of the Sumerian sign **√â**, which means \"house,\" \"home,\" or \"temple.\"\n    *   **E. Deity:** The cuneiform sign used as a determinative for a deity (Sumerian: dingir) was a star symbol (íÄ≠). This is visually very different from the sign in the image.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for \"beard\" (Sumerian: su) looks different and is often associated with the pictograph of a human head.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n    Based on the strong visual resemblance to a building and cross-referencing with known archaic cuneiform signs, the sign is identified as the early form of **√â**, meaning \"house\" or \"home\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
