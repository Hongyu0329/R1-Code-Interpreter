    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K based on their visual characteristics like color, texture, and composition.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and appears lightweight. It is characterized by a high number of small holes or cavities, giving it a spongy or bubbly appearance. This texture is known as vesicular. The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates the rock formed from gas-rich lava that cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface. The gas bubbles were trapped as the rock solidified. The reddish color often comes from the oxidation of iron.\n*   **Identification:** These features are characteristic of **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder), which is an extrusive igneous rock.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color, ranging from white to light grey. Like specimen H, it is highly vesicular, filled with many small holes. It appears to be very low in density.\n*   **Interpretation:** The light color suggests a felsic composition, meaning it is rich in silica. The vesicular texture indicates it formed from a frothy, gas-filled lava that cooled very quickly.\n*   **Identification:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, low-density volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments of various colors and sizes. These fragments are noticeably angular and are cemented together in a fine-grained matrix.\n*   **Interpretation:** A rock composed of cemented, angular fragments is known as a breccia. The angularity of the clasts (fragments) suggests they were not transported far from their source before being cemented together. If the fragments are of volcanic origin, it is a volcanic breccia.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is a **Breccia**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is made of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic. The mineral composition appears to be a mix of light-colored minerals (like pink/white feldspar and grey quartz) and some darker minerals (like biotite or hornblende).\n*   **Interpretation:** The large crystal size indicates the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing ample time for crystals to grow. This points to an intrusive igneous rock. The light color and mineral assemblage are typical of a felsic composition.\n*   **Identification:** A coarse-grained, light-colored, intrusive igneous rock is identified as **Granite**. Due to the very large size of the crystals, it could also be more specifically called a **Pegmatite**, which is a type of granite with exceptionally large crystals.\n\n**Summary of Identifications**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite (or Pegmatite)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite (or Pegmatite)\n>>>"
