    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reaction starts with a pentacyclic triterpene alcohol and treats it with catalytic acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 °C). The products are an alkene and water. This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which proceeds through a carbocation intermediate. The question explicitly states that the mechanism involves a series of `[1,2]` shifts, indicating a significant carbocation rearrangement is taking place. The high temperature provides the energy for this complex rearrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material and Product Skeletons**\n*   **Starting Material:** The stereochemistry of the ring junctions and the pattern of methyl groups are characteristic of the **friedelane** skeleton. The molecule is specifically **friedelan-3-ol**.\n*   **Product:** The product molecule has the methyl group pattern and ring fusion stereochemistry of the **oleanane** skeleton. The double bond is located between carbons 12 and 13 (using standard oleanane numbering). The product is **olean-12-ene** (also known as δ-amyrin).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The reaction is a well-known \"friedelane-oleanane rearrangement\", a classic example of a backbone rearrangement in terpenoid chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe mechanism involves the formation of a carbocation, followed by a cascade of [1,2] shifts, and finally elimination to form the alkene.\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This group leaves as a water molecule, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n2.  **Cascade of [1,2] Shifts:** A series of seven sequential, stereospecific [1,2] shifts of methyl (CH₃) and hydride (H) groups occurs. This \"zipper\" reaction moves the positive charge across the molecule, converting the higher-energy friedelane skeleton into the more stable oleanane skeleton.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A **CH₃** group shifts from C-4 to C-3. The positive charge moves to C-4 (now a tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 2:** A **H** atom shifts from C-5 to C-4. The charge moves to C-5.\n    *   **Shift 3:** A **CH₃** group shifts from C-10 to C-5. The charge moves to C-10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** A **H** atom shifts from C-9 to C-10. The charge moves to C-9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** A **CH₃** group shifts from C-8 to C-9. The charge moves to C-8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** A **H** atom shifts from C-14 to C-8. The charge moves to C-14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** A **CH₃** group shifts from C-13 to C-14. The charge moves to C-13.\n\n3.  **Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade terminates with a stable tertiary carbocation at C-13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent C-12, forming the final C-12=C-13 double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Substituents at Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**\nBy carefully tracking which groups move and which stay in place during the rearrangement, we can determine the identity of the substituents at the labeled positions in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** C-4 starts with two CH₃ groups. One migrates away to C-3. The other, the α-methyl group (pointing down), remains at C-4. Thus, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):** The original CH₃ group at C-10 migrates to C-5. A H atom migrates from C-9 to take its place. Thus, **2 = H**.\n*   **Position 3 (on C-8):** The original CH₃ group at C-8 migrates to C-9. A H atom migrates from C-14 to take its place. Thus, **3 = H**.\n*   **Position 4 (on C-14):** C-14 starts with a CH₃ group (β, pointing up) and a H atom (α, pointing down). The H atom migrates away to C-8. The original β-CH₃ group at C-14 (labeled as 4) does not move. Thus, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (on C-14):** After its H atom migrates away, C-14 receives a CH₃ group from C-13. This new CH₃ group takes the α-position (pointing down, indicated by the dashed bond). Therefore, in the final product, C-14 has two methyl groups. The label '5' points to this second methyl group. Thus, **5 = CH₃**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = CH₃\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
