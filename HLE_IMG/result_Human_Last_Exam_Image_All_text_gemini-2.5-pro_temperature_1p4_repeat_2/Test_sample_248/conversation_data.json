    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organisms in the image.**\nThe photograph shows a typical rocky intertidal zone community. We can clearly distinguish several types of marine invertebrates:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, whitish, conical shells are attached to the dark rock. These are sessile crustaceans.\n*   **Sea Snails (Gastropods):** There are multiple snails.\n    *   A prominent, medium-sized snail with a grayish-tan shell that has distinct, brown spiral stripes.\n    *   A second large snail, whitish/cream-colored and somewhat eroded, lacking clear patterns.\n    *   Several smaller, darker, conical snails.\n\n**Step 2: Focus on identifying a species with a specific geographic range.**\nThe question requires us to find a species that is found on the Atlantic Coast but not the Pacific Coast. We need to identify one of the organisms in the photo to the species level and then check its known geographic distribution.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the most recognizable species.**\nThe most distinct and easily identifiable organism in the photograph is the snail with the striped shell. Its size, shape (robust, conical shell), and coloration are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**, whose scientific name is ***Littorina littorea***. The other larger, paler snail is likely an older, eroded specimen of the same species.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the geographic distribution of *Littorina littorea*.**\n*   **Native Range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic, along the coasts of Europe.\n*   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast around the 1840s and has since become one of the most common and widespread intertidal snails from Canada to Maryland.\n*   **Pacific Presence:** *Littorina littorea* has also been introduced to the Pacific Coast of North America. However, these populations are localized and not widespread. They are found in specific bays (like San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound) but are not a characteristic feature of the open Pacific coastline in the way they are in the Atlantic.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate other species as potential indicators.**\n*   **Barnacles:** The barnacles resemble the Common Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is indeed exclusive to the North Atlantic. However, identifying barnacles to the species level from a photograph without seeing specific details can be difficult, as Pacific species like *Balanus glandula* can appear similar.\n*   **Small Snails:** The small, dark snails could be the Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis*, which is also an exclusive Atlantic species. Again, identification from this photo is not as certain as for the larger snail.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude based on the most definitive evidence.**\nWhile *Semibalanus balanoides* and *Littorina saxatilis* would be absolute indicators if positively identified, the most confidently identifiable species in the image is *Littorina littorea*. The presence of a thriving population of *Littorina littorea* in this type of rocky shore habitat is a classic, textbook indicator of a North Atlantic coastal environment. Although isolated populations exist in the Pacific, their presence is not typical of the general Pacific coastline. Therefore, for all practical ecological purposes, *Littorina littorea* definitively points to the photo being taken on the Atlantic coast.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
