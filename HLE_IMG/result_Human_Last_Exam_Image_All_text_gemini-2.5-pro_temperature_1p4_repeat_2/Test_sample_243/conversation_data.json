    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant in the Image**\nThe image displays a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key features to note are:\n*   **Leaf Color and Texture:** The leaves are a deep, dark green. They appear somewhat glossy.\n*   **Vein Pattern:** The most striking feature is the intricate network (reticulation) of silvery-white or pale green veins that stand out starkly against the dark green leaf blade.\n*   **Leaf Shape:** The leaves are elongated and elliptical or lanceolate (lance-shaped).\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves seem to be arranged in whorls or closely packed along the stem. The stems themselves have a slight purplish tint.\nBased on these unique characteristics, the plant can be identified as ***Debregeasia orientalis***. It is an evergreen shrub in the nettle family (Urticaceae) and is sometimes known by the common name \"oriental false nettle\" or sold under names like 'Silver Veins'.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Native Range of the Plant**\nNow that the plant is identified as *Debregeasia orientalis*, the next step is to research its natural habitat and distribution to find where it is endemic.\n*   Botanical databases and resources (such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew's \"Plants of the World Online\" and various flora guides) are consulted to find the native range of this species.\n*   These resources consistently state that *Debregeasia orientalis* is native to East Asia.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Island(s)**\nThe question asks for the specific island to which the plant was endemic.\n*   Looking deeper into the native range of *Debregeasia orientalis*, its distribution is specifically listed as Taiwan and the Nansei-shoto (also known as the Ryukyu Islands) of Japan.\n*   The type specimen (the original plant used to describe the species) was collected in Taiwan (historically known as Formosa).\n*   Since the plant is native to the island of Taiwan and the nearby Ryukyu Islands, and the question asks for \"the island\" in the singular, Taiwan is the most prominent and accurate answer.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the plant. While other plants like *Fittonia* (nerve plant) have patterned veins, their leaf shape, size, and growth habit (low-growing groundcover) are different from the shrub-like plant in the photo.\n*   **Understanding \"Endemic\":** The term endemic means a species is native and restricted to a certain place. While *Debregeasia orientalis* is found on more than one island, its native range is limited to this specific geographic region (Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands).\n*   **Singular vs. Plural:** The question asks for \"the island\" (singular). As the plant is native to the large island of Taiwan as well as the Ryukyu island chain, naming the main island, Taiwan, is the most direct and appropriate response.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the plant as *Debregeasia orientalis* and researching its native distribution, we can conclude that it is endemic to the island of Taiwan and the neighboring Ryukyu Islands.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
