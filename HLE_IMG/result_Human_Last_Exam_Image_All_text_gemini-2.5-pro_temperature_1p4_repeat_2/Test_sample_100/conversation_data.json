    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic compound, specifically a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N-2) is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The formula for a PMB group is C8H9O.\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group attached to the double bond at position C-5.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    1.  **Bicyclic Core (with CF3 and lactam):** Let's count the atoms of the core structure C5H5(CF3)N(CO).\n        *   Carbons: 5 carbons in the [2.2.1] skeleton (C1, C4, C5, C6, C7), 1 carbon for the carbonyl group (C3), and 1 carbon in the CF3 group. Total = 7 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: There are hydrogens at C1, C4, C6, and two at C7. Total = 5 hydrogens.\n        *   Fluorines: 3 from the CF3 group.\n        *   Nitrogen: 1 from the lactam.\n        *   Oxygen: 1 from the carbonyl group.\n        *   Formula of the deprotected core (with CF3): C7H5F3NO. Note that the N would have an H if deprotected, making it C7H6F3NO.\n    2.  **Adding the PMB group:** The PMB group (C8H9O) replaces the H on the nitrogen atom.\n        *   Carbons: 7 (core) + 8 (PMB) = 15 C\n        *   Hydrogens: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14 H\n        *   Fluorines: 3 F\n        *   Nitrogen: 1 N\n        *   Oxygens: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2 O\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Start with C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   Remove the PMB group (C8H9O). This leaves C7H5F3NO.\n    *   Add one H atom to the nitrogen.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C7H6F3NO.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) to a single bond (C5-C6).\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO).\n    *   The hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = C7H8F3NO.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The lactam (a cyclic amide) in Intermediate 2 will be hydrolyzed. This reaction opens the ring by cleaving the amide bond (the N2-C3 bond).\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Hydrolysis of an amide bond consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The C=O group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2). In the acidic conditions, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+).\n    *   The net change in the molecular formula is the addition of one molecule of H2O.\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO).\n    *   Add H2O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C7H(8+2)F3N(O+1) = C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe final product is an amino acid, specifically a cis-1-amino-4-carboxy cyclopentane derivative with a trifluoromethyl group. Let's confirm the atom count based on this structure:\n*   Carbons: 5 in the cyclopentane ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CF3 group = 7 C.\n*   Hydrogens: 7 on the cyclopentane ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 2 in the -NH2 group = 10 H.\n*   Fluorines: 3 in the -CF3 group.\n*   Nitrogen: 1 in the -NH2 group.\n*   Oxygens: 2 in the -COOH group.\nThe derived structure is consistent with the formula C7H10F3NO2.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nStarting Material (C15H14F3NO2) -> Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) -> Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) -> Product (C7H10F3NO2).\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
