    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\nThe image displays a circular bas-relief (a sculpture in which the figures project only slightly from the background) set within a decorative square frame. The style is clearly that of the Italian Renaissance. The material appears to be a type of ceramic or terracotta, given the smooth finish and the nature of the relief. The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering a sacrament, likely the Eucharist (Holy Communion), to a group of kneeling figures.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the inscription.**\nAt the bottom of the circular relief, there is a small cartouche with an inscription. Using the zoomed-in crops, the text can be read as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic form of Italian/French that translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject matter is the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the style and medium to a specific school or artist.**\nThe technique of glazed terracotta bas-relief was famously pioneered and perfected by the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries. The graceful figures, balanced composition, and decorative framing with fruit and leaf motifs are all hallmarks of their work. The leading figures of this workshop were Luca della Robbia, his nephew Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's son Giovanni della Robbia.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific artwork and its creator.**\nBy searching for \"Della Robbia,\" \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" or \"Sacramenti de l'Autel,\" we can identify this specific piece. This roundel is a detail from the predella (the base platform) of the *Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament*. This altarpiece is located in the Collegiate Church of San Giovanni Battista in Fucecchio, Italy. Art historians attribute this significant work, created around 1484-1490, to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525). He was the nephew of Luca della Robbia and took over the highly successful family workshop, continuing its legacy of producing these distinctive glazed terracotta sculptures.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to confirm the author.**\nThe subject matter (Sacrament of the Altar), the unique medium (glazed terracotta relief), the distinctive Renaissance style, and the specific identification of the artwork as a panel from the Fucecchio Altarpiece all point conclusively to Andrea della Robbia as the author.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
