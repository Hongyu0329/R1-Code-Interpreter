    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components of the erasure poem.**\nAn erasure poem is created by taking an existing text and erasing or obscuring parts of it, leaving a new poem composed of the remaining words. In this collage-style erasure, we must consider all the text that has been deliberately left visible on the page as part of the final poem. This includes:\n*   The title from the original page: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n*   The page number from the original page: \"35\"\n*   The cutout words collaged onto the image: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\".\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the poem's text.**\nTo analyze the meter, we first need to read the words in a coherent order. A logical reading order is from top to bottom, incorporating all visible text elements.\nThis gives us the following line:\n\"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work.\"\n\n**Step 3: Count the syllables in the poem.**\nWe need to count the syllables for each word or phrase in the assembled line:\n*   \"The first step\": The (1) + first (1) + step (1) = 3 syllables\n*   \"thirty-five\" (reading the number 35): thir-ty (2) + five (1) = 3 syllables\n*   \"rules\": 1 syllable\n*   \"and\": 1 syllable\n*   \"lines\": 1 syllable\n*   \"an\": 1 syllable\n*   \"intricate\": in-tri-cate = 3 syllables\n*   \"spider's\": spi-der's = 2 syllables\n*   \"web\": 1 syllable\n*   \"work\": 1 syllable\n\nNow, let's sum the total number of syllables:\n3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the answer choices based on the syllable count and structure.**\nWe will now evaluate each metric pattern provided in the answer choices against our findings.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** Poetry with no regular meter or rhyme. While the poem's rhythm is not strictly regular, if there's a more specific form that fits, it would be a better answer.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** A line with 10 syllables in an alternating unstressed-stressed pattern. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line with 12 syllables. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A specific stanzaic form, with its main lines having 11 syllables and a distinct meter. Our poem is a single sentence of 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line with three iambic feet, typically around 6 syllables. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A poetic form, popularized by Allen Ginsberg, that consists of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nOur analysis shows that the poem consists of a single sentence with exactly 17 syllables. This perfectly matches the definition of an **American Sentence**. The inclusion of this specific and less common poetic form as an answer choice strongly suggests that this is the intended interpretation, requiring the solver to identify all parts of the erasure poem and know the definition of this form.\n\n<<<F>>>"
