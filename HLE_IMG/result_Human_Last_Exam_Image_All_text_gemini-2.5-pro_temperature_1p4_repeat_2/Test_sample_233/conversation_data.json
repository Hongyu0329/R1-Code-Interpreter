    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial query and visual information.**\nThe request asks for the ID of a specific \"Ingvar runestone\" shown in an image fragment. The term \"Ingvar runestone\" refers to a specific group of about 30 Viking Age runestones that commemorate those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland). This context is a crucial starting point. The image itself shows runic text carved on stone. A highly distinctive feature is that the runes are arranged in a grid-like pattern, separated by horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n**Step 2: Use key features to narrow down the specific runestone.**\nThe most unique visual characteristic is the grid or register format of the inscription. Most runestones feature inscriptions that follow the winding bands of a serpent or dragon. An inscription neatly divided into rows and columns is very rare. Combining this visual clue with the \"Ingvar runestone\" classification, we can search for a stone that matches both criteria. This search quickly points to the **Gripholm Runestone**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the identification by examining the runic text.**\nTo confirm that the image fragment is indeed from the Gripholm Runestone, we can attempt to transliterate the visible runes and compare them to the known inscription of this stone. The full inscription on the Gripholm Runestone reads (in transliteration):\n\n`× tula : lit : raisa : stain : þinsa| |at : sun : sin : haralt : bruþur : | inkuars : þaiR furu : trikila : | fiari : at : kuli : auk : austarla| |arþu : sunar-la : a sirk-lan-i`\n\nWhich translates to: \"Tola had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east they fed the eagle. They died in the south in Serkland.\"\n\nLet's match the runes in the image to a section of this text:\n*   **Middle Row:** The most complete row in the image reads, from left to right: word divider (`x`), `ᛋ` (s), `ᚢ` (u), `ᚾ` (n), `ᛅ` (a), `ᚱ` (r), `ᛚ` (l), `ᛅ` (a), word divider (`x`). This transliterates to **`: sunarla :`**.\n*   **Top Row:** This row shows the end of the line preceding `: sunarla :`. The main inscription has `... austarla| |arþu : sunar-la ...`. The visible runes in the top row, from right to left, are `ᚢ` (u), `ᚦ` (þ), `ᚱ` (r), `ᛅ` (a). This spells out **`arþu`**, which perfectly matches the inscription.\n*   **Bottom Row:** This row shows the beginning of the text following `: sunarla :`. The inscription has `... sunar-la : a sirk-lan-i`. The visible runes are: word divider (`x`), `ᛅ` (a), a word divider (`:` represented by a dot in the inscription, but here it looks like a break), followed by a character resembling a `*`. This `*` is a known variant of the `ᛋ` (s) rune. This corresponds to the start of the next section, **`: a s...`**.\n\nThe exact match of the sequence **`... arþu : sunarla : a s...`** confirms beyond doubt that the image depicts the Gripholm Runestone.\n\n**Step 4: Provide the official ID.**\nRunestones in Sweden are catalogued in the Rundata project. Each stone has a unique identifier based on the province it was found in. The Gripholm Runestone is located in Södermanland. Therefore, its official designation is **Sö 179**.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
