    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the object:** The image displays a medallion, a circular object with a flat suspension loop at the top, suggesting it was meant to be worn or displayed. It is made of a reflective material, likely a precious metal like silver. The style is repoussé, where the design is hammered from the reverse side to create a raised relief.\n\n2.  **Analyze the iconography:** The medallion features two busts in profile facing each other. This \"vis-à-vis\" (face-to-face) portrait format was common on Roman imperial coinage and medallions, often depicting the emperor and his empress or co-ruler.\n    *   **The male figure (left):** He is depicted with short hair and clean-shaven, which was common for Roman emperors of certain periods. The most striking and diagnostic feature is the large, curved, and ridged horn sprouting from his temple. This is the ram's horn, an attribute of the god Jupiter-Ammon (a syncretic Greco-Roman version of the Egyptian god Amun). Roman emperors, following the example of Alexander the Great, sometimes adopted this iconography to associate themselves with divinity and divine favor.\n    *   **The female figure (right):** She is shown with an elaborate hairstyle, where the hair is braided and piled high on her head. This type of complex coiffure is a key chronological marker in Roman art. She wears earrings and a draped garment.\n\n3.  **Identify the artistic style:** The portrait style is characteristic of Late Antiquity. The faces are somewhat idealized and formal, with large, prominent eyes that gaze forward rather than engaging with each other. This departs from the more naturalistic portraiture of the earlier Roman Empire and is typical of the art produced under the Constantinian dynasty and their successors.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the information for dating:**\n    *   The combination of the Jupiter-Ammon horn on an emperor and the Late Antique artistic style points strongly to the 4th century A.D.\n    *   The specific hairstyle of the empress is characteristic of the mid-4th century.\n    *   This specific object is well-known to archaeologists and art historians. It is the famous **Kerch Medallion**, discovered in Kerch (ancient Panticapaeum) in Crimea.\n    *   Scholarly consensus identifies the male figure as the Emperor Constantius II (reigned 337-361 A.D.) and the female figure as his wife, the Empress Eusebia.\n    *   Therefore, the medallion was created during his reign, placing it firmly in the **mid-4th century A.D.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the iconography (imperial portraits, ram's horn), artistic style (Late Antique), and known archaeological context (the Kerch Medallion of Constantius II), the object is ascribed to the 4th century A.D.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The horn is key:** Mistaking the ram's horn for a laurel wreath or other headwear would make identification much harder. It's the most specific iconographic clue.\n*   **Artistic style as a dating tool:** The shift from classical naturalism to the more formal, abstract style of Late Antiquity is a crucial element for dating Roman art from this period.\n*   **Imperial portraits:** Recognizing the format as typical for imperial propaganda helps narrow down the context to the Roman Empire.\n*   **Cross-referencing:** Confirming the object's identity as a known artifact (the Kerch Medallion) solidifies the dating provided by stylistic and iconographic analysis.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
