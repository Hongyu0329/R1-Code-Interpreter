    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario in Table 1 with the \"Proposed\" scenario in Table 2.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT Definition:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. This refers to the total miles traveled by vehicles (cars in this case), not the people inside them. Therefore, we must sum the shares of both car types (`car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`) to find the total car usage.\n2.  **Irrelevant Data:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) are not needed to calculate VMT, as VMT is concerned with the vehicle's travel, not the number of passengers.\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is not a simple average. It's a weighted sum based on the distribution of trips across different distance categories. The VMT for each category is calculated as: `(Share of Total Trips) x (Average Trip Distance) x (Total Car Mode Share for that distance)`.\n4.  **Relative Calculation:** Since the total number of trips is not provided, we can calculate the average VMT per trip. This relative value is sufficient for determining the percentage reduction, as the unknown total number of trips would cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe will calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category and then sum them up.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48%\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   Total car mode share: 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.48 * 1 * 0.53 = 0.2544`\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22%\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.22 * 4 * 0.81 = 0.7128`\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14%\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.14 * 7.5 * 0.85 = 0.8925`\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16%\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.16 * 20 * 0.89 = 2.848`\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT (relative value):**\n    *   `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.848 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48%\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   Total car mode share: 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.48 * 1 * 0.03 = 0.0144`\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22%\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.22 * 4 * 0.27 = 0.2376`\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14%\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.14 * 7.5 * 0.41 = 0.4305`\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16%\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   Total car mode share: 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.16 * 20 * 0.49 = 1.568`\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT (relative value):**\n    *   `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.568 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   Percentage Reduction = `(2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100%`\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ `0.52195 * 100%`\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ `52.2%`\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
