    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature shows one flat (B♭). This typically indicates the key of F major or D minor.\n    *   The first chord is F minor (F-), and the piece consistently resolves towards F minor, indicating that the overall key is F minor. It's common in jazz lead sheets to use a simpler key signature and add accidentals as needed.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   The chord progression in the first few bars is highly distinctive.\n    *   Bar 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Bar 2: E-7♭5 (E half-diminished 7)\n    *   Bar 3: E♭-6 (E-flat minor 6)\n    *   Bar 4: D♭maj7 (D-flat major 7)\n    *   This progression features a descending chromatic bass line (F, E, E♭, D♭), which is a very strong characteristic and a major clue for identifying the tune.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   Let's transcribe the melody of the first four bars, paying attention to the key signature and accidentals.\n    *   Bar 1 (over F-): The notes are C, B♭, A♭, G. This is a descending line from the 5th of the F minor scale.\n    *   Bar 2 (over E-7♭5): The notes are F, E♭, D.\n    *   Bar 3 (over E♭-6): The notes are E♭, D♭, C.\n    *   Bar 4 (over D♭maj7): The notes are C, B♮, B♭.\n    *   The melody follows a descending pattern that complements the descending bass line of the chords.\n\n4.  **Identify the Song and Composer:**\n    *   The combination of the F minor tonality, the unique descending chromatic chord progression (F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7), and the corresponding descending melody is the unmistakable signature of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n    *   This piece was composed by the influential hard bop jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded in 1956 on the album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers*.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Bridge:**\n    *   The middle section (the bridge, or \"B\" section) begins on the third staff. The chord progression is D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |. This progression is the standard bridge for \"Nica's Dream,\" further confirming the identification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, chord progression, and overall structure, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
