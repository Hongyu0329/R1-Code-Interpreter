The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the formation of a rigid, bicyclic m端nchnone intermediate from N-acetyl-proline. Unlike the flexible, acyclic m端nchnone in Reactions 1 and 2, this bicyclic structure prevents isomerization. Reactions 1 and 2 demonstrate that while the cycloaddition itself is regioselective, the acyclic m端nchnone can isomerize (likely via a ring-opening/re-closing mechanism), scrambling its C2 and C4 substituents and leading to a mixture of labeled products. In Reaction 3, the absence of this isomerization pathway means the single, rigid m端nchnone intermediate reacts with methyl propiolate via a single regiochemical pathway, resulting in the formation of only one product, Product B.
