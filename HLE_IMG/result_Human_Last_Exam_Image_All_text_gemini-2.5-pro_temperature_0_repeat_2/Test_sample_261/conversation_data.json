    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the book title.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image shows a portion of an illustration. The key elements are:\n*   **A unicorn:** The creature is white or light blue, with a horse-like body and a single, golden horn on its forehead. It appears ethereal or ghostly.\n*   **Motion:** The unicorn is depicted in a dynamic pose, suggesting it is running or galloping.\n*   **Setting:** The background is dark and indistinct, resembling a forest at night.\n*   **Framing:** On the right side of the image, there is a vertical element that looks like a stone pillar or part of an architectural frame, which partially obscures the unicorn.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to known literary works.**\nThe scene of a unicorn in a dark forest is a powerful and memorable image in modern fantasy literature. This specific depiction strongly evokes a key scene from the Harry Potter series. In the first book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (or *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the US), Harry has a significant encounter with a unicorn in the Forbidden Forest.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and its source.**\nThe art style is very distinctive and matches the work of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original American editions of the Harry Potter series. By examining the cover art she created for the first book, we can confirm the source of the fragment.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the fragment on the book cover.**\nThe original US cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* features a central image of Harry on his broomstick. The entire scene is framed by a stone archway. If you look at the full cover, on the left-hand side, in the background behind one of the pillars of the arch, you can see this exact image of the ghostly unicorn running through the forest. The provided image is a zoomed-in crop of this specific detail from the cover.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the book title.**\nSince the fragment is a confirmed detail from the original US cover illustration by Mary GrandPré, the book is the first installment of the Harry Potter series. The title associated with this specific cover is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
