    "An analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm designed to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the array is considered sorted, and the function returns.\n    -   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then checks if the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the `(n-1)`-th element (`a[n-2]`). After the first step, `a[n-2]` should be the largest element in the `a[0...n-2]` subarray.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it means `a[n-1]` is out of place, so it's swapped with `a[n-2]`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial part. If a swap occurred, the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements might have been disrupted. For example, the new element at `a[n-2]` (which was originally at `a[n-1]`) might be smaller than `a[n-3]`. To fix this, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the entire prefix.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Time Complexity Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for sorting an array of size `n`. The `if` statement and the `swap` operation take constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n    -   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens, contributing `T(n-1)` to the complexity.\n    -   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` only happens if the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true.\n\n    This gives us two scenarios:\n    -   **Best Case:** The condition is false. The recurrence is `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`. This solves to `O(n)`. This occurs when the array is already sorted.\n    -   **Worst Case:** The condition is true. The recurrence is `T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We need to determine when this worst case happens.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition is met at every level of the recursion. Let's consider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    -   Let's analyze `sort(a, n)` on this input.\n    -   The first call, `sort(a, n-1)`, is executed. It will sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. So, `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The whole array `a` is now `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    -   Next, the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is checked. This is `1 < n`. For any `n > 1`, this condition is true.\n    -   Therefore, a swap occurs, and the second recursive call `sort(a, n-1)` is executed.\n    -   This pattern repeats for the recursive calls on `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on. Thus, a reverse-sorted array represents the worst-case input.\n\n4.  **Solving the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, with a base case `T(1) = O(1) = d`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   Expanding this `k` times: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 1)`\n    -   The sum is a geometric series `(2^k - 1)`. So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n    -   To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    -   The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is `O(2^n)`. The algorithm will always terminate because the size of the problem `n` decreases with each recursive call.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\n-   A. O(n): Best-case complexity.\n-   B. O(n log n): Complexity of efficient sorting algorithms.\n-   C. O(n^2): Complexity of simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.\n-   D. O(n^3): Not applicable here.\n-   E. O(2^n): Matches our analysis for the worst-case complexity.\n-   F. does not terminate: Incorrect, the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe correct answer is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
