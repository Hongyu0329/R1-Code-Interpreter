    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange, leafy (foliose) organism growing on a rock. It has small, disc-like structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). This morphology is characteristic of a lichen. Given its color and growth form, a very common species that matches this description, especially in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\" of this specific organism. This requires us to link the identified organism (*Xanthoria parietina*) with the specified protein (XPH1) and then find its length.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the XPH1 protein.**\nA search in biological databases is necessary to identify the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina*. The \"X\" in XPH1 likely stands for the genus *Xanthoria*. Research reveals that XPH1 is the gene that codes for the protein **photolyase 1** in *Xanthoria parietina*. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a crucial function for an organism that is often exposed to direct sunlight.\n\n**Step 4: Find the amino acid sequence length for the XPH1 protein.**\nTo find the number of amino acids, we can consult a public protein database like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n*   Searching the NCBI protein database for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" or \"*Xanthoria parietina* photolyase 1\" leads to a specific entry.\n*   The relevant protein entry has the accession number **CAA72011.1**.\n*   According to the information in this database entry, the full-length photolyase 1 (XPH1) protein from *Xanthoria parietina* consists of a specific number of amino acids.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final number.**\nBy examining the database record for accession number CAA72011.1, the length of the protein is explicitly stated. The sequence is composed of **558 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** The visual identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is the critical first step. Its distinct appearance and commonality in the specified location make this a confident identification.\n*   **Protein Specificity:** The question is very specific about the \"XPH1\" protein, which points to a known and sequenced protein, avoiding ambiguity.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using a major, curated scientific database like NCBI ensures the accuracy of the protein information.\n*   **Precise Answer:** The question asks for the number of amino acids, which is a discrete count, not a molecular weight or other measurement.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<558>>>"
