**Product A:** A dihydropyridone fused to a pyrrolidine ring, resulting from a decarboxylative cycloaddition. A plausible structure is methyl 2-acetyl-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-4-oxo-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline-3-carboxylate.

**Product B:** A tricyclic dione, resulting from a complex rearrangement and elimination cascade. A plausible structure is a derivative of dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-d]pyrazine-dione.

**Product C:** The mixed anhydride, [1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl] acetate.
