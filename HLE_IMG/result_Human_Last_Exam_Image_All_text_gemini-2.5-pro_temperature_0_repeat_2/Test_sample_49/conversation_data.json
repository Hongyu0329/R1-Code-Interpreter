    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Goal**\n\nThe circuit is an infinite resistive ladder network with an input at node $c_0$ and a capacitor $C$ connected at node $a_0$. We need to find the cutoff frequency of this circuit at node $a_0$. This is a low-pass filter, as the capacitor shunts high-frequency signals to the ground. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the filter's output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ (or -3 dB) of its DC value.\n\n**2. Thevenin's Theorem Approach**\n\nThe cutoff frequency of an RC filter is determined by the resistance and capacitance. We can simplify the circuit as seen by the capacitor $C$ by finding the Thevenin equivalent circuit connected to node $a_0$.\nThe Thevenin equivalent consists of a Thevenin voltage source $V_{th}$ and a Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$. The cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} $$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. Our main task is to find the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with the capacitor $C$ removed and all independent sources turned off. Turning off the input voltage source at \"IN\" (node $c_0$) means connecting node $c_0$ to ground.\n\nWe will use the method of node voltage analysis by injecting a test current $I_0$ at node $a_0$ and calculating the resulting voltage $V_{a0}$. Then, $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_0$.\n\nLet $V_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $U_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$. The input node $c_0$ is grounded, so $V_0 = 0$.\n\nWe can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for the nodes (after multiplying by $r$):\n*   At node $a_0$: A current $I_0$ is injected. The voltage $V_{a0}$ is related to the voltage at node $d_1$ ($U_1$) by the resistor $r$ between them: $V_{a0} - U_1 = I_0 r$.\n*   At node $d_1$: $(U_1 - V_{a0}) + (U_1 - V_1) + (U_1 - U_2) = 0$. Substituting $(U_1 - V_{a0}) = -I_0 r$, we get $2U_1 - V_1 - U_2 = I_0 r$.\n*   At node $c_1$: $(V_1 - V_0) + (V_1 - U_1) + (V_1 - V_2) = 0$. Since $V_0 = 0$, this simplifies to $3V_1 - U_1 - V_2 = 0$.\n*   For any node $n \\ge 2$, the structure is repetitive:\n    *   KCL at $d_n$: $3U_n - U_{n-1} - V_n - U_{n+1} = 0$.\n    *   KCL at $c_n$: $3V_n - V_{n-1} - U_n - V_{n+1} = 0$.\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\n\nWe have a system of coupled linear difference equations. We look for solutions of the form $U_n = A k^n$ and $V_n = B k^n$. Substituting these into the general equations for $n \\ge 2$ leads to two types of solutions (modes) that are bounded as $n \\to \\infty$:\n1.  A symmetric mode where $V_n = U_n$, which corresponds to $k=1$.\n2.  An anti-symmetric mode where $V_n = -U_n$, which corresponds to $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution for $n \\ge 1$ that vanishes at infinity is a superposition of these modes:\n$$ U_n = A \\cdot 1^n + C \\cdot k^n = A + Ck^n $$\n$$ V_n = A \\cdot 1^n - C \\cdot k^n = A - Ck^n $$\nwhere $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we use the boundary conditions at $n=1$ to find the constants $A$ and $C$.\nUsing the KCL equation at $c_1$: $3V_1 - U_1 - V_2 = 0$.\nSubstituting the general solutions for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n$3(A - Ck) - (A + Ck) - (A - Ck^2) = 0$\n$A(3-1-1) + C(-3k-k+k^2) = 0$\n$A + C(k^2 - 4k) = 0$\nFrom the characteristic equation for the anti-symmetric mode, we know $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, so $k^2 - 4k = -1$.\nThis gives $A - C = 0$, which means $A = C$.\n\nSo the solution simplifies to:\n$$ U_n = A(1 + k^n) $$\n$$ V_n = A(1 - k^n) $$\n\nNext, we use the KCL equation at $d_1$ to find $A$: $2U_1 - V_1 - U_2 = I_0 r$.\n$2A(1+k) - A(1-k) - A(1+k^2) = I_0 r$\n$A(2+2k - 1+k - 1-k^2) = I_0 r$\n$A(3k - k^2) = I_0 r$\nUsing $k^2 = 4k-1$, we get $A(3k - (4k-1)) = I_0 r$, which simplifies to $A(1-k) = I_0 r$.\nSo, $A = \\frac{I_0 r}{1-k}$.\n\n**5. Finalizing the Thevenin Resistance and Cutoff Frequency**\n\nNow we can find $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_0$.\n$V_{a0} = I_0 r + U_1 = I_0 r + A(1+k)$.\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_{a0}}{I_0} = r + \\frac{A(1+k)}{I_0}$.\nSubstitute the expression for $A$:\n$R_{th} = r + \\frac{(I_0 r / (1-k))(1+k)}{I_0} = r + r\\frac{1+k}{1-k}$\n$R_{th} = r \\left( 1 + \\frac{1+k}{1-k} \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{1-k+1+k}{1-k} \\right) = r \\frac{2}{1-k}$.\n\nNow, substitute $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$1-k = 1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3} - 1$.\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)C} $$\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hz is:\n$$ f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)C} $$\n\n**Careful Points**\n*   The key to this problem is to correctly calculate the Thevenin resistance seen by the capacitor.\n*   The infinite nature of the ladder is handled by finding general solutions to the difference equations and applying boundary conditions at infinity (voltages must be bounded/vanish).\n*   The start of the ladder (at $n=0$ and $n=1$) is different from the rest, providing the necessary boundary conditions to solve for the unknown coefficients in the general solution.\n*   Careful algebraic manipulation, especially involving the value of $k$ and its properties (like $k^2-4k+1=0$), is crucial to avoid errors.\n*   The problem asks for the \"cutoff frequency\", which can refer to angular frequency $\\omega_c$ (in rad/s) or frequency $f_c$ (in Hz). The expression is what's important. We will provide the angular frequency as it is more direct.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe Thevenin resistance at node $a_0$ is calculated to be $R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\nThe cutoff angular frequency of an RC circuit is given by the formula $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$.\nSubstituting the value of $R_{th}$, we get the final expression for the cutoff frequency.\n\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C} $$\n\n<<<$1/(r*(1+sqrt(3))*C)>>>"
