    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the object and its style.**\n    The image shows a metal medallion, likely a phalera (a decorative disc for a military harness or horse trapping). It depicts two busts facing each other in high relief. The style is not classical Greek or Roman; it is more abstract and stylized. The figures have large, prominent eyes and intricately patterned hair. This artistic style is characteristic of the provincial Roman or \"barbarian\" art found on the frontiers of the Roman Empire, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Pontic Steppe region.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify key iconographic features.**\n    The most significant feature is the large, curved ram's horn on the head of the figure on the left. This is a powerful symbol, most famously associated with the Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon. Alexander the Great was famously depicted with the horns of Ammon, and this iconography was later adopted and adapted by other rulers and cultures. The presence of this motif points to a cultural context influenced by Hellenistic traditions but interpreted through a local artistic lens.\n\n*   **Step 3: Place the object in its archaeological context.**\n    This specific phalera is a well-known archaeological find. It is part of the **Kosanovo Hoard** (or Kosaniv treasure), discovered in Ukraine. This hoard, along with similar finds like those from Staryi Krym (Crimea), is attributed to the **Sarmatians**, an Iranian-speaking nomadic people who dominated the Pontic Steppe during the Roman period.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the date based on archaeological evidence.**\n    The Kosanovo Hoard and other related Sarmatian artifacts of this style are consistently dated by archaeologists. The combination of the object types, the artistic style (a local interpretation of Roman and Hellenistic motifs), and comparison with other dated finds places this phalera firmly in the Roman Imperial Period. The scholarly consensus dates the hoard to the late 2nd century AD or, more commonly, the first half of the **3rd century AD**. Therefore, the century archaeologists ascribe to this medallion is the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century AD>>>"
