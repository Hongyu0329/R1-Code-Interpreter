    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each horizontal line corresponds to the activity recorded by a single electrode.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential, or \"firing,\" of a neuron at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire together in a short amount of time. In the raster plot, these events appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating high firing activity across many electrodes simultaneously.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph, we can identify four major synchronized bursts. We need to estimate the time at the center of each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first prominent burst is located near the beginning of the recording. It is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second major burst occurs between 10 s and 20 s. It appears to be centered at approximately **t₂ = 16 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third major burst is between 30 s and 40 s. Its center is at approximately **t₃ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The final major burst is near the end of the recording, centered at approximately **t₄ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 16 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the midpoints of two consecutive bursts. We have three such intervals between the four identified bursts.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** The time between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 16 s - 2 s = **14 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** The time between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 16 s = **20 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** The time between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 3).\n\n*   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n*   Average IBI = (14 s + 20 s + 12 s) / 3\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 3\n*   Average IBI ≈ 15.333... s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated value is 15.333... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n*   The third digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n\nTherefore, the average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is **15 s**.\n\n<<<15>>>"
