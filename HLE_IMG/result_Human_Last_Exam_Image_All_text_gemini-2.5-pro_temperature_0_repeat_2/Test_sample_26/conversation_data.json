    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nThe key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key is either C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. Given that this is the first movement of the \"Pathetique\" Sonata, the home key is C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Analyze Measure 30**\nMeasure 30 is the third measure on the second system of the provided score. It is also circled in the image for easy identification. We need to identify all the notes played in this measure.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays a chord on the first beat consisting of the notes G (in two octaves) and B♮.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays a series of broken chords (arpeggios) throughout the measure. The notes in the arpeggio are G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Notes to Identify the Chord**\nCombining all the notes played simultaneously in measure 30, we get the pitches: G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n*   The notes G, B♮, and D form a G major triad.\n*   The F♯ is the major seventh above the root G.\n*   Together, these notes form a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chord's Function and Roman Numeral**\nNow we must determine the function of this Gmaj7 chord within the key of C minor.\n*   The tonic of the key is C.\n*   The note G is the fifth scale degree of C minor. Chords built on the fifth degree are called dominant chords.\n*   In minor keys, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree to create a leading tone. In C minor, the seventh degree is B♭, which is raised to B♮ to create a stronger pull to the tonic C. This makes the dominant triad a major chord (G-B♮-D) instead of a minor chord (G-B♭-D).\n*   Therefore, the G major triad (G-B♮-D) functions as the dominant chord in C minor. The Roman numeral for a major dominant chord is a capital V.\n*   The F♯ in the chord is a chromatic alteration. It is not part of the standard dominant or dominant seventh chord (which would have an F♮). In this context, the F♯ acts as a chromatic non-chord tone that increases tension and leads strongly to the G in the C minor tonic chord that follows in measure 31.\n*   Despite the presence of the chromatic F♯, the fundamental harmonic function of the chord in measure 30 is that of the dominant. The core harmony is the G major triad. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Accidentals are crucial:** The B is natural (♮), not flat (♭) as in the key signature. The F is sharp (♯), not natural as it would be in the key of C minor. These accidentals define the specific quality of the chord.\n*   **Function over literal spelling:** Roman numeral analysis is primarily about function. Even though the chord is a Gmaj7, its role in the progression (coming from a G7 in m. 29 and resolving to a Cm in m. 31) is unequivocally dominant.\n*   **Standard practice in minor keys:** The use of a major V chord in a minor key is the norm, so the B♮ is expected for a dominant function. The F♯ is the more unusual element, but it doesn't change the chord's root or its dominant function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord in measure 30 is built on G, the fifth degree of C minor. The triad is major (G-B♮-D). Therefore, its function is dominant, and the correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
