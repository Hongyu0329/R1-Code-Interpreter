    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify every unique splice variant (species) of mRNA transcript detected by the different RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. Each unique band or unique pattern of bands resulting from a specific primer pair represents one or more splice species.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This PCR uses a forward primer in the E1 exon (E1F1) and a reverse primer in the E4 exon (E4R). The gel shows two distinct bands (band 1: 190 bp, band 2: 159 bp). This indicates the existence of two different splice variants in this region.\n    *   **Species identified: 2** (Let's call them Species 1 and Species 2).\n\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This PCR uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a reverse primer further downstream in the E5 exon (E5R). It also shows two bands (band 1: 584 bp, band 2: 553 bp). The size difference between these bands is 31 bp (584 - 553), which is the same as the difference in Panel B (190 - 159). This confirms the presence of Species 1 and 2 but does not identify new ones.\n    *   **Cumulative species: 2**\n\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This PCR uses a specific forward primer, E1F2, which spans the 929^3465 splice junction. It produces a single band of 551 bp. Since this primer only amplifies transcripts containing this specific splice, this represents a new species, different from Species 1 and 2.\n    *   **Species identified: 1** (Let's call it Species 3).\n    *   **Cumulative species: 3**\n\n4.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This PCR uses the general E1F1 primer and a reverse primer in the L2 exon (L2R). It produces a single band of 1,005 bp. If this transcript were either Species 1 or Species 2, we would expect two bands reflecting the 31 bp difference. The presence of only one band indicates this is a distinct splice variant.\n    *   **Species identified: 1** (Let's call it Species 4).\n    *   **Cumulative species: 4**\n\n5.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This PCR uses the E1F2 primer (specific for the 929^3465 splice) and the L2R reverse primer. It produces a single band of 972 bp. This is a transcript containing the 929^3465 splice that extends to L2. It is different from Species 3, which also contained this splice but was detected with a primer in E5.\n    *   **Species identified: 1** (Let's call it Species 5).\n    *   **Cumulative species: 5**\n\n6.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This PCR uses the E1F3 primer, which is specific for a different splice junction (929^3506). It produces two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp, band 2: 931 bp). Since both are amplified by a primer for a unique splice junction and they have different sizes, they represent two new, distinct species.\n    *   **Species identified: 2** (Let's call them Species 6 and Species 7).\n    *   **Cumulative species: 5 + 2 = 7**\n\n7.  **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This PCR uses the general E1F1 primer and a reverse primer in the L1 exon (L1R). It shows two bands (band 1: 450 bp, band 2: 419 bp). The 31 bp difference is consistent with Species 1 and 2. This result confirms that Species 1 and 2 are also spliced to the L1 region but does not identify new species.\n    *   **Cumulative species: 7**\n\n8.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same PCR as in Panel H but run for more cycles, increasing sensitivity. It detects the same two bands (450 bp and 419 bp) corresponding to Species 1 and 2. In addition, it reveals two new, fainter bands (band 3: 378 bp, band 4: 187 bp). These represent two additional, less abundant splice variants.\n    *   **Species identified: 2** (Let's call them Species 8 and Species 9).\n    *   **Cumulative species: 7 + 2 = 9**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy systematically analyzing each PCR result and accounting for unique splice junctions and product sizes, we can identify a total of 9 distinct splice species.\n\n*   **Species 1 & 2:** Detected in panels B, C, H, and I.\n*   **Species 3:** Detected in panel D.\n*   **Species 4:** Detected in panel E.\n*   **Species 5:** Detected in panel F.\n*   **Species 6 & 7:** Detected in panel G.\n*   **Species 8 & 9:** Detected in panel I.\n\nTotal number of splice species is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
