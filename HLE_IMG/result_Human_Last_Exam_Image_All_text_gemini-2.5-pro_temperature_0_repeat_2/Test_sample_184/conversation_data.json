    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the two products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting materials and reaction conditions.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** The cyclobutene derivative. Let's determine its structure and name. The four-membered ring has a double bond. Let's number the ring starting from the bottom left carbon as C1.\n    *   C1: A CH₂ group.\n    *   C2: A carbon on the double bond, substituted with a methoxy group (MeO).\n    *   C3: The other carbon on the double bond, substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   C4: A quaternary carbon substituted with a methyl group (Me, shown with a wedge) and a methoxy group (OMe, shown with a dash).\n    *   The systematic name is (4R*)-3-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene (assuming the depicted stereoisomer). The formula is C₇H₁₂O₂.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCO₂Et). This is an electron-deficient alkene, making it a good dienophile for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Conditions:** Heat (Δ). This indicates that the reaction is thermally promoted, which is characteristic of pericyclic reactions like electrocyclic reactions and Diels-Alder cycloadditions.\n\n**Step 2: The 4π electrocyclic ring opening.**\n*   The first step is a 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene. This reaction involves four π electrons (two from the C=C bond and two from the σ bond being broken).\n*   Under thermal conditions (Δ), a 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** mechanism. This means the substituents on the carbons of the breaking σ bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n*   The σ bond that breaks is the one between the two sp³-hybridized carbons, which is the C1-C4 bond.\n*   The ring opening results in a conjugated 1,3-diene. The connectivity of the diene will be C4-C3=C2-C1. Let's trace the substituents:\n    *   C4 is substituted with Me and OMe.\n    *   C3 is substituted with H.\n    *   C2 is substituted with MeO.\n    *   C1 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The resulting diene is **CH₂=C(MeO)-CH=C(Me)(OMe)**. (2-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxy-1,3-butadiene).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the diene:** The starting material is chiral at C4. The conrotatory opening can occur in two ways (both ends rotate clockwise, or both rotate counter-clockwise). These two pathways are diastereotopic and will lead to two different diastereomeric dienes. The new stereocenter is the C3=C4 double bond. Let's call the two dienes Diene (Z) and Diene (E) with respect to this double bond.\n    *   **Diene (Z):** The higher priority groups on C3 (the C1-C2 part) and C4 (the OMe group) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Diene (E):** The higher priority groups on C3 and C4 are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   In the s-cis conformation required for the Diels-Alder reaction, the Z/E stereochemistry of the diene determines which substituent at C4 (Me or OMe) is pointing \"inside\" (towards the center of the C-shape) and which is \"outside\".\n        *   For **Diene (Z)**, the **OMe** group is \"inside\" and the **Me** group is \"outside\".\n        *   For **Diene (E)**, the **Me** group is \"inside\" and the **OMe** group is \"outside\".\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder cycloaddition.**\n*   The dienes formed in Step 2 react with ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** We need to determine how the diene and dienophile align. The options provided (A-H) help us deduce the correct regiochemistry. The connectivity in products A-D corresponds to an \"ortho\" cycloaddition, where the new bonds form between C1 of the diene and the CH(CO₂Et) carbon of the dienophile, and between C4 of the diene and the CH₂ carbon of the dienophile. This leads to a product where the C(Me,OMe) group and the CH(CO₂Et) group are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   Diene: **CH₂(1)=C(MeO)(2)-CH(3)=C(Me,OMe)(4)**\n    *   Dienophile: **CH₂(5)=CH(CO₂Et)(6)**\n    *   The reaction forms bonds between C4 and C5, and between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting cyclohexene has the structure shown in options A-D.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The question specifies an **endo** approach. The endo rule states that the electron-withdrawing group (CO₂Et) of the dienophile orients itself \"under\" the diene system. In the product, this means the CO₂Et group will be *cis* (on the same face of the ring) to the \"inside\" substituents of the diene.\n\n**Step 4: Predicting the final products.**\nWe now combine the outcomes for each of the two dienes reacting via an endo pathway. The stereocenters in the product are at C1 (the original C4 of the diene) and C3 (from the dienophile, using the numbering in the options).\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene (E):**\n    *   The \"inside\" group at C4 is the **Me** group.\n    *   In the endo transition state, the CO₂Et group is syn to the Me group.\n    *   Therefore, the product has the **Me** group at C1 and the **CO₂Et** group at C3 on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Looking at the options, structure **C** has the Me group at C1 as a wedge and the CO₂Et group at C3 as a wedge. They are cis. The OMe group at C1 is a dash (trans to CO₂Et). This matches our prediction.\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene (Z):**\n    *   The \"inside\" group at C4 is the **OMe** group.\n    *   In the endo transition state, the CO₂Et group is syn to the OMe group.\n    *   Therefore, the product has the **OMe** group at C1 and the **CO₂Et** group at C3 on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Looking at the options, structure **D** has the OMe group at C1 as a wedge and the CO₂Et group at C3 as a wedge. They are cis. The Me group at C1 is a dash (trans to CO₂Et). This matches our prediction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction of the single enantiomer of the starting cyclobutene proceeds through two diastereomeric diene intermediates. Each of these reacts in an endo Diels-Alder cycloaddition to give a specific diastereomeric product. The two products formed are **C** and **D**.\n\n<<<C and D>>>"
