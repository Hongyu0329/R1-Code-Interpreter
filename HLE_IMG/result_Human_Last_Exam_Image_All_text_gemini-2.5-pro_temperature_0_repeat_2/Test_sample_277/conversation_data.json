    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to determine the relationship between molecules shown in an image and select the correct option from a multiple-choice list.\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Information:** The image provided is completely black. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or names of any molecules shown. The question refers to \"the molecules mentioned above,\" but there are no molecules mentioned or depicted.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The question is unanswerable because the necessary information (the structures of the molecules) is missing. We cannot compare what is not there.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Let's consider each option in the context of the missing information.\n    *   **(a) Conformers isomers:** Conformers are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation about single bonds. To identify them, we would need to see at least two structures of the same molecule. This is not possible.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These are molecules that have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order). To identify them, we would need to see the structures of at least two different molecules and be able to determine their formulas and connectivity. This is not possible.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if two molecules are identical, we would need to see their structures and check if they are superimposable. This is not possible.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These are isomers with the same molecular formula and connectivity but a different arrangement of atoms in space (and are not conformers). This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers. Again, we need to see the structures to make this determination. This is not possible.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** Since we cannot apply any of the classifications from (a) to (d) due to the complete lack of information about the molecules, this option is the only logical conclusion. The conditions for any other answer are not met.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Because no molecules are provided for comparison, it is impossible to determine their isomeric relationship. Therefore, none of the specific classifications apply.\n\n<<<e>>>"
