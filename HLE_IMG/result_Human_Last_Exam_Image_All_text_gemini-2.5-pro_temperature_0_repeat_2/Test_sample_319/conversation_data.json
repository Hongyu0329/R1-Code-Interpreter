    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image**\nThe image consists of two plots representing a sound stimulus.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We can see a long, thin horizontal line, which represents a pure tone at a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this line is broken. At the exact moment of the break, a vertical line appears, which represents a short burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise, like a burst of static or a cough). After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes. Physically, the stimulus is: Tone -> Noise -> Tone.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It corresponds to the spectrogram above. We see a regular sine wave (the tone), which is then interrupted by a complex, irregular wave (the noise), and then the wave continues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Description**\nThe description provides several key clues about the nature of the phenomenon:\n*   **It's an illusion:** This means that what is perceived is different from the physical reality presented in the stimulus.\n*   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets an ambiguous 2D drawing in one of two possible 3D ways. This comparison suggests the auditory illusion also involves the brain resolving an ambiguity to create a coherent perception. The ambiguity here is whether the tone truly stopped or was merely obscured by the noise.\n*   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This indicates that the illusion is not just a lab curiosity but demonstrates a fundamental brain mechanism that we use constantly in everyday life without being aware of it.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Phenomenon**\n*   When a person listens to the sound stimulus depicted, they typically do not hear the tone stopping. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted *behind* the burst of noise.\n*   The brain \"fills in\" the missing auditory information, creating a perception of continuity. This is a form of perceptual completion.\n*   This phenomenon is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n*   The description's emphasis on a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" points to a very important application of this illusion: understanding speech in noisy environments. When a speech sound (a phoneme) within a word is replaced by a noise (e.g., a cough), listeners still perceive the entire word, unconsciously \"restoring\" the missing sound. This specific and famous example of the auditory continuity illusion is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The core of the illusion is the discrepancy between the physical stimulus (which is discontinuous) and the subjective perception (which is continuous).\n*   The illusion is a powerful example of top-down processing, where the brain uses context and prior knowledge (e.g., the expectation that sounds are continuous) to interpret incoming sensory data.\n*   While the image technically shows the stimulus for the general \"Auditory Continuity Illusion,\" the description strongly points to its most significant and well-known manifestation, the \"Phonemic Restoration Effect,\" which is vital for everyday communication. The question asks for the name of the phenomenon, and the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most specific and celebrated name for this type of perceptual completion.\n\nBased on the combined analysis of the image and the rich description, the most fitting answer is the name of this specific, powerful illusion.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
