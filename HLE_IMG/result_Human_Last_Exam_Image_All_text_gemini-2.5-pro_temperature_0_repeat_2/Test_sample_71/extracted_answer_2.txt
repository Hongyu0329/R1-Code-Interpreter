[Image of tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methane, which has a central CH group bonded to the C1 position of three separate benzene rings. Each benzene ring has a methoxy (-OCH3) group at the C2 position (ortho to the C1 position).]
The structure is a central carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen atom and three 2-methoxyphenyl groups. The chemical structure is CH(C₆H₄OCH₃)₃.
Here is a representation of the structure:
