    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings in the given molecular structure can rotate freely in solution. Free rotation typically occurs around single bonds, unless restricted by being part of a ring system or by significant steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the overall structure of the molecule.**\nThe molecule is an organometallic complex with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. The Ir atom is coordinated by three separate ligands, each of which binds to the metal at two points (bidentate coordination). This coordination creates a relatively rigid core structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each ligand and its components.**\n*   **Ligand 1 (top left):** This ligand consists of a central phenyl ring (A) and a pyridine ring (B). It is a cyclometalated ligand, meaning it binds to the Iridium through both a nitrogen atom (from pyridine ring B) and a carbon atom (from phenyl ring A, at position C6). This dual-point attachment, called chelation, forms a rigid 5-membered ring involving the Ir atom. Consequently, the phenyl ring A and the pyridine ring B are locked in a fixed orientation relative to each other and cannot rotate freely.\n*   **Ligand 2 (bottom left):** This ligand, comprising rings C and D, is analogous to the first one. It is also a cyclometalated ligand, binding to the Iridium through the nitrogen of pyridine ring D and a carbon atom of phenyl ring C. Due to chelation, rings C and D are also part of a rigid system and cannot rotate freely.\n*   **Ligand 3 (right):** This ligand consists of two pyridine rings (E and F) and a phenyl ring (G). Rings E and F form a bipyridine unit, which chelates the Iridium atom through the two nitrogen atoms. This chelation makes the bipyridine (E-F) unit rigid, preventing free rotation of rings E and F relative to each other.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the rotational freedom of the peripheral phenyl rings.**\nThe question asks about the rotation of phenyl rings. We have already established that rings A and C are part of the rigid chelated backbones. Now we must consider the other phenyl rings: G, H, J, K, and L.\n*   **Ring H:** It is attached to ring A at position C4 via a single C-C bond. Since this is a single bond and ring H is a terminal group (not part of a chelate ring), it can rotate freely around the bond connecting it to ring A.\n*   **Ring K:** It is attached to ring A at position C5 via a single C-C bond. Similar to ring H, it is a terminal group and can rotate freely around its connecting single bond.\n*   **Ring J:** It is attached to ring C at position C4 via a single C-C bond. As a terminal phenyl group, it can rotate freely.\n*   **Ring L:** It is attached to ring C at position C5 via a single C-C bond. It can also rotate freely.\n*   **Ring G:** It is attached to ring F at position C6 via a single C-C bond. Even though ring F is part of a rigid chelate, the bond to ring G is a single, exocyclic bond. Therefore, ring G can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 5: Summarize the findings and select the correct answer.**\nThe phenyl rings that are part of the rigid, chelated ligand backbones (A and C) cannot rotate freely. The phenyl rings that are attached as substituents to these backbones via single bonds (G, H, J, K, and L) can rotate freely.\nTherefore, the set of freely rotating rings is {G, H, J, K, L}.\n\nComparing this set with the given answer choices:\nA. G, J, L, K, H\nB. G, J, L, H\nC. G, J, K, H\nD. L, K, J, H\nE. G, J, H\nF. L, J, H\nG. K, J, H\nH. J, H\nI. J, G\nJ. G, H\nK. G\nL. J\nM. H\nN. none\n\nAnswer choice A matches our conclusion perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
