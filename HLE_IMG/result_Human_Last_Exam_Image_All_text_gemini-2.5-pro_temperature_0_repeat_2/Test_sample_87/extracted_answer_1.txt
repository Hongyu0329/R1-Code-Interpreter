**Product A:** The structure is a dihydropyrrolizine resulting from the [3+2] cycloaddition, which is then C-acylated by acetic anhydride. It is a fused 5-5 ring system with the original (4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl) group on the bridgehead nitrogen. The newly formed five-membered ring contains a methoxycarbonyl group and an acetyl group on adjacent carbons.

**Product B:** The structure is an oxidized version of the initial cycloadduct. It is a pyrrolizin-one derivative, featuring an aromatic pyrrole ring (with H and methoxycarbonyl substituents) fused to a pyrrolidinone (lactam) ring. The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with the original (4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl) group.

**Product C:** The structure is the N-acetylated starting material. The N-H proton of the amidine group in the starting material has been replaced by an acetyl group (-COCH3). The pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid core remains intact.

Here are the drawn structures:
**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
```
      O=C(OCH3)
      |
...-C1--C2(COCH3)-...  (Part of a dihydropyrrolizine ring)
   /   \
  N(R)--...
  R = (4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)
```
A more accurate representation: A 2,3,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizine core. N4 is substituted with R. C1 has a methoxycarbonyl group. C2 has an acetyl group.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
```
      O=C(OCH3)
      |
...=C1--C2=...  (Part of an aromatic pyrrole ring fused to a lactam)
   /   \
  N(R)--C5(=O)-...
  R = (4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)
```
A more accurate representation: A 4-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-methoxycarbonyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizin-5-one.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
```
      COOH
      |
  ...-CH--N(R')-... (Pyrrolidine ring)
          |
          CH2-...
  R' = 1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl
```
A more accurate representation: 1-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
