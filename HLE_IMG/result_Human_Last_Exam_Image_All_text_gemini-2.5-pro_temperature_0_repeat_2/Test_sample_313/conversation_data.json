    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue provides an image and some context: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Image Analysis:** The image shows two men in formal attire at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other. The trophy is a shiny, metallic, somewhat spherical object on a base.\n*   **Event Identification:** An awards ceremony on June 20, 2019, featuring a trophy like this, strongly suggests a major sports awards event. A quick search reveals the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019. The date in the prompt is likely the date of reporting or publication.\n*   **People Identification:** The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won several major awards that night, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player, voted by players). The trophy shown is the Ted Lindsay Award.\n*   **Connecting to \"X Y\":** The clue says \"X Y is pictured\". This could refer to a person, an object, or a concept visible or represented in the image.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This clue tells us that \"X Y\" is a word or phrase with at least two meanings (a homonym or polysemy). One meaning is connected to the image (Clue 1), and the \"other\" meaning is related to something that is no longer used because of the toxicity of mercury salts.\n*   **Key Connection:** The phrase \"toxicity of mercury salts\" is a very specific pointer. It immediately brings to mind historical uses of mercury that are now banned or obsolete.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm and evaluate potential answers.**\n\n*   **Possibility 1: \"Hatter\"**\n    *   **Connection to Clue 2:** This is a strong connection. Mercury(II) nitrate was used in the felting process for making hats, and the chronic mercury poisoning suffered by hat makers led to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". The profession of a hatter using this method has ceased.\n    *   **Connection to Clue 1:** This connection is weaker and more indirect. Nikita Kucherov is a hockey player. In hockey, scoring three goals is a \"hat trick,\" after which fans may throw hats on the ice. One could argue that a player known for scoring hat tricks (like Kucherov) is metaphorically a \"hatter.\" However, this is a significant logical leap.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: \"Daguerreotype\"**\n    *   **Connection to Clue 2:** The daguerreotype, an early photographic process, used mercury vapor for development. The process is obsolete, and the mercury was toxic. This is a good fit.\n    *   **Connection to Clue 1:** The image is a photograph, but it is a modern digital photograph, not a daguerreotype. The clue says \"Daguerreotype is pictured,\" which is not accurate.\n\n*   **Possibility 3: \"Quicksilver\"**\n    *   **Connection to Clue 2:** \"Quicksilver\" is a common synonym for the element mercury. The use of mercury and its toxic salts (like mercury chloride or mercury nitrate) in things like thermometers, medicine, and industrial processes has \"almost ceased to be used\" due to their toxicity. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **Connection to Clue 1:** The trophy being awarded in the picture is made of a highly polished, silvery metal. Its shiny, lustrous appearance can be described as being like \"quicksilver.\" Therefore, \"Quicksilver\" (in the sense of a shiny object) is \"pictured at the event.\" The phrase \"Another X Y\" works perfectly here: one \"Quicksilver\" is the shiny trophy, and the \"other Quicksilver\" is the element mercury.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nComparing the possibilities, \"Quicksilver\" provides the most direct and logical connection for both clues. The link to the first clue is a direct visual description of the trophy, and the link to the second clue is a direct synonym for mercury, whose salts are famously toxic.\n\n<<<Quicksilver>>>"
