    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observations and Analysis of Musical Elements**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (two staves, a treble clef and a bass clef, joined by a brace). This indicates it is for a keyboard instrument, most commonly the piano.\n2.  **Key Signature:** There are two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature. This corresponds to the key of D major or its relative minor, B minor. The piece begins and ends its phrases on D major chords (e.g., measure 1, measure 3), strongly suggesting the key is D major.\n3.  **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time. This means there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n4.  **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo (Andante or Moderato).\n5.  **Dynamics and Articulation:** The piece features a wide range of dynamics.\n    *   It begins *p* (piano - soft) in measure 1.\n    *   There is a sudden shift to *f* (forte - loud) in measure 3.\n    *   It drops to *mp* (mezzo-piano - medium soft) in measure 4.\n    *   It builds to *mf* (mezzo-forte - medium loud) in measure 8.\n    *   The \"8\" with a dotted line over the right hand in measure 1 indicates that the passage should be played an octave higher than written.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic and Harmonic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Measures 1-2 (The Opening Theme):** The right hand plays a simple, lyrical melody starting on A, moving up the D major scale (A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G, F#). This melody is played over a sustained D major chord in the left hand. This gentle, almost ethereal opening is a very distinct feature.\n2.  **Measures 3-5 (The Heroic Section):** There is an abrupt change in character. The music becomes loud and rhythmic. Both hands play rapid, descending sixteenth-note arpeggios and block chords.\n    *   Measure 3: D major -> G major -> D major -> A major. This is a classic I-IV-I-V progression in D major.\n    *   Measure 4: B minor -> E minor -> B minor -> F# major. This is a vi-ii-vi-V/vi progression.\n    This pattern of a quiet, lyrical theme followed by a loud, heroic, arpeggiated section is the most significant clue.\n3.  **Measures 8-10:** This section repeats the loud, chordal texture from measure 3, reinforcing the heroic and adventurous feel of the piece.\n4.  **Measure 11:** A dramatic, fast-rising arpeggio (a glissando-like effect is indicated) leads into the next section, adding to the epic quality.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis and Identification**\n\nThe combination of these elements—a gentle, memorable opening melody in D major that gives way to a powerful, fanfare-like section with driving arpeggios—is highly characteristic of the main theme from a very famous video game series. The specific melodic contour and chord progressions are iconic.\n\nThis piece is the **\"Main Theme\"** from the **Final Fantasy** video game series, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The opening lyrical section is often associated with the \"Crystal Theme\" or \"Prelude,\" which then transitions into the heroic main theme proper, as seen starting in measure 3 of this arrangement.\n\n<<<Main Theme from Final Fantasy>>>"
