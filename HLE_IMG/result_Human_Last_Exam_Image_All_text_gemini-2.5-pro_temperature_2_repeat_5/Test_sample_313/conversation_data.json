    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"**\n    *   The image shows an awards ceremony. A man with a beard is receiving a trophy from an older man in a suit.\n    *   A search for awards ceremonies around that date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019. The slight date difference is likely negligible.\n    *   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n    *   The trophy he is receiving is the Hart Memorial Trophy, the NHL's Most Valuable Player award. The word \"Hart\" is a key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"**\n    *   This clue points to a historical product or process that involved mercury salts and is now obsolete because of health risks.\n    *   The most famous example of this is the process of \"carroting,\" which used mercuric nitrate to treat animal fur to make high-quality felt for hats. This process was notoriously toxic, leading to mercury poisoning among hat-makers and inspiring the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   The product of this process is a **Felt Hat**.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:**\n    *   From Clue 1, we have the keyword \"Hart\" from the Hart Trophy.\n    *   From Clue 2, we have the concept of making felt hats using mercury salts.\n    *   The connection lies in the meaning of the word \"hart.\" A hart is an adult male red deer.\n    *   Historically, the fur of animals like beavers, rabbits, and **harts** was the primary material used in the carroting process to create felt for hats.\n    *   Therefore, the **Hart** Trophy pictured in Clue 1 links directly to the animal (**hart**) whose fur was used to make the **Felt Hat** mentioned in Clue 2.\n\n4.  **Identify \"X Y\":**\n    *   The object from the second clue, which connects to the first clue via the word \"Hart,\" is a **Felt Hat**. This fits the two-word \"X Y\" format.\n    *   The puzzle works by creating a link between the Hart Trophy and a Felt Hat through the double meaning of the word \"hart.\"\n\n<<<Felt hat>>>"
