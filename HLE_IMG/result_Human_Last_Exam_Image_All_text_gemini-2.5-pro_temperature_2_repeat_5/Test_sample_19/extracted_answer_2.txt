1. The music modulates to the key of E Major.
2. The home key of the piece is C# minor. E Major is its relative major. In a sonata form movement, it is standard convention for a piece in a minor key to modulate to its relative major for the second theme.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is an F# minor chord in root position. In the new key of E Major, this functions as the supertonic chord, so its Roman numeral is ii.
