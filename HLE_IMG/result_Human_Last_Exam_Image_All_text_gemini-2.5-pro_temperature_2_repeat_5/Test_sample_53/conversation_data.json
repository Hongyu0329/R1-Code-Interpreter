    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from an ancient Greek vase, likely Apulian red-figure ware, identifiable by its style and use of added white and yellow paint. The central scene features a two-wheeled chariot pulled by a horse (partially visible on the left). Inside the chariot are two figures: a driver wearing ornate, patterned clothing and a headdress, and a female figure seated beside him. Above the chariot, a large white wing is visible, belonging to a flying figure. The most dramatic part of the scene is a nude male figure falling backwards out of the chariot, his body contorted as he lands on the ground.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the narrative action.**\n    The scene depicts a moment of high drama involving a chariot. The fall of the male figure is violent and suggests a tragic event, likely a death or defeat in a race. The presence of a winged figure, especially one positioned above the victor in a contest, often represents Nike, the goddess of Victory. The driver of the chariot appears victorious, carrying away a female figure who was likely the prize. The falling man is the loser of this event.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the mythological story.**\n    This collection of characters and actions corresponds to a well-known Greek myth: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    *   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa decreed that any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand must defeat him in a chariot race. The loser would be killed. Pelops, a suitor from the East (Lydia or Phrygia), bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the bronze lynchpins of the king's chariot with ones made of wax. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels fell off, and Oenomaus was thrown from his chariot and killed. Pelops then won the race and Hippodamia.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the figures in the image to the characters in the myth.**\n    *   **The Falling Figure:** This is King **Oenomaus**, who is dying after his sabotaged chariot falls apart. His position, falling out of the vehicle, perfectly illustrates his defeat and death.\n    *   **The Chariot Driver:** This is **Pelops**. His Eastern-style clothing (patterned sleeves, Phrygian-style cap) alludes to his foreign origins.\n    *   **The Female Passenger:** This is **Hippodamia**, the daughter of Oenomaus and the prize of the race, now being carried off by the victor, Pelops.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** This is **Nike**, the goddess of Victory, signifying Pelops' triumph.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the identity of the specified figure.**\n    The question asks to identify \"the figure leaving the chariot\". In the context of the dynamic scene, this clearly refers to the individual being violently ejected from the vehicle, which is the central tragic action depicted. Therefore, the figure leaving the chariot is King Oenomaus.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
