    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image Fragment**\nThe image presents a dramatic scene centered around a windmill.\n*   **Subject:** A large, somewhat dilapidated windmill stands prominently.\n*   **Setting:** The background depicts a very turbulent atmosphere. Dark, heavy clouds dominate the sky, suggesting a storm or thunderstorm. However, there is a break in the clouds revealing a patch of blue sky.\n*   **Action/Drama:** In the background to the right, a building is illuminated with bright orange and yellow hues, resembling a fire. Smoke appears to rise from this area.\n*   **Style and Mood:** The brushwork, dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro effect with the dark storm and bright fire/sunset), and emotional intensity are characteristic of the Romanticism movement, which flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The painting style looks like oil on canvas.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Artist and Period**\nBased on the style and subject, the painting is likely from the 19th-century European Romantic period. The combination of landscape, dramatic weather, and signs of human impact (the windmill, the fire) points toward artists like Caspar David Friedrich, J.M.W. Turner, or their contemporaries. The specific depiction of the windmill and landscape might suggest a German or Dutch artist.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct a Search and Refine**\nUsing keywords from the analysis such as \"19th-century painting,\" \"windmill,\" \"storm,\" \"fire,\" and \"romanticism,\" or by performing a reverse image search, we can narrow down the possibilities. This process leads to the German painter **Carl Blechen** (1798–1840).\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Artwork and its Title**\nCarl Blechen was a prominent German landscape painter of the Romantic era, known for his realistic and often dramatic scenes with innovative light effects. The painting in the image is one of his famous works.\n*   **Artist:** Carl Blechen.\n*   **Date:** Circa 1826. This falls squarely within the 19th century, matching the question's criteria.\n*   **Title:** The painting is known by a few variations in German, as is common for artworks of this period. The most common title is **\"Windmühle im Gewittersturm\"**, which translates to **\"Windmill in a Thunderstorm\"**. Other related titles include \"Gewitterlandschaft mit Windmühle\" (Thunderstorm Landscape with Windmill). The apparent fire in the background is often interpreted as the intense light of a setting sun breaking through the storm clouds, though its fiery appearance gives the painting much of its dramatic power.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe fragment is from the 19th-century painting by German artist Carl Blechen. The most widely accepted title is \"Windmühle im Gewittersturm\", or \"Windmill in a Thunderstorm\" in English.\n\n<<<Windmill in a Thunderstorm (Windmühle im Gewittersturm)>>>"
