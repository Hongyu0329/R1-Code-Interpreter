    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Pollen-Carrying Structures (Scopae/Corbiculae):** In most non-parasitic bee species, only females collect pollen to provision nests. They possess specialized hair structures for this, either on their hind legs (scopae or corbiculae) or on the underside of their abdomen (abdominal scopa). Males lack these structures.\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with an additional segment compared to females (typically 13 segments in males vs. 12 in females). In some groups, like certain wasps, the tips of the male antennae are distinctly curled or hooked.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** The shape of the abdomen's tip can be a key indicator. Females have a concealed stinger (a modified ovipositor), often making the tip appear more pointed. Males may have visible genitalia (claspers) or a blunter, more rounded, or uniquely shaped abdominal tip. Females typically have 6 visible abdominal segments, while males have 7.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) that are absent or reduced in females.\n\n**Analysis of each pair:**\n\n**Pair A:** These are Cuckoo Bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites (they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees), and therefore, the females do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the problem's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee has an abdomen that tapers to a very sharp, conical point. This is the characteristic modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the host's nest cell. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee's abdomen does not end in a sharp point. Instead, the terminal segment is blunt and has several distinct spines or prongs. This morphology is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are Paper Wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae as they typically hunt other insects to feed their young, although adults feed on nectar. This group fits the problem's description.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic trait of many male wasps, including *Polistes*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight from base to tip, which is characteristic of a female. The abdomen also appears to end in a slight point, typical for a female possessing a stinger. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n**Pair C:** These appear to be long-horned bees. There is a contradiction here with the provided context (\"taxa without scopae on their legs\"), as the female of this type of bee clearly possesses large pollen-collecting scopae on her legs. We must rely on the direct visual evidence to determine sex.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has very large, dense brushes of hair on its hind legs that are heavily loaded with yellow pollen. These are scopae, and their presence (especially full of pollen) is a definitive indicator of a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee lacks the large pollen-carrying hairs seen on the left individual. Its hind legs are much more slender. In bee species with sexually dimorphic pollen-collecting structures, the absence of scopae indicates a male. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Female, Male (F, M) -> 4\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (M, F) -> 3\n*   Pair C: Female, Male (F, M) -> 4\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 3, 4>>>"
