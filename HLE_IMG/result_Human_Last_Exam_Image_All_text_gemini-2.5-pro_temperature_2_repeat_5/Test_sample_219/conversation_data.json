    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which is commonly used in neuroscience to visualize the firing patterns of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents **Time (s)**, with labeled ticks every 10 seconds (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50).\n*   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, from 0 to 128. Each horizontal line corresponds to a single electrode.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential, or \"firing,\" detected by a specific electrode at a specific moment in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of electrodes detect high-frequency firing simultaneously. On the raster plot, these appear as dense, vertical bands of black dots spanning many electrodes.\nBy visual inspection of the graph, we can identify four distinct synchronized bursts. We need to estimate the timestamp for the center of each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** There is a clear, dense band of activity between 0 and 10 seconds. Its center appears to be at approximately **3 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 2:** Another burst occurs between 10 and 20 seconds. Its center is just before the 20-second mark, at approximately **18 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A third burst is located between 30 and 40 seconds. Its center appears to be slightly past the halfway point, at approximately **36 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The final burst starts around the 50-second mark and continues off the graph. We can estimate its center at approximately **51 seconds**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: **3 s, 18 s, 36 s, and 51 s**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We can calculate the IBIs using the timestamps identified in the previous step. There are three intervals between the four bursts.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 18 s - 3 s = **15 s**.\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 36 s - 18 s = **18 s**.\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 51 s - 36 s = **15 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nNow, we calculate the average of the three IBIs.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 15 s + 18 s + 15 s = 48 s\n*   Number of IBIs = 3\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of IBIs) = 48 s / 3 = **16 s**.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the answer to two significant figures. Our calculated average is 16, which already has two significant figures (1 and 6). Therefore, no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Identified burst timestamps: ~3 s, ~18 s, ~36 s, ~51 s.\n*   Calculated inter-burst intervals: 15 s, 18 s, 15 s.\n*   Calculated average IBI: (15 + 18 + 15) / 3 = 16 s.\n*   The final answer is required to two significant figures, which is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
