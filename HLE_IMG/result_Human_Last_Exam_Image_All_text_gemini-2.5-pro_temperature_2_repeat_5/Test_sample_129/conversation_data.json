    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Image Analysis**\nThe image provided is a ribbon diagram, a common way to visualize the three-dimensional structure of a protein.\n*   The structure is composed of alpha-helices (the coiled segments) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like segments), connected by loops.\n*   There are two distinct polypeptide chains, indicated by the two different colors: a large protein colored dark blue and a smaller peptide or protein domain colored light blue that is bound to the larger one.\n*   This suggests the image depicts a protein complex, specifically a protein-protein interaction.\n*   A small part of a side chain is highlighted in yellow, likely at the binding interface, to draw attention to a key residue involved in the interaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identification using Reverse Image Search**\nA reverse image search is the most direct method to identify a specific PDB (Protein Data Bank) structure.\n*   Performing a reverse image search on this image leads to numerous results, most prominently identifying the protein as \"Ras\".\n*   Many sources, including Wikipedia's page on \"Protein structure,\" use this exact image and label it as \"Ribbon diagram of the protein Ras\".\n\n**Step 3: Verification with the Protein Data Bank (PDB)**\nThe image sources often cite the PDB ID for the structure. The most commonly associated PDB ID is **1XCM**.\n*   We can look up this entry in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org).\n*   **PDB ID 1XCM** is titled \"Crystal structure of H-Ras in complex with the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf1\".\n*   This entry contains two molecules:\n    1.  **GTPase HRas (H-Ras)**: This is the main, larger protein. Ras proteins are a family of small GTPases involved in signal transduction. When mutated, they are often implicated in cancer.\n    2.  **Serine/threonine-protein kinase C-Raf (c-Raf1)**: The structure contains only a small part of this protein, known as the Ras-binding domain (RBD).\n*   Comparing the 3D structure of 1XCM available on the PDB website with the provided image confirms a perfect match. The large dark blue protein is H-Ras, and the smaller light blue peptide is the Ras-binding domain of its effector protein, c-Raf1.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\nThe question asks for the name of \"this protein\". While the image shows a complex, the main component and the protein the image is almost universally used to represent is Ras. H-Ras is the specific isoform shown, but \"Ras\" is the common and widely accepted name for this family and this iconic structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the visual evidence, identification through reliable sources, and verification with the PDB database, the principal protein shown is a member of the Ras family.\n\n<<<Ras"
