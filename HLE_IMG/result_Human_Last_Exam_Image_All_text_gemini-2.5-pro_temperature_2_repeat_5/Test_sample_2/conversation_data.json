    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    Let's analyze the provided `sort(a, n)` function. The function takes an array `a` and its size `n` as input.\n    -   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array with 0 or 1 elements is considered sorted, so the function does nothing and returns.\n    -   **Recursive Step (n > 1):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the first `n - 1` elements of the array (i.e., the subarray from index 0 to `n-2`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n - 1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of this sorted subarray (`a[n - 2]`) with the element that was not part of the sort (`a[n - 1]`).\n        3.  `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: If the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the `(n-1)`-th element (`a[n-2]`), it swaps them. This moves the smaller element into the `n-1` position, but it might disrupt the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the previous swap might have unsorted the subarray from index 0 to `n-2`, the algorithm makes another recursive call to sort this subarray again.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n    -   `T(1) = O(1)` (a constant amount of work for the base case).\n    -   For `n > 1`, the time taken is the sum of the times for its parts:\n        -   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n        -   `if` and `swap`: These take constant time, `O(1)`.\n        -   `sort(a, n - 1)` (the second one): This call is conditional.\n\n    We need to find the **worst-case** time complexity. The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, because this triggers the second, expensive recursive call.\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst-case scenario happens when the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed at every step of the recursion (for n, n-1, n-2, ...).\n    -   Consider a reverse-sorted array, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`.\n    -   `sort(a, 3)`:\n        -   Calls `sort(a, 2)`. After this call, the first 2 elements `[3, 2]` become sorted to `[2, 3]`. The array is now `[2, 3, 1]`.\n        -   Checks `if a[2] < a[1]` -> `if 1 < 3`. This is **true**.\n        -   `swap` makes the array `[2, 1, 3]`.\n        -   Calls `sort(a, 2)` again on the (now unsorted) prefix `[2, 1]`.\n    This demonstrates that a reverse-sorted input (or one where the smallest element is at the end) will consistently trigger the `if` block.\n\n4.  **Write and Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    In the worst case, the recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n    Let's solve this recurrence by expansion:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   Generalizing this pattern, after `k` steps:\n        `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    We expand until we reach the base case, `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series equal to `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    -   `T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    -   `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored. Therefore:\n    `T(n) = O(2^(n-1)) = O(2^n)`\n\n### Careful Points\n- **Termination:** The algorithm always terminates because each recursive call is on a problem of a smaller size (`n-1`), and there is a base case (`n <= 1`).\n- **Best Case:** The best case occurs if the array is already sorted. The `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` would always be false. The recurrence would be `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n- **Worst Case vs. Average Case:** The question specifically asks for the worst-case complexity. The logic of repeatedly re-sorting the prefix is highly inefficient and leads to exponential behavior in the worst case.\n- **Comparison to other sorts:** This algorithm is much worse than common simple sorts like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort, which are `O(n^2)`. The structure `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + ...` is characteristic of exponential time complexity.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe worst-case time complexity is determined by the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
