    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab Major or F minor.\n    *   **Tonic Chord:** The piece begins on an F- (F minor) chord and ends on an F chord. This strongly suggests the tonic is F, and the overall key is F minor.\n    *   **Form:** The music shows a first and second ending with a repeat sign, which is typical of the 'A' section of a tune. Following this, there's a new section of music (the bridge or 'B' section) and then a return to material similar to the first section. This points to a common song form like AABA.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The first melodic phrase begins on the note C. In the key of F minor, C is the 5th degree of the scale.\n    *   The opening notes are C, F, Eb, D, C, Bb. This melodic contour is very distinctive. In solfege for the F minor scale, this would be Sol, Do, Te, La, Sol, Fa. This opening phrase is the signature melody of a well-known standard.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   **A Section (First 8 bars):** The progression starts `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 ...`. The bass notes of the first three chords create a clear chromatic descent: F -> E -> Eb. This descending line is a famous characteristic of the song. The `G7` to `C7` is a secondary dominant progression leading back to the tonic, `F-`.\n    *   **B Section (Bridge):** The section following the repeated A section starts with chords like `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab`. This is a classic bridge structure that moves through a series of ii-V progressions and dominant chords, modulating away from the home key and eventually leading to the relative major (Ab) before returning to the final A section.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Song:**\n    *   **Title:** The combination of the specific opening melody (C-F-Eb-D...), the key of F minor, and the characteristic chromatic descending chord progression (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6...`) unmistakably identifies the song as **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n    *   **Composer:** The composer of the music for the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\" is **Jerome Kern**. (The lyrics were written by Otto Harbach).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Handwritten charts can have slight variations or errors compared to published versions, but the core musical identity (melody and foundational harmony) remains. For instance, `Eb-6` might sometimes be written as `Ebmaj7` or `Bbm7/Eb`. The `G7` in the fourth bar is a passing chord. These variations are common in jazz performance practice but do not change the song's identity.\n*   Recognizing common patterns is key. The chromatic descent in the A section and the sequence of ii-V's in the bridge are strong identifiers for experienced musicians.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the melody, chord progression, and structure, the song is \"Yesterdays\" composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
