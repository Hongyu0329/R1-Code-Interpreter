The two major products A and B are 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate and 1-phenylpropyl benzoate, formed through competing radical pathways. The reaction mechanism is as follows: 1) The reaction between tert-butyl peroxybenzoate and Fe(OTf)₃ generates a tert-butoxyl radical (tBuO•). 2) This tBuO• radical can follow two pathways: (i) it can add to styrene to form a benzylic radical intermediate, tBuO-CH₂-ĊH-Ph. (ii) It can undergo β-fragmentation to form a methyl radical (•CH₃) and acetone. The methyl radical then adds to styrene to form a different benzylic radical, CH₃-CH₂-ĊH-Ph. 3) Both benzylic radical intermediates are then trapped by the benzoyloxy group (from the Fe(III) complex) to yield the final products. Product A, 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate (C₆H₅CH(OCOC₆H₅)CH₂OC(CH₃)₃), is formed from pathway (i). Product B, 1-phenylpropyl benzoate (C₆H₅CH(OCOC₆H₅)CH₂CH₃), is formed from pathway (ii).
