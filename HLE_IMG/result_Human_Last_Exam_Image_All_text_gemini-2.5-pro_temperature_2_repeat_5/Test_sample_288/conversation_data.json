These include red brickwork, some of which is in a herringbone pattern, a tan stucco section with a raised quatrefoil-like design, and an upper-level open-air section with a white, crisscrossing lattice railing.\n    *   In the foreground, a large tour truck is parked, suggesting this is a venue for live performances like concerts.\n    *   Using these architectural details in an image search identifies the building as the **First Interstate Arena at MetraPark**, located in Billings, Montana.\n\n2.  **Determine the event on the specified date.**\n    *   The question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on **October 12, 2023**.\n    *   A search for the event calendar for the First Interstate Arena for that date is required.\n\n3.  **Find the performer.**\n    *   Searching for \"First Interstate Arena events October 12 2023\" or \"MetraPark Billings concert October 12 2023\" leads to official event listings, news articles, and ticketing sites.\n    *   These sources confirm that the Canadian singer **Shania Twain** performed at the First Interstate Arena on Thursday, October 12, 2023, as part of her \"Queen of Me Tour\".\n\n4.  **Synthesize the final answer.**\n    *   The venue in the image is the First Interstate Arena at MetraPark.\n    *   The artist who performed at this venue on October 12, 2023, was Shania Twain.
