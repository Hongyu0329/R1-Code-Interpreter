In the resulting compound A, the three isopropylidene ketal (acetonide) groups of the starting material have been hydrolyzed to form three catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) units. The core fused polycyclic aromatic cation structure remains unchanged. The final product is the hexahydroxy-derivative of the starting cation. The image of the final product is presented above.
