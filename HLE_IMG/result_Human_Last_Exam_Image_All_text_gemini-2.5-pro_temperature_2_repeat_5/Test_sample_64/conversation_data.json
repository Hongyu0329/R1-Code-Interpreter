    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state (Panel L):** The image shows a multicellular, filamentous structure, likely an alga or fungus. It is composed of cylindrical cells arranged end-to-end. There are distinct cross-walls, called septa, separating the individual cells. An arrowhead points to one of these septa. The filament is straight and intact.\n\n2.  **Analyze the intermediate state (Panel M):** This panel shows a progression of the event. At the septum indicated by the arrowhead, a noticeable swelling or bulge has appeared. This suggests that the cell wall at this junction is undergoing a change, possibly weakening, degrading, or absorbing water and gelatinizing.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state (Panel N):** The process has advanced further. The swelling at the septum is more pronounced. This swelling has created a physical force that is causing the filament to bend and break at that specific point. The connection between the cells is being severed.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the process:** The sequence of images from L to N clearly illustrates a process where a single filament breaks apart into smaller fragments. The breakage is not random but occurs at a specific locationâ€”a pre-existing septum between two cells. The mechanism involves the modification and swelling of this septum, which physically pushes the cells apart until they separate.\n\n5.  **Identify the biological process:** This method of breaking into pieces, where each piece can potentially grow into a new organism, is a form of asexual reproduction known as **fragmentation**. The specific mechanism shown, involving the enzymatic degradation and subsequent swelling of a septum to force cells apart, is called **secession**. Therefore, the image depicts asexual reproduction by fragmentation via the mechanism of cell secession.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Subject:** The subject is a filamentous organism, not a single cell or a complex tissue.\n*   **Sequence:** The panels L, M, and N represent a time-lapse or sequential stages of a single process.\n*   **Key feature:** The arrows consistently point to the site of action, which is the septum between two cells.\n*   **Mechanism:** The visible change is swelling at the septum, leading to mechanical breakage, not cell division or fusion.\n*   **Outcome:** The result is the division of one filament into two or more smaller filaments.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the process depicted is the fragmentation of a filament for asexual reproduction.\n\n<<<Asexual reproduction by fragmentation (specifically, by cell separation or secession)."
