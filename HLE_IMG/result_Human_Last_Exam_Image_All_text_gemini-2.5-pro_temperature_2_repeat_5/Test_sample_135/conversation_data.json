    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the author:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Artwork Type:** The image shows a relief sculpture set within a decorative circular frame, known as a tondo or roundel. This tondo is part of a larger, more elaborate frame, suggesting it is a detail from a bigger piece like an altarpiece.\n    *   **Medium:** The surface appears smooth and slightly reflective, with high-contrast modeling. This is highly characteristic of glazed terracotta, a technique famously associated with a specific family of Florentine artists.\n    *   **Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a Christian sacrament. A priest is shown giving the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including men, women, and a child. This is a common religious theme.\n    *   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with the inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\". This is Old French for \"Sacrament de l'Autel,\" meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which explicitly confirms the subject as the Eucharist. The French language is a significant clue.\n    *   **Artistic Style:** The style is distinctly Italian High Renaissance. The figures are composed in a classical, balanced manner, with realistic anatomy and expressive drapery. The decorative motifs in the frame, such as the egg-and-dart pattern, are also typical of this period.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   The combination of an Italian Renaissance style, the specific medium of glazed terracotta, and a French inscription strongly points to a work created by the Della Robbia workshop for a French patron or location.\n    *   The Della Robbia family, active in Florence from the 15th to the 16th century, were masters of glazed terracotta sculpture. Their workshop exported works across Europe, including to France.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Artwork and Artist:**\n    *   A search for \"Della Robbia Sacrament de l'Autel\" or similar terms leads to the \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" (in French, *Retable du Sacrement*).\n    *   This altarpiece is a well-documented work featuring seven roundels, each depicting one of the seven sacraments. The roundel in the photo is the one representing the Eucharist.\n    *   The entire work is attributed to **Luca della Robbia the Younger** (Luca di Andrea della Robbia, 1475â€“1548). He was the nephew of the famous Luca della Robbia (the Elder) and a prominent member of the family workshop.\n    *   This specific altarpiece was made around 1510-1515 in Florence and was commissioned for a church in France, which explains the French inscription.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The artwork is a detail (the tondo of the Eucharist) from the Altarpiece of the Sacraments.\n    *   The author of this altarpiece is Luca della Robbia the Younger.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia the Younger"
