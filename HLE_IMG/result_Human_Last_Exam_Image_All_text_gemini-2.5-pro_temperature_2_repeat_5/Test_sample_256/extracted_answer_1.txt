True. In the upper-right quadrant of the image, there are two characters painted that resemble the modern letters "r" and "u". These letters belong to the Latin alphabet, which was unknown to the ancient Southwest cultures that created the surrounding pictographs. This indicates the letters are likely modern graffiti and are not related to the original artists or their religious symbolism.
