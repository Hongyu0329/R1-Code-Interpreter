    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   In the bicyclic core (azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenone part): there are 6 carbons (two bridgehead carbons, one carbonyl carbon, two alkene carbons, one methylene bridge carbon).\n    *   In the trifluoromethyl (-CF3) group: there is 1 carbon.\n    *   In the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group: there is 1 benzylic -CH2- carbon, 6 carbons in the benzene ring, and 1 carbon in the methoxy -OCH3 group. Total is 1+6+1=8 carbons.\n    *   Total carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   In the bicyclic core: there are 2 hydrogens on the bridgehead carbons, 1 hydrogen on the alkene carbon (the other is substituted with CF3), and 2 hydrogens on the CH2 bridge. Total is 2+1+2=5 hydrogens.\n    *   In the PMB group: there are 2 hydrogens on the benzylic -CH2-, 4 hydrogens on the benzene ring, and 3 hydrogens on the methoxy -CH3 group. Total is 2+4+3=9 hydrogens.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 5 + 9 = 14.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the -CF3 group.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the bicyclic ring.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   There is 1 oxygen atom in the lactam carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   There is 1 oxygen atom in the methoxy (-OCH3) group.\n    *   Total oxygen atoms = 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to form Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protected amines. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen atom and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom (H) to the nitrogen.\n    *   Atoms removed: C8H9O\n    *   Atoms added: H\n    *   Net change: -C8, H(1-9) = -H8, -O1. So, -C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The formula for Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**. This is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to form Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** This reaction adds one molecule of hydrogen (H2) across the double bond.\n    *   Net change: +H2.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Add H2: C7H(6+2)F3NO.\n    *   The formula for Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**. This is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to form the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions represent a strong acid hydrolysis. The lactam (a cyclic amide) is hydrolyzed, which means the amide C-N bond within the ring is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). This opens the ring and forms a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from the carbonyl group and an amine (-NH2) from the nitrogen atom. The amine will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+) under these acidic conditions.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** This reaction adds one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   Net change: +H2O.\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n    *   Add H2O: C7H(8+2)F3N(O+1).\n    *   The formula for the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is an amino acid: 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (it exists as its hydrochloride salt under the reaction conditions, but the molecular formula refers to the neutral molecule).\n\nFinal determination of the product's molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
