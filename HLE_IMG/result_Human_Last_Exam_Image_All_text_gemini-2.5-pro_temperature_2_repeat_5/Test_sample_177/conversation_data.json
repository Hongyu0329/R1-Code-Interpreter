    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in total Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when moving from the \"Baseline\" model (Table 1) to the \"Proposed\" model (Table 2).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **VMT Definition:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles traveled by the vehicle itself, regardless of how many people are inside. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are not needed for this calculation and should be ignored.\n2.  **Car Modes:** Total \"Car\" VMT is the sum of VMT from both car categories: 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n3.  **Calculation Structure:** We don't have the absolute total number of trips. However, since we need a percentage change, we can work with a \"VMT index\" calculated using the given percentages. This index will be proportional to the actual total VMT, and the total number of trips will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n4.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT index is a weighted sum across the four distance categories. For each category, the contribution to the VMT index is calculated as: `(share of total trips) × (average trip distance) × (total car mode share)`.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total Car VMT index for the Baseline scenario (Table 1).**\n\nFirst, find the total share of car trips for each distance category by adding the shares of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53% (or 0.53)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 1 (mile) × 0.53 (car share) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.22 (share of trips) × 4 (miles) × 0.81 (car share) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.14 (share of trips) × 7.5 (miles) × 0.85 (car share) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.16 (share of trips) × 20 (miles) × 0.89 (car share) = 2.8480\n\nNow, sum the contributions to get the total Baseline VMT index:\n`Baseline VMT Index` = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total Car VMT index for the Proposed scenario (Table 2).**\n\nRepeat the same process using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 1 (mile) × 0.03 (car share) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.22 (share of trips) × 4 (miles) × 0.27 (car share) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.14 (share of trips) × 7.5 (miles) × 0.41 (car share) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n    *   VMT Index Contribution = 0.16 (share of trips) × 20 (miles) × 0.49 (car share) = 1.5680\n\nNow, sum the contributions to get the total Proposed VMT index:\n`Proposed VMT Index` = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100%`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) × 100%\n    Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
