    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction shows a polycyclic alcohol reacting with catalytic strong acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 °C) to yield an alkene and water. This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which proceeds via an E1 mechanism. The product's rearranged carbon skeleton and the position of the new double bond suggest that the intermediate carbocation undergoes a series of rearrangements.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Initial Carbocation:** The reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material by the acid catalyst (H+). This converts the poor leaving group (-OH) into a good leaving group (H₂O). The water molecule then departs, leaving behind a secondary carbocation at carbon-3 (C3), the carbon that was bonded to the OH group.\n\n3.  **Carbocation Rearrangement (The Backbone Rearrangement):** Secondary carbocations are relatively unstable and tend to rearrange to form more stable tertiary carbocations if possible. In this type of pentacyclic triterpenoid system, this initiates a cascade of [1,2]-shifts (migration of a group, either hydride (H⁻) or methide (CH₃⁻), to an adjacent positively charged carbon). This specific cascade is often referred to as a Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangement. The cascade is driven by the formation of a more stable carbocation at each step, and it continues until it reaches a \"thermodynamic sink,\" usually resulting in a highly substituted and stable alkene.\n\n4.  **Tracing the Cascade of [1,2] shifts:** We will track the movement of the positive charge and the migration of methyl (CH₃) and hydrogen (H) groups. Let's denote the key carbons by their standard triterpenoid numbering.\n    *   **Start:** C3 becomes C⁺ (a secondary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH₃) from the gem-dimethyl group at C4 migrates to C3. The positive charge moves to C4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n        *   C4: loses a CH₃.\n    *   **Shift 2:** A hydride (H⁻) from C5 migrates to C4. The positive charge moves to C5 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C4: gains a H. C5: loses a H.\n    *   **Shift 3:** The methyl group from C10 migrates to C5. The positive charge moves to C10 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C5: gains a CH₃. C10: loses a CH₃.\n    *   **Shift 4:** A hydride from C9 migrates to C10. The positive charge moves to C9 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C10: gains a H. C9: loses a H.\n    *   **Shift 5:** The methyl group from C8 migrates to C9. The positive charge moves to C8 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C9: gains a CH₃. C8: loses a CH₃.\n    *   **Shift 6:** The methyl group from C14 migrates to C8. The positive charge moves to C14 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C8: gains a CH₃. C14: loses a CH₃.\n    *   **Shift 7:** A hydride from C13 migrates to C14. The positive charge moves to C13 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   C14: gains a H. C13: loses a H.\n\n5.  **Formation of the Final Product:** The cascade stops at the C13 carbocation. The final step is an elimination (deprotonation) to form a stable alkene. Elimination of a proton from C12 forms a tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, which is the product shown.\n\n6.  **Determining the Substituents at the Final Positions:** Now we determine the final substituent (H or CH₃) at each numbered position by tracking the changes.\n    *   **Position 1 (on C4):** Initially, C4 had two CH₃ groups. It lost one CH₃ in Shift 1 and gained a H in Shift 2. Therefore, the final substituent at this location is **CH₃**. (Note: The diagram erroneously shows an intact gem-dimethyl group here, which would be inconsistent with the backbone rearrangement required to form the final product. We follow the mechanistic path.)\n    *   **Position 2 (on C10):** Initially, C10 had one CH₃ group. It lost this CH₃ in Shift 3 and gained a H in Shift 4. Therefore, the final substituent at this location is **H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (on C9):** Initially, C9 had one H substituent. It lost this H in Shift 4 and gained a CH₃ in Shift 5. Therefore, the final substituent at this location is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 4 (on C8):** Initially, C8 had one CH₃ group. It lost this CH₃ in Shift 5 and gained a new CH₃ in Shift 6. So, it ends up with a **CH₃** group.\n    *   **Position 5 (on C14):** Initially, C14 had one CH₃ group. It lost this CH₃ in Shift 6 and gained a H in Shift 7. Therefore, the final substituent at this location is **H**.\n\n**Summary of Final Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH₃\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
