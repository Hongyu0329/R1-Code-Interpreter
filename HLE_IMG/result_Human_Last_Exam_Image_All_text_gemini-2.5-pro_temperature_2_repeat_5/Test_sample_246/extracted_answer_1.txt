Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy ball on the twig, which is a Woolly Oak Gall. This gall is formed when a gall wasp lays its egg inside the twig. The larva then develops inside this protective structure. Additionally, close-up images show a smaller gall on a leaf, a cluster of insect eggs on a leaf, and holes from insects feeding on the leaves. Therefore, depending on the species of insect, it will lay its eggs either **inside the plant's twigs** or **on the leaves**.
