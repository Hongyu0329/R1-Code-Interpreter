    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  **Observe the obverse (the left coin image):** This side shows a bust of a monarch facing right. Around the edge, we can decipher parts of a Latin inscription. The cropped images help identify \"FR ET NAV\" and \"D G\". This combination stands for \"DEI GRATIA FRANCIAE ET NAVARRAE REX,\" which translates to \"By the Grace of God, King of France and Navarre.\" This title was used by French kings. The style of the portrait is characteristic of King Louis XV.\n    2.  **Observe the reverse (the right coin image):** This side is crucial for determining the colony. The most prominent and readable text around the rim is \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES,\" which translates to \"French Colonies.\" The central design features two crossed scepters, each topped with a fleur-de-lis, all under a royal crown.\n    3.  **Identify the Coin Type:** Combining the features from both sides—the bust of Louis XV, the \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" legend, and the crossed scepters—identifies this coin as a 9 Deniers piece, also known as a \"Sou Marqué.\" These coins were minted in France between 1721 and 1722.\n    4.  **Determine the Colony of Use:** The legend \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" indicates the coin was not for a single specific colony like Cayenne or Saint-Domingue (which had their own distinct inscriptions) but for general circulation in French colonial territories. However, historical records show that this specific issue was primarily intended for France's vast North American territories, which were collectively known as **New France** (Nouvelle-France). This territory included Louisiana, the Illinois Country, and Canada (what is now Quebec). These coins circulated widely throughout this region.\n\n*   **Careful Points to Note:**\n    *   The image quality is low, requiring careful examination of the details and legends.\n    *   The legend \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" is the most critical piece of information on the coin for this question.\n    *   It is important to understand that the coin was physically minted in France (specifically, at the Rouen and La Rochelle mints) but its *origin* in terms of use and purpose was the colonies.\n    *   While technically for all colonies, this particular issue (the 9 Deniers of 1721-1722) is numismatically and historically tied to the North American colonies. Therefore, \"New France\" is the most accurate and specific answer.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The coin is identified as a French 9 Deniers from the reign of Louis XV. The inscription \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" and its historical context link it directly to the French colonial empire in North America. The proper name for this large territory at the time was New France.\n\n<<<New France (Nouvelle-France)>>>"
