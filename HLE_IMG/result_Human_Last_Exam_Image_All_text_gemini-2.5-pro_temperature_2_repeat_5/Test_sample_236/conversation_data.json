    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject of the photo. The flowers appear to be a species of goldenrod (*Solidago*). The insect's body has distinct orange and black coloration.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect's Features**\nTo identify the insect, we need to carefully examine its key morphological characteristics, using the main image and the provided crops for a closer look.\n*   **Order:** The insect has a sucking mouthpart (not visible but inferred from its type), two pairs of wings (the front pair is hardened at the base, called hemelytra), and a somewhat flattened body. This morphology is characteristic of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a striking pattern of black and orange/red.\n*   **Head:** The head is entirely black.\n*   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, black, and segmented.\n*   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section immediately behind the head (the pronotum) is predominantly bright orange, with some black markings along its side edges.\n*   **Wings (Hemelytra):** While not fully visible, we can see the front portion of the wings behind the thorax, which is also orange. The overall pattern is consistent with a seed bug (family Lygaeidae).\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Comparing Features with Known Insect Species**\nThe distinct black and orange/red pattern helps narrow down the possibilities. We can compare it to several common insects with similar coloration:\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Boxelder bugs are similar in color, but their pronotum typically has three reddish longitudinal stripes on a black background. The insect in the image has a mostly orange pronotum, which does not match.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug is larger and has a prominent black band across the middle of its orange wings. The insect in the photo does not have this band.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This species is an excellent match for the observed features. It has a black head, a predominantly red or orange pronotum (often with a variable black mark in the middle, which seems minimal or absent from this angle), and an \"X\" shape of black on its wings. The overall coloration, shape, and visible parts in the image align perfectly with the characteristics of the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation and Final Identification**\nBased on the detailed comparison in Step 3, the insect is identified as a Small Milkweed Bug. The scientific name for this species is a binomial name consisting of its genus and species.\n\n*   **Genus:** *Lygaeus*\n*   **Species:** *kalmii*\n\nTherefore, the full scientific name of the insect is *Lygaeus kalmii*. Its presence on goldenrod is also common, as it feeds on nectar and seeds from various plants besides its namesake milkweed.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
