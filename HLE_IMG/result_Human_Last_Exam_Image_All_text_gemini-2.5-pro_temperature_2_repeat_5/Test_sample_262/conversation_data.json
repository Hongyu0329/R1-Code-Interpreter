    "An analysis of the question to determine which complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes involves a step-by-step breakdown of the molecular structures and their relationship to the stability of phosphorescent emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components of the complexes and the differences between them.**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻) counter-anion. They share a common general structure: [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺.\n*   **The N^N ligand:** This is the neutral, bidentate ligand coordinating through two nitrogen atoms. In all four complexes, this ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). Since this component is identical across all four complexes, it is not the source of the difference in their lifetimes. The bulky tert-butyl groups are primarily to improve solubility and prevent intermolecular quenching.\n*   **The C^N ligands:** These are the monoanionic, cyclometalating ligands, coordinating through a carbon atom of a phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom of a pyridine ring. There are two such ligands in each complex. The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of these C^N ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Both C^N ligands are 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy). The complex is [Ir(dFppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺.\n    *   **Complex 2:** One C^N ligand is 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy), while the other is the unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The complex is [Ir(dFppy)(ppy)(dtbbpy)]⁺.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Both C^N ligands are 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine (Fppy). The complex is [Ir(Fppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Both C^N ligands are 2-(2',4',5'-trifluorophenyl)pyridine (tFppy). The complex is [Ir(tFppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺.\n\n**Step 2: Relate molecular structure to LEC emitter lifetime.**\nThe operational lifetime of an LEC is largely determined by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter molecule. Emitters in LECs undergo repeated cycles of oxidation and reduction. Degradation can occur through various pathways, including bond cleavage (especially the metal-ligand bonds), or attack by other species in the device.\nA widely established strategy for improving the stability and lifetime of iridium(III) emitters is the **fluorination of the C^N cyclometalating ligands**.\n\n**Careful points about the effect of fluorination:**\n*   **Bond Strength:** Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative. The C-F bond is significantly stronger than the C-H bond, making the ligand itself more resistant to degradation.\n*   **Inductive Effect:** The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of fluorine atoms stabilizes the molecular orbitals of the complex. This stabilization is particularly significant for the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which has significant character on the metal and the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand.\n*   **Oxidative Stability:** A lower-lying HOMO means a higher oxidation potential. The complex becomes harder to oxidize, which protects it from oxidative degradation, a major failure mechanism in electro-emissive devices.\n*   **Ir-C Bond Stability:** Fluorination, especially at the 2'-(ortho) position of the phenyl ring, is known to strengthen the crucial Iridium-Carbon bond of the cyclometalated ring, making it less prone to cleavage.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the stability of the four complexes.**\nBased on the principles above, the stability of the complexes, and therefore their expected lifetime, should increase with the degree of fluorination on the C^N ligands. We can compare the complexes based on this:\n*   **Complex 4:** Has two trifluorinated ligands (tFppy). This is the highest degree of fluorination (6 fluorine atoms total on the C^N ligands). It is expected to be the most stable complex with the **longest** lifetime.\n*   **Complex 1:** Has two difluorinated ligands (dFppy). This is the second-highest degree of fluorination (4 fluorine atoms total). It should be very stable with a **long** lifetime, but likely shorter than Complex 4.\n*   **Complex 3:** Has two monofluorinated ligands (Fppy). It has only two fluorine atoms in total and at a single position. While more stable than a complex with no fluorine, it is expected to be significantly less stable than complexes 1 and 4. Its lifetime should be in the **shorter** range compared to 1 and 4.\n*   **Complex 2:** This complex is a special case. It contains one highly stable difluorinated ligand (dFppy) but also one completely unsubstituted ligand (ppy). The overall stability of a molecule is often limited by its weakest point. The non-fluorinated `ppy` ligand is susceptible to all the degradation pathways that fluorination helps prevent (weaker C-H and Ir-C bonds, easier oxidation). Therefore, Complex 2 is expected to be the least stable of the four and have the **shortest** lifetime.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which complexes have shorter lifetimes.**\nThe expected order of lifetime is:\n**Lifetime(C4) > Lifetime(C1) > Lifetime(C3) > Lifetime(C2)**\n\nThe question asks for the complexes that are \"expected to show shorter lifetimes\". Following our stability ranking, the two complexes at the lower end of the stability/lifetime scale are **Complex 2** and **Complex 3**. Complex 2 is the least stable due to the presence of the \"weak link\" `ppy` ligand. Complex 3 is more stable than 2, but its level of fluorination is significantly lower than that of 1 and 4, placing it also in the category of having a \"shorter\" lifetime relative to the most stable emitters in the set.\n\nThus, complexes [2] and [3] are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
