    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Goal:** The objective is to identify and count every unique mRNA splice variant (splice species) detected by the various RT-PCR experiments shown in the image.\n\n**Methodology:** We will analyze the results from each panel (B through I). Each unique DNA band represents a product from a specific mRNA template. We will systematically count the unique products, making sure not to double-count species that might be detected in multiple experiments.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Panel B: E1F1/E4R (20 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F1 (forward, in E1 exon) and E4R (reverse, in E4 exon).\n    *   **Result:** Two distinct bands are observed (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates the presence of **2** different splice species that both contain parts of the E1 and E4 exons. The 31 bp size difference suggests a small alternative splicing event between the primer binding sites.\n\n2.  **Panel C: E1F1/E5R (20 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F1 (forward, in E1 exon) and E5R (reverse, in E5 exon).\n    *   **Result:** Two bands are observed (band 1: 584 bp; band 2: 553 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The size difference between these two bands is also 31 bp (584 - 553 = 31). Since the forward primer is the same as in panel B and E5R is just downstream of E4R, these two bands correspond to the same two splice species identified in panel B. No new species are identified.\n    *   **Running Count:** 2 species.\n\n3.  **Panel D: E1F2/E5R (20 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F2 (forward, spanning the 929^3465 splice junction) and E5R (reverse, in E5 exon).\n    *   **Result:** One distinct band is observed (551 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This primer pair specifically detects a transcript containing the splice from nucleotide 929 to 3465. This is a unique splice junction not identified previously. This represents **1** new species.\n    *   **Running Count:** 2 + 1 = 3 species.\n\n4.  **Panel E: E1F1/L2R (20 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F1 (forward, in E1 exon) and L2R (reverse, in L2 exon).\n    *   **Result:** One distinct band is observed (1,005 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This product shows a linkage between the E1 exon and the L2 exon. This is distinct from the previous species that terminated in the early region (E4/E5). This represents **1** new species.\n    *   **Running Count:** 3 + 1 = 4 species.\n\n5.  **Panel F: E1F2/L2R (25 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F2 (forward, spanning 929^3465) and L2R (reverse, in L2 exon).\n    *   **Result:** One distinct band is observed (972 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This species contains both the specific 929^3465 splice junction and the late L2 exon. It's different from the species in D (which has E5) and E (which doesn't have the 929^3465 splice). This is **1** new species.\n    *   **Running Count:** 4 + 1 = 5 species.\n\n6.  **Panel G: E1F3/L2R (30 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F3 (forward, spanning the 929^3506 splice junction) and L2R (reverse, in L2 exon).\n    *   **Result:** Two distinct bands are observed (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment uses a primer for a different splice junction (929^3506). The two bands indicate two different mRNA variants that share this specific splice but differ elsewhere between the primers. These are **2** new species.\n    *   **Running Count:** 5 + 2 = 7 species.\n\n7.  **Panel H & I: E1F1/L1R (20 & 30 cycles)**\n    *   **Primers:** E1F1 (forward, in E1 exon) and L1R (reverse, in L1 exon).\n    *   **Result:** Panel H (20 cycles) shows two prominent bands (band 1: 450 bp; band 2: 419 bp). Panel I, a more sensitive amplification at 30 cycles, shows four distinct bands (band 1: 450 bp, band 2: 419 bp, band 3: 378 bp, and band 4: 187 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Panel I reveals the full diversity for this primer pair. These transcripts link the E1 region to the L1 region, making them distinct from all previously identified species (which linked to E5 or L2). All four products are unique. These represent **4** new species.\n    *   **Running Count:** 7 + 4 = 11 species.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSumming up all the unique splice species identified from the experiments:\n*   From panel B: 2 species\n*   From panel D: 1 new species\n*   From panel E: 1 new species\n*   From panel F: 1 new species\n*   From panel G: 2 new species\n*   From panel I: 4 new species\n\nTotal = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 distinct splice species identified in this image.\n\n<<<11>>>"
