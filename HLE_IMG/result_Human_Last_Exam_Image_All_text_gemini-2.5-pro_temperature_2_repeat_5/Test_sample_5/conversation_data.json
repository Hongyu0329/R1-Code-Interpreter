    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the musical piece from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Form:** The music is written for a solo piano, indicated by the grand staff (two staves, treble and bass clef, joined by a brace).\n2.  **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has two flats (B♭ and E♭). The first measure strongly establishes the key of G minor, with a G minor triad in the right hand and G octaves in the left hand. The frequent use of F# as an accidental throughout confirms the use of the G harmonic minor scale.\n3.  **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time). The tempo is marked as a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (♩ = 80), which suggests a moderate, marching tempo. Some editions label this section \"Alla marcia\" (in the style of a march).\n4.  **Dynamics and Mood:** The piece begins quietly (`p` - piano), then erupts dramatically in the third measure with a `f` (forte) marking. There are further dynamic changes, such as `mp` (mezzo-piano) in measure 4 and `mf` (mezzo-forte) in measure 8. This wide dynamic range suggests a piece from the Romantic era, known for its emotional expression.\n5.  **Melodic and Rhythmic Features:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** A short, quiet introduction with block chords.\n    *   **Measure 3 onwards:** A very distinct and famous main theme begins. The right hand plays a fast-paced, continuous line of sixteenth notes, which is essentially a descending G harmonic minor scale (G, F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G...).\n    *   **Left Hand Accompaniment:** The left hand plays powerful, rhythmic block chords and octaves that provide a strong, march-like foundation. In measure 3, the chords outline a classic G minor progression: Gm (i) - Cm (iv) - Gm (i) - D (V).\n6.  **Synthesis and Identification:** The combination of a G minor key, a march-like rhythm, a quiet chordal opening, and the subsequent explosion into a virtuosic, running sixteenth-note theme is the unmistakable hallmark of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5**. This piece is one of Rachmaninoff's most famous compositions and a staple of the piano repertoire.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Identification:** Don't just look at the key signature. The first chord and the accidentals used (like the F#) are crucial for determining the minor key and the specific scale (harmonic minor).\n*   **Characteristic Theme:** The most identifiable part is the theme starting in measure 3. The specific melodic shape (descending scale) and the rhythmic drive are unique to this piece.\n*   **Stylistic Period:** The virtuosic writing, dramatic dynamic contrasts, and lush harmonies are all characteristic of the late Romantic period, which fits Rachmaninoff's style perfectly.\n\nBy carefully analyzing these elements, the piece can be confidently identified.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5>>>"
