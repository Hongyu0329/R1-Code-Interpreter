    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure:** First, we need to locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The music snippet starts at measure 20. The second system of staves begins at measure 28. Measure 30 is the third measure in that system and is the second half of the area circled in the image.\n\n2.  **Determine the Key Signature:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of either E-flat major or C minor. The \"Pathetique\" Sonata No. 8 is famously in C minor. This is the home key of the movement.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes played are a sequence of sixteenth notes: F♯, A, C, A.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays and holds an octave on the note D.\n\n4.  **Combine the Notes to Form the Chord:** Taking all the notes sounding simultaneously throughout the measure, we have the pitches D, F♯, A, and C.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chord Quality and Root:**\n    *   If we stack these notes in thirds, starting with D, we get D - F♯ - A - C.\n    *   This intervallic structure forms a dominant seventh chord:\n        *   D (Root)\n        *   F♯ (Major Third above D)\n        *   A (Perfect Fifth above D)\n        *   C (Minor Seventh above D)\n    *   Therefore, the chord is a D dominant seventh chord, abbreviated as D7.\n\n6.  **Determine the Chord's Function in C Minor (Roman Numeral Analysis):**\n    *   The home key is C minor. A D7 chord is not diatonic to the natural minor scale of C (C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭). The diatonic chord built on the second degree (D) would be a D diminished triad (D-F-A♭).\n    *   To understand the function of this non-diatonic D7 chord, we must look at where it resolves. The following measure, measure 31, contains the notes G, B♮, and D. This is a G major chord.\n    *   In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree, which is the dominant. A G major chord (G-B♮-D) functions as the dominant (V) chord of C minor. (The dominant in a minor key is typically major, utilizing the raised 7th degree, or leading tone, B♮ in this case).\n    *   The D7 chord in measure 30 leads directly to the G major chord (V) in measure 31. A dominant seventh chord resolving to a major or minor chord a perfect fifth below it is a standard dominant-tonic relationship. Here, D7 is functioning as the dominant of G.\n    *   Since G is the dominant (V) of C minor, the D7 chord is the \"dominant of the dominant.\" This is called a secondary dominant.\n    *   The Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is V7. The notation for a secondary dominant \"of the dominant\" is V7/V.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key:** Do not confuse the key with the key of the chord. The overall piece is in C minor, which is the frame of reference for the Roman numerals.\n*   **Accidentals:** The F♯ is a crucial accidental. Without it (if it were an F♮), the chord would be a D half-diminished seventh (D-F-A-C), which has a different function.\n*   **Context:** Analyzing the preceding and succeeding chords is essential for determining the function of non-diatonic chords like this secondary dominant. The resolution to G major in measure 31 is the key piece of evidence.\n*   **Roman Numeral Notation:** The notation V7/V clearly indicates a dominant seventh chord (V7) that functions as the dominant of the fifth scale degree (/V).\n\n<<<V7/V>>>"
