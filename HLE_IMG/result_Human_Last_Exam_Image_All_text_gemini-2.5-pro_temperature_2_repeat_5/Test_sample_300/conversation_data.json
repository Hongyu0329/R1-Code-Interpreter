    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork, moving from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top Left):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** The painting depicts women from a Chinese ethnic minority group in traditional attire. The style is characterized by dynamic, fluid ink lines and expressive character portrayal.\n*   **Signature/Seal:** In the upper right corner, a signature and seal are visible. The characters in the signature read \"黄胄\" (Huang Zhou).\n*   **Conclusion:** The subject matter (ethnic minorities), the artistic style, and the clear signature all point to **Huang Zhou**, a master known for such depictions.\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top Middle):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** This is a landscape painting done in an abstract ink wash style. It features bold lines and forms that simplify and reconstruct a natural scene with buildings.\n*   **Style Analysis:** The style of blending traditional Chinese ink with Western modernist abstraction, particularly in landscape subjects like southern Chinese \"water towns,\" is the hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong**. The semi-abstract depiction of houses and trees is very typical of his work.\n*   **Conclusion:** The style is unmistakably that of **Wu Guanzhong**.\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top Right):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy executed in a highly expressive and fluid \"grass script\" (cursive). The lines appear dynamic and almost \"trembling\" with energy.\n*   **Style Analysis:** This particular style of cursive script, renowned for its seemingly untamed yet masterfully controlled brushwork, is famously known as the \"Lin script.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** This calligraphy is the work of **Lin Sanzhi**.\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle Left):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** Another piece of calligraphy in grass script. The characters are bold, powerful, and interconnected, conveying a sense of monumental energy. Two red seals are prominently placed at the beginning of the text on the right side.\n*   **Style Analysis:** This vigorous and assertive style of cursive calligraphy is characteristic of the 20th-century master **Gao Ershi**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calligraphy is by **Gao Ershi**.\n\n**Artwork 5 (Middle Center):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** This is a realist oil painting of a young woman with short hair in a white shirt, holding a pen and sketchbook. The style is marked by delicate, soft lighting and a sense of calm introspection, a style often termed \"Romantic Realism.\"\n*   **Artwork Identification:** This is a very famous and iconic work of modern Chinese art titled \"Youth\" or \"Young Female Singer.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** This painting is one of the most celebrated works by **Chen Yifei**.\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle Right):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** The artwork is a portrait of a woman in an elegant, stylized manner. She wears an elaborate headdress, and sparrows are depicted in the background. The composition is typically square, and the style synthesizes Chinese ink techniques with Western modernist principles, such as Fauvist color and Cubist form.\n*   **Style Analysis:** This unique style—especially the stylized female figures with elongated eyes and melancholic expressions, often in square compositions—is the signature of **Lin Fengmian**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n*   **Conclusion:** The artist is **Lin Fengmian**.\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** This painting shows a vibrant rural courtyard scene with hanging gourds, laundry on a line, and a rooster in a basket. The style combines bright colors with strong geometric lines and patterns.\n*   **Signature/Seal:** A signature is visible on the wall on the right side. The characters clearly read \"吴冠中\" (Wu Guanzhong). A date, \"一九九六\" (1996), is also visible on the left.\n*   **Conclusion:** Both the signature and the distinct style confirm the artist is **Wu Guanzhong**.\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** A landscape painting depicting a majestic gorge with steep cliffs and a fleet of boats with red sails. The artist uses heavy, layered ink to create a sense of depth, light, and monumental weight.\n*   **Style Analysis:** This powerful landscape style and the subject of the Yangtze River Gorges are trademarks of **Li Keran**. He is famous for his innovative techniques in Chinese landscape painting, especially his use of dark ink to build form.\n*   **Conclusion:** The work is by **Li Keran**.\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** The painting features a single lobster, rendered with remarkable simplicity and skill in ink wash on paper. The brushstrokes are economical yet powerful, capturing the creature's texture and form perfectly.\n*   **Style Analysis:** The subject of shrimps and other aquatic life, painted with masterful calligraphic brushwork, is the most iconic theme of **Qi Baishi**. This work is a classic example of his style.\n*   **Conclusion:** The artist is **Qi Baishi**.\n\n***\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  **Top Row:** Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Lin Sanzhi\n2.  **Middle Row:** Gao Ershi, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian\n3.  **Bottom Row:** Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Lin Sanzhi, Gao Ershi, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
