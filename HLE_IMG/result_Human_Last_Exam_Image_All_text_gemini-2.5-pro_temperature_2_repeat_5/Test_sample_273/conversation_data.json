    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the chiral centers in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule has three such centers, which we will analyze from left to right.\n\n*   **C_Left:** The leftmost chiral carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (-H, which is implicit), and the rest of the molecule to the right.\n*   **C_Mid:** The middle chiral carbon is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (-H, implicit), and two different carbon groups to its left and right.\n*   **C_Right:** The rightmost chiral carbon is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (-H, implicit), and the rest of the molecule to the left.\n\n**2. Assign Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**\n\nNext, we assign priorities to the four groups attached to each chiral center based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. The higher the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center, the higher the priority.\n\n**3. Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S) for Each Center**\n\n**Analysis of the Rightmost Chiral Center (C_Right)**\n\n*   **Attached Groups:**\n    1.  The group to the left (-CH(Et)-...)\n    2.  Aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2)\n    3.  Methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  Hydrogen atom (-H)\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    *   Compare the atoms directly bonded to C_Right: C (from the left), C (from -CH2NH2), C (from -CH3), and H.\n    *   To break the tie between the three carbon atoms, we look at the atoms they are bonded to:\n        *   -CH2NH2: C is bonded to (N, H, H).\n        *   Group to the left: C is bonded to (C, C, H).\n        *   -CH3: C is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    *   Since N (atomic number 7) is higher than C (6), the -CH2NH2 group has the highest priority.\n    *   Comparing the remaining two carbon groups, the group to the left (-CH(Et)-...) has priority over the methyl group.\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -CH2NH2, 2: Group to the left, 3: -CH3, 4: -H.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The drawing shows the bond to the left group and the implicit -H bond as being in the plane of the paper. The -CH2NH2 group (Priority 1) is on a wedge (coming out). The -CH3 group (Priority 3) is on a dash (going in).\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can use the \"swap\" method. We swap the -H (4) with the group on the dash, -CH3 (3).\n    *   After the swap, -H is on the dash (pointing away). We now determine the configuration of this new arrangement: the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, the configuration is **R**.\n\n**Analysis of the Middle Chiral Center (C_Mid)**\n\n*   **Attached Groups:**\n    1.  Group to the left (-CH(OH)CH3)\n    2.  Group to the right (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2)\n    3.  Ethyl group (-CH2CH3)\n    4.  Hydrogen atom (-H)\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    *   Compare the carbon atoms of the three non-hydrogen substituents:\n        *   Left group C: bonded to (O, C, H).\n        *   Right group C: bonded to (C, C, H).\n        *   Ethyl group C: bonded to (C, H, H).\n    *   The left group has the highest priority because O has a higher atomic number than C.\n    *   The right group has the second-highest priority over the ethyl group.\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -CH(OH)CH3, 2: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2, 3: -CH2CH3, 4: -H.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The drawing shows the ethyl group (Priority 3) on a wedge. This implies the implicit hydrogen (-H, Priority 4) is on a dash.\n    *   With the lowest priority group pointing away, we can trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path is clockwise. Therefore, the configuration is **R**.\n\n**Analysis of the Leftmost Chiral Center (C_Left)**\n\n*   **Attached Groups:**\n    1.  Hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    2.  Group to the right (-CH(Et)-...)\n    3.  Methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  Hydrogen atom (-H)\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    *   O has a higher atomic number than C. -OH is priority 1.\n    *   Comparing the carbon groups, the group to the right is of higher priority than the methyl group.\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -OH, 2: Group to the right, 3: -CH3, 4: -H.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The drawing for this center is geometrically problematic as it shows two substituents (-OH and -CH3) on dashes while the bond to the main chain is in the plane. For a tetrahedral carbon, this would force the implicit -H atom to be on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   Accepting this interpretation to solve the problem: with the lowest priority group (-H, 4) on a wedge, we determine the direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from -OH (1, dash) -> Right group (2, plane) -> -CH3 (3, dash) traces a clockwise direction.\n    *   Because the lowest priority group points towards us, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes S.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration is **S**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe absolute configurations for the three chiral centers, from left to right in the drawing, are S, R, and R.\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
