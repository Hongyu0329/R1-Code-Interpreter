    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most obvious, \"at a glance\" feature of the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses is the structure that produces spores and typically consists of a capsule (containing spores), a seta (stalk), and a foot (which attaches it to the gametophyte).\n\n2.  **Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***:\n    *   **Seta (stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically very short and straight.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is so short, the capsule remains immersed within, or is only slightly emergent from, the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem where the sporophyte develops).\n    *   **Capsule Shape/Texture:** The capsule is typically ovoid to subglobose (egg-shaped to almost spherical) and is smooth-walled, meaning it does not have prominent ridges or furrows (it is not plicate), even when dry.\n    *   **Observation from the image:** The provided image shows numerous capsules that are nestled down among the leafy stems. They are not held aloft on stalks. This matches the description of an immersed capsule on a short, straight seta, consistent with *Grimmia montana*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***:\n    *   **Seta (stalk):** The key feature is given by its specific name, *curviseta*, which means \"curved seta\". The seta of this species is relatively long and distinctly curved, bent, or even swan-necked (cygneous).\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The long, curved seta causes the capsule to be exserted well beyond the leaves. The curvature often makes the capsule hang downwards or to the side (cernuous to pendent).\n    *   **Capsule Shape/Texture:** The capsule is often ovoid-oblong and may be striate or ribbed, especially when dry.\n\n4.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   The most significant and visually striking difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **seta**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, the **seta is short and straight**, resulting in an **immersed capsule**.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, the **seta is longer and strongly curved**, resulting in an **exserted and nodding capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Nomenclature as a Clue:** The name *curviseta* directly points to the defining characteristic of its sporophyteâ€”the curved seta.\n*   **\"At a Glance\" Feature:** The position of the capsule relative to the leaves (immersed vs. exserted) is a direct consequence of the seta's length and curvature. This is a macroscopic feature that can be easily seen in the field without a microscope, making it the perfect \"at a glance\" characteristic.\n*   **Other Differences:** While there might be other subtle differences (e.g., in capsule shape or wall texture), the seta's form and the resulting capsule position are the primary and most reliable distinguishing features.\n*   **Observation Conditions:** These features are often most clear when the moss is dry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for distinction at a glance is the nature of the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta that leaves the capsule immersed among the leaves, whereas *Grimmia curviseta* has a long, distinctly curved seta that causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang.\n\n<<<The main difference is in the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which makes the capsule exserted (raised above the leaves) and typically nodding or hanging."
