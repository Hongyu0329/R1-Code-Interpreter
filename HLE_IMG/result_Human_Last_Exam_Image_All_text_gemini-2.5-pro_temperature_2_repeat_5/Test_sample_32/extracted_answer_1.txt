The main difference is in the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which makes the capsule exserted (raised above the leaves) and typically nodding or hanging.
