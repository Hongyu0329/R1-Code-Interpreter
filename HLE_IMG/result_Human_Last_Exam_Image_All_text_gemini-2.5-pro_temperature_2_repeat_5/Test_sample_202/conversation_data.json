    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K. We will analyze each specimen based on its visible characteristics like texture, color, and composition.\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Color:** Reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is highly porous with many visible holes or cavities. This texture is known as vesicular. The pores (vesicles) are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled. The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n    *   **Identification:** These features are characteristic of an extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock. The reddish color and high vesicularity are typical of **Scoria**. Scoria is formed from mafic to intermediate lava that is rich in dissolved gases.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Color:** A light-colored, whitish-grey matrix holding together various darker and reddish fragments.\n    *   **Texture:** This rock is clastic, meaning it is composed of broken pieces (clasts) of other rocks that have been cemented together. The clasts are angular and of various sizes, embedded in a fine-grained groundmass or matrix.\n    *   **Identification:** A rock made of angular volcanic fragments cemented by volcanic ash is known as a **Volcanic Breccia** or **Tuff** (specifically a lapilli tuff if the fragments are of a certain size). The appearance strongly suggests it was formed from a pyroclastic flow, an explosive volcanic eruption.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Color:** Very light-colored, off-white or pale grey.\n    *   **Texture:** Similar to specimen H, this rock is also highly vesicular and appears lightweight and frothy. The vesicles seem to be smaller and more numerous than in H. The texture is fine-grained and glassy.\n    *   **Identification:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Pumice**. Pumice is formed from felsic lava with a very high gas content that cools rapidly, trapping the bubbles. Its density is often so low that it can float on water.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Color:** A mixture of large, light-colored crystals (white, pinkish, or clear) and smaller, dark-colored minerals (green or black).\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n    *   **Identification:** A phaneritic texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The extremely large crystals (typically over 1 cm) are characteristic of a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites form during the final stages of magma crystallization where water and other volatiles become concentrated, allowing very large crystals to grow.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (Extrusive Igneous)\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia / Tuff (Volcaniclastic)\n*   **J:** Pumice (Extrusive Igneous)\n*   **K:** Pegmatite (Intrusive Igneous)\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia (or Tuff)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
