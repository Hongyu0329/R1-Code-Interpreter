    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry is a property a shape or pattern has when it looks the same after being rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree rotation. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Inspect the Tiling for Repeating Motifs**\nThe image displays a complex geometric tiling composed of several distinct shapes. We should look for prominent, repeating motifs and potential centers of rotation. The most striking motifs are the star-like or rosette patterns.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Potential Center of Rotation**\nLet's focus on one of the prominent rosettes, for example, the one located in the center of the provided image. This rosette appears to be a good candidate for a center of rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structure Around the Potential Center**\nAt the heart of this central rosette is a large, blue, regular polygon. By counting its sides, we can identify it as a **heptagon** (a 7-sided polygon). This heptagon itself has 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the Tiles Surrounding the Central Heptagon**\n*   Directly attached to each of the 7 sides of the central heptagon is a light yellow pentagon (5-sided polygon). There are 7 of these pentagons arranged symmetrically around the central heptagon.\n*   In the \"valleys\" between these pentagons, there are 7 light yellow squares.\n*   This entire arrangement of the central heptagon and its surrounding rings of pentagons and squares forms a large, symmetrical super-unit.\n\n**Step 6: Test the Rotational Symmetry of the Motif**\nImagine placing a pin in the exact center of the blue heptagon and rotating the entire image.\n*   A rotation by 360°/7 (approximately 51.4°) will cause the central heptagon to align perfectly with its original outline.\n*   Simultaneously, each of the 7 surrounding pentagons will move into the exact position previously occupied by its neighbor.\n*   The same is true for the surrounding squares and all other tiles further out in the pattern. The entire tiling will appear unchanged.\n*   Since the pattern coincides with its original state 7 times during a full 360° rotation, the tiling has **7-fold rotational symmetry** around the center of each blue heptagon.\n\n**Step 7: Consider Other Possible Symmetries**\nWhile the most prominent symmetry is 7-fold, it's worth noting that the tiling also contains other centers of rotation. For example, the center of each light yellow square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. However, the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern is 7. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry, this typically refers to the highest or most characteristic order. The presence of 7-fold symmetry is a key feature of this specific type of aperiodic tiling.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the central motifs formed by the heptagons and their surrounding tiles, the tiling exhibits 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
