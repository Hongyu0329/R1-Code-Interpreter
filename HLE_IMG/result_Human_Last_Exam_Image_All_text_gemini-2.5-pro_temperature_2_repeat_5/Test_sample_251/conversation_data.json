    "*   **Step 1: Understand the ECG calibration.**\n    The ECG strip has a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. This information is printed at the top left corner of the ECG. This speed is standard for ECG recordings. The grid on the ECG paper is used to measure time on the horizontal axis and voltage on the vertical axis.\n    *   Each small square on the grid is 1 mm wide.\n    *   Each large square on the grid consists of 5 small squares, so it is 5 mm wide.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the time represented by each square.**\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the R-waves and R-R intervals.**\n    The R-wave is the prominent positive (upward) deflection in the QRS complex. The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves. We need to find the longest such interval on the entire rhythm strip.\n\n*   **Step 4: Visually scan the ECG for the longest R-R interval.**\n    By looking at the entire rhythm strip, we can see that the rhythm is mostly regular, with some variation. There is a very noticeable long pause in the fourth row of the tracing (the row that starts near the time marker `0:06:08`). All other R-R intervals appear significantly shorter than this pause.\n\n*   **Step 5: Precisely measure the longest R-R interval.**\n    We will now measure the duration of this long pause by counting the squares between the R-wave peak just before the pause and the R-wave peak just after the pause.\n    1.  Locate the R-wave peak at the beginning of the pause (it's the 7th QRS complex in that row).\n    2.  Locate the R-wave peak at the end of the pause (it's the 8th QRS complex in that row).\n    3.  Count the number of large squares between these two peaks. Placing a mental marker on the peak before the pause, we can count the number of large squares (the squares with thicker lines) until we reach the peak after the pause. There are exactly 8 large squares separating the two R-wave peaks.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave before the pause and the peak of the R-wave after the pause align perfectly in their position relative to the large squares, simplifying the count.\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the time in seconds.**\n    Now, we convert the measured distance in large squares into time in seconds.\n    *   Number of large squares = 8\n    *   Time per large square = 0.2 seconds\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 8 large squares × 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n    Alternatively, using small squares:\n    *   Number of small squares = 8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square = 40 small squares.\n    *   Time per small square = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 40 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.6 seconds.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result. The longest R-R interval is 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
