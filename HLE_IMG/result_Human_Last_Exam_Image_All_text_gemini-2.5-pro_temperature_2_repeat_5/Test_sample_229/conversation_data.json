    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music's Characteristics:**\n    *   **Notation Style:** This is a \"lead sheet\" or \"fake book\" style of notation, which provides the main melody and the chord progression. This format is very common in jazz and related popular music styles.\n    *   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4. A tempo marking \"Med. J=120\" (Medium, 120 beats per minute) is visible at the top, which is a moderate swing tempo common in jazz.\n    *   **Key and Harmony:** The key signature is C major/A minor. The chords used, such as `C`, `E7`, `F`, `G7`, `C-` (C minor), and `A-` (A minor), involve standard diatonic chords, secondary dominants (`E7` acting as V7 of A minor, but resolving to `F`), and modal interchange (`C` to `C-`). This level of harmonic complexity is characteristic of jazz.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The progression in the first four bars, `C | E7 | F | F#dim G7`, is particularly distinctive. The `I - III7 - IV` (`C - E7 - F`) movement is a well-known feature in certain styles, notably French jazz and chanson.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody is syncopated, features arpeggios, and uses chromatic passing tones. This phrasing and rhythmic feel are hallmarks of jazz, specifically with a \"swing\" feel.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Style and Origin:**\n    *   Based on the harmony and melody, the style is clearly a form of jazz.\n    *   The specific `C | E7 | F...` progression is strongly associated with French music, particularly the \"Jazz Manouche\" or \"Gypsy Jazz\" style popularized in Paris.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Song:**\n    *   The combination of the specific melodic contour and the chord progression `C | E7 | F | F#dim G7` points to a well-known tune in the Gypsy Jazz repertoire.\n    *   While other songs like \"C'est si bon\" use a similar progression, the melody on this sheet music does not match that of \"C'est si bon.\"\n    *   This melody and chord progression perfectly match the composition \"Douce Ambiance\" by the seminal Gypsy Jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   **Title:** The song is \"Douce Ambiance\".\n    *   **Musical Style:** The style is Gypsy Jazz (also known as Jazz Manouche or Hot Club Jazz).\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The style originated in France, pioneered by French/Romani artist Django Reinhardt in Paris in the 1930s. Therefore, the country of origin is France.\n\n<<<Title: Douce Ambiance\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: France>>>"
