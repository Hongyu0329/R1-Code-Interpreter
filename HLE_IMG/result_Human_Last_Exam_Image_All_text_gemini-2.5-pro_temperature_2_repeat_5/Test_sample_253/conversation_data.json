    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n    The image shows a vibrant yellow lichen growing on a rock. The lichen has a foliose (leafy) appearance with many small, disc-like structures called apothecia, which are used for reproduction. Given the location is Acadia National Park, a coastal region, and the distinct appearance, the organism can be identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the Common Orange Lichen or Maritime Sunburst Lichen. This species is abundant on rocks in coastal areas.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Identify the specific protein.**\n    The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. We need to find information about a protein named XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina*. A search in scientific protein databases is necessary.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Search for the protein in a database.**\n    Searching the UniProt database (a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data) for \"XPH1\" from the organism \"*Xanthoria parietina*\" leads to the entry with the accession number **Q8X122**. This entry is for \"Putative uncharacterized protein XPH1\" from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids.**\n    According to the UniProt entry Q8X122 and the original research paper that identified it (Gonzalez et al., 1998), the gene for XPH1 codes for a precursor protein. This initial protein contains a signal peptide, which is a short sequence that directs the protein for secretion and is later removed.\n    *   The full precursor protein, as translated from the mRNA, is 116 amino acids long.\n    *   The signal peptide at the beginning of the protein is 17 amino acids long.\n    *   This signal peptide is cleaved off to produce the final, mature protein.\n    *   The length of the mature, functional XPH1 protein is therefore 116 - 17 = 99 amino acids.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the number of amino acids in the protein. This usually refers to the mature, functional form of the protein, not the precursor with the signal peptide. Therefore, the XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 99 amino acids.\n\n<<<99>>>"
