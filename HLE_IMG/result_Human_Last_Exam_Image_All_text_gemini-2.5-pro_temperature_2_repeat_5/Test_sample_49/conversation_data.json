    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cutoff frequency of the filter at node $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$ and the rest of the resistive ladder network. This configuration forms a first-order low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency of such a filter is determined by the capacitance $C$ and the Thévenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is given by:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$\n\nOur primary task is to find the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\n**2. Calculating the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we follow these steps:\n1.  Remove the capacitor $C$ from the circuit.\n2.  Deactivate all independent sources. The input signal \"IN\" is a voltage source connected at node $c_0$. Deactivating a voltage source means replacing it with a short circuit, so we ground node $c_0$.\n3.  Calculate the equivalent resistance between the terminals where the capacitor was connected, i.e., between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n\n**3. Setting up the Resistance Calculation using Recurrence Relations**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder. We can analyze it using difference equations (recurrence relations).\n*   Let's label the nodes on the left rail as $c_0, c_1, c_2, ...$ and their potentials as $v_0, v_1, v_2, ...$.\n*   Let's label the nodes on the right rail as $d_0, d_1, d_2, ...$ and their potentials as $u_0, u_1, u_2, ...$.\n*   From the diagram, the input node is $c_0$, and the output node is $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is the termination of the right rail, so we identify $a_0$ with $d_0$.\n*   For the $R_{th}$ calculation, we apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ at node $a_0$ ($d_0$) and set the input node $c_0$ to ground. Thus, our boundary conditions at the bottom of the ladder (index $k=0$) are:\n    $u_0 = V_{test}$\n    $v_0 = 0$\n*   The network is passive and extends to infinity. We assume that the potentials must remain bounded as we go up the ladder (i.e., as the index $k \\to \\infty$).\n\n**4. Formulating and Solving the Difference Equations**\nApplying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at a generic node $c_k$ and $d_k$ (for $k \\ge 1$), we get a system of coupled difference equations:\n*   At node $c_k$: $\\frac{v_k - v_{k-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_k - v_{k+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_k - u_k}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_k - v_{k-1} - v_{k+1} - u_k = 0$\n*   At node $d_k$: $\\frac{u_k - u_{k-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_k - u_{k+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_k - v_k}{r} = 0 \\implies 3u_k - u_{k-1} - u_{k+1} - v_k = 0$\n\nTo solve this system, we decouple the equations by defining new variables:\n*   Sum: $s_k = v_k + u_k$\n*   Difference: $d_k = v_k - u_k$\n\nAdding and subtracting the two KCL equations gives two independent second-order linear difference equations:\n*   For $s_k$: $s_{k+1} - 2s_k + s_{k-1} = 0$\n*   For $d_k$: $d_{k+1} - 4d_k + d_{k-1} = 0$\n\nThe general solutions are:\n*   For $s_k$: The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1 = 0 \\implies (\\lambda-1)^2 = 0$. This gives a repeated root $\\lambda=1$. The general solution is $s_k = A_1(1)^k + A_2 k (1)^k = A_1 + A_2 k$. For the potentials to be bounded as $k \\to \\infty$, we must have $A_2 = 0$. So, $s_k = A_1$ (a constant).\n*   For $d_k$: The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$. The roots are $\\lambda = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. For the potentials to be bounded as $k \\to \\infty$, we must choose the root with magnitude less than 1, which is $\\lambda_d = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. So, the solution is $d_k = D(2-\\sqrt{3})^k$.\n\n**5. Applying Boundary Conditions to Find Coefficients**\nThe recurrence relations are valid for $k \\ge 1$. We use the values at $k=0$ to find the constants $A_1$ and $D$.\n*   For $s_k$: Evaluate the recurrence at $k=1$: $s_2 - 2s_1 + s_0 = 0$. Since $s_k$ is constant for $k \\ge 1$, $s_2=s_1=A_1$. Thus, $A_1 - 2A_1 + s_0 = 0 \\implies A_1 = s_0$. We know $s_0 = v_0 + u_0 = 0 + V_{test} = V_{test}$. So, $A_1 = V_{test}$. This means $v_k + u_k = V_{test}$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n*   For $d_k$: Evaluate at $k=1$: $d_2 - 4d_1 + d_0 = 0$. The solution is $d_k=D(2-\\sqrt{3})^k$ for $k\\ge 1$. So $d_1 = D(2-\\sqrt{3})$ and $d_2 = D(2-\\sqrt{3})^2$. Substituting these gives $D(2-\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4D(2-\\sqrt{3}) + d_0 = 0 \\implies D((2-\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(2-\\sqrt{3})) + d_0 = 0$. The characteristic equation tells us $\\lambda_d^2 - 4\\lambda_d + 1 = 0$, so $\\lambda_d^2 - 4\\lambda_d = -1$. This simplifies the equation to $-D + d_0 = 0 \\implies D=d_0$. We know $d_0 = v_0 - u_0 = 0 - V_{test} = -V_{test}$. So, $D = -V_{test}$. This means $v_k - u_k = -V_{test}(2-\\sqrt{3})^k$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Input Current and Resistance**\nThe Thévenin resistance is $R_{th} = V_{test} / I_{test}$. The test current $I_{test}$ is the total current flowing from node $a_0$ into the circuit. From the diagram, node $a_0$ is only connected to node $d_1$ through a resistor $r$.\n$I_{test} = \\frac{u_0 - u_1}{r}$\n\nWe need to find $u_1$. From our solutions:\n$s_1 = v_1 + u_1 = V_{test}$\n$d_1 = v_1 - u_1 = -V_{test}(2-\\sqrt{3})^1$\nSubtracting the two equations gives $2u_1 = s_1 - d_1 = V_{test} - (-V_{test}(2-\\sqrt{3})) = V_{test}(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = V_{test}(3 - \\sqrt{3})$.\n$u_1 = \\frac{V_{test}(3 - \\sqrt{3})}{2}$\n\nNow we can calculate $I_{test}$:\n$I_{test} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_{test} - \\frac{V_{test}(3 - \\sqrt{3})}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\left( \\frac{2 - 3 + \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \\right)$\n\nFinally, we calculate $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}} = r \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} \\right) = r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$\n\n**7. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thévenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency. We will express the answer as the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)C}$\n\n<<<1 / ((sqrt(3) + 1) * r * C)>>>"
