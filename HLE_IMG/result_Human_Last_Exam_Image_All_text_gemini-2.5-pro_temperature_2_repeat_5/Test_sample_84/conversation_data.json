    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the city with a coat of arms similar to the one in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual components of the coat of arms in the image.**\n*   **The Shield (Escutcheon):** This is the central and most important element for identification. It is divided horizontally into two fields (a design called \"per fess\" in heraldry).\n    *   The top half is dark blue (azure).\n    *   The bottom half is gold/yellow (or).\n*   **The Charges (Symbols on the Shield):**\n    *   In the top blue half, there is a yellow crescent moon with its horns pointing upwards.\n    *   In the bottom gold half, there is a prominent black crab (sable).\n*   **External Ornaments (Paraphernalia):**\n    *   **Crown:** Above the shield is a silver-colored crown with gold details.\n    *   **Wreath/Supporters:** The shield is flanked by two crossed branches. The one on the left appears to be an olive branch (with green leaves and black olives), and the one on the right is an oak branch (with gnarled wood and acorns).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the most unique features for searching.**\nThe most distinctive and non-generic combination of elements on the shield is the **blue and gold divided field**, charged with a **crescent moon** and a **crab**. The external ornaments like the crown and branches can vary widely in artistic representations and are less reliable for identification than the shield itself.\n\n**Step 3: Search for a city with a matching coat of arms.**\nSearching for combinations like \"coat of arms with crab and moon,\" \"heraldry blue gold crab,\" or \"city coat of arms crescent crab\" leads to a specific coat of arms.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the image with the discovered coat of arms.**\nThe search results strongly point to the coat of arms of **Chornomorsk, Ukraine**.\n*   The coat of arms of Chornomorsk features a shield divided horizontally, blue over gold. This perfectly matches the image.\n*   The shield of Chornomorsk has a crescent in the top blue section and a black crab in the bottom gold section. This also perfectly matches the image's layout and symbols.\n*   **Minor difference:** The official heraldic description (blazon) for Chornomorsk's coat of arms specifies a silver (argent) crescent. The image shows a gold (or) crescent. This is a common type of artistic variation, and the overall design remains unmistakably the same. The city was known as Illichivsk until 2016, and the coat of arms has remained.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe design of the shield in the provided image—a blue and gold field with a crescent moon above a crab—is virtually identical to the coat of arms of the city of Chornomorsk in Ukraine. The external crown and wreath are artistic additions, but the core heraldic identity on the shield is a clear match.\n\n<<<Chornomorsk>>>"
