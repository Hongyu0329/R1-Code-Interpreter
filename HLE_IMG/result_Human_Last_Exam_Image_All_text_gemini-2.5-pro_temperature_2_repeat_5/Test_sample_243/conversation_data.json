    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the plant's key features.**\nThe image shows a plant with distinctive leaves. The key characteristics are:\n*   **Leaf Shape:** The leaves are simple, elliptical to lance-shaped with smooth edges.\n*   **Leaf Color and Pattern:** The leaves are a deep, dark green. The most prominent feature is the striking network of pale green or silvery-white veins. This pattern is called reticulate venation, where the veins form a fine, web-like network.\n*   **Leaf Arrangement:** The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, but appear clustered towards the growing tips.\n*   **Stem:** The young stems appear to have a slight purplish tinge.\n*   **Habit:** The plant appears to be a shrub.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant species based on its features.**\nUsing the distinctive leaf pattern as the primary clue, a search for plants with \"dark green leaves and white netted veins\" or \"reticulate venation\" leads to a few candidates. One of the strongest matches is *Debregeasia hedyotidea*. Comparing images of *Debregeasia hedyotidea* online confirms a near-perfect match with the plant in the photograph. This species is known for this specific, beautiful venation. Another similar looking plant is *Sarcococca ruscifolia* var. *chinensis* 'Dragon's Gate', but its native range is mainland China, not an island. *Debregeasia hedyotidea* fits the visual evidence very well.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\nThe question asks for the name of the island to which this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means that the plant is found naturally only in that specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world. Researching the native distribution of *Debregeasia hedyotidea* reveals that it is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family, Urticaceae. According to botanical databases and academic sources, this species is endemic to Taiwan.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the identification of the plant as *Debregeasia hedyotidea* and the fact that it is endemic to a specific island, the answer is the name of that island.\n\nThe island to which this plant, *Debregeasia hedyotidea*, was endemic is Taiwan.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
