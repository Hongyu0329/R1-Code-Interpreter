    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC lattice has atoms at each of the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces. The primitive (simplest) basis for an FCC lattice consists of a single atom and three primitive lattice vectors, for example:\n`p1 = a/2(1, 1, 0)`\n`p2 = a/2(1, 0, 1)`\n`p3 = a/2(0, 1, 1)`\nwhere 'a' is the side length of the conventional cubic cell. Any atom in the crystal can be found by starting at the origin and adding integer combinations of these three vectors.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction**\nViewing a 3D structure along the [110] direction means we are projecting all the atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector. This plane is known as the (110) plane. To analyze the resulting pattern, we can set up a new 2D coordinate system on this plane. A convenient choice for axes within this plane are the [001] direction and the [1, -1, 0] direction, as they are both perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction and to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical 2D Pattern**\nWhen we project the 3D FCC lattice points onto the (110) plane, the resulting 2D pattern has a specific, recognizable symmetry. The calculation shows that the projected points form a **centered rectangular lattice**.\nThis means the pattern can be described by a repeating rectangular unit cell that has atoms at all four corners and one atom precisely in the center of the rectangle.\nThe side lengths of this rectangle are in the ratio `a` to `a/√2`, which gives an aspect ratio of `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Image Options**\nNow, we examine each of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the \"centered rectangular\" description. We should look for the fundamental repeating unit cell in each projection.\n\n*   **Pattern A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of rectangles, but no atoms in the centers of these rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction. It is not a centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Pattern B:** The atoms seem to form a hexagonal pattern or a centered square. If we outline a repeating rectangle, its aspect ratio (height/width) is close to 1. This \"centered square\" pattern is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction. The overall hexagonal feel is also characteristic of a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure viewed along its c-axis. In either case, it does not match the centered rectangle with an aspect ratio of √2 expected for FCC [110].\n\n*   **Pattern D:** This pattern shows a rectangle with atoms not only at the corners and the center but also at the center of each of the four edges. This is a **face-centered rectangular** pattern. This pattern is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction. It has more atoms per unit cell than the simple centered rectangle we are looking for.\n\n*   **Pattern C:** This pattern appears less regular than the others, partly due to the 3D perspective view. However, if we identify the atoms belonging to a repeating unit, we can find the characteristic centered rectangular arrangement. We can trace a large parallelogram (a rectangle distorted by perspective) formed by corner atoms (e.g., at (1, 7.5), (9, 7.5), (1, 14), and another one inferred near (9,14)). The key feature is the presence of other atoms (like the one near (4.5, 12)) that lie in the center of this rectangular unit. This arrangement, consisting of two interlocking rectangular sub-lattices where one is shifted to the center of the other, is the definition of a centered rectangular lattice. Although distorted by perspective, pattern C is the only one that has the correct topology for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy elimination and by identifying the key topological features, Pattern C is the only one that represents a centered rectangular lattice, which is the correct projection for an FCC structure along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
