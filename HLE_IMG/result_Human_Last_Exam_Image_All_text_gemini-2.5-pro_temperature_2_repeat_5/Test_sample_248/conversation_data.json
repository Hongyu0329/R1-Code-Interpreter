    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms in the image:** The photograph shows a typical rocky intertidal community. Several types of organisms are visible:\n    *   **Barnacles:** The rock is covered with acorn barnacles, which are the small, volcano-shaped crustaceans with whitish shells.\n    *   **Snails:** There are at least two, possibly three, species of marine snails (gastropods).\n        *   Two larger snails are in the center. The upper one has a brownish shell with fine spiral stripes. The lower one is whiter and more eroded, but of a similar size and shape.\n        *   Several smaller, darker snails with ribbed shells are also present.\n    *   **Other encrusting organisms:** Tiny greyish dots are scattered on the rock, which are likely very young, newly settled barnacles (spat) or another type of encrusting life form.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:** The question asks to identify a species that is found on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast of North America, thus pinpointing the location.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the species' geographic distributions:** We need to consider the known ranges of these common intertidal organisms.\n    *   **Barnacles:** Many common barnacle species look similar. For example, the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*) is a dominant species on the North Atlantic coast. The Pacific coast has its own common species, such as *Balanus glandula*. While an expert might be able to tell them apart, it is not always straightforward from a photograph, and they fill similar ecological niches. Therefore, the barnacles are not the most definitive indicator.\n    *   **Small, dark snails:** These are likely a species of periwinkle, such as the Rough Periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*). However, the *L. saxatilis* species complex is found on *both* the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Therefore, its presence is not a definitive indicator of either coast.\n    *   **Large, striped snail:** This snail is the most distinctive feature for geographic identification. Its size, shape, and coloration (light shell with thin, dark spiral lines) are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**, whose scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n4.  **Focus on *Littorina littorea***: Let's examine the biogeography of this species.\n    *   *Littorina littorea* is native to the coasts of northeastern Europe.\n    *   It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast around the 1840s.\n    *   It has since become one of the most common and abundant intertidal animals along the rocky shores of the Atlantic coast, from Canada down to Maryland/Virginia.\n    *   Crucially, *Littorina littorea* has **never successfully established a breeding population on the Pacific coast of North America**. Its presence in a natural, thriving intertidal community, as shown in the photo, is a definitive sign that the location is on the Atlantic coast.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, definitively indicates that the photo was taken on a North American Atlantic coast. No other species in the photo provides such a clear geographic distinction. The scientific name requested is therefore *Littorina littorea*.\n\n***\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
