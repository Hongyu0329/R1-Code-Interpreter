    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The provided image shows a specific knot. I will first identify it using standard knot theory classifications (the Alexander-Briggs notation).\n2.  **State the Relevant Theorem:** I will use a key theorem by Jacob Rasmussen that connects the Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` to another, more easily accessible invariant for a special class of knots to which this one belongs.\n3.  **Find the Necessary Value:** The theorem relates `s(K)` to the knot's signature, `sigma(K)`. I will use the known, tabulated value of the signature for this specific knot.\n4.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will use the theorem and the known signature value to find the Rasmussen invariant.\n\nThe python code below carries out this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the knot.\n    # The knot diagram in the image is a standard representation of the knot 7_4\n    # in the Alexander-Briggs notation. It is an alternating knot, which is a crucial property.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem.\n    # For any alternating knot K, a fundamental result from knot theory states that\n    # its Rasmussen s-invariant, s(K), is equal to its classical signature, sigma(K).\n    # Formula: s(K) = sigma(K)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the signature for the 7_4 knot.\n    # The signature is a well-known invariant. While it can be computed from the diagram,\n    # the process is complex. We will use the standard, tabulated value for 7_4 from\n    # knot theory references like the KnotInfo database.\n    # For the 7_4 knot, the signature is -4.\n    sigma_of_knot = -4\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    # Using the theorem from Step 2, we can directly equate the Rasmussen invariant\n    # to the signature.\n    rasmussen_invariant = sigma_of_knot\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as {knot_name}, which is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant 's' is equal to the knot signature 'sigma'.\")\n    print(f\"The known signature for the {knot_name} knot is: {sigma_of_knot}\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {sigma_of_knot}\")\n    print(f\"The Rasmussen invariant is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\nsolve_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<-4>>>"
