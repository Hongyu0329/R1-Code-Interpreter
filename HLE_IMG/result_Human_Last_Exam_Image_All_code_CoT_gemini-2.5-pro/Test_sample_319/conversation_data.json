    "The image displays a visual representation of an auditory stimulus designed to elicit a specific perceptual illusion. Here is my plan to identify it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Stimulus:** I will first analyze the two plots in the image. The top plot is a spectrogram (frequency vs. time), and the bottom is a waveform (amplitude vs. time). The stimulus starts as a pure tone (one frequency), is interrupted by a brief, wide-frequency sound (like noise or a click), and is then replaced by a different sound composed of two distinct tones.\n2.  **Identify the Illusion:** This setup is a classic demonstration of an auditory illusion where the brain perceptually \"fills in\" a sound that is briefly interrupted by another sound. Even though the original tone stops and is replaced, a listener will often perceive the original tone as continuing seamlessly through the interruption.\n3.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This perceptual completion effect is known as the auditory continuity illusion.\n4.  **Provide Code:** As requested, I will write a Python script using `numpy` and `matplotlib` to generate and visualize a similar stimulus. The code will create the initial tone, the interrupting noise, and the subsequent two tones, and then plot the resulting waveform and spectrogram. Finally, the script will print the name of the phenomenon.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef demonstrate_auditory_illusion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script generates and visualizes a stimulus for the auditory continuity illusion,\n    similar to the one shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
