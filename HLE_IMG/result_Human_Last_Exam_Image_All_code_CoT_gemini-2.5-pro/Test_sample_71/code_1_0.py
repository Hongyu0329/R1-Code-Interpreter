# Step 1: Analysis of the chemical reaction.
# The reaction synthesizes Trioxatriangulenium tetrafluoroborate from a starting material A.
# The product is a large, stable aromatic cation, [C19H9O3]+, commonly known as the TOTA cation.
# The reagents are 1) pyridinium HCl at 200 °C and 2) HBF4.
# Pyridinium HCl at high temperatures is a classic reagent for demethylating aryl methyl ethers and serves as a high-boiling acidic medium for cyclization reactions.

# Step 2: Identification of Compound A.
# The product's structure, with a central carbon connected to three fused benzoxepine-like rings, strongly suggests a triphenylmethane-type precursor.
# The demethylating conditions point to the presence of methoxy (-OCH3) groups in Compound A.
# A literature search confirms this hypothesis. Patent US 6,639,088 B2 by Laursen and Krebs describes this exact synthesis.
# In Example 1, Trioxatriangulenium tetrafluoroborate is prepared by reacting Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol with pyridinium hydrochloride at 200 °C for 1.5 hours.
# Therefore, Compound A is Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol.

# Step 3: Determine the chemical formula of Compound A.
# The structure of Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol is C(OH)(C6H4OCH3)3.
# Let's count the atoms:
# - Carbon (C): 1 (central C) + 3 * (6 in benzene ring + 1 in methoxy) = 1 + 3 * 7 = 22.
# - Hydrogen (H): 1 (in OH) + 3 * (4 in benzene ring + 3 in methoxy) = 1 + 3 * 7 = 22.
# - Oxygen (O): 1 (in OH) + 3 * 1 (in methoxy) = 4.
# The chemical formula is C22H22O4.

# Step 4: Print the results as requested.
