    "My plan is to deduce the country by analyzing the dates of the recurring peaks in the Google Trends graph and matching them to significant annual historical events or holidays of a specific country.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Peaks:** I will examine the x-axis to determine the approximate dates of the prominent, recurring spikes for each of the three colored lines (red, yellow, and blue).\n2.  **Identify Peak Timings:**\n    *   The **red line** shows a strong peak every year around late January or early February.\n    *   The **yellow line** has two major recurring peaks: one in early June (with a particularly large spike in 2023) and another in October.\n    *   The **blue line** shows smaller peaks in early June, coinciding with the yellow line's peak, and also in April.\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I will search for a country that has three major, distinct, and nationally significant events whose anniversaries align with these timeframes.\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis:** The combination of a major event in late Jan/early Feb (Lunar New Year), a highly sensitive political anniversary in early June (Tiananmen Square), and another major national celebration in October (National Day) strongly points towards one country.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By matching the event dates to the graph's peaks, I will identify the country.\n\nI will use a Python script to print this step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the recurring peaks in the provided Google Trends graph.\")\n    print(\"The graph shows search interest for three topics from Dec 2019 to mid-2023.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the timing of the annual peaks for each line.\")\n    print(\" - Red Line: Shows a prominent peak every year in late January or early February.\")\n    print(\" - Yellow Line: Has significant peaks in early June and again in October of each year.
