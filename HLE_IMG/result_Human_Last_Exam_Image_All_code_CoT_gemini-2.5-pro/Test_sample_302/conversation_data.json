    "The characters on the seal are in an ancient Chinese script style known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū). Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n\nHere is a step-by-step identification of the characters:\n\n1.  **Right Column, Top Character:** This character is 壽 (shòu), which means \"longevity\". Its simplified form is **寿**.\n2.  **Right Column, Bottom Character:** This character is 康 (kāng), which means \"health\". It is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n3.  **Left Column, Top Character:** This character is 年 (nián), which means \"year\". It is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n4.  **Left Column, Bottom Character:** This character is 豐 (fēng), which means \"abundant\" or \"bountiful harvest\". Its simplified form is **丰**.\n\nPutting them together in the correct order (top-to-bottom, right-to-left), the phrase is 壽康年豐. In simplified Chinese, this is **寿康年丰** (shòu kāng nián fēng), which is an auspicious idiom wishing someone longevity, health, and a year of abundance.\n\nThe following Python code will print the characters in simplified Chinese.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the simplified Chinese characters on the seal.\n  The characters are read from top to bottom, right to left.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The characters in traditional script are 壽康年豐.\n  # Converted to simplified Chinese, they are 寿康年丰.\n  character_1 = \"寿\"  # simplified of 壽 (shòu - longevity)\n  character_2 = \"康\"  # 康 (kāng - health)\n  character_3 = \"年\"  # 年 (nián - year)\n  character_4 = \"丰\"  # simplified of 豐 (fēng - abundant)\n\n  # The phrase is read right column (top to bottom), then left column (top to bottom).\n  final_phrase = f\"{character_1}{character_2}{character_3}{character_4}\"\n\n  print(f\"The simplified Chinese characters on the seal read: {final_phrase}\")\n  # The final output is an auspicious phrase meaning \"longevity, health, and a year of abundance\".\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<寿康年丰>>>"
