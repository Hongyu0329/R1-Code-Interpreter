    # Plot 4: S(t) vs. q_l (Quarantine Length). The prominent "shelf" in the
    # curve is a unique signature of the quarantine period ending at different times
    # for each of the three simulations. This is the most distinct feature among all plots.
    p4 = param_map["q_l"]

    # Plots 5 & 7: Cost plots. These plots show curves that are scaled versions
    # of each other, which is characteristic of varying a cost parameter (c_h or c_l)
    # that only affects its own cumulative total.
    # Plot 5 is a smooth S-curve, consistent with C_h (integral of H(t)).
    # Plot 7 has a longer tail, consistent with C_l (integral of D' + I_n + I_s).

    # Plot 1: S(t) vs. q_s (Quarantine Start). Varying the start time of the
    # quarantine has a massive effect on the final size of the epidemic. A late
    # start allows for uncontrolled spread, leading to the huge separation between
    # the curves seen in the plot.
    p1 = param_map["q_s"]
    
    # Plot 9: D(t) vs. f_s (Fraction Severe). This S-shaped plot shows a cumulative
    # variable. The parameter being varied has a strong effect. Varying f_s directly
    # alters the flow into the more lethal severe pathway (I_s), thus having a
    # major impact on the total number of deaths (D).

    # incubation period directly changes the fundamental speed of the epidemic's growth,
    # matching the observed strong effect.

    # Plot 3: S(t) vs. q_f (Quarantine Effectiveness). This plot shows a noticeable
    # kink. This is caused by varying the contact rate specifically during the
    # quarantine period, which starts at day 60.

    # Plot 6: S(t) vs. mu_s (Severe Mortality). This plot shows a moderate effect.
    # The mortality rate for severe cases (mu_s) is nominally high, so varying it
    # has a significant, though not dominant, effect on the overall epidemic size by
    # removing infectious individuals.
    p6 = param_map["mu_s"]
    
    # Plot 8: S(t) vs. beta_h (Hospitalized Contact Rate). This plot shows a weak
    # effect with a gentle kink. The contact rate from hospitalized patients is a
    # secondary transmission path, so its overall impact is small. The effect tracks
    # the rise and fall of the hospitalized population (H), creating the smooth kink.
