    Analyzes the provided tectonic plate map to determine the most likely location for the longest and tallest mountain range.

    Thinking Steps:
    1.  Principle of Mountain Formation: The tallest and longest mountain ranges (like the Himalayas) are formed at convergent plate boundaries, where two continental plates collide.
    2.  Map Symbol Interpretation:
        - Red lines with arrows pointing towards each other represent convergent boundaries (mountain building zones).
        - Blue lines with arrows pointing away represent divergent boundaries (rifts/ridges).
        - Green lines with parallel arrows represent transform boundaries (fault lines).
    3.  Objective: Find the longest continuous red line among the given answer choices.
    4.  Evaluation of Choices:
        - A. Kihei & South Avalonia: Convergent (red line). A potential candidate.
        - B. South Avalonia & South Kesh: Primarily transform (green) and divergent (blue). Incorrect.
        - C. North Tethys & South Tethys: Divergent (blue). Incorrect.
        - D. South Kesh & Eurybian: Convergent (red), but relatively short.
        - E. Brigantic & Boreal: Divergent (blue). Incorrect.
        - F. Central Iapetus & Artemian: Convergent (red), but shorter than other candidates.
        - G. Artemian & Eurybian: Mix of divergent (blue) and transform (green). Incorrect.
        - H. Goidelic & Central Iapetus: Divergent (blue). Incorrect.
        - I. North Tethys & Brigantic: Convergent (red). Visually appears to be the longest and most continuous convergent boundary among the choices.
    5.  Conclusion: The boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate is the longest convergent boundary offered, making it the most likely site for the longest and tallest mountain range.

1.  **Identify Mountain-Building Zones:** The tallest and longest mountain ranges form at convergent plate boundaries, where plates collide. On the map, these are represented by red lines with arrows pointing towards each other.

2.  **Eliminate Other Boundary Types:** We can immediately eliminate choices that describe divergent boundaries (blue lines, plates moving apart) or transform boundaries (green lines, plates sliding past each other), as these do not form major mountain ranges.
    -   (B) South Avalonia & South Kesh: Mostly transform/divergent.
    -   (C) North Tethys & South Tethys: Divergent.
    -   (E) Brigantic & Boreal: Divergent.
    -   (G) Artemian & Eurybian: Divergent/transform.
    -   (H) Goidelic & Central Iapetus: Divergent.

3.  **Compare Convergent Boundaries:** The remaining choices are all convergent boundaries (red lines):
    -   (A) Kihei Plate and South Avalonia Plate
    -   (D) South Kesh Plate and Eurybian Plate
    -   (F) Central Iapetus Plate and Artemian Plate
    -   (I) North Tethys Plate and Brigantic Plate

4.  **Select the Longest Range:** The question asks for the *longest* range of the tallest mountains. By visually comparing the lengths of the red lines for options A, D, F, and I, the boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate (I) is the most extensive and continuous convergent boundary shown among the choices.

Therefore, this location is the most likely to have the longest and tallest mountain range.
