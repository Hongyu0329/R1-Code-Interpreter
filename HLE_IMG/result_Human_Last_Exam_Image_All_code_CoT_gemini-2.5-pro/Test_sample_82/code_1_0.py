  # In the intramolecular Heck reaction shown:
  # 1. Pd(0) inserts into the C9-Br bond.
  # 2. The vinyl-Pd complex adds across the C4=C5 double bond. The new C-C bond forms between C5 and C9. The Pd atom attaches to C4.
  # 3. Beta-hydride elimination occurs. A hydrogen from the adjacent carbon C3 is eliminated along with the Pd from C4.
  # 4. This forms a new double bond between C3 and C4.
