# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem.
# The propagation constant 'mu' is derived from the given logarithmic derivative.
mu_numerator = 17
mu_denominator = 324
mu = mu_numerator / mu_denominator

# Step 2: Explain the core logic.
# Based on the physics of soliton stability, the coefficient of the |Phi|^16 term in the NLSE must be zero.
# This leads to v1 = v2, which simplifies the NLSE.
# The equation for the maximum amplitude of the flat-top soliton, Phi_max, becomes:
# Phi_max^8 = mu

# Step 3: Print the equation for Phi_max with the specific numbers.
print("The key insight is that for a stable flat-top soliton to exist, the higher-order focusing term must vanish.")
print("This simplifies the problem and yields the following equation for the maximum amplitude, Phi_max:")
print(f"Phi_max^8 = {mu_numerator} / {mu_denominator}")

# Step 4: Solve for Phi_max.
phi_max = mu**(1/8)

# Step 5: Calculate the final required value, which is 1 - Phi_max.
result = 1 - phi_max

# Step 6: Print the components of the final calculation and the result.
print("\nThe final value is calculated as 1 - Phi_max.")
print(f"The equation for the final answer is: 1 - ({mu_numerator}/{mu_denominator})^(1/8)")
print(f"Calculated value of Phi_max: {phi_max}")
print(f"Final Result (1 - Phi_max): {result}")
