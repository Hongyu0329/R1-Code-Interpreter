    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm:** I will break down the provided sorting algorithm to understand its logic, including the base case and the recursive steps.\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:** I will identify the input that forces the algorithm to perform the maximum amount of work.\n3.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** Based on the worst-case analysis, I will create a recurrence relation `T(n)` that describes the algorithm's runtime for an input of size `n`.\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** I will solve the relation to find a closed-form expression or an asymptotic bound (Big O notation) for `T(n)`.\n5.  **Present the Solution in Python:** I will write a Python script that prints this step-by-step analysis and the final conclusion, as requested.\n\nThis process will lead us to the correct time complexity among the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script is designed to run in a terminal and might not display formatted\n# text correctly in all environments.\n\ndef analyze_algorithm_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a step-by-step analysis of the given algorithm's time complexity\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use a simple check to improve rendering in some environments\n    is_rich_text_supported = sys.stdout.isatty()\n\n    def print_header(title):\n        if is_rich_text_supported:\n            # ANSI escape code for bold text\n            print(f\"\\n\\033[1m{title}\\033[0m\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"\\n### {title} ###\")\n\n    print_header(\"Algorithm Analysis\")\n    print(\"The provided sorting algorithm is defined by the following pseudocode:\")\n    print(\"\"\"\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n\"\"\")\n\n    print_header(\"1.
