# The user wants me to choose the best statement based on the provided biological evidence.
# I will analyze the text and images to determine the most logical conclusion.

# 1. Relationship between D. melanogaster and D. willistoni genes:
# D. melanogaster has one gene (CG14879).
# D. willistoni has two elements (left and right).
# This implies a gene duplication event. One D. willistoni element is the ortholog (retains original function/structure)
# and the other is a paralog (the duplicate).

# 2. Are the two D. willistoni elements one gene or two?
# The text states: "...overall expression is different between the left and right genomic elements... This would be highly unusual for a single gene..."
# Conclusion: They are likely two separate genes.

# 3. Which is the ortholog? We use the principle of parsimony.
# The text states: "These potential CDSs maximize parsimony with D. melanogaster in terms of CDS number..."
# D. melanogaster's CG14879 gene mostly has 2 CDSs.
# The gene predictions for the D. willistoni RIGHT element show isoforms with 2 CDSs (1a+2 or 1b+2).
# This structural similarity (parsimony) makes the RIGHT element the best candidate for the ORTHOLOG.
# Therefore, the LEFT element is the PARALOG.

# 4. Evaluate the options based on this analysis.
# Option P states: "The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely a ortholog of CG14879,
# because of the number of CDSs is more parsimonious between species for the right element. The elements are likely part of separate genes."
# This matches our conclusions perfectly.
# - It correctly identifies the left as the paralog and the right as the ortholog.
# - It provides the correct reason (parsimony of CDS number).
# - It correctly states they are separate genes.

# Final Answer Selection
final_answer = 'P'
print(f"The evidence points to the right element in D. willistoni being the ortholog of CG14879 due to structural parsimony (number of CDSs), and the left element being a paralog. The differential RNA-seq expression strongly suggests they are separate genes.")
print(f"This reasoning directly supports option P.")
