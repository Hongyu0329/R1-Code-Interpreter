    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the characteristic two-dimensional pattern that results from projecting a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice along the [110] direction. We can then compare this theoretical pattern with the four given images to find the match.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure**: An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners (e.g., (0, 0, 0)) and 6 face centers (e.g., (0.5, 0.5, 0)), assuming a cube with side length 1.\n2.  **Define the Projection**: Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector [1, 1, 0]. We can define a new 2D coordinate system on this plane using two perpendicular basis vectors, for instance, `v1 = [1, -1, 0]` and `v2 = [0, 0, 1]`.\n3.  **Calculate Projected Coordinates**: The new 2D coordinates (x', y') of any atom at position (x, y, z) are found by calculating the dot product of its position vector with the basis vectors `v1` and `v2`.\n4.  **Identify the Pattern**: By projecting the key atoms of the FCC lattice, we can identify the resulting 2D repeating pattern. For an FCC lattice viewed along [110], this pattern is a centered rectangle. Atoms form a rectangle, and another atom sits in the center of that rectangle.\n5.  **Compare with Images**: We will then visually compare this centered rectangular pattern with images A, B, C, and D to find the correct one.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the coordinates that form the characteristic pattern and then draws a conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef project_fcc_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the projection of FCC atoms along the [110] direction\n    and identifies the resulting pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define key atom positions in an FCC lattice (unit cell side a=1).\")\n    # Corner atoms and face-center atoms that define the projected pattern\n    # A corner atom at the origin\n    corner_atom_1 = np.array([0, 0, 0])\n    # A corner atom that forms one side of the projected rectangle\n    corner_atom_2 = np.array([1, 0, 0])\n    # A corner atom that forms the other side of the projected rectangle\n    corner_atom_3 = np.array([0, 0, 1])\n    # The fourth corner of the projected rectangle\n    corner_atom_4 = np.array([1, 0, 1])\n    # A face-center atom that projects to the center of the rectangle\n    center_atom = np.array([0.5, 0, 0.5])\n    # Note: We use un-normalized projection vectors for simplicity. The resulting\n    #       pattern shape is what matters. The vector [1,-1,0] has length sqrt(2).\n    #       We will scale the x-coordinates by 1/sqrt(2) for a proper aspect ratio.\n    scaling_factor = 1 / np.sqrt(2)\n\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the projection axes for the [110] view.\")\n    # The new 2D axes are perpendicular to the view direction [1, 1, 0]\n    proj_axis_x = np.array([1, -1, 0])\n    proj_axis_y = np.array([0, 0, 1])\n    print(f\"x' axis is along {proj_axis_x}, y' axis is along {proj_axis_y}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the projected 2D coordinates of these key atoms.\")\n    atoms = {\n        \"Rectangle Corner 1\": corner_atom_1,\n        \"Rectangle Corner 2\": corner_atom_2,\n        \"Rectangle Corner 3\": corner_atom_3,\n        \"Rectangle Corner 4\": corner_atom_4,\n        \"Center Atom\": center_atom\n    }\n    \n    print(\"The projected coordinates (x', y') form a centered rectangle:\")\n    for name, pos_3d in atoms.items():\n        # Project the 3D position onto the 2D plane\n        pos_2d_x = np.dot(pos_3d, proj_axis_x) * scaling_factor\n        pos_2d_y = np.dot(pos_3d, proj_axis_y)\n        print(f\"- {name}: Original 3D position = {pos_3d}\")\n        print(f\"  Projected 2D position (x', y') = ({pos_2d_x:.2f}, {pos_2d_y:.2f})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Analyze the pattern and compare with the given images.\")\n    print(\"The calculated pattern is a 'centered rectangle'.
