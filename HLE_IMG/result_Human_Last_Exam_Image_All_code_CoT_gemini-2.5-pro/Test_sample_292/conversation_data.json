    "Based on the distinctive architectural features in the image, I can identify the location. The image shows the interior of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. The key identifying feature is the unique glass ceiling with a pattern of dots (a ceramic frit pattern) and the underlying space frame structure. This design is well-documented and recognizable.\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city where the picture was taken.\n    The image provided shows the iconic ceiling of the Jacob K.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
