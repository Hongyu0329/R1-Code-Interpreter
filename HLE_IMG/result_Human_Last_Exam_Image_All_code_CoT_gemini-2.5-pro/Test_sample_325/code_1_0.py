def solve_reaction_diffusion_plots():
    """
    Analyzes the reaction-diffusion plots and determines the parameter change for each.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Plot 2 is the baseline (0).
    2.  Plots are categorized as "fast reaction" (1, 4) or "slow reaction" (3, 5, 6) compared to the baseline.
    3.  Slow reaction plots are identified:
        - Plot 3: Very flat profile, fast initial rise of c_A -> Doubled Diffusion (D).
        - Plot 5: Looks like a scaled-down version of baseline -> Halved Rate Constant (k).
        - Plot 6: Remaining slow case -> Doubled Reaction Order (N).
    4.  Fast reaction plots are identified:
        - Plot 1: Most extreme case, c_B crosses c_A -> Halved Reaction Order (n).
        - Plot 4: Fast equilibration, less extreme than #1 -> Doubled Rate Constant (K).
    5.  The final six-character string is assembled from these findings.
