    "This is a virtuosic piano arrangement of a famous piece of video game music. Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify it:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis**: The sheet music is for piano, in 4/4 time, with a key signature of three sharps (A major or F# minor) and a tempo of ♪ = 80. The piece begins with a quiet two-bar introduction before launching into a loud, fast section with continuous eighth notes in the right hand and broken chords in the left. The style is highly reminiscent of a 19th-century concert étude.\n\n2.  **Harmonic and Melodic Progression**: The loud section starting at measure 3 follows a standard I-IV-I-V chord progression in A major (A major -> D major -> A major -> E major). This serves as a buildup.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Main Theme**: The iconic main melody, for which the piece is famous, doesn't start until measure 9. By transcribing the top notes played by the right hand in this measure, we get the following sequence: A - G# - A - B - C# - B - A - G#.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: This melodic phrase is unmistakably the main theme of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", the extra stage boss theme from the video game *Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*. The preceding measures are an introduction created for this specific piano arrangement.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the song.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music from the provided sheet music.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    - The key is A Major (3 sharps).\n    - The time signature is 4/4.\n    - The style is a virtuosic piano arrangement.\n    - The main theme starts at measure 9. The melody (A-G#-A-B-C#-B-A-G#) is a clear match.\n    \n    Conclusion:\n    The piece is a piano arrangement of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\" from the game \"Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    song_title = \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\"\n    source_game = \"Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\"\n    \n    print(f\"The music is an arrangement of: {song_title}\")\n    print(f\"It is the extra stage boss theme from the game: {source_game}\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<U.N.
