--- Optimization Results ---
Objective: Minimize reactive power injection Q_opt to restore voltage to 1.00 p.u.

--- Calculated Reactive Power ---
The minimum reactive power required from the MMCC STATCOM is:
Q_opt = 2.8071 p.u.
Q_opt = 280.71 MVAR
(Note: This required power exceeds the STATCOM's maximum capacity of 50 MVAR.)

--- Calculated System Losses ---
Note: Loss calculation requires a simplifying assumption of no external load, which contradicts the initial voltage sag value.
The fundamental real power loss in the transmission line is:
P_loss_fund = 1.3674 p.u. = 136.74 MW
Considering a 4% increase due to harmonics, the total system real power loss is:
P_loss_total = P_loss_fund * 1.04 = 1.4221 p.u. = 142.21 MW

--- Final Equations with numbers ---
Q_opt = ((1.0^2 - 0.85*cos(0.1714))*9.6154 + (0.85*sin(0.1714))*8.5897) * 100 MVA = 280.71 MVAR
P_loss_total = |(1.00 - (0.6432 + -0.7657j)) / (0.02 + 0.10j)|^2 * 0.
