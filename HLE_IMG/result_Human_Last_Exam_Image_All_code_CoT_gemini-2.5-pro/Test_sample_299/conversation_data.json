    "This is a classic and beautiful chess puzzle. To find the mate in two, we need to make a \"quiet\" move that puts Black in a state of zugzwang, where any move they make leads to an unavoidable checkmate. The key to this puzzle lies in creating pins against Black's pawns.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** The Black King at `e4` is heavily restricted. Its potential escape squares `d3`, `e3`, `f3`, `f5`, and `d4` are all covered by White's pieces. However, Black is not in check and has pieces that can move, so it is not a stalemate. The key defenders for Black are the Queen at `d5` and the pawns at `e5` and `f4`, which can capture potential checking pieces.\n\n2.  **Find the key move for White:** The winning move is a subtle Queen retreat: **1. Qd1**. This move seems passive, but it's incredibly powerful. It keeps the `d4` square guarded and sets up three potential pins on Black's defensive pawns.\n\n3.  **Analyze Black's responses and White's mating moves:** After **1. Qd1**, any move Black makes will lead to checkmate.\n\n    *   **Variation A:** If Black captures the Rook on f3 with **1... fxf3**, it creates a discovered pin. The Black pawn on `e5` is now pinned to the King at `e4` by the White Bishop at `g2`. This means the `e5` pawn cannot move. White delivers checkmate with **2. Qd4#**. The King cannot escape, and the checking Queen on `d4` cannot be captured because the `e5` pawn is pinned.\n\n    *   **Variation B:** If Black captures the White Queen with **1... Qxd1**, a different pin comes into play. The Black pawn on `e5` is pinned to the King at `e4` by the White Rook at `h5`. White checkmates with **2. Nf5#**. The King cannot move, and the Knight cannot be captured because the `e5` pawn is pinned.\n\n    *   **Variation C:** If Black makes any other move (for example, moving the Rook or the Queen to a square other than `d1`), a third pin is decisive. The Black pawn on `f4` is now pinned to the King at `e4` by the White Queen on `d1`. White delivers mate with **2. Re3#**. The King has no escape, and the Rook cannot be captured because the `f4` pawn is pinned.\n\nTherefore, the first move is `1. Qd1`, and the second move will be a checkmate depending on Black's forced reply. We will show the first variation as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1_white = \"Qd1\"\n    black_response = \"fxf3\"\n    move2_white_mate = \"Qd4#\"\n    \n    print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 is:\")\n    print(f\"1. {move1_white} {black_response}\")\n    print(f\"2. {move2_white_mate}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<1.
