    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Roman numeral for the chord in measure 30:\n\n1.  **Identify the Local Key:** First, we need to establish the key of the musical passage. The key signature in this section is two flats (B♭ and E♭). The harmony in the measures immediately preceding measure 30 (measures 27-29) strongly suggests the key of G minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** Next, we identify all the notes being played in the first beat of measure 30.\n    *   In the right hand (treble clef), the notes are F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n    *   In the left hand (bass clef), the note is D.\n    *   Combining these, the chord consists of the notes: D, F♯, A, C, E♭.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord Structure:** We then arrange these notes to determine the root and quality of the chord. Stacking them in thirds starting from D reveals the structure:\n    *   **D**: Root\n    *   **F♯**: Major Third\n    *   **A**: Perfect Fifth\n    *   **C**: Minor Seventh\n    *   **E♭**: Minor Ninth\n    This chord is a D dominant seventh chord with an added minor ninth, commonly notated as D7(♭9).\n4.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:** Finally, we determine the chord's function within the key of G minor.\n    *   The root of the chord, D, is the fifth scale degree of G minor. The Roman numeral for a chord built on the fifth degree is **V**.\n    *   The chord is a dominant seventh chord (a major triad with a minor seventh), which is the standard quality for a V chord in a minor key (using the raised leading tone, F♯).\n    *   The chord includes a minor ninth (the E♭). This is represented by adding \"♭9\" to the Roman numeral.\n    *   Since the lowest note is D (the root), the chord is in root position.\n\nTherefore, the complete Roman numeral for this chord is V♭9. The following Python code prints this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a step-by-step analysis to find the Roman numeral for the chord\n    in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Analysis Data ---\n    piece = \"Beethoven's 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st Mvt.\"\n    measure = 30\n    local_key = \"G minor\"\n    notes_in_chord = [\"D\", \"F#\", \"A\", \"C\", \"Eb\"]\n    chord_root = \"D\"\n    chord_quality = \"Dominant 7th with a minor 9th\"\n    chord_name = \"D7(b9)\"\n    scale_degree = 5\n    roman_numeral = \"Vb9\"\n\n    # --- Print Analysis ---\n    print(f\"Analysis of the chord in measure {measure} of {piece}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Key Context\n    print(f\"1.
