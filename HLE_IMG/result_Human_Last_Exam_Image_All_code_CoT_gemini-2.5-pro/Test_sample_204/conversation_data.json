    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Identify Each Specimen:** I will visually analyze each of the four specimens (A, B, C, D) to identify the mineral based on its physical properties like crystal habit, color, and luster.\n    *   **Specimen C** is a granular mass of green crystals, characteristic of **Olivine**.\n    *   **Specimen A** is a dark, short, stout prismatic crystal, characteristic of a **Pyroxene** (like Augite).\n    *   **Specimen B** is a flaky, layered specimen with a pearly luster, characteristic of a **Mica** (a sheet silicate).\n    *   **Specimen D** is a translucent, glassy, six-sided prism, characteristic of **Quartz**.\n\n2.  **Classify by Silicate Structure:** Each identified mineral belongs to a specific silicate group, which is defined by how the silica tetrahedra (the basic building blocks) are linked together.\n    *   **Olivine (C)** is a **Nesosilicate**, where the silica tetrahedra are isolated. This is the simplest structure.\n    *   **Pyroxene (A)** is a single-chain **Inosilicate**, where tetrahedra link to form long single chains.\n    *   **Mica (B)** is a **Phyllosilicate**, where tetrahedra link to form extensive two-dimensional sheets.\n    *   **Quartz (D)** is a **Tectosilicate** (or framework silicate), where every tetrahedron is linked to four others, forming a complex three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex structure.\n\n3.  **Order by Complexity:** Based on the classification, I will order the specimens from the simplest silicate structure (isolated tetrahedra) to the most complex (framework).\n    *   1st (Simplest): Nesosilicate -> **C (Olivine)**\n    *   2nd: Inosilicate -> **A (Pyroxene)**\n    *   3rd: Phyllosilicate -> **B (Mica)**\n    *   4th (Most Complex): Tectosilicate -> **D (Quartz)**\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically stores this information, sorts the minerals by their structural complexity, and prints the final ordered sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define each specimen with its identification, silicate group, and a complexity score.\n    # The complexity score is based on the degree of polymerization of silica tetrahedra:\n    # 1: Nesosilicate (isolated)\n    # 2: Inosilicate (chain)\n    # 3: Phyllosilicate (sheet)\n    # 4: Tectosilicate (framework)\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'group': 'Nesosilicate', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'group': 'Inosilicate (single chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'group': 'Phyllosilicate (sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'group': 'Tectosilicate (framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the specimens based on their assigned complexity score.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 4: Print the identification of each specimen and the final ordered list.\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Silicate Group:\")\n    # Create a correctly ordered dictionary for printing identifications\n    id_dict = {item['label']: item for item in specimens}\n    for label in sorted(id_dict.keys()):\n        item = id_dict[label]\n        print(f\"Specimen {item['label']}: {item['mineral']} ({item['group']})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    \n    # Build the descriptive output string\n    order_description = []\n    for specimen in sorted_specimens:\n        order_description.append(f\"{specimen['label']} ({specimen['mineral']})\")\n    \n    print(\" -> \".join(order_description))\n\n    # Extract the final ordered labels\n    final_order_labels = [specimen['label'] for specimen in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer (the ordered sequence):\")\n    print(\", \".join(final_order_labels))\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
