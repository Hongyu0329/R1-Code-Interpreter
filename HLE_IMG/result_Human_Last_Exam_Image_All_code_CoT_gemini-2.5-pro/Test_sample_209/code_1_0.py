    This function identifies the correct giraffe based on visual pattern matching.

    1.  **Analyze Target Pattern:** The target giraffe's coat has a unique pattern of spots. Key features are the shape, size, and arrangement of spots on the torso and shoulder.
    2.  **Compare Patterns:** Each option (A-F) is compared to the target.
        *   A, C, D, and F are eliminated due to clear differences in spot color, shape, or pattern.
        *   B is similar, but E is an exact match.
    3.  **Identify Match:** The pattern of spots on giraffe E perfectly aligns with the target giraffe's pattern.
    4.  **Conclusion:** The correct image is E.
