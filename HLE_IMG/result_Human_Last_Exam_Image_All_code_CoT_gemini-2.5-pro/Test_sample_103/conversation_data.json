    "This is a complex chess position where White has a strong attack but must also be mindful of Black's threats, particularly from the queen on h4. Let's analyze the best move for White step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analyze the position**\n*   **White's advantages:** White's knight on f7 is a powerful attacking piece, putting the black king under direct pressure. The white queen on d5 also controls key squares and targets black's pieces, especially the rook on d8.\n*   **Black's advantages:** Black's queen on h4 creates serious counter-threats against the white king, particularly on the h-file and the back rank. The black bishop on e4 is a strong piece, controlling important diagonals and restricting white's queen.\n*   **Goal:** White needs to find a forcing sequence of moves that capitalizes on the attack against the black king while neutralizing black's counterplay.\n\n**2. Evaluate the candidate moves**\n\nLet's look at the most forcing moves available to White: checks and captures.\n\n*   **Checks:** `Ne5+`, `Nd6+`, `Nh6+`, `Nxd8+`\n*   **Captures:** `Qxe4`, `Qxd8`\n\nLet's break down the most promising options:\n\n*   **J. Nxd8+:** This move wins the exchange (a rook for a knight). 1. Nxd8+ Rxd8. While White is now ahead in material, Black's queen and bishop remain very active and pose a significant threat to the white king (e.g., with ...Qh1+). This leads to a complicated position where Black has dangerous compensation.\n\n*   **G. Ne5+:** This is a very strong move. 1. Ne5+. Black cannot play 1...Kf8? because of 2. Qxd8#. Black is forced to play either 1...Kg7 or 1...Kh8.\n    *   If 1...Kg7, White can continue the attack with 2. Qe6!, threatening the rook on f8 and setting up mating ideas. This is a powerful continuation.\n    *   This move is a top contender.\n\n*   **C. Qxe4:** This is arguably the most decisive move. It eliminates Black's key bishop on e4, which is crucial for both defense and counter-attack. Let's see Black's responses:\n    *   If Black plays 1...Rxf7 (taking the knight), White delivers a quick mate: 2. Qxe8+ Rf8 3. Qxf8#.\n    *   If Black tries to create counterplay with 1...Qh1+, White simply moves the king: 2. Kg2. Black has no effective follow-up, and White's threats are overwhelming. For example, after 2...Kg7, White can play 3. Qxd8, and Black's position collapses. After 3...Rxd8, White plays 4. Ne5+, forking the king and rook on f8, leading to a massive material advantage.\n    *   Because `Qxe4` removes a key piece and leads to a forced win in all major variations, it is the best move. It is clean, decisive, and simplifies the position into a winning one for White.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile several moves like `Ne5+` and `Nxd8+` are good, `Qxe4` is the most powerful and direct path to victory. It systematically dismantles Black's position and neutralizes all counterplay.\n\n```python\nimport chess\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and determines the best move for white.\n    \"\"\"\n    # FEN for the position: r2r1k2/p1p2pNp/8/3Q4/4b2q/2P5/P1P3PP/R6K w - - 0 1\n    # Note: The knight on f7 is forking the king and the rook on d8.\n    # The question is about the best move for White.\n\n    # Let's analyze the move Qxe4\n    move = \"Qxe4\"\n    piece = \"Queen\"\n    start_square = \"d5\"\n    capture_symbol = \"x\"\n    target_square = \"e4\"\n    target_piece = \"bishop\"\n\n    print(f\"The best move for White is {move}.\")\n    print(\"This move is strategically decisive for several reasons:\")\n    print(\"1.
