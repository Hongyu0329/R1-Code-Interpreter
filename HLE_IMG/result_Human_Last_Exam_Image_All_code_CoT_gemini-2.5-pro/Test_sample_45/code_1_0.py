# The user wants to find the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.

# 1. We analyze the image to find points of rotational symmetry.
# 2. A prominent feature is the star-like pattern with a dark blue polygon at the center.
# 3. We count the sides of this central polygon. It has 7 sides, making it a heptagon.
# 4. The arrangement of tiles around this central heptagon is also 7-fold symmetric.
# 5. Rotating the pattern by 360/7 degrees around the center of the heptagon leaves the tiling unchanged.
# 6. Therefore, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.

# The order of the rotational symmetry is n.
n = 7

# Print the result.
print(f"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is {n}-fold.")
print(f"This is because the pattern looks the same after being rotated by 360 / {n} degrees.")
