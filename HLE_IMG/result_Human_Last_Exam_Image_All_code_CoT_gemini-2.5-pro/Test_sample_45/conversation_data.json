    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which we can rotate the pattern so that it appears unchanged. The order of rotational symmetry, 'n', is the number of times the pattern matches itself during a full 360-degree rotation.\n\n1.  **Identify a center of rotation:** Let's focus on the center of one of the prominent star-like figures. These figures have a dark blue polygon at their core.\n2.  **Count the sides/points:** By counting the sides of the central dark blue polygon, we find it is a heptagon (a 7-sided polygon). This heptagon is surrounded by 7 light-yellow pentagons and 7 light-yellow squares.\n3.  **Test the rotation:** If we rotate the entire pattern around the center of this blue heptagon, we can see that the pattern will perfectly align with its original position 7 times in a full 360-degree turn. Each rotation would be by an angle of 360 / 7 degrees.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of these 7-fold symmetric motifs means the tiling has 7-fold rotational symmetry. While there are other points with lower-order symmetry (e.g., 4-fold symmetry at the center of the yellow squares), the highest order of rotational symmetry present is 7.\n\nThe following Python code will print the order of the rotational symmetry.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n\n# 1. We analyze the image to find points of rotational symmetry.\n# 2. A prominent feature is the star-like pattern with a dark blue polygon at the center.\n# 3. We count the sides of this central polygon. It has 7 sides, making it a heptagon.\n# 4. The arrangement of tiles around this central heptagon is also 7-fold symmetric.\n# 5. Rotating the pattern by 360/7 degrees around the center of the heptagon leaves the tiling unchanged.\n# 6. Therefore, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n# The order of the rotational symmetry is n.\nn = 7\n\n# Print the result.\nprint(f\"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is {n}-fold.\")\nprint(f\"This is because the pattern looks the same after being rotated by 360 / {n} degrees.\")\n```\n<<<7>>>"
