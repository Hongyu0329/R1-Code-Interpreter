    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** First, I will determine the molecular formula of the initial reactant by counting the atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen) in its chemical structure. The structure consists of a bicyclic core, a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Deprotection):** The reaction with CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate) is a standard method for removing the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This process cleaves the PMB group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the molecular formula to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation):** The reaction with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) is a catalytic hydrogenation, which will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond in the ring to a single bond. This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. I will update the formula to get that of Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis):** The final step involves heating with strong acid (4 N HCl). This condition hydrolyzes the lactam (a cyclic amide) in the structure. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O) to open the ring, forming an amino acid. I will add the atoms of water to the formula of Intermediate 2 to find the final product's molecular formula.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically performs these calculations. The script will start with the initial formula, apply the changes for each reaction step, and finally, print the resulting molecular formula of the final product.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Core (C6H5NO) + CF3 (CF3) + PMB (C8H9O)\n    # C: 6 + 1 + 8 = 15\n    # H: 5 (from core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n    # F: 3\n    # N: 1\n    # O: 1 (from core) + 1 (from PMB) = 2\n    # Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n    formula = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    \n    # Step 2: First reaction - Deprotection of PMB group with CAN.\n    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    # Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1\n    formula['C'] -= 8\n    formula['H'] -= 9\n    formula['O'] -= 1\n    formula['H'] += 1\n    # Formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n\n    # Step 3: Second reaction - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2.\n    # The C=C double bond is reduced, which adds two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    # Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n\n    # Step 4: Third reaction - Lactam hydrolysis with 4 N HCl.\n    # The lactam ring is opened by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    formula['O'] += 1\n    # Final Product Formula: C7H10F3NO2\n\n    # Step 5: Format and print the final molecular formula.\n    # The convention is C, H, then other elements in alphabetical order.\n    elements_order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n    final_formula_str = \"\"\n    print(\"The final product has the following elemental composition:\")\n    \n    for elem in elements_order:\n        count = formula.get(elem, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            print(f\"{elem}: {count}\")\n            final_formula_str += elem\n            # As requested, explicitly output each number in the formula.\n            final_formula_str += str(count)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is:\")\n    print(final_formula_str)\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
