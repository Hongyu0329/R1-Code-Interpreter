# Step 1: Define the known data points
# n = number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain
n_values = np.array([1, 2, 3])
# distance = distance between adjacent polymer chains in Angstroms
distance_values = np.array([12.4, 12.6, 13.2])

# Step 2: Perform linear regression to find the best-fit line (distance = m*n + c)
# np.polyfit returns the coefficients [m, c] for a 1st degree polynomial
m, c = np.polyfit(n_values, distance_values, 1)

# Step 3: Define the target ligand
# Ligand 8 is R = n-octyl, which has 8 carbon atoms
n_target = 8

# Step 4: Predict the distance for the target ligand using the linear model
predicted_distance = m * n_target + c

# Step 5: Output the results, including the final equation with numbers
