    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total weighted Car VMT for the Baseline scenario (Table 1).**\n    *   For each distance category, we'll calculate a VMT component by multiplying three values: the 'share of total trips' for that category, the total car mode share for that category ('car, 1 occupant' + 'car, with more than 2 occupants'), and the 'average trip distance'.\n    *   We will sum the VMT components from all four distance categories to get the total Baseline VMT.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total weighted Car VMT for the Proposed scenario (Table 2).**\n    *   We will use the same method as in step 1, but with the mode share values from Table 2.\n\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.**\n    *   The reduction is calculated using the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Data from the tables ---\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\naverage_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\ndistance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n# Baseline car mode shares (Table 1)\ncar_1_occupant_baseline = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\ncar_pool_baseline = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# Proposed car mode shares (Table 2)\ncar_1_occupant_proposed = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\ncar_pool_proposed = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# --- Calculation for Baseline VMT ---\nvmt_baseline = 0\nvmt_baseline_components = []\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)\")\nprint(\"Formula per category: (Share of Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Avg.
