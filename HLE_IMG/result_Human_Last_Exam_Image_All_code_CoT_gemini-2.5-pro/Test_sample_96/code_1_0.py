# Step 1: Define the circle and calculate its total area.
# The circle's equation is x^2 + y^2 = 4, which means the radius r is 2.
r = 2
area_circle = math.pi * r**2
print(f"The circle has radius r = {r}.")
print(f"The total area of the circle is pi * r^2 = 4 * pi.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Calculate the area of region R that lies inside the circle.
# This area can be split into the part in Quadrant 2 (Q2) and the part in Quadrant 4 (Q4).

# Part A: Calculate the area of R inside the circle in Q2 (x from -2 to 0).
# The boundary is y = floor(2-x) - 1.
# - For x in (-1, 0], y=1. This creates a 1x1 square, which is fully inside the circle.
area_R_Q2_part1 = 1.0
# - For x in (-2, -1], y=2. The region is a rectangle bounded by x=-2, x=-1, y=0, y=2.
#   The part inside the circle is under the arc y=sqrt(4-x^2) from x=-2 to x=-1.
#   This area can be calculated geometrically as a sector area minus a triangle area.
#   Area = (Area of sector with angle pi/3) - (Area of triangle with base 1, height sqrt(3))
#        = (1/2 * r^2 * pi/3) - (1/2 * 1 * sqrt(3))
#        = (1/2 * 4 * pi/3) - sqrt(3)/2 = 2*pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2
area_R_Q2_part2 = (2 * math.pi / 3) - (math.sqrt(3) / 2)
total_area_R_Q2 = area_R_Q2_part1 + area_R_Q2_part2

# Part B: Calculate the area of R inside the circle in Q4 (x from 1 to 2).
# The boundary is y = floor(2-x) - 1.
# - For x in (1, 2], y=-1. The region is a rectangle bounded by x=1, x=2, y=-1, y=0.
#   The part inside the circle is split at x=sqrt(3) (where the circle intersects y=-1).
#   - From x=1 to x=sqrt(3), it's a rectangle of area 1 * (sqrt(3)-1).
area_R_Q4_part1 = math.sqrt(3) - 1
#   - From x=sqrt(3) to x=2, it's the area under the arc y=sqrt(4-x^2).
#     This area is a sector minus a triangle.
#     Area = (Area of sector with angle pi/6) - (Area of triangle with base sqrt(3), height 1)
#          = (pi/3) - (sqrt(3)/2)
area_R_Q4_part2 = (math.pi / 3) - (math.sqrt(3) / 2)
total_area_R_Q4 = area_R_Q4_part1 + area_R_Q4_part2

# Step 3: Sum the parts to find the total area of R inside the circle.
# Symbolically, the sum is:
# (1) + (2*pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3) - 1) + (pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2)
# = (1 - 1) + (2*pi/3 + pi/3) + (-sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2)
# = 0 + pi + 0 = pi
total_area_R_inside_circle = total_area_R_Q2 + total_area_R_Q4

print(f"The area of R inside the circle is the sum of its parts.")
print(f"Area in Q2 = {area_R_Q2_part1:.4f} + {area_R_Q2_part2:.4f} = {total_area_R_Q2:.4f}")
print(f"Area in Q4 = {area_R_Q4_part1:.4f} + {area_R_Q4_part2:.4f} = {total_area_R_Q4:.4f}")
print(f"Total area of R inside circle = {total_area_R_Q2:.4f} + {total_area_R_Q4:.4f} = {total_area_R_inside_circle:.4f}")
print(f"The exact area of R inside the circle is pi.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 4: Calculate the final answer.
# Area = Area(Circle) - Area(R inside Circle) = 4*pi - pi = 3*pi
final_area = area_circle - total_area_R_inside_circle
circle_area_coeff = 4
r_inside_circle_coeff = 1
final_area_coeff = 3

print("The final area is the area of the circle minus the area of R inside the circle.")
print(f"The final equation is: {circle_area_coeff} * pi - {r_inside_circle_coeff} * pi = {final_area_coeff} * pi")
print(f"The final area is 3*pi, which is approximately {final_area:.4f}")
