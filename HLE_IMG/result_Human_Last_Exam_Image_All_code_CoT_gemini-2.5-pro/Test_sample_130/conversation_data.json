    "Based on a visual analysis of the emission spectrum provided, the pattern of spectral lines corresponds to the element Helium.\n\nEvery element emits light at specific, characteristic wavelengths when its atoms are excited. This unique pattern acts as a \"fingerprint\" for the element. The image displays several prominent lines across the visible spectrum: a strong red line, a yellow line, a bright green line, a cyan line, and several lines in the blue and violet regions.\n\nBy comparing this pattern to the known emission spectra of various elements, we can identify the substance. The observed lines closely match the established spectral lines of Helium.\n\nThe Python code below will list the prominent spectral lines of Helium in the visible range, which correspond to the lines seen in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the element based on its characteristic spectral lines.\n    The image provided corresponds to the emission spectrum of Helium.\n    This function will print the element's name and its major visible spectral lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    element_name = \"Helium\"\n    \n    # Prominent spectral lines of Helium in the visible spectrum (in nanometers)\n    # These values correspond to the colored lines seen in the image.\n    helium_lines = {\n        \"Red\": 667.8,\n        \"Yellow\": 587.6,\n        \"Green\": 501.6,\n        \"Cyan\": 492.2,\n        \"Blue-Violet\": 447.1,\n        \"Violet\": 402.6\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The element with the spectral lines shown in the image is: {element_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nIts prominent spectral lines in the visible range are:\")\n    \n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # Since there is no equation, we will list each characteristic wavelength.\n    for color, wavelength in helium_lines.items():\n        print(f\"- A {color} line at approximately {wavelength} nm\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
