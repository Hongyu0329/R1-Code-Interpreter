    "My plan is to first visually identify the synchronized bursts in the provided raster plot. A synchronized burst is a vertical column where many neurons fire at nearly the same time. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** By examining the x-axis (Time in seconds), I can estimate the time for each major burst of activity.\n    *   Burst 1: ~2.5 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~9.0 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~17.0 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~25.0 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~36.0 s\n    *   Burst 6: ~48.0 s\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will find the time difference between each consecutive burst.\n    *   IBI 1 = 9.0 - 2.5 = 6.5 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 17.0 - 9.0 = 8.0 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 25.0 - 17.0 = 8.0 s\n    *   IBI 4 = 36.0 - 25.0 = 11.0 s\n    *   IBI 5 = 48.0 - 36.0 = 12.0 s\n\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n\n4.  **Format Output:** The final average will be rounded to two significant figures.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and present the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 1. Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The timestamps are estimated from the center of each vertical band of high activity.\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 9.0, 17.0, 25.0, 36.0, 48.0]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# 2. Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\ninter_burst_intervals = []\nfor i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n    inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n# 3. Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# 4. Print the calculation and the result rounded to two significant figures.\ncalculation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\nprint(f\"Average IBI calculation: ({calculation_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average inter-burst interval: {average_ibi:.2g} s\")\n```\n<<<9.1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
