    "My plan is to identify the jazz standard based on the provided sheet music. I will analyze the key signature, melody, and chord progression to determine the song's title and composer.\n\n1.  **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor. The first chord is an F minor chord (F-), establishing the piece in the key of F minor.\n2.  **Melody:** The first few notes of the melody are C, A, C. This melodic phrase is highly recognizable.\n3.  **Chord Progression:** The chord progression in the first few bars is F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7. This progression features a chromatic descending bassline (F, E, E♭, D♭), which is a hallmark of this particular tune.\n4.  **Identification:** The combination of the key (F minor), the opening melodic phrase (C, A, C), and the characteristic chromatic chord progression strongly identifies the song as the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n5.  **Composer:** The music for \"Yesterdays\" was written by the renowned American composer Jerome Kern.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now generate a Python script to print the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
