# The goal is to move the 2x2 red block to the top-left corner.
# Let's calculate a theoretical minimum number of moves required.

# 1. Calculate the moves needed to clear the destination area.
# The top-left 2x2 area is occupied by two pieces that need to be moved:
# - A 2x1 grey block.
# - A 2x1 beige block.
# In an ideal scenario, each can be moved out of the way in one move.
moves_to_clear_destination = 2

# 2. Calculate the moves needed to move the red block into the cleared area.
# The red block's top-left corner is at (row=2, col=2).
# The destination's top-left corner is at (row=0, col=0).
# The displacement required is 2 steps left and 2 steps up.
# Each step is a separate move.
horizontal_moves_for_red_block = 2
vertical_moves_for_red_block = 2
moves_to_reposition_red_block = horizontal_moves_for_red_block + vertical_moves_for_red_block

# 3. Calculate the total minimum number of moves.
# This is the sum of the moves to clear the space and the moves to reposition the block.
total_moves = moves_to_clear_destination + moves_to_reposition_red_block

print(f"To clear the destination for the red block, we need to move {moves_to_clear_destination} pieces.")
print(f"To move the red block to the destination requires {horizontal_moves_for_red_block} horizontal moves and {vertical_moves_for_red_block} vertical moves, totaling {moves_to_reposition_red_block} moves.")
print(f"The minimum number of moves is the sum of these actions.")
print(f"{moves_to_clear_destination} + {moves_to_reposition_red_block} = {total_moves}")
