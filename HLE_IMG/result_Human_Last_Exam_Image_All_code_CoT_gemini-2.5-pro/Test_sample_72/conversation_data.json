    "Of course, I can help you with this organic chemistry problem. Here is my plan to identify the pericyclic reactions involved:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first step**: The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene. Under photochemical conditions (`hv`), aromatic rings like benzene can undergo valence isomerization. I will identify the specific type of pericyclic reaction that converts hexafluorobenzene into its reactive intermediate. This involves analyzing the number of π-electrons participating in the ring formation.\n2.  **Analyze the second step**: The intermediate formed in the first step reacts with cyclobutene. I will examine the way these two molecules combine to form the final product. This involves identifying the π-systems from each molecule that participate in forming the new ring structure, which will classify the second pericyclic reaction.\n3.  **Construct the code**: I will write a Python script that clearly states the names of the two identified reactions, including the number of electrons involved in each, as per your request.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer:\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The overall transformation proceeds in two sequential steps under photochemical conditions.\n\n    # Step 1: The photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer,\n    # hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This is an electrocyclic ring closure involving 6 π-electrons.\n    reaction1_type = \"electrocyclization\"\n    reaction1_electrons = 6\n\n    # Step 2: The cycloaddition of cyclobutene to the hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate.\n    # This involves a 2 π-electron system from each molecule to form a new four-membered ring.\n    reaction2_type = \"cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_electrons_a = 2\n    reaction2_electrons_b = 2\n\n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\")\n    # Print the name and electron count for each reaction.\n    print(f\"1. A [{reaction1_electrons}π] {reaction1_type}.\")\n    print(f\"2. A [{reaction2_electrons_a}+{reaction2_electrons_b}] {reaction2_type}.\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<A [6π] electrocyclization followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation.
