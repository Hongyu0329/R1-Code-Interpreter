    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the musical content of the image**: I will identify the specific notes and chords being played in the piano roll visualization. This involves mapping the purple bars to the keys on the piano keyboard below.\n2.  **Identify the piano piece**: Based on the sequence of notes and chords (especially the key signature and opening progression), I will identify the famous classical piano piece being shown.\n3.  **Determine the opus number of the identified piece**: I will find the standard opus number associated with that composition.\n4.  **Reconcile with the given answer choices**: I will compare the correct opus number with the provided multiple-choice options. If there is a mismatch, I will investigate other famous pieces in the same key whose opus numbers are listed in the choices to find the most probable intended answer, explaining the discrepancy.\n5.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a Python script that explains this entire process step-by-step and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided piano roll image to identify the associated opus number.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the musical notation in the image.\")\n    print(\"The image displays a piano roll visualization.
