    "This is a two-step pericyclic reaction problem. Let's break it down to find the final products.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening:**\n    *   The first step is a thermal 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the starting cyclobutene derivative. The starting material is **1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobutene**.\n    *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion.\n    *   The C3-C4 sigma bond of the cyclobutene ring breaks, and the π system rearranges to form a conjugated diene. The starting material is chiral at C4, but since it is provided as a racemate (or its chirality is not specified for a single enantiomer), the conrotatory opening will lead to a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers of the resulting diene.\n    *   The diene formed is **(E/Z)-3,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-butadiene** (`CH₂=CH−C(OMe)=C(Me)(OMe)`).\n\n2.  **Diels-Alder Cycloaddition:**\n    *   The second step is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene formed in step 1 and the dienophile, **ethyl acrylate** (`CH₂=CH−CO₂Et`).\n    *   This is a normal-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction, as the diene is electron-rich (due to OMe and Me groups) and the dienophile is electron-poor (due to the CO₂Et group).\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Two main regioisomers are possible, often referred to as \"ortho\" and \"meta\" adducts. While simple electronic analysis might favor one, secondary orbital interactions or steric effects often dictate the outcome. Let's analyze the products to determine the regiochemistry. The products C and G result from an \"ortho-like\" addition where the ester group is at C3 of the final cyclohexene ring.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion. This means the electron-withdrawing group (`−CO₂Et`) on the dienophile is oriented under the π-system of the diene in the transition state. This governs the stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the ester group. In products C and G, the `CO₂Et` group is shown with a wedged bond (up), which represents the endo selectivity.\n    *   **Formation of Two Products:** The starting racemic cyclobutene gives a mixture of E and Z dienes. The Diels-Alder reaction of these two diene isomers with ethyl acrylate will produce two different diastereomeric products. Products **C** and **G** are such a pair of diastereomers; they are epimers at the C6 position (the `C(Me)(OMe)` center), which originates from the diene, and both have the endo configuration at C3.\n\nTherefore, the two products of this reaction sequence are C and G.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify the two products from the given options.\n# Based on the analysis of the reaction sequence (electrocyclic ring opening followed by an endo Diels-Alder),\n# the resulting products are C and G.\nproduct_1 = \"C\"\nproduct_2 = \"G\"\n\nprint(f\"The two products are {product_1} and {product_2}.\")\n```\n<<<C and G>>>"
