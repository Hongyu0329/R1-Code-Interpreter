    "This is a classic organic chemistry reaction sequence involving a mesoionic compound. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the reaction types and the byproduct.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the overall transformation.**\nThe first reactant is a 1,3-oxazolium-5-olate, commonly known as a Münchnone. This type of molecule is a mesoionic compound and is a well-known 1,3-dipole. The second reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which is an electron-deficient alkyne and serves as an excellent dipolarophile. The reaction is heated to 100 °C and results in the formation of a substituted pyrrole.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the first pericyclic reaction.**\nThe reaction between a 1,3-dipole (the Münchnone) and a dipolarophile (DMAD) is a **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition**. This is a [4π+2π] cycloaddition reaction that proceeds in a concerted fashion to form a five-membered ring. In this case, it forms an unstable bicyclic adduct as an intermediate.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the byproduct and the second pericyclic reaction.**\nTo figure out the second step, we can perform an atom balance between the reactants and the final product.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   Münchnone (C₁₀H₉NO₂): Has a methyl (Me), a phenyl (Ph), an N-H, and a C₃O₂ core.\n    *   DMAD (C₆H₆O₄): Has two methoxycarbonyl groups (CO₂Me) attached to an alkyne.\n    *   Total formula of reactants: C₁₆H₁₅NO₆\n*   **Product:**\n    *   Pyrrole (C₁₅H₁₅NO₄): Has a methyl, a phenyl, an N-H, two CO₂Me groups, and a C₄N ring.\n*   **Difference (Byproduct):**\n    *   C: 16 - 15 = 1\n    *   H: 15 - 15 = 0\n    *   N: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   O: 6 - 4 = 2\n    *   The missing atoms correspond to **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**.\n\nThe elimination of CO₂ from the unstable bicyclic intermediate is the second pericyclic reaction. This type of reaction, where a ring fragments to extrude a small stable molecule, is called a **cycloreversion**. More specifically, because two sigma bonds to a single atom (the carbonyl carbon) are broken, it can be classified as a cheletropic elimination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two pericyclic reactions are a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition followed by a cycloreversion (cheletropic elimination), and the stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_details():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the types of pericyclic reactions and the stoichiometric byproduct\n  for the given chemical transformation.\n  \"\"\"\n  reaction_type_1 = \"1,3-dipolar cycloaddition\"\n  reaction_type_2 = \"Cycloreversion\"\n  byproduct = \"CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)\"\n\n  print(\"The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n  print(f\"1. {reaction_type_1}\")\n  print(f\"2. {reaction_type_2}\")\n  print(\"\\nThe stoichiometric byproduct is:\")\n  print(byproduct)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  identify_reaction_details()\n```\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and cycloreversion, and the byproduct is CO2.>>>"
