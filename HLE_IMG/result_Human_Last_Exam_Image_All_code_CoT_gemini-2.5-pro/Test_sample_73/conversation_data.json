    "Of course, I can help with this stereochemistry problem. Here is my plan to determine the configuration of the four stereocenters:\n\n1.  **Identify Stereocenters**: I will identify the four chiral centers in the reaction scheme, which include one in each reactant and two in the product.\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: For each stereocenter, I will list the attached chemical groups and assign their priorities based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n3.  **Determine Configuration**: Using the 3D representation from the image, I will determine the absolute configuration ((R) or (S)) for each center. I will explain the method used for the assignment.\n4.  **Consider Reaction Mechanism**: The reaction is an esterification, which proceeds with retention of configuration at the chiral centers. I will use this principle to confirm the assignments in the product.\n5.  **Output Results**: The Python code below will walk through these steps for each of the four stereocenters and print the resulting configuration for each one.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignment for the four \n    stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the stereocenters from left to right in the reaction scheme.\")\n    \n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant ---\n    print(\"\\n--- 1.
