    "My plan is to solve this riddle by breaking it down into two parts based on the clues provided and then finding a single two-word phrase, \"X Y\", that satisfies both parts.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue and the image:** The first clue is \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will identify the person, event, and context from the image. The image shows NHL player Nikita Kucherov receiving an award in June 2019. On this occasion, he won a \"hat trick\" of three major awards (Hart Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award, Art Ross Trophy). As the league's Most Valuable Player and top scorer, he was unequivocally the \"top\" player of the year. This combination of being a \"top\" player and achieving a \"hat trick\" of awards can be cleverly described as a \"Top Hat\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** The second clue is \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical fact. The manufacturing of felt hats, particularly the classic top hat, traditionally used a process called \"carroting\" which involved mercuric nitrate. This substance was highly toxic and caused neurological damage to the hat makers, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". This mercury-based process has since been abandoned.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the solution:** The phrase \"Top Hat\" is the only one that connects both clues. The image represents a metaphorical \"Top Hat\" (the top player with a hat trick), while the historical clue refers to the literal \"Top Hat\" (the felt hat made with the toxic mercury process).\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the two-word phrase \"X Y\".\n\n    Clue 1 Analysis: The image shows NHL star Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL awards.\n    He was the \"top\" player that season and won a \"hat trick\" of three major awards.\n    This can be metaphorically and punnily described as a \"Top Hat\".\n\n    Clue 2 Analysis: The phrase \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the\n    toxicity of mercury salts\" refers to the historical process of making felt hats.\n    The literal top hat was a type of felt hat made using a toxic mercury process,\n    which is now obsolete.\n\n    Conclusion: The phrase \"Top Hat\" fits both clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    x_y = \"Top Hat\"\n    print(x_y)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Top Hat>>>"
