    """
    This function solves the riddle by identifying the two-word phrase "X Y".

    Clue 1 Analysis: The image shows NHL star Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL awards.
    He was the "top" player that season and won a "hat trick" of three major awards.
    This can be metaphorically and punnily described as a "Top Hat".

    Clue 2 Analysis: The phrase "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the
    toxicity of mercury salts" refers to the historical process of making felt hats.
    The literal top hat was a type of felt hat made using a toxic mercury process,
    which is now obsolete.

    Conclusion: The phrase "Top Hat" fits both clues.
