    # Step 1: Formation of the intermediate
    # Triethyl phosphonoacetate reacts with formaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde) in an aldol-type reaction,
    # followed by dehydration with TsOH to yield the intermediate.
    intermediate = "ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate"

    # Step 2: Tandem Michael addition and intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction
    # The intermediate reacts with 2-mercaptoethanal (from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol) in the presence of Et3N.
    # The thiolate adds to the acrylate (Michael addition), creating a carbanion.
    # This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular HWE reaction with the aldehyde.
    # The cyclization forms a 5-membered ring.

    # Final Product Structure: A 5-membered dihydrothiophene ring with an ethoxycarbonyl group.
    # The ring atoms are -S-CH2-CH=C(COOEt)-CH2-.

    # IUPAC Naming
    # Parent ring: 2,5-dihydrothiophene
    # Numbering: S is 1. Double bond is at C3-C4. Substituent is at C4.
