    "This problem is a riddle that points to a specific poetic form. By carefully analyzing the clues in the prompt and the image, we can deduce the syllable structure of the poem. The form is a **Haiku**, which is defined by a three-line structure with 5, 7, and 5 syllables per line, respectively.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the 5-7-5 structure:\n\n1.  **First Line (5 syllables):** The image contains margin numbers on the left side. These numbers are `2` and `3`. Adding them together gives the syllable count for the first line: `2 + 3 = 5`.\n2.  **Second Line (7 syllables):** The text of the prompt itself contains two numbers. It refers to the image as the \"**third**\" (`3`) line and mentions a \"**four**-line\" (`4`) stanza. Adding these numbers gives the syllable count for the second line: `3 + 4 = 7`.\n3.  **Third Line (5 syllables):** The prompt states that the final poem in the sequence is \"nacreous wavers\". Counting the syllables in these words (`na-cre-ous` has 3, `wa-vers` has 2) gives the syllable count for the third line: `3 + 2 = 5`.\n\nThe code below demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poetic_form_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle to determine the poetic form by combining clues\n    from the prompt and the image to find a 5-7-5 syllable structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The poetic form can be determined by solving a riddle using numbers from the prompt and the image.\")\n    print(\"The target form is a Haiku, which has a 5-7-5 syllable structure.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Deriving the first line's syllable count (5)\n    num_from_image_left_1 = 2\n    num_from_image_left_2 = 3\n    first_line_syllables = num_from_image_left_1 + num_from_image_left_2\n    print(f\"1.
