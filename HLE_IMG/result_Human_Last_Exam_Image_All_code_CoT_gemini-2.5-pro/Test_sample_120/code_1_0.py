    # Part 1: Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics

        "1. From the plots, we compare the relaxation time (<τ>) for ring 1 (blue diamonds) "
        "between the nonmethylated (N1) and methylated (M1) systems. At any given temperature, "
        "the <τ> for ring 1 in M1 is significantly higher than in N1. For example, at 350 K, "
        "<τ> for N1 is ~20 ns while for M1 it is ~150 ns. "
        "This indicates that the addition of the methyl group increases the relaxation time, "
        "making the ring's rotation slower due to steric hindrance."

    # Part 2: Analysis of Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature
    analysis_part2 = (
        "2. The nematic phase is stabilized by the efficient packing and alignment of molecules. "
        "The addition of a bulky lateral methyl group disrupts the rod-like shape of the mesogen. "
        "This steric hindrance interferes with the ability of the molecules to pack closely, "
        "weakening the intermolecular forces that maintain the ordered nematic phase. "
        "Consequently, less thermal energy is required to transition to the disordered isotropic phase, "
        "leading to a lower nematic-isotropic transition temperature."

        "and that the addition of a bulky side group disrupts molecular packing, "
