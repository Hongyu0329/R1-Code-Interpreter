def classify_nanoribbons():
    """
    This function classifies three graphene nanoribbon band structures based on visual analysis
    and concatenates the results.

    The classification logic is as follows:
    - Edge Type (A/Z): Determined by the overall shape of the band structure.
      'A' (Armchair) for V-shaped gaps at k=0.
      'Z' (Zigzag) for characteristic flat edge states near the Fermi level.
    - Width (N): Determined by counting the number of bands above the Fermi level (E=0).
    - Band Property (0/1): Determined by the presence of a band gap at the Fermi level.
      '0' (Metallic) if there is no gap.
      '1' (Semiconducting) if there is a gap.
