    "The image displays several species common to the rocky intertidal zone. To determine whether the location is on the Atlantic or Pacific coast, we need to identify a species that is exclusive to one of these coasts.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo shows acorn barnacles, small dark periwinkles, and two larger, lighter-colored snails.\n2.  **Focus on the most identifiable species:** The most distinct snail, with visible brown spiral bands on a lighter background, is the Common Periwinkle.\n3.  **Determine its scientific name and distribution:** The scientific name for the Common Periwinkle is *Littorina littorea*.\n4.  **Check its range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the coasts of the northeast Atlantic (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now widespread there. However, it is not established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of *Littorina littorea* definitively indicates that the photograph was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species\n  that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The most identifiable species in the image that is exclusive to the\n  # Atlantic coast of North America is the Common Periwinkle.\n  species_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the indicator species is: {species_name}\")\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
