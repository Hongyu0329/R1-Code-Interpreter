Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The most prominent sign is the large, white, woolly gall on the twig. This gall was formed after a gall wasp laid its egg *inside the twig*. The plant tissue then grew around the developing larva to create the gall. Additionally, a small cluster of eggs from another insect can be seen on the underside of one of the leaves.
