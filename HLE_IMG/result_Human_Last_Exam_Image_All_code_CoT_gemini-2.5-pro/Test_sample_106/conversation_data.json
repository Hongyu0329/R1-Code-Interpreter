    "To solve this problem, we need to trace the movement of hydrogen atoms (H) and methyl groups (CH3) during the acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of the starting material. This type of reaction is a classic Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves a cascade of [1,2] shifts of alkyl or hydride groups to form a more stable carbocation, ultimately leading to the final alkene product.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement:\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 is protonated by the acid (HCl) to form a good leaving group (-OH2+). This group departs as a water molecule (H2O), leaving a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial secondary carbocation at C-3 is unstable and undergoes a series of [1,2] shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations. The driving force is the formation of the thermodynamically stable oleanane skeleton.\n\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH3) from the adjacent quaternary C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge moves to C-4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n    *   **Shift 2:** A hydride (H) from C-5 migrates to C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5 (tertiary).\n    *   **Shift 3:** The methyl group from C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10 (tertiary).\n    *   **Shift 4:** A hydride from C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9 (tertiary).\n    *   **Shift 5:** The methyl group from C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (tertiary).\n    *   **Shift 6:** The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14 (tertiary).\n    *   **Shift 7:** A hydride from C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13 (tertiary).\n\n3.  **Elimination:** The final C-13 carbocation is stabilized by the elimination of a proton from an adjacent carbon. To form the tetrasubstituted double bond shown in the product (olean-13(18)-ene skeleton), a proton is lost from C-18.\n\n### Determining the substituents at the labeled positions:\n\nNow, we can determine the substituent (H or CH3) at each labeled position in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** C-4 starts with two methyl groups. One migrates to C-3. C-4 then gains a hydrogen from C-5. Therefore, C-4 ends up with one CH3 group and one H. The labeled substituent at position 1 is the methyl group that did not migrate.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** C-10 starts with a methyl group, which migrates to C-5. It then gains a hydrogen from C-9.\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3 (at C-8):** C-8 starts with a methyl group, which migrates to C-9. It then gains a methyl group from C-14.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4 (at C-14):** The diagram shows labels 4 and 5 on the same carbon, C-14. Let's analyze C-14. It starts with a methyl group, which migrates to C-8. It then gains a hydrogen from C-13. Thus, C-14 ends up with a single hydrogen substituent. Label 4 points to this position.\n    *   **4 = H**\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** The diagram is slightly misleading by showing two distinct substituent labels (4 and 5) on C-14, which ends up with only one substituent (H). This suggests a possible error in the diagram's labeling. However, if we evaluate the other key positions that have been altered, such as C-9 (which gained a methyl group from C-8), we find a new methyl group. It is plausible that label 5 is intended to point to one of the newly positioned methyl groups, for example, the one at C-9. In this interpretation, the substituent would be a methyl group. Let's assign this based on the likely intent to query the fate of the migrating groups.\n    *   **5 = CH3**\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions after the rearrangement.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"H\",\n        5: \"CH3\"  # Based on interpretation of a likely misplaced label, pointing to another rearranged methyl group.\n    }\n\n    print(\"The substituents at the numbered positions are:\")\n    for position, substituent in substituents.items():\n        print(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
