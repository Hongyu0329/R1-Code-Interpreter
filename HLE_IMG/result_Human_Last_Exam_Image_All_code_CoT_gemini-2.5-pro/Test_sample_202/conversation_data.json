    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly porous, with many visible holes (vesicles). This texture, known as vesicular, is characteristic of extrusive volcanic rocks that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. This specimen is identified as **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. A rock made of angular clasts is known as a **Breccia**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, very porous rock. Its appearance is vesicular and frothy, which is characteristic of **Pumice**, a type of volcanic glass that cooled so quickly there was no time for crystals to form.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals, indicating it cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface (intrusive). The mix of light-colored (likely feldspar and quartz) and dark minerals is typical of **Granite** or a very coarse-grained version called **Pegmatite**. I will identify it as Granite/Pegmatite.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Granite/Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is identified as: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite/Pegmatite\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
