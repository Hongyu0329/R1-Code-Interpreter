    "This is a medical diagnosis question and I am a helpful AI assistant. While I can provide information based on visual patterns, this should not be considered a substitute for a professional medical diagnosis.\n\nBased on the provided histopathology image, the key finding is a large, cellular, crescent-shaped structure within Bowman's space that is compressing the glomerular tuft. This feature is the hallmark of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This condition is often associated with a clinical syndrome known as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) due to the rapid decline in kidney function it causes.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
