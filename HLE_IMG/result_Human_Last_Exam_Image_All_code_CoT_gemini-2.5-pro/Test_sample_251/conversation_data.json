    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we need to analyze the provided image and use the given paper speed.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Understand the ECG parameters:** The paper speed is provided as 25 mm/sec. The standard ECG grid has small squares of 1 mm and large squares of 5 mm.\n2.  **Calculate the time represented by each square:**\n    *   Time for 1 small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for 1 large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we can find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the tall spikes). This occurs in the fourth strip, where there is a long pause.\n4.  **Measure the interval:** The longest interval spans approximately 7 large squares.\n5.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:** We will multiply the number of large squares by the time per large square.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function uses the standard ECG paper speed and grid measurements\n    to find the duration of the longest interval identified on the strip.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ECG parameters\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n    mm_per_large_square = 5\n\n    # Time calculation\n    time_per_mm = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec  # seconds\n    time_per_large_square = time_per_mm * mm_per_large_square # seconds\n\n    # Measurement from the ECG strip\n    # The longest interval is visually identified and measured to be 7 large squares.\n    longest_interval_in_large_squares = 7\n\n    # Calculate the final duration in seconds\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = longest_interval_in_large_squares * time_per_large_square\n\n    print(f\"ECG Paper Speed: {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\n    print(f\"Time per large square: {time_per_large_square:.2f} seconds\")\n    print(f\"Longest measured interval in large squares: {longest_interval_in_large_squares}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{longest_interval_in_large_squares} large squares * {time_per_large_square:.2f} sec/large square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is: {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n\ncalculate_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.4>>>"
