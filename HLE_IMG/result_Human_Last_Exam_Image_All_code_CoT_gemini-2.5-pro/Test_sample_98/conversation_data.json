    "This artifact is the Tarsus Medallion, a large silver medallion from the Hellenistic period. It is most commonly identified as depicting the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes (reigned 175â€“164 B.C.) and his wife Laodice IV.\n\nTo determine the century, we can use the dates of Antiochus IV's reign. The years 175 B.C. and 164 B.C. both fall within the 2nd century B.C.\n\nI will write a Python script to formally calculate the century from the year 175 B.C. The formula for finding the century for a year 'Y' in B.C. is `floor((Y - 1) / 100) + 1`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Tarsus Medallion is widely dated to the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes,\n# which began in 175 B.C. We will use this year to calculate the century.\nyear_bc = 175\n\n# The formula to calculate the century for a B.C. year is: floor((year - 1) / 100) + 1\n# Let's show the calculation with all the numbers.\nterm1 = year_bc\nterm2 = 1\nterm3 = 100\nterm4 = 1\n\ncentury = math.floor((term1 - term2) / term3) + term4\n\nprint(f\"To find the century for the year {year_bc} B.C., we use the formula: floor(({term1} - {term2}) / {term3}) + {term4}\")\nprint(f\"The calculation resolves to: floor(({term1 - term2}) / {term3}) + {term4}\")\nprint(f\"Which simplifies to: floor({(term1 - term2) / term3}) + {term4}\")\nprint(f\"This gives us: {math.floor((term1 - term2) / term3)} + {term4}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting in the century: {century}\")\n\n# Output the final answer in a readable format.\n# For the number 2, the ordinal suffix is 'nd'.\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the {century}nd century B.C.\")\n```\n<<<2nd century B.C.>>>"
