    "My plan is to analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product step-by-step. This reaction involves changes in the carbon skeleton, specifically the sizes of the rings, which is characteristic of pericyclic reactions.\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** I will examine the starting material, which contains a four-membered ring (cyclobutene) fused to an eight-membered ring. The first logical step in a thermal reaction is the opening of the strained cyclobutene ring. This is an electrocyclic reaction. I will determine the number of π-electrons involved and use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions to determine the stereochemical course (conrotatory or disrotatory).\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The product of the first step is a ten-membered ring with a conjugated system of π-electrons. This intermediate then cyclizes to form the final product, which has two fused six-membered rings. This is another electrocyclic reaction. I will again determine the number of π-electrons involved and apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules to find the stereochemical mode of this ring closure.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that describes these two sequential reactions, clearly stating the type of reaction, the number of electrons involved (4π and 6π), and the stereochemical mode for each step. The script will print this explanation as the output.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions\n    occurring in the given thermal transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The transformation is from bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-1,3,5,7-tetraene to 9,10-dihydronaphthalene.\n    # This occurs in two sequential steps under thermal conditions (Δ).\n\n    # Step 1: Electrocyclic Ring Opening\n    # The strained 4-membered cyclobutene ring opens.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
