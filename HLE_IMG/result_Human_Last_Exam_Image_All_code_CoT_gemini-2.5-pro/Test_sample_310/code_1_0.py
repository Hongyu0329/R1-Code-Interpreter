    # The degree of destruction 'a' is given by a = m/25 for m in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
    # There are 2 polymer types (linear, ladder) and 5 values of 'a', for a total of 10 simulations.
    # The image displays 9 plots, so one is missing.

    # Step 3 & 4: Differentiate polymer types and identify the missing plot's type.
    # Linear polymers degrade much faster (proportional to 'a') than ladder polymers (proportional to 'a^2').
    # By inspection, plots 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 show slow degradation (likely ladder polymers).
    # Plots 2, 5, 8, 9 show much faster degradation (likely linear polymers).
    # Since there are 5 'ladder' plots and 4 'linear' plots, the missing simulation
    # must be for a LINEAR polymer.

    # Step 5: Determine the 'm' value for the missing plot.
    # We can match the 4 visible linear plots to the 'm' values by observing the trend.
    # Degradation increases with 'm'. The visual order of degradation for the linear plots is 9 < 8 < 2 < 5.
    # Let's calculate the theoretical N_n for linear polymers to confirm.
    
    # N_n (linear) for m=1, a=0.04: 20 / (1 + 0.04 * 19) = 11.36 (Matches plot 9)
    # N_n (linear) for m=2, a=0.08: 20 / (1 + 0.08 * 19) = 7.94  (Matches plot 8)
    # N_n (linear) for m=3, a=0.12: 20 / (1 + 0.12 * 19) = 6.10  (Matches plot 2)
    # N_n (linear) for m=4, a=0.16: 20 / (1 + 0.16 * 19) = 4.95  (Matches plot 5)
    
    # The plots for m=1, 2, 3, 4 are present. Therefore, the missing plot corresponds to m=5.

    # Step 6: Calculate N_n for the missing simulation.
    # Parameters for the missing plot:
    # Polymer Type: Linear
    # Initial degree of polymerization, N = 20
    # m = 5
    
    m = 5
    a = m / 25.0
    
    # Formula for linear polymer: N_n = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))
    N_n = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))
