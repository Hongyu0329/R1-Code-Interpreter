    # Explanation for DIKW Model
    print("1. Why the DIKW Model is applicable:")
    print("   - The sales pipeline generates a lot of DATA (e.g., VA Sales List, call outcomes, conversion rates).")
    print("   - This data can be processed into INFORMATION (e.g., 'Script A has a 20% success rate').")
    print("   - This leads to KNOWLEDGE (e.g., 'We understand which client profiles respond best to our offers').")
    print("   - This culminates in WISDOM (e.g., 'We will strategically focus our marketing on these profiles').")
    print("   - DIKW helps turn raw sales figures into actionable strategy to boost results.\n")

    # Explanation for SECI Model
    print("2. Why the SECI Model is applicable:")
    print("   - Sales success often relies on the TACIT knowledge (skills, intuition) of experienced salespeople.")
    print("   - The SECI model provides a framework to capture this. For example:")
    print("     - Externalization: A top salesperson's techniques are documented into a 'VA Sales Script' or 'Work Manual/Template'.")
    print("     - Combination: Various scripts and templates are combined into a master sales playbook.")
    print("     - Internalization: New hires study the playbook to internalize the skills.")
    print("   - SECI helps make individual expertise an organizational asset, ensuring consistent performance.\n")

    # Explanation for why Bloom's Taxonomy is less suitable
    print("3. Why Bloom's Taxonomy is not the primary choice:")
    print("   - Bloom's Taxonomy is an excellent framework for designing individual training programs.")
    print("   - However, it focuses on an individual's learning process, not on managing the collective knowledge of the entire organization to improve a business process.\n")

    print("  a) Analyze performance data to refine strategy (DIKW).")
    print("  b) Capture and share the expertise of its sales team (SECI).")
