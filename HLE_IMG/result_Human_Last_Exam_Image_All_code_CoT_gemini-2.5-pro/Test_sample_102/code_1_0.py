    """
    This script determines and prints the IUPAC name of the reaction product.

    The reaction proceeds through an intramolecular cyclization mechanism:
    1.  Thermal conditions promote the elimination of methanol (CH3OH), likely via protonation of the methoxy group by the alcohol, forming an allylic carbocation intermediate.
    2.  The hydroxyl group then acts as an internal nucleophile.
    3.  The nucleophilic attack results in a favored 5-exo-trig ring closure, forming a five-membered ring.
    4.  The final product is a 2,5-dihydrofuran derivative with a cyclohexenyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 5.
