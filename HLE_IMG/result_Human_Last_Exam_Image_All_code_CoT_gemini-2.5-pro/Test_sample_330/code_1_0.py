    This function prints the solution to the thermosiphon dynamics puzzle.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Plot 1 is the reference chaotic attractor, looking the most "standard" and symmetric. Code: 0
    2.  Plot 2 shows a more energetic and larger attractor. With 'R/r' taken, the most likely cause is doubling mu (M), which increases the driving term for one of the systems. Code: M
    3.  Plot 3 is very similar to Plot 1, as expected from a change in initial conditions (Z0) for a chaotic system. Code: Z
    4.  Plot 4 shows perfect synchronization of the two systems, which is caused by very strong coupling, hence a doubled Biot number (B). Code: B
    5.  Plot 5 shows the dynamics decaying to a stable fixed point. This is characteristic of reducing the Rayleigh number (r) below the threshold for chaos. Code: r
    6.  Plot 6 shows a simple periodic orbit (limit cycle). This bifurcation can be caused by changing the Prandtl number. Halving it (p) is a plausible cause. Code: p
