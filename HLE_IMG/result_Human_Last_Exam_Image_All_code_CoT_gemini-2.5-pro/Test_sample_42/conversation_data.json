    "My analysis of the image reveals that it is a fresco from the Church of St. Demetrius in the Patriarchate of Peć, Serbia, painted around 1345. Although the figure's appearance—an elderly man with a long beard and a scroll—is common for many monastic saints in Orthodox iconography, this specific artwork is widely identified by art historians and catalogues as a depiction of Moses the Prophet. In this tradition, Old Testament prophets are often portrayed in a similar style to saints, holding scrolls that contain their prophecies or, in the case of Moses, the Divine Law.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icon_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided icon and identifies the depicted figure.\n    \n    Analysis Steps:\n    1.
