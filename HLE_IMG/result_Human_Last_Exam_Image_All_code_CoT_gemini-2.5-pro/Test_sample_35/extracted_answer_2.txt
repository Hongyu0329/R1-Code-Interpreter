Based on the provided diagram and information, the protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE)**, specifically binding to its extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** and not solely as an adjunct marker. While its presence confirms neuroinflammation (adjunct role), its true value lies in predicting the disease's course. The diagram clearly shows that the S100B-RAGE signaling pathway directly leads to critical pathological outcomes such as **neurodegeneration, neuronal loss, and apoptosis**. Therefore, the level of S100B expression would directly correlate with the severity and progression of the neurological disorder, making it a valuable tool for prognosis.
