S100B could be used as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker, but its role as a prognostic marker is more significant.

Here's the explanation:
1.  **As an Adjunct Marker:** Its presence and over-expression, as mentioned in the text, indicate active neuroinflammation, making it a useful marker to use in conjunction with other clinical assessments to support a diagnosis.

2.  **As a Prognostic Marker:** The diagram shows that the S100B-RAGE interaction directly activates pathways (like JNK/JUN and NF-kB) that lead to definitive, long-term pathological outcomes such as Apoptosis (cell death), Neuronal loss, and Neurodegeneration. A prognostic marker predicts the likely outcome or course of a disease. Since higher levels of S100B would drive these destructive processes more strongly, its concentration could predict the severity and speed of disease progression. Therefore, it serves as a powerful prognostic marker for the pathology of neurological disorders.
