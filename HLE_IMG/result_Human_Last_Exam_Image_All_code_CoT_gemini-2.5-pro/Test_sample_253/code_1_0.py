# The organism in the image is identified as Xanthoria parietina.
# The question is about the length of its XPH1 protein.
# The XPH1 gene in Xanthoria parietina encodes a protein called photolyase.
# By looking up this protein (accession: CAA75924.1) in the NCBI database,
# we can find its length.

# Number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina.
num_amino_acids = 558
