The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the **seta**, which is the stalk that supports the spore capsule.

*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very **short and straight seta**, causing the capsule to be immersed or barely raised above the surrounding leaves.
*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name implies (*curvi-* meaning curved and *-seta* referring to the stalk), has a **longer, distinctly curved or hooked (arcuate) seta**. This makes the capsule hang or nod to one side, well clear of the leaves.

This difference in the seta's length and curvature is the most obvious feature to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are producing spores.
