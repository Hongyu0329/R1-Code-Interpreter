    "The user wants to know the main distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. I need to provide this information in the form of a Python script that prints the answer.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Research the morphology of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n2.  Identify the most prominent and easily observable difference, as the user specified \"at a glance\".\n3.  The specific epithet *curviseta* means \"curved seta\", which is a strong hint. The seta is the stalk that holds the capsule (the spore-containing structure).\n4.  Confirm the characteristic of the seta in *Grimmia montana*. Sources indicate it has a very short and straight seta.\n5.  Therefore, the main difference is the length and curvature of the seta.\n6.  Create a Python script that uses a `print()` statement to explain this difference clearly.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Distinguishing Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta by Sporophyte\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"=\" * len(title))\n\n    difference = \"\"\"\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, which allows for distinguishing them at a glance, is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n\n1.  Grimmia montana:\n    - Has a very short and straight seta.\n    - This makes the capsule appear immersed or only slightly emergent from the leaves.\n\n2.  Grimmia curviseta:\n    - As its name 'curviseta' (curved seta) suggests, it has a longer, distinctly curved or hooked (arcuate) seta.\n    - This curvature causes the capsule to be exserted (projecting beyond the leaves) and often nodding or oriented to the side.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a long, curved seta in Grimmia curviseta versus a short, straight seta in Grimmia montana is the key distinguishing feature.\n\"\"\"\n    print(difference)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the **seta**, which is the stalk that supports the spore capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very **short and straight seta**, causing the capsule to be immersed or barely raised above the surrounding leaves.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name implies (*curvi-* meaning curved and *-seta* referring to the stalk), has a **longer, distinctly curved or hooked (arcuate) seta**. This makes the capsule hang or nod to one side, well clear of the leaves.\n\nThis difference in the seta's length and curvature is the most obvious feature to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are producing spores.>>>"
