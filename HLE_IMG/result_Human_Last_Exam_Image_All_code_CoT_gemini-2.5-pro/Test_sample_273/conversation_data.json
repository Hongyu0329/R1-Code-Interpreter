    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers. We will label the chiral carbons C2, C3, and C4 from left to right as they appear in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** The molecule has three chiral centers, which are the carbon atoms C2 (bonded to OH), C3 (bonded to an ethyl group), and C4 (bonded to CH3 and CH2NH2).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, we will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   Orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer (a dashed bond).\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   If the path is clockwise, the configuration is **R**.\n    *   If the path is counter-clockwise, the configuration is **S**.\n4.  **Address Drawing Ambiguity:** The stereocenter at C2 is drawn with two dashed bonds, which is geometrically impossible for a simple tetrahedral carbon. This is a common type of error in chemical drawings. We will resolve this by assuming it's a typo and that one of the bonds should be a wedge. A logical assumption in such drawings is that substituents on a chain often alternate. Since the ethyl group on C3 is a wedge, we will assume the main functional group on C2, the -OH group, is also a wedge. The adjacent methyl group (implied as the start of the carbon chain) will be treated as being on a dash.\n\nThis systematic process allows us to determine the configuration for each center.\n\n```python\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration\n    for the three chiral centers in the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and their substituents.\")\n    print(\"The molecule has three chiral centers, labeled C2, C3, and C4 from left to right.\")\n    print(\" - C2 is bonded to: -OH, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the molecule (C3).\")\n    print(\" - C3 is bonded to: -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H, and the carbons C2 and C4.\")\n    print(\" - C4 is bonded to: -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H, and C3.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the configuration of C4 (the rightmost chiral center).\")\n    print(\"Substituents on C4: -CH2NH2, -C3_group, -CH3, -H.\")\n    print(\"Priorities (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -CH2NH2 (due to N atom)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3_group (complex carbon group)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3\")\n    print(\"4: -H\")\n    print(\"Spatial arrangement: -CH2NH2 is wedge (front), -CH3 is dash (back).
