    # A clock face has 12 positions. We can represent them as numbers 0-11.
    # Let the '12' mark be position 0.

    # This means its speed is 3 positions per tick.

    # "The minute hand gains, with every tick, A quarter turn"
    # A quarter turn on a 12-position clock is 12 / 4 = 3 positions.
    # "Gains" refers to the relative speed of the minute hand to the hour hand.
    minute_hand_gain = 3
    
    # The absolute speed of the minute hand is the hour hand's speed plus its gain.
    minute_hand_speed = hour_hand_speed + minute_hand_gain

    # We want to find the time 't' in ticks when the hands meet.
    # They start at the same position (0), so they meet again when the distance
    # the minute hand has gained on the hour hand is a full circle (12 positions).
    # The equation for the first meeting time (t) is: gain * t = 12
    first_meeting_ticks = 12 / minute_hand_gain

    # Now we find the position on the clock where they meet.
    # We can use the hour hand's position formula: pos = (speed * t) % 12
    meeting_position_calc = (hour_hand_speed * first_meeting_ticks) % 12
    
    # The riddle asks "When will they meet?", implying a time format.
    # A "visual tableau" of both hands pointing to 12 represents the time 12:00.
    # To follow the instruction "output each number in the final equation",
    # we will construct the final time step-by-step.
    
    # The hour is determined by the meeting position on the clock face. Position 0 is 12.
    final_hour = 12
    
    # The minute is determined by the minute hand's position. When it's at '12',
    # it signifies 0 minutes past the hour.
