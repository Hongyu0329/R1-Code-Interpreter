    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### **Plan:**\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:** Determine the molecular weight (MW) and deduce the molecular formula using the nitrogen rule. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:** Identify key functional groups present in the molecule.\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:** Identify the number and types of carbon atoms (CH₃, CH₂, CH, C).\n4.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** Determine the number of different proton environments, their integration (number of protons), and their splitting patterns (neighboring protons).\n5.  **HSQC Analysis:** Correlate the proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals to confirm connectivity.\n6.  **Structure Elucidation:** Combine all the pieces of information to build the molecular structure.\n7.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Assign the correct IUPAC name to the determined structure.\n\nI will now execute this plan using the provided data.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Mass Spectrum Analysis\")\n    mw = 135\n    print(f\"The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = {mw}.\")\n    print(\"An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"Assuming one nitrogen atom (N=14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121 for C and H.\")\n    # C*12 + H = 121.
