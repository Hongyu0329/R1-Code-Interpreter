    This function solves the cellular automaton visualization grouping puzzle.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Determine the correct time step 't' for each visualization (A-P). This involves an initial sizing based on a (2t+1)x(2t+1) bounding box, followed by a reassignment of visualizations that appear smaller than their true time step would imply, in order to match the expected number of images per time step.
    2.  The correct time assignments are:
        t=2: {L}
        t=3: {D, M}
        t=4: {I, J, O}
        t=5: {A, K, N, H}
        t=6: {P, E, C}
        t=7: {F, G}
        t=8: {B}
    3.  Identify visually continuous sequences of four visualizations that match the time progressions for each of the four rules.
        - Rule 1 (t=2,3,4,5): The sequence L->D->I->A shows a consistent evolution of a rotational pattern.
        - Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6): The sequence M->O->N->P shows a rule that involves a cyan background, which evolves into a sparse pattern and then a dense one.
        - Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7): The sequence J->K->E->F shows a pattern of growing frames that subsequently break apart.
        - Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8): The remaining images form the sequence H->C->G->B.
    4.  Combine these sequences into the final formatted string.
