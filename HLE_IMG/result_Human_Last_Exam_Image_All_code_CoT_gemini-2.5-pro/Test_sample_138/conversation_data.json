    "This task requires identifying the biological sexes of three pairs of insects (A, B, C) based on visual characteristics known as sexual dimorphism.\n\n**Analysis Steps:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees, likely *Coelioxys*):**\n    *   The insect on the left has a distinctly conical and sharply pointed abdomen. This is a characteristic of female *Coelioxys* bees, which use this specialized abdomen to pierce the nests of their hosts to lay eggs.\n    *   The insect on the right has a more blunt abdomen, which terminates in several small spines or prongs. This abdominal structure is characteristic of males and is used for grasping the female during mating.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is **Female, Male (F, M)**, which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps, likely *Polistes*):**\n    *   The wasp on the left exhibits antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a reliable field mark for male wasps in the family Vespidae.\n    *   The wasp on the right has straight antennae, which is typical for a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees, likely *Melissodes* or a related genus):**\n    *   The bee on the left has very long antennae that extend far beyond its head. This is the defining characteristic of male \"long-horned bees\". Additionally, its face (clypeus) is yellow, another common male trait in this group.\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, typical of a female. Its face is dark.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   A: F, M -> 4\n*   B: M, F -> 3\n*   C: M, F -> 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices. The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the indices for the biological sexes of the insect pairs.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    Pair A: The left insect is a female Coelioxys (pointed abdomen for egg-laying). \n              The right insect is a male (blunt, spined abdomen).\n              This corresponds to (Female, Male) -> index 4.\n\n    Pair B: The left insect is a male Polistes wasp (curled antennae).\n              The right insect is a female (straight antennae).\n              This corresponds to (Male, Female) -> index 3.\n\n    Pair C: The left insect is a male long-horned bee (very long antennae, yellow face).\n              The right insect is a female (shorter antennae, dark face).\n              This corresponds to (Male, Female) -> index 3.\n\n    Options given:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices for pairs A, B, and C respectively\n    index_A = 4\n    index_B = 3\n    index_C = 3\n    \n    # Print the result in the required format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
