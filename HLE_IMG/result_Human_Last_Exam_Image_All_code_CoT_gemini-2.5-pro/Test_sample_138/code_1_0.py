    This function determines the indices for the biological sexes of the insect pairs.
    
    Analysis:
    Pair A: The left insect is a female Coelioxys (pointed abdomen for egg-laying). 
              The right insect is a male (blunt, spined abdomen).
              This corresponds to (Female, Male) -> index 4.

    Pair B: The left insect is a male Polistes wasp (curled antennae).
              The right insect is a female (straight antennae).
              This corresponds to (Male, Female) -> index 3.

    Pair C: The left insect is a male long-horned bee (very long antennae, yellow face).
              The right insect is a female (shorter antennae, dark face).
              This corresponds to (Male, Female) -> index 3.
