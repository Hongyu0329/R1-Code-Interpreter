# The user wants me to identify the correct nyala from the given images.
# This is a visual identification task, and no computation is required.
# I will analyze the features of the target nyala and compare them with the options provided.

# Plan:
# 1. Examine the target nyala's key features: horn shape, stripe pattern, and spot pattern on the flank.
# 2. Compare these features with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
# 3. Identify the option that has the most consistent features with the target.

# Analysis:
# - Target: Has a specific lyre-shaped horn structure, a distinct pattern of ~9-10 stripes, and a unique cluster of white spots on its rear flank.
# - Option A: Looks like a younger bull, different horn development.
# - Option B: The stripe pattern and the specific arrangement of spots on the flank are an excellent match for the target. The horn shape is also consistent.
# - Option C: Different coloration (blue/grey hue).
# - Option D: The horns are different; the tip of the left horn has a more pronounced outward flick.
# - Option E: There is a white marking on the front left leg which is not present on the target.
# - Option F: Partially obscured, but the visible parts don't provide a conclusive match.

# Conclusion: Based on the matching stripe and spot patterns, Image B is the correct one.
