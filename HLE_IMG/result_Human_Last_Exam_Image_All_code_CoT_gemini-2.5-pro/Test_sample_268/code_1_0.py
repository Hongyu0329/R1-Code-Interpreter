# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the analysis.
# The graph is a complete graph (K_N) with N nodes.
N = 64

# The node of interest is the "central node". In a complete graph, all nodes
# are topologically identical, so the calculation is the same for any node.

# Step 2: Calculate the degree 'k' of the node.
# In a complete graph K_N, a node is connected to all other N-1 nodes.
k = N - 1

# Step 3: Calculate the number of edges 'E' between the neighbors.
# The neighbors of the node are the other 'k' nodes. In a complete graph,
# these neighbors form a complete subgraph (a clique), K_k.
# The number of edges in K_k is given by the formula k * (k - 1) / 2.
k_minus_1 = k - 1
E = k * k_minus_1 // 2

# Step 4: Calculate the clustering coefficient C.
# The formula is C = (2 * E) / (k * (k - 1)).
C_numerator = 2 * E
C_denominator = k * k_minus_1
C = C_numerator / C_denominator

# Step 5: Print the final calculation, showing each number.
print("The clustering coefficient C is calculated as (2 * E) / (k * (k - 1)).")
print(f"For a node in a K_{N} graph:")
print(f"k = {N} - 1 = {k}")
print(f"E = ({k} * ({k} - 1)) / 2 = {E}")
print(f"C = (2 * {E}) / ({k} * {k_minus_1}) = {C_numerator} / {C_denominator} = {int(C)}")
