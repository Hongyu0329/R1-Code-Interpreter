    Analyzes different solutions to improve a model's accuracy on an imbalanced dataset.
    The context is an HMM for media processing where audio is the majority class and video is the minority class.
    The goal is to find the most cost-effective solution.

Step-by-step analysis of the options:

1.  The Problem: The HMM shows a significant data imbalance. Probabilities for audio functions (e.g., setAudioSource() - 0.82) are much higher than for video functions (e.g., setVideoSource() - 0.17). This results in poor recommendation accuracy for video processing workflows.

2.  Evaluating the Choices on Cost-Effectiveness:

    A. Add more training data for video processing:
       - Benefit: High. More targeted data is a robust way to improve model performance.
       - Cost: High. Data collection and labeling are typically expensive and time-consuming.

    B. Use resampling to reduce the imbalance:
       - Benefit: Good. Resampling techniques (like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) directly combat the effects of imbalance on the training process.
       - Cost: Low. This is a computational technique applied to the existing dataset. It avoids the high cost of new data acquisition and major model changes.

    C. Train a specific model for video and another for audio:
       - Benefit: Potentially high, but creates a more complex system.
       - Cost: High. This doubles the model development, training, and maintenance effort.

    D. Add specific states to indicate audio or video processing:
       - Benefit: Potentially high, as it makes the model structure more explicit.
       - Cost: High. This is a fundamental change to the model's architecture, requiring significant re-engineering.

    E. Use a model with a longer context window, such as an LLM:
       - Benefit: Potentially very high.
       - Cost: Extremely high. Moving to a vastly more complex model like an LLM involves huge computational, data, and engineering costs.

3.  Conclusion:
    Comparing the options, resampling (B) offers a direct solution to the data imbalance problem at a very low cost compared to all other alternatives. Therefore, it is the most cost-effective solution.
