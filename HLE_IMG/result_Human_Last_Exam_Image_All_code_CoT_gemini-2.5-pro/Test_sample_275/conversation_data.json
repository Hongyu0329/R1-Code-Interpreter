    "To find all the splice species and count them, we will analyze the RT-PCR results from each panel. The key is to identify the number of unique bands for each primer combination, and then combine these findings without double-counting species.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Group experiments by Forward Primer:** The forward primers (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3) are designed to amplify different sets of transcripts. By grouping the results this way, we can avoid counting the same species multiple times.\n    *   **E1F1:** A general primer for transcripts originating from the E1 promoter. Results are in panels B, C, E, H, and I.\n    *   **E1F2:** A splice-junction-specific primer (for splice 929^3465). Results are in panels D and F.\n    *   **E1F3:** Another splice-junction-specific primer (for splice 929^3506). Results are in panel G.\n2.  **Count species for the E1F1 primer group:**\n    *   Panel I (E1F1/L1R) provides the most information for this group, showing 4 distinct bands.\n    *   Panel E (E1F1/L2R) shows 1 band. This band (1,005 bp) is larger than any in Panel I, even though the primer L2R is upstream of L1R. This indicates it's a distinct species.\n    *   Total for this group = 4 (from Panel I) + 1 (from Panel E) = 5 species.\n3.  **Count species for the E1F2 primer group:**\n    *   Panels D and F both use the splice-specific primer E1F2 and each shows 1 band. This confirms the existence of 1 unique species containing this specific splice.\n4.  **Count species for the E1F3 primer group:**\n    *   Panel G uses the splice-specific primer E1F3 and shows 2 distinct bands. This means there are 2 species containing this specific splice.\n5.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the species counts from the three mutually exclusive primer groups to get the total number of splice species found.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the number of unique species detected by each forward primer group.\\n\")\n\n    # Group 1: General forward primer E1F1\n    # Panel I (E1F1/L1R) shows 4 bands: 450, 419, 378, 187 bp.\n    species_from_panel_I = 4\n    # Panel E (E1F1/L2R) shows 1 band: 1,005 bp.
