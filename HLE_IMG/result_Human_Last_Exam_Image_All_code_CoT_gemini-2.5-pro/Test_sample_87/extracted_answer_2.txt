**Product A**: The 1:1 cycloadduct (pyrrolizidine derivative) formed from the azomethine ylide and methyl propiolate, which is subsequently acetylated on the imine nitrogen of its substituent and deprotonated to form a stable N-acetyl enamine.
**Product B**: An aromatized and oxidized version of the 1:1 adduct. The structure is Methyl 4-(5-oxopyrrolidin-2-yl)pyrrolizine-6-carboxylate, featuring an aromatic pyrrolizine core and a lactam substituent. SMILES: `COC(=O)c1cc2c(cn2C2CC(=O)NC2)c1`
**Product C**: A zwitterionic side product from the N-acetylation of the starting material. SMILES: `[O-]C(=O)C1N(C2=[N+](C(=O)C)CCC2)CCC1`
