    "This coin is a \"9 Deniers\" from the reign of King Louis XV of France. The inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" on the reverse indicates it was minted for use in the French colonies. This specific issue, minted in 1721-1722, is most famously associated with the historical French Colony of Louisiana.\n\nI will write a Python script to present the detailed identification of the coin.\n\n```python\ndef identify_coin():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the origin of the French colonial coin based on its visible features.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key features identified from the coin's image\n    ruler = \"Louis XV\"\n    obverse_legend_partial = \"LUD ...
