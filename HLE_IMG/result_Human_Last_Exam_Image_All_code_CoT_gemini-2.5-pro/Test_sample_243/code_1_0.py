  This function identifies the plant in the image and determines its endemic island.
  
  The plant is identified as Daphnephyllum teijsmannii based on its distinct
  leaf morphology, especially the reticulate white veins.
  
  Research indicates this species is native to Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands.
  Since the question asks for "the island" (singular), Taiwan is the most
  fitting answer as it is a single island, whereas the Ryukyu Islands are an archipelago.
