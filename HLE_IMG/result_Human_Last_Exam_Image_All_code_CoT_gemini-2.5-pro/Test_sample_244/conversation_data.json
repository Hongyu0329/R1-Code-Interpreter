    "Based on the visual characteristics of the organism in the image, I will identify its genus.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the image to observe the key features of the epiphytic organism growing on the tree bark. The organism presents as a network of fine, black, branching lines on a lighter-colored background (the bark and the lichen's own body, or thallus).\n2.  Recognize this distinctive pattern. The appearance is highly characteristic of a specific group of lichens commonly known as \"script lichens\" due to their resemblance to writing or hieroglyphs.\n3.  Identify the scientific genus that corresponds to this common name and appearance. The genus *Graphis* is named for this very feature (from Greek \"graphis\", meaning \"writing\").\n4.  Create a Python script that will print the identified genus name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the genus of the epiphyte shown in the image.\n    The epiphyte is a lichen with a very distinctive appearance: a pale thallus (the lichen body)\n    with black, elongated, and branching fruiting bodies (apothecia) that resemble script or writing.\n    This morphology is characteristic of the \"script lichens\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The primary genus known for this script-like appearance is Graphis.\n    genus_name = \"Graphis\"\n    \n    print(f\"The epiphytic species in the image, characterized by its script-like black markings, belongs to the genus: {genus_name}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Graphis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
