    "My plan to identify the author of this altarpiece detail involves a step-by-step analysis of the image provided.\n\n1.  **Visual and Textual Analysis:** I will first examine the style of the sculpture. It is a bas-relief in a roundel format, characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The inscription at the bottom, \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL,\" translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" identifying the scene as the Eucharist.\n2.  **Art Historical Research:** The style is strongly indicative of the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence, famous for their work in glazed terracotta. I will search for works by this workshop that match the scene and style.\n3.  **Identification:** This research confirms the artwork is a detail from the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament*, located in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola, Florence.\n4.  **Author Attribution:** Historical sources consistently attribute this masterpiece, created around 1441-1443, to the renowned artist **Luca della Robbia**.\n5.  **Code Generation:** Finally, I will create a Python script to present this finding, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_artist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the artist of the provided artwork detail.\n    The identification is based on art historical analysis of the style,\n    subject matter, and inscription.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information gathered through research\n    artist = \"Luca della Robbia\"\n    artwork_title = \"Tabernacle of the Sacrament\"\n    detail_scene = \"Institution of the Eucharist\"\n    location = \"Church of Santa Maria a Peretola, Florence\"\n    date = \"c. 1441-1443\"\n\n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"The image shows a detail from the '{artwork_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The specific scene is the '{detail_scene}'.\")\n    print(f\"This work is located in the {location} and dates to {date}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe author of this detail of the Altarpiece is:\")\n    print(artist)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the author's name.\nfind_artist()\n```\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
