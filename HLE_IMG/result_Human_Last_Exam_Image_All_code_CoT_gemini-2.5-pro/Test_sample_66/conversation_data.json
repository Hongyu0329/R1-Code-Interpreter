    "To find the total area of the shaded regions, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry**: The diagram provides clues to determine the geometric properties of the figure. We can see a large right-angled triangle implied by the lengths 17 and 34. Let's assume the line segment of length 34 is the hypotenuse and the segment of length 17 is one of the legs. The other leg corresponds to the radius `R` of the circular sector.\n    *   Using the Pythagorean theorem: `R² + 17² = 34²`.\n    *   This allows us to solve for `R`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Angle**: In the same right-angled triangle, we can find the angle at the center of the circle. Let's call the angle subtended by the blue region `2θ`. The sine of this angle is the ratio of the opposite side (17) to the hypotenuse (34).\n    *   `sin(2θ) = 17 / 34 = 0.5`. This means `2θ = 30°`.\n    *   The entire sector has an angle of `4θ`, which is `60°`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Area Calculation**: The total shaded area is the region enclosed by the circular arc and the two tangents at the endpoints of that arc. This area can be calculated by finding the area of the large kite shape formed by the two radii and two tangents, and then subtracting the area of the circular sector.\n    *   `Total Area = Area(Kite) - Area(Sector)`\n\n4.  **Calculate and Print**: We will write Python code to perform these calculations and print the formula with the derived values, along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values from the geometric construction.\n# 'a' is the length of the tangent leg of the right triangle.\n# 'h' is the length of the hypotenuse.\na = 17\nh = 34\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the radius (R) of the circular sector using the Pythagorean theorem.\n# R^2 + a^2 = h^2\nR_squared = h**2 - a**2\nR = math.sqrt(R_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Determine the total central angle of the sector.\n# The angle 2*theta is found from sin(2*theta) = a / h = 17 / 34 = 0.5.\n# So, 2*theta is 30 degrees. The total angle of the sector shown is 4*theta.\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * 30 \ntotal_angle_rad = math.radians(total_angle_deg)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the kite formed by the two outer radii and their tangents.\n# The kite's area is twice the area of one of the right triangles (with legs R and a).\n# Area_Kite = 2 * (1/2 * R * a) = R * a\narea_kite = R * a\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the area of the circular sector.\n# Area_Sector = (1/2) * R^2 * total_angle_rad\narea_sector = 0.5 * R_squared * total_angle_rad\n\n# Step 6: The total shaded area is the difference between the kite area and the sector area.\ntotal_area = area_kite - area_sector\n\n# Step 7: Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\n# The base number for our calculations can be seen as 17*17 = 289.\nbase_val = a**2\n\nprint(\"The total shaded area is the area of the kite minus the area of the sector.\")\nprint(f\"Formula: Area = Area_Kite - Area_Sector\")\nprint(f\"The equation with the calculated numbers is:\")\n# The area of the kite is 289 * sqrt(3)\n# The area of the sector is (1/2) * 867 * (pi/3) = 289 * pi / 2\nprint(f\"Area = {base_val} * sqrt(3) - ({base_val} * pi / 2)\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values of sqrt(3) and pi:\")\nprint(f\"Area = {base_val} * {math.sqrt(3):.4f} - ({base_val} * {math.pi:.4f} / 2)\")\nprint(f\"Area = {area_kite:.4f} - {area_sector:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Final Total Area = {total_area:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<46.5891>>>"
