    "My plan is to identify the song by analyzing its musical characteristics and then searching for a match.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Music:** I'll first examine the sheet music for key clues. The time signature is 4/4, the key appears to be C major, and the tempo marking \"Med. Up J=176\" indicates a very fast pace. The chords used (C, E7, F, G7, etc.) and the complex, syncopated melody are hallmarks of the Bebop subgenre of jazz.\n\n2.  **Identify the Melody:** The melody is the most unique identifier. I will transcribe the first few distinctive bars:\n    *   Pickup notes: G, G\n    *   Measure 1 (over a C chord): E, G, C, (rest), E, G, C, (rest)\n    *   Measure 2 (over an E7 chord): B, D, F#, G#, A, G#, F#, D\n\n3.  **Search and Verify:** I will use this distinctive melodic phrase and the chord progression (C -> E7 -> F) to search for the song title. This combination points directly to the song \"Bebop\" by Dizzy Gillespie. I will then confirm that the style (Bebop) and origin (USA, as Dizzy Gillespie was American) are correct.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script to print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the song from the provided sheet music and prints its details.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Bebop\"\n    musical_style = \"Bebop (Jazz)\"\n    country_of_origin = \"USA\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Title: Bebop, Musical Style: Bebop (Jazz), Country of Origin: USA>>>"
