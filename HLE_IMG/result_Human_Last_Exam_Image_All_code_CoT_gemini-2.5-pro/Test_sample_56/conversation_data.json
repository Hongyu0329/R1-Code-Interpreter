    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1. I will analyze the provided image, which exhibits a strong surrealist style, characterized by dreamlike scenes and illogical combinations of objects.\n2. The key elements in the painting are the room interior with multiple doorways opening to different worlds (a glacier, a sea with a ship, a cityscape), a fireplace burning books, and a tree outside with a hot air balloon.\n3. Based on these unique stylistic elements, I will identify the artist. This style is very distinctive of the Polish surrealist painter Jacek Yerka. The painting is often titled \"The Burning of the Books\" (\"La Quema de los Libros\") or \"Library\".\n4. Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of the artist.\n\n```python\ndef find_artist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the artist of the surrealist painting.\n    The painting is known for its intricate details and dream-like scenes,\n    which are hallmarks of a specific Polish painter.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Jacek Yerka\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the following painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nfind_artist()\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
