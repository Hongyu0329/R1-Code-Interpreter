# Step 1: Define the side length of the red hexagon from the problem statement.
s = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the area of the regular red hexagon.
# The formula for the area of a regular hexagon with side s is (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2.
area_hexagon = (3 * math.sqrt(3) / 2) * s**2

# Step 3: Based on analysis, a plausible hypothesis is that the area of the white shape
# is 3/4 of the area of the red hexagon.
fraction = 3/4
area_white_shape = area_hexagon * fraction

# Step 4: Print the full calculation step-by-step.
