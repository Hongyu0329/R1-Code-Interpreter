    Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:

    1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is a triarylmethane carbocation where the three aromatic rings are linked by methylene acetal (-O-CH2-O-) bridges. These bridges act as protecting groups for catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) units.

    2.  **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction occurs in 0.1 M HCl (a dilute aqueous acid) under reflux (heating). These are classic conditions for the hydrolysis of acetals.

    3.  **Chemical Transformation:** The acid (H+) catalyzes the cleavage of the methylene acetal groups by water (hydrolysis). Each -O-CH2-O- bridge is converted back into two hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and one molecule of formaldehyde (CH2O) is released as a byproduct.

    4.  **Product Identification (Compound A):** Since there are three acetal bridges, the reaction consumes three molecules of water and produces three molecules of formaldehyde. The core carbocation structure remains, but it is now substituted with three catechol groups. Therefore, Compound A is the tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium cation.

    The overall balanced chemical equation is:
    1 (Reactant Cation) + 3 H2O -> 1 (Compound A) + 3 CH2O
