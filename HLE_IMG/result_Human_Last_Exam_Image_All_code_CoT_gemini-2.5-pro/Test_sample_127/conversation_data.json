    "An analysis of the molecular structure is required to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely. Free rotation can occur around single bonds, but it can be restricted by steric hindrance (clashing of atoms).\n\n1.  **Identify the Phenyl Rings in Question:** We need to evaluate rings G, H, J, K, and L.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Environment of Each Ring:**\n    *   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached to the 4-position of the cyclometalated phenyl rings A and C, respectively. These positions are on the outer edge of the complex, far from other bulky groups. The single C-C bond connecting them to the main ligand framework allows for free rotation with minimal steric hindrance.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to the 6-position of the pyridine ring D. This position is also on the periphery of the molecule, pointing away from the crowded central iridium atom. Therefore, ring G can rotate freely around its connecting C-C bond.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached to the 6-position of the cyclometalated phenyl rings A and C, respectively. These positions are located in a very sterically crowded environment, \"sandwiched\" between the other ligands (like pyridines E and F) and the central Iridium atom. Rotation of rings K and L would cause significant clashes with these adjacent parts of the molecule. Therefore, their rotation is severely restricted.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, rings G, J, and H are located in sterically unhindered positions and can rotate freely. Rings K and L are in a crowded environment, which prevents free rotation.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this reasoning and provides the answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the molecular structure to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of Phenyl Ring Rotation:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Free rotation occurs around single C-C bonds connecting the phenyl rings to the main ligand structure.\")\n    print(\"However, rotation can be restricted by steric hindrance (i.e., when a ring is in a crowded space).\\n\")\n\n    # Analysis of each ring\n    print(\"Ring G: Attached to pyridine ring D. It is on the periphery of the complex and is unhindered. It can rotate freely.\")\n    print(\"Ring J: Attached to phenyl ring C. It is on the outer edge of the complex and is unhindered. It can rotate freely.\")\n    print(\"Ring H: Attached to phenyl ring A. It is on the outer edge of the complex and is unhindered. It can rotate freely.\")\n    print(\"Ring K: Attached to phenyl ring A, but in a crowded position near the central Iridium and other ligands (like ring E). Its rotation is sterically hindered.\")\n    print(\"Ring L: Attached to phenyl ring C, also in a crowded position near the central Iridium and other ligands. Its rotation is sterically hindered.\\n\")\n\n    # Final conclusion\n    freely_rotating_rings = ['G', 'J', 'H']\n    print(\"Conclusion: The rings that can rotate freely are:\")\n    for ring in freely_rotating_rings:\n        print(ring)\n\nanalyze_ring_rotation()\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is E.\")\n# The final answer is the letter corresponding to the set {G, J, H}\nprint(\"<<<E>>>\")\n```"
