    "Based on visual analysis, the image shows the landscape near Warner Springs, an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California. The prominent mountains in the background are characteristic of this area.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Find the official elevation of Warner Springs from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).\n2.  The GNIS lists the elevation as 3133 feet.\n3.  Convert this elevation from feet to meters, as requested. The conversion factor is 1 foot = 0.3048 meters.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the resulting equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_elevation_in_meters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the elevation of Warner Springs, CA in meters.\n    The elevation in feet is sourced from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Elevation of Warner Springs in feet (from GNIS)\n    elevation_feet = 3133\n\n    # Conversion factor from feet to meters\n    conversion_factor = 0.3048\n\n    # Calculate elevation in meters\n    elevation_meters = elevation_feet * conversion_factor\n    \n    # The official GNIS value in meters is 955, which is the rounded result of this calculation.\n    rounded_elevation_meters = round(elevation_meters)\n\n    print(f\"The elevation of the unincorporated community (Warner Springs, CA) is calculated by converting its elevation from feet to meters.\")\n    print(f\"Elevation in feet: {elevation_feet}\")\n    print(f\"Conversion factor (meters per foot): {conversion_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {elevation_feet} * {conversion_factor} = {elevation_meters}\")\n    print(f\"The elevation in meters, rounded to the nearest whole number, is {rounded_elevation_meters}.\")\n\ncalculate_elevation_in_meters()\n```\n<<<955>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2023 in an unincorporated community.
