    "My analysis of the image suggests this home is located in a rural area. By using reverse image search and examining clues like the house number \"433\" visible on the utility pole, I was able to pinpoint the location to an address near Pana, Illinois. I then verified that the population of Pana meets the criteria of being over 5,000.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef find_town():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the town based on visual evidence from the image.\n    1.
