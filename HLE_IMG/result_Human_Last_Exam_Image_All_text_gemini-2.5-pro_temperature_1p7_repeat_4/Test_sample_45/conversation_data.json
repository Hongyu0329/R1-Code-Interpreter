    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the rotational symmetry of the given tiling. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' or 'n-fold' symmetry means that the tiling looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point (a center of rotation). We need to find the highest value of 'n' for which this is true.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of the Tiling:** First, let's identify the basic shapes (tiles) and their colors that make up the pattern.\n    *   There are large, regular hexagons colored dark blue.\n    *   There are squares colored light yellow/tan.\n    *   There are rhombi (diamond shapes) colored orange.\n\n3.  **Find Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we must look for points in the tiling around which a rotation can leave the entire pattern unchanged. The most likely candidates for centers of rotation are the geometric centers of the tiles themselves.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Center of a Hexagon:**\n    *   **Locate a center:** Pick a blue hexagon near the middle of the image.\n    *   **Observe its surroundings:** Look closely at what tiles touch the sides of this hexagon. You will see that each of the six sides of the blue hexagon is adjacent to a light yellow square.\n    *   **Observe the next layer:** The gaps formed between these six yellow squares are each filled by an orange rhombus.\n    *   **Test for 6-fold rotation:** Now, imagine rotating the entire pattern by 60 degrees (360 / 6) around the center of the blue hexagon.\n        *   The central blue hexagon will rotate onto itself.\n        *   Each of the 6 surrounding yellow squares will move into the position previously occupied by the next yellow square.\n        *   Each of the 6 surrounding orange rhombi will move into the position previously occupied by the next orange rhombus.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the arrangement of shapes and colors is perfectly symmetrical around the hexagon's center in this way, a 60-degree rotation leaves the entire tiling visually unchanged. This means the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry** around the center of every hexagon.\n\n5.  **Analyze Other Potential Centers (for completeness):**\n    *   **Center of a Square:** A yellow square is surrounded by four orange rhombi at its sides. Rotating by 90 degrees (360 / 4) around the center of a square also leaves the pattern unchanged. This means the tiling also possesses points of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Center of a Rhombus:** A rhombus can be rotated by 180 degrees (360 / 2) around its center to look the same. This means the tiling has points of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n6.  **Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry:** The question asks for \"the rotational symmetry\" of the tiling. In mathematics and crystallography, this refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern's symmetry group. While the pattern does contain points of 2-fold and 4-fold symmetry, the highest order of rotation is 6-fold.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe tiling has multiple centers of rotation, but the highest order is found at the center of the blue hexagons. A rotation of 60 degrees (360/6) around these points maps the entire pattern onto itself. Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6>>>"
