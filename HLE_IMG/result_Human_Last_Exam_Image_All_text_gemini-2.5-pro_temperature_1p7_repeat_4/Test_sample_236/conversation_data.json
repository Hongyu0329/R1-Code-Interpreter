    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observation of the Animal:** The image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect has a distinct color pattern, being primarily black and orange/red. It has six legs, a pair of antennae, and a body divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen, which are typical characteristics of an insect.\n2.  **Detailed Feature Examination:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The head is black. The pronotum (the section just behind the head) is bright orange-red with a black mark in the center. The wings (hemelytra) are mostly black but form a distinct reddish-orange \"X\" or hourglass shape on the back. This aposematic coloration warns predators that it is unpalatable.\n    *   **Body Shape:** The body is somewhat oval and flattened on top. This general shape is common among the order Hemiptera, or \"true bugs\".\n    *   **Habitat:** The insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago*).\n\n3.  **Identification Process:** The distinctive color pattern is key to identification. We can compare these features to common insects with similar coloration.\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** While also black and red/orange, the pattern is different. Boxelder bugs typically have red/orange lines bordering their wings and thorax, not the prominent \"X\" pattern seen here.\n    *   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug is larger and has a broad black band across the middle of its orange wings, which is absent in the insect pictured.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This species perfectly matches the insect in the photo. It is known for the red/orange \"X\" mark on its back and the red/orange pronotum with a central black spot. They primarily feed on milkweed but are often found on other plants like goldenrod for nectar, especially late in the season.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the unique and matching visual characteristics (especially the \"X\" marking on the back), the insect is identified as the Small Milkweed Bug. The scientific name for this species is required.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specific Markings:** The exact pattern of coloration is crucial for distinguishing between similar-looking species of \"true bugs.\" The \"X\" shape on the back is the most definitive feature for this particular insect.\n*   **Distinguishing Look-Alikes:** It is important not to confuse it with the Large Milkweed Bug or the Boxelder Bug, which share a similar color scheme but have different patterns.\n*   **Host Plant Clues:** While this bug is on goldenrod, its common name refers to its primary host plant, milkweed. Knowing that they also frequent other flowers for nectar helps confirm the identification.\n*   **Scientific Name Convention:** The question asks for the scientific name, which consists of the genus and species (e.g., *Genus species*).\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the scientific name of the animal can be confidently determined.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
