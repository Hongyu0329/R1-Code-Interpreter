    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the author.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\n*   **Medium and Style:** The artwork is a relief sculpture, likely made of glazed terracotta. The figures are rendered with a serene classicism, idealized faces, and flowing drapery, which is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, particularly the Florentine school. The form of a roundel (a circular artwork) set within a decorative, foliated frame is also common for this period.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest, standing before an altar with a lit candle, is giving communion to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground. This represents the Eucharist, or the Sacrament of the Altar.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with a partially visible inscription. Using the zoomed-in crops, the text can be deciphered as \"SACRAMENT[I] / DE-L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic or regional spelling of the Italian \"Sacramenti dell'Altare,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject of the relief.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual evidence to known artists and workshops.**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta relief, a religious subject, and the specific High Renaissance style strongly points to the work of the della Robbia family workshop in Florence. This workshop, founded by Luca della Robbia, was famous for its mastery of this medium. Andrea della Robbia, Luca's nephew, and Giovanni della Robbia, Andrea's son, continued the tradition.\n*   Andrea della Robbia (1435â€“1525) is particularly known for his altarpieces featuring narrative scenes in the predella (the base of the altarpiece). His style is characterized by its sweetness, grace, and piety, which aligns well with the figures in the image.\n\n**Step 3: Research and verify the specific artwork.**\n*   Searching for \"della Robbia Sacramenti dell'Altare\" or \"della Robbia Eucharist relief\" leads to a specific, well-known work.\n*   This roundel is identified as a predella panel from the *Altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints Flora, Lucilla, John the Baptist, and Donatus*.\n*   This altarpiece is located in the Church of Santi Flora e Lucilla in Torrita di Siena, Italy.\n*   Art historical sources unanimously attribute this significant work to **Andrea della Robbia** and his workshop, dating it to around 1490-1492. The predella consists of three roundels depicting Faith, the Sacrament of the Altar (the scene in the image), and Hope.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\n*   Based on the style, medium, inscription, and direct comparison with documented works, the relief is a detail from the Altarpiece in Torrita di Siena.\n*   The author of this altarpiece is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to recognize the image as a *detail* of a larger composition (the altarpiece).\n*   The black-and-white nature of the photograph obscures the signature blue and white glazes of della Robbia ware, but the sculptural style is a definitive clue.\n*   The inscription, though slightly irregular in spelling (\"DE-L'AVTEL\"), is key to confirming the subject matter.\n*   Attribution for Renaissance workshop pieces often goes to the head of the workshop, Andrea della Robbia in this case, even if assistants contributed to the execution.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the artist.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
