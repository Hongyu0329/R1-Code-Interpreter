    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Measure:** The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find measure 28 marked at the beginning of the second system. Counting forward, measure 30 is the third measure on that line, which is circled in the image.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This sonata is famously in C minor. Therefore, the tonic (i) is C minor.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a consistent two-note chord throughout the measure: D and F#. The lowest note is D, which serves as the bass of the harmony.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of sixteenth-note figures.\n        *   On the first beat, it plays G-B♭ and E♭-G.\n        *   On the second beat, it plays A♮-C and F#-A♮.\n\n4.  **Identify the Chord:** To identify the underlying harmony, we combine the notes from both hands. The primary structural notes, particularly those emphasized on the beat and within the bass, form the chord.\n    *   **Bass Note:** D\n    *   **Chord Tones:** Combining the most stable notes from both hands gives us D, F#, A♮, and C. The other notes (E♭, G, B♭ in the right hand) can be analyzed as non-chord tones (such as passing or neighbor tones) that decorate the main harmony.\n    *   **Chord Quality:** Stacking the identified notes (D, F#, A♮, C) in thirds reveals a D dominant seventh chord (D7).\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral Function:** Now, we relate this D7 chord to our home key of C minor.\n    *   The **dominant** chord in C minor is built on the fifth scale degree, which is G. This chord is G major (G-B♮-D) and is represented by the Roman numeral **V**.\n    *   The chord in measure 30 is D7. The D7 chord is the dominant of G (a D7 chord typically resolves to G major or G minor).\n    *   Since D7 is the dominant of G, and G is the V of C minor, the D7 chord functions as the **dominant of the dominant**.\n    *   This secondary dominant function is written as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\"). Because the chord is a dominant seventh, the complete Roman numeral is **V7/V**.\n\n6.  **Confirm with Context:** This V7/V harmony in measure 30 resolves as expected to the V chord (G major) in the following measure, measure 31, confirming the analysis.\n\n<<<V7/V>>>"
