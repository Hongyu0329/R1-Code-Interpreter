    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe most striking feature of the runestone in the image is that the runic inscription is carved within neatly ruled horizontal bands. This specific and somewhat unusual style is a major clue for identification. The runes themselves are of the Younger Futhark script, typical of the Viking Age. The carving appears clean and well-defined.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the visible runes.**\nTo identify the specific stone, we need to read parts of the inscription. Let's transcribe the clearest parts of the three visible rows of runes.\n\n*   **Top Row:** The row contains a name and a verb. We can discern the runes: `...ᚦᚢᚱᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ : ᚱᛁᛋᛏ...` (`...þurstain : rist...`). This transliterates to the name `Þorsteinn` (Þorsteinn) followed by a word separator and the beginning of a verb like `risti` or `raisti` (meaning \"carved\" or \"raised\").\n*   **Middle Row:** This row is less clear, but seems to contain words like `suni` (son) and `sin` (his).\n*   **Bottom Row:** This row provides a very clear and crucial clue. Reading from the left, we can see the runes: `ᚼᛅᚾ × ᚢᛅᛋ ...` (`han x uas ...`). This transliterates to the words `han vas` (Old Norse: `hann vas` or `hann var`), meaning \"he was\".\n\n**Step 3: Combine the clues and search for matching runestones.**\nWe are looking for an Ingvar runestone that has the following characteristics:\n1.  The inscription is arranged in horizontal bands.\n2.  The text includes the name `Þorsteinn` as the carver (`risti`).\n3.  The text includes the phrase `han vas` (\"he was\").\n\nLet's check known Ingvar runestones with these features.\n*   The \"ruled\" style significantly narrows down the possibilities. The most famous Ingvar stones with this style are Sö 281 in Strängnäs and U 785 in Tillinge.\n*   Let's compare our transcribed fragments with the known inscription of U 785 (the Tillinge stone).\n    *   The full inscription of U 785 is: `+ þurstain : risti * runaR * aftiR * ikul * sun * sin * han * uas * farin * maþ * ikuari * ...`\n    *   English translation: \"Þorsteinn carved the runes in memory of Ígull, his son. He had travelled with Ingvarr...\"\n*   Now, let's match our transcription to the U 785 inscription:\n    *   Our Top Row (`...þurstain : rist...`) perfectly matches the beginning of the U 785 inscription: `þurstain : risti...` (\"Þorsteinn carved...\").\n    *   Our Bottom Row (`han x uas...`) perfectly matches a later part of the U 785 inscription: `han * uas * farin...` (\"He was/had travelled...\").\n\nThe inscription on the other candidate, Sö 281, does not contain the phrase \"Þorsteinn carved...\" nor does the sequence `han vas` appear in the corresponding section.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe visual style (ruled bands) and the transcribed runic fragments (`Þorsteinn risti...` and `han vas...`) are a definitive match for the Ingvar runestone known as the Tillinge Runestone. Its official catalog ID is U 785.\n\n<<<U 785>>>"
