    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the book title.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a portion of an illustration. The main subject is a white, four-legged creature with a single horn on its forehead, which is identifiable as a unicorn. The unicorn has an ethereal, slightly blurry, and ghostly appearance. It seems to be in motion, running or galloping through a dark, shadowy background that suggests a forest. On the right side of the fragment, there is a large, textured pillar or part of a stone archway, which frames the scene with the unicorn.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to known literary works.**\nA unicorn appearing in a dark forest is a powerful image in fantasy literature. One of the most famous instances of such a scene occurs in the Harry Potter series. Specifically, in the first book, Harry has an encounter with a slain unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, where Lord Voldemort is drinking its blood. The description of the unicorn and the setting matches the general theme.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific book cover.**\nThe art style is distinctive and matches the illustrations done by Mary GrandPré for the original American editions of the Harry Potter series. Let's examine the cover of the first book, titled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States.\n*   The cover art for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* features a central image of Harry Potter on his broomstick, framed by a large stone archway.\n*   The fragment in the question is a detail from the left-hand side of this cover. The ghostly white unicorn is depicted running in the Forbidden Forest, visible through the arch.\n*   The pillar on the right of the fragment is the left side of the main stone arch on the cover.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the title.**\nBased on the direct match of the artwork fragment with the cover illustrated by Mary GrandPré, the book is the first installment of the Harry Potter series. The title of the book that features this specific cover art is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. (Note: The original UK title is *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, but this particular cover art was created for the US release).\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
