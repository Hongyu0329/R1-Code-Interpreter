    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the name of the island where the plant is endemic.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant**\nThe first step is to identify the plant shown in the image. The most distinctive feature is its leaves.\n*   **Leaf Appearance:** The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a leathery texture.\n*   **Vein Pattern:** The most striking characteristic is the very prominent and intricate network of pale green or white veins that covers the leaf surface, creating a reticulated or \"cracked-glaze\" pattern. This pattern is called reticulate venation.\n*   **Leaf Shape and Arrangement:** The leaves are elliptical to ovate and appear to be arranged in opposite pairs or in whorls around the stem.\n*   **Overall Habit:** The woody stems and leaf arrangement suggest that this is a shrub or a small tree.\n\nBased on these features, a search for plants with prominent reticulate venation leads to a very strong candidate: ***Myrsine cheesemanii*** (also known as *Suttonia cheesemanii*). This plant is famous for its unique and decorative foliage, which perfectly matches the image.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Plant's Native Habitat**\nOnce the plant is identified as *Myrsine cheesemanii*, the next step is to find out where it is native. An endemic species is one that is found exclusively in a specific geographic area.\n*   **Geographic Origin:** Researching the distribution of *Myrsine cheesemanii* in botanical databases (such as the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network) confirms its origin.\n*   **Endemic Status:** *Myrsine cheesemanii* is documented as being endemic to New Zealand.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Island**\nThe question specifically asks for the name of the island.\n*   **Distribution within New Zealand:** While the species is endemic to the country of New Zealand, its natural range is restricted to a very specific, small location.\n*   **Specific Location:** Botanical sources state that *Myrsine cheesemanii* is endemic to the **Three Kings Islands** (ManawatƒÅwhi), a group of small islands located about 55 kilometers northwest of Cape Reinga, the northernmost point of the North Island of New Zealand. The plant is found on several islands within this archipelago, not just a single one. Since the question asks for \"the island,\" the name of the island group is the correct and specific answer defining its endemic range.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The venation pattern is the most critical clue for identification. It is highly unusual and distinctive.\n*   Distinguishing between similar-looking plants is important. While other plants might have variegated or patterned leaves, the specific \"crackle\" network of veins is characteristic of *Myrsine cheesemanii*.\n*   The term \"endemic\" is key. The plant must be native exclusively to the location in question.\n*   The question asks for \"the island\" in the singular, but the plant is endemic to an archipelago (a group of islands). In this context, naming the island group is the most accurate and complete answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the plant as *Myrsine cheesemanii* and researching its native distribution, we can conclude that it is endemic to the Three Kings Islands.\n\n<<<Three Kings Islands>>>"
