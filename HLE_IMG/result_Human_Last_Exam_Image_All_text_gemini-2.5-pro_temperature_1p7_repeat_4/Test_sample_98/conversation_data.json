    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image shows a medallion-like object featuring two portraits facing each other. This composition is known as \"confronted busts\". The image is a black and white photograph, possibly of an original artifact or a plaster cast of one.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Iconography:** The most crucial detail is on the male figure to the left. He has a distinct ram's horn curling around his ear. In the ancient world, the ram's horn is the primary symbol of the Egyptian god Amun, who was syncretized by the Greeks into Zeus-Ammon. Alexander the Great was famously depicted with these horns after being declared the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Siwa Oasis. Subsequent Hellenistic rulers, especially the Ptolemies in Egypt, adopted this iconography to associate themselves with Alexander and claim divine lineage.\n\n3.  **Determine the Historical Context:** The style of portraiture, with its blend of idealism and naturalism, is characteristic of the Hellenistic period (c. 323 BC - 31 BC). The practice of depicting a ruling couple, often a brother and sister, on coins and medallions was a signature policy of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt after Alexander's death.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Rulers:** Based on stylistic comparison with other known artifacts, such as the Gonzaga Cameo, these portraits are identified as Ptolemy II Philadelphos and his sister-wife, Arsinoe II. They were deified during their lifetimes as the *Theoi Adelphoi* (\"Brother-Sister Gods\"), and their joint portraits were widely circulated to promote their royal cult. The object shown is a well-known glass paste medallion from this period.\n\n5.  **Establish the Date:** Ptolemy II Philadelphos reigned from 283 BC to 246 BC. The medallion would have been produced during his reign. This entire period falls within the 3rd century BC.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Archaeologists and art historians firmly place this medallion and similar objects from the reign of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II in the 3rd century BC.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
