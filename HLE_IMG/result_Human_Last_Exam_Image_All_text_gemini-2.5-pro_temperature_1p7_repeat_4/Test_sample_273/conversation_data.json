    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the main carbon chain according to IUPAC nomenclature.**\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. We can visually inspect the molecule to find them.\n    *   The carbon bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to -OH, a methyl group (-CH3), an implicit hydrogen (-H), and the rest of the molecule. These are four different groups, so it is a chiral center.\n    *   The carbon bonded to the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the ethyl group, an implicit hydrogen (-H), and two different parts of the carbon chain. These are four different groups, so it is a chiral center.\n    *   The carbon bonded to the methyl (-CH3) and aminoethyl (-CH2NH2) groups is attached to -CH3, -CH2NH2, an implicit hydrogen (-H), and the rest of the molecule. These are four different groups, so it is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has three chiral centers.\n\n2.  **Determine the Main Carbon Chain and Numbering (IUPAC Rules):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the main chain must contain the carbon atom bonded to it (let's call it C-OH). The name will end in \"-ol\".\n    *   We need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes C-OH.\n    *   There are three possible 5-carbon chains containing C-OH. IUPAC rules state that if there are multiple chains of the same maximum length, we should choose the one with the most substituents.\n    *   Chain choice A: `CH3(from Et)-CH2(from Et)-C-C(OH)-CH3(left)`. This gives a pentan-2-ol backbone with one complex substituent on C3: `(1-aminopropan-2-yl)`.\n    *   Chain choice B: `CH3(from left)-C(OH)-C-C(from right)-CH3(from right)`. This gives a pentan-2-ol backbone with two substituents: an ethyl group on C3 and an aminomethyl group on C4.\n    *   Chain choice C: `CH3(from left)-C(OH)-C(with Et)-C(with Me)-C(in CH2NH2)`. This gives a pentan-2-ol backbone with three substituents: an ethyl group on C3, a methyl group on C4, and an amino group on C5.\n    *   Chain C has the most substituents (three) and is therefore the correct principal chain.\n    *   Numbering: To give the -OH group the lowest possible number, we number the chain from the left.\n        *   C1: The leftmost methyl group.\n        *   C2: The carbon with the -OH group.\n        *   C3: The carbon with the ethyl substituent.\n        *   C4: The carbon with the methyl substituent.\n        *   C5: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Priorities to the Groups on Each Chiral Center (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules).**\n\n*   **Chiral Center C2:**\n    *   Groups: -OH, -CH3 (C1), -C3H(Et)(C4...), -H.\n    *   Priorities (by atomic number of the atom directly attached):\n        1.  -OH (O > C > H)\n        2.  -C3H(Et)(C4...) (C bonded to C,C,H)\n        3.  -CH3 (C bonded to H,H,H)\n        4.  -H\n*   **Chiral Center C3:**\n    *   Groups: -C2H(OH)CH3, -C4H(Me)(C5...), -CH2CH3 (Ethyl), -H.\n    *   Priorities (comparing atoms at first point of difference):\n        1.  -C2H(OH)CH3 (C bonded to O,C,H)\n        2.  -C4H(Me)(C5...) (C bonded to C,C,H - note C5 is bonded to N, so C4 is C(C,C(N),H))\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (C bonded to C,H,H)\n        4.  -H\n*   **Chiral Center C4:**\n    *   Groups: -C5H2NH2, -C3H(Et)(C2...), -CH3, -H.\n    *   Priorities:\n        1.  -C5H2NH2 (C bonded to N,H,H)\n        2.  -C3H(Et)(C2...) (C bonded to C,C,H)\n        3.  -CH3 (C bonded to H,H,H)\n        4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S) for Each Chiral Center.**\n\n*   **Configuration at C2:**\n    *   Geometry from the drawing: The -OH and -CH3 groups are on dashed wedges (pointing away/back). The bond to C3 is in the plane. For tetrahedral geometry, the implicit -H must be on a solid wedge (pointing towards you/front).\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing forward.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3: -OH (back) -> -C3 (plane right) -> -CH3 (back). This traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is forward, we reverse the result. CW (R) becomes S.\n    *   **The configuration at C2 is (S).**\n\n*   **Configuration at C3:**\n    *   Geometry from the drawing: The ethyl group is on a solid wedge (front). The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. The implicit -H must be on a dashed wedge (back).\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing back.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3: -C2 (left) -> -C4 (right) -> -Ethyl (up/front). This traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is back, the result is what we see.\n    *   **The configuration at C3 is (R).**\n\n*   **Configuration at C4:**\n    *   Geometry from the drawing: The C4-C5 bond (the bond to the CH2NH2 group) is on a solid wedge (front). The substituent -CH3 group is on a dashed wedge (back). The bond to C3 is in the plane. The implicit -H must also be in the plane.\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can use the swap method. Swap the lowest priority group (-H, #4) with the group pointing back (-CH3, #3).\n    *   In the swapped molecule, -H is back and -CH3 is in the plane.\n    *   Trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 in the swapped molecule: -C5 (front) -> -C3 (plane left) -> -CH3 (plane up). This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    *   The configuration of the swapped molecule is (S).\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   **The configuration at C4 is (R).**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the three chiral centers are C2=(S), C3=(R), and C4=(R).\n\nSo, the full stereochemical descriptor for the molecule is **(2S, 3R, 4R)**.\n\n<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>>"
