    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion (M+) peak is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Therefore, the compound contains at least one nitrogen atom.\n*   A plausible molecular formula that fits the molecular weight of 135 and contains a nitrogen atom is C9H13N (9 × 12.01 + 13 × 1.01 + 1 × 14.01 ≈ 135).\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) for C9H13N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible, which are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹ (~2850-2960 cm⁻¹):** Peaks corresponding to aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹, ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700 cm⁻¹ and ~740 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in the out-of-plane bending region, characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a monosubstituted benzene ring, aliphatic groups, and a primary amine (-NH2) functional group.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** These are the five protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n*   **δ ~2.85 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **δ ~2.75 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine (-CH-) group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl (-CH3) group coupled to a single proton. This indicates a `-CH-CH3` fragment.\n*   The remaining 2 protons required by the formula C9H13N are from the -NH2 group. These signals are often broad and may not be clearly resolved or integrated.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of 13C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **13C Signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. There are 7 signals for 9 carbons, implying some carbons are equivalent, which is consistent with a monosubstituted ring.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   **Negative Signal:** Indicates one CH2 group.\n    *   **Positive Signals:** Indicate CH and CH3 groups. There are 5 such groups.\n    *   **Absent Signal:** Quaternary carbons do not appear. The signal at 145.1 ppm must be the quaternary ipso-carbon of the benzene ring.\n*   The side chain consists of one -CH3, one -CH, and one -CH2 group.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation using all data, including HSQC**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates directly bonded 1H and 13C nuclei.\n*   The 3H doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm correlates with the 13C signal at **19.2 ppm**. This is the -CH3 group.\n*   The 1H multiplet at δ ~2.75 ppm correlates with the 13C signal at **49.6 ppm**. This is the -CH group.\n*   The 2H multiplet at δ ~2.85 ppm correlates with the 13C signal at **43.5 ppm**. This must be the -CH2 group (which gives the negative DEPT-135 signal).\n\nWe can now assemble the fragments: C6H5-, -CH-, -CH2-, -CH3, and -NH2.\nThere are two possible isomers:\n1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3\n2.  **2-phenyl-1-propanamine:** C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2\n\nLet's check the assignments against the chemical shifts:\n*   In structure 1, the CH group is bonded to the nitrogen (C-N), and the CH2 group is benzylic (C6H5-C). The expected chemical shifts are `δC(C-N) ≈ 50-60 ppm` and `δC(C6H5-C) ≈ 40-45 ppm`.\n    *   Our data shows: CH at 49.6 ppm and CH2 at 43.5 ppm. This is an excellent match for structure 1.\n*   In structure 2, the CH group is benzylic, and the CH2 group is bonded to nitrogen. The expected chemical shifts would be `δC(C6H5-C) ≈ 40-45 ppm` and `δC(C-N) ≈ 45-55 ppm`.\n    *   Our data would require assigning the CH to 49.6 ppm and CH2 to 43.5 ppm, which does not fit the expected chemical shifts well.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to the structure being **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Name**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine.\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   The amine is on carbon 2, so the parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached as a substituent on carbon 1.\n*   The complete IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
