    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Context:** The score is from Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397. The question asks for a Roman numeral analysis of the circled notes in measure 8.\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature is one flat (B♭), which indicates the key of D minor or F major. The piece's overall tonic is D, establishing the key as D minor.\n    *   **Measure Identification:** The number '8' on the left side of the score points to the system containing measure 8. Counting from the beginning, the circled notes are indeed in the eighth full measure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** The circled notes are in the bass clef.\n    *   Reading the notes from bottom to top as they are written, they form an arpeggiated chord: C♯, E, G, B♭.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord Quality:** To identify the chord, we stack the notes into thirds.\n    *   The notes are C♯, E, G, B♭.\n    *   The interval from C♯ to E is a minor third.\n    *   The interval from E to G is a minor third.\n    *   The interval from G to B♭ is a minor third.\n    *   A chord built entirely of stacked minor thirds is a **fully diminished seventh chord**. The root of this chord is the lowest note, C♯. So, this is a C♯ diminished seventh chord (C♯dim7).\n\n4.  **Determine the Chord's Function in the Key of D minor:**\n    *   In the key of D minor, the tonic is D.\n    *   We use the harmonic minor scale to build dominant-function chords, which includes a raised 7th degree. The D harmonic minor scale is: D, E, F, G, A, B♭, C♯.\n    *   The leading tone (the 7th degree) of D minor is C♯.\n    *   The circled chord, C♯-E-G-B♭, is built on the leading tone, C♯.\n\n5.  **Assign the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a chord built on the seventh degree of the scale is **vii**.\n    *   Since the chord is a fully diminished seventh chord, we use the symbols '°' for diminished and '7' for the seventh.\n    *   Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is **vii°7**.\n    *   The chord is in root position because the root (C♯) is in the bass.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Signature and Accidentals:** Always check the key signature (one flat for D minor) and any accidentals within the measure (the C♯ is an accidental that confirms the use of the harmonic minor's leading tone).\n*   **Chord Function vs. Chord Name:** While the chord is a C♯dim7, the question asks for the Roman numeral, which describes its function within the key of D minor.\n*   **Leading-Tone Chord:** Recognizing that C♯ is the leading tone of D minor is the crucial step to correctly identifying the chord's function.\n*   **Relationship to the Dominant:** The vii°7 chord (C♯-E-G-B♭) is functionally very similar to the dominant seventh chord with a flatted ninth (V⁹♭). The V⁹♭ chord in D minor would be A-C♯-E-G-B♭. The vii°7 is essentially a V⁹♭ chord without the root (A). This close relationship reinforces its strong pull towards the tonic (i). However, the standard and most accurate analysis for the notes present is vii°7.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Key: D minor\n- Notes: C♯, E, G, B♭\n- Chord: C♯ diminished seventh\n- Root of Chord: C♯, which is the leading tone (scale degree vii) in D minor.\n- Roman Numeral: vii°7\n\n<<<vii°7>>>"
