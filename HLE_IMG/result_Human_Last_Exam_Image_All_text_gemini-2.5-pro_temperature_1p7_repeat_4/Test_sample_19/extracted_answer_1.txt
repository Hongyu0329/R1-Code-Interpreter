1. The music modulates to the key of **E Major**. The chord at the beginning of measure 12 is a B Major chord, which functions as the dominant (V) of the new key, E Major.

2. The home key is C# minor. The key of E Major is its **relative major**. This is a standard and structurally significant modulation in sonata form, moving from the tonic minor (i) to the relative major (III) to provide harmonic contrast for the second thematic area.

3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the harmony on the first beat of measure 11 is **viiÂ°/V**. The chord is an F## diminished triad, which functions as the secondary leading-tone chord to the dominant (V, which is G#) of the home key, C# minor.
