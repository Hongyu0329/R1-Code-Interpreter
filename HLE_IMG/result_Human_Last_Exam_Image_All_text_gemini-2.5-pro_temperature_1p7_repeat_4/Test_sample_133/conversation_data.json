    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺•):**\n    *   The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the high mass end. The most significant peaks in this region listed in the table are at m/z 258 (I=17.4%), 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), and 264 (I=12.9%).\n    *   The highest m/z value with a non-negligible intensity that could represent the molecular ion is typically considered. Let's assume the peak at m/z 262 represents the molecular ion containing the most common isotopes, [M]⁺•. This means the monoisotopic mass of the compound is 262 u.\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms:**\n    *   The presence of multiple peaks in clusters (e.g., M, M+2, M+4) strongly suggests the presence of isotopes, particularly chlorine (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) or bromine (⁷⁹Br:⁸¹Br ≈ 1:1).\n    *   Let's analyze a clear fragment cluster. The peaks at m/z 227 and m/z 229 have intensities of 66.7% and 22.2%, respectively.\n    *   The ratio of these intensities is I(227) / I(229) = 66.7 / 22.2 ≈ 3.00.\n    *   A 3:1 intensity ratio is the characteristic signature for a species containing **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   This implies that the fragment responsible for the peaks at m/z 227/229 contains one chlorine atom.\n\n3.  **Deduce a Major Fragmentation Pathway:**\n    *   A very common fragmentation for halogenated compounds is the loss of a halogen radical (X•).\n    *   Let's assume the fragment at m/z 227, [F]⁺, is formed from the molecular ion, [M]⁺•, by the loss of a chlorine atom: [M]⁺• → [M-Cl]⁺ + Cl•.\n    *   If [M-Cl]⁺ has one chlorine atom (as deduced in step 2), the original molecule M must have had **two chlorine atoms**.\n    *   Let's verify this pathway with masses. If the molecular ion with two ³⁵Cl atoms is at m/z 262 ([R³⁵Cl₂]⁺•), then losing one ³⁵Cl radical would yield a fragment [R³⁵Cl]⁺ at m/z 262 - 35 = 227. This matches the observed peak at m/z 227.\n    *   The M+2 peak of the molecule, [R³⁵Cl³⁷Cl]⁺•, is at m/z 264. Losing a ³⁷Cl radical gives [R³⁵Cl]⁺ at m/z 227. Losing a ³⁵Cl radical gives [R³⁷Cl]⁺ at m/z 229. This explains the presence and origin of the m/z 227 and 229 peaks as an isotopic pair for the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Base Peak and its Origin:**\n    *   The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z 225 with 100% relative intensity.\n    *   It is located 2 mass units below the prominent [M-Cl]⁺ fragment at m/z 227.\n    *   This suggests that the base peak is formed by the loss of two hydrogen atoms from the m/z 227 fragment: [M-Cl]⁺ → [M-Cl-2H]⁺ + 2H•. The loss of H₂ or 2H• is a common process that leads to a more stable, highly unsaturated or cyclized cation.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have established that the molecule contains two chlorine atoms and its monoisotopic mass is 262 u.\n    *   The mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms is 2 * 35 = 70 u.\n    *   The mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule (let's call it R) is 262 - 70 = 192 u.\n    *   We need to find a chemically plausible formula for a radical R with a mass of 192 u, likely composed of carbon, hydrogen, and possibly oxygen.\n    *   Let's test formulas: C₁₆H₀ (16*12 = 192). C₁₅H₁₂ (15*12 + 12*1 = 180 + 12 = 192). C₁₄H₂₄ (14*12 + 24*1 = 168 + 24 = 192).\n    *   A formula of **C₁₅H₁₂** for the non-halogen part is highly plausible for a compound analyzed by MS, as it suggests a stable aromatic or polycyclic structure. The corresponding parent hydrocarbon would be C₁₅H₁₄.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n    *   Let's check the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE): DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) = 15 + 1 - (12/2) - (2/2) = 16 - 6 - 1 = 9. This high DBE value is consistent with a polycyclic aromatic structure.\n\n6.  **Identify the Compound and Propose IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ corresponds to a dichlorinated derivative of a C₁₅H₁₄ hydrocarbon.\n    *   We need to find a compound with this formula that matches the observed fragmentation.\n    *   A plausible structure is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)propene**.\n        *   Structure: Two 4-chlorophenyl rings attached to the first carbon of a propene chain. (4-Cl-C₆H₄)₂C=CH-CH₃.\n        *   Formula Check: Each C₆H₄Cl ring is C₆H₄Cl. Two rings make C₁₂H₈Cl₂. The C=CH-CH₃ part is C₃H₄. Total: C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. This matches.\n        *   Fragmentation Check: The molecular ion at m/z 262 is plausible. The loss of a chlorine radical to form a stable cation at m/z 227 is a very likely fragmentation step. Subsequent loss of 2H to form an even more stable ion at m/z 225 (the base peak) is also reasonable.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for this compound is based on the longest carbon chain, which is propene.\n    *   The name is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1-propene**.\n\nFinal check: This analysis is internally consistent and leads to a specific, identifiable compound whose formula and likely fragmentation match the spectral data.\n\n<<<1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1-propene>>>"
