    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase painting. The style is red-figure with added white and yellow paint, characteristic of South Italian pottery from the Classical period (around the 4th century BCE). The scene depicts several figures in a dramatic composition.\n    *   **Central figures:** There is a chariot at the center. In the chariot sits a figure wearing an ornate, patterned costume and an Eastern-style headdress (a Phrygian cap). This figure is driving the chariot, holding the reins. This person is carrying another figure, who is draped entirely in white cloth and appears limp or lifeless.\n    *   **Figure on the ground:** Below and slightly in front of the chariot wheel lies a nude male figure, seemingly dead or dying. His body is contorted.\n    *   **Animal pulling the chariot:** To the left, part of an animal is visible. Above the driver, a large white wing is prominent. This suggests the chariot is pulled by a mythical winged creature, like a serpent or dragon, rather than a horse.\n    *   **Context:** The elaborate dress of the driver, the mythical chariot, and the scene of death strongly suggest a mythological story. The driver's Phrygian cap often signifies a foreigner or someone from the East in Greek art.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological scene.**\n    This specific combination of elements is a well-known depiction of a famous myth: Medea's escape from Corinth.\n    *   **The Myth:** Medea, a sorceress from Colchis (considered \"the East\"), helped Jason obtain the Golden Fleece. When Jason later abandoned her in Corinth to marry a Greek princess, Medea took horrific revenge. She murdered Jason's new bride and the bride's father, and then, to inflict the ultimate pain on Jason, she killed the two sons she had with him. Finally, she escaped from Corinth in a magical, flying chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios, taking the bodies of her children with her.\n    *   **Mapping the myth to the image:**\n        *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Medea**. The non-Greek clothing identifies her as the foreign sorceress.\n        *   The chariot pulled by winged creatures is her magical chariot from Helios.\n        *   The nude figure on the ground is **one of her murdered sons**.\n        *   The limp, white-draped figure she is carrying in the chariot is **her other murdered son**. She took their bodies to deny Jason the right to bury them.\n\n*   **Step 3: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question is: \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" This phrasing is slightly ambiguous.\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** It could refer to the figure on the ground. This boy has been cast out of or run over by the chariot as Medea flees. He has been \"left\" behind on the ground.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** It could refer to the figure being carried inside the chariot, but this figure is not actively \"leaving\"; rather, he is being transported away.\n    *   **Interpretation 3:** It could refer to Medea herself, who is \"leaving\" Corinth in the chariot. However, the question asks about a figure leaving *the chariot* itself, not a location.\n\n    Given the composition, where the chariot is moving away and the figure on the ground is static and separate, the most logical interpretation is that the question refers to the boy on the ground. He has violently and permanently \"left\" the chariot and the living. In either case (the boy on the ground or the boy in her arms), the identity is the same in terms of their role in the story.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The figure leaving (or having left) the chariot is one of Medea's sons, murdered by her as part of her revenge against Jason.\n\n<<<One of the sons of Medea>>>"
