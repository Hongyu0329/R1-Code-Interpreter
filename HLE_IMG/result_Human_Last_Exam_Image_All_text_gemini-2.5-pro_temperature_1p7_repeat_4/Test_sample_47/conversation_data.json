    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the current I.\n\n**1. Understand the Circuit Diagram**\nFirst, we need to interpret the circuit diagram and identify the connections between the components. This circuit consists of a DC voltage source and five resistors. Let's label the important nodes (junctions) in the circuit.\n*   **Node 1:** The top horizontal wire connected to the positive terminal of the 41 V battery. The potential at this node is V₁ = 41 V.\n*   **Node 2:** The bottom horizontal wire connected to the negative terminal of the battery and to ground. The potential at this node is V₂ = 0 V.\n*   **Node L:** The junction on the left side of the middle wire. The 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors meet here (or are connected to this node). Let's call its potential V_L.\n*   **Node R:** The junction on the right side of the middle wire. The 11 Ω, 29 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors meet here. Let's call its potential V_R.\n\nBased on this, the connections are as follows:\n*   The 76 Ω resistor is connected between Node 1 and Node L.\n*   The 8 Ω resistor is also connected between Node 1 and Node L. This means the 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are in parallel.\n*   The 14 Ω resistor is connected between Node L and Node R.\n*   The 11 Ω resistor is connected between Node 1 and Node R.\n*   The 29 Ω resistor is connected between Node R and Node 2.\nThe current `I` is indicated flowing from Node L to Node R through the 14 Ω resistor.\n\n**2. Simplify the Circuit**\nWe can simplify the parallel combination of the 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors into a single equivalent resistor, let's call it R_p.\nR_p = (R₁ * R₂) / (R₁ + R₂)\nR_p = (76 * 8) / (76 + 8) = 608 / 84 Ω\nTo simplify the fraction, divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 4):\nR_p = 152 / 21 Ω (approximately 7.238 Ω)\n\nNow, the simplified circuit has R_p connected between Node 1 and Node L.\n\n**3. Use Nodal Analysis**\nWe can find the unknown node potentials V_L and V_R using the Nodal Analysis method, which is based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL). KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving the node. We will set up equations for Node L and Node R.\n\n**Equation for Node L (potential V_L):**\nSum of currents leaving Node L = 0\nCurrent through R_p: (V_L - V₁) / R_p\nCurrent through the 14 Ω resistor: (V_L - V_R) / 14\nSo, the KCL equation is:\n(V_L - 41) / (152/21) + (V_L - V_R) / 14 = 0\n21 * (V_L - 41) / 152 + (V_L - V_R) / 14 = 0\nTo eliminate the denominators, we can multiply the entire equation by the least common multiple of 152 and 14, which is 1064.\n7 * 21 * (V_L - 41) + 76 * (V_L - V_R) = 0\n147 * (V_L - 41) + 76 * (V_L - V_R) = 0\n147*V_L - 6027 + 76*V_L - 76*V_R = 0\nCombining terms, we get our first equation:\n**223*V_L - 76*V_R = 6027  (Eq. 1)**\n\n**Equation for Node R (potential V_R):**\nSum of currents leaving Node R = 0\nCurrent through the 11 Ω resistor: (V_R - V₁) / 11\nCurrent through the 29 Ω resistor: (V_R - V₂) / 29\nCurrent through the 14 Ω resistor: (V_R - V_L) / 14\nSo, the KCL equation is:\n(V_R - 41) / 11 + (V_R - 0) / 29 + (V_R - V_L) / 14 = 0\nTo eliminate the denominators, we multiply by the LCM of 11, 29, and 14, which is 4466.\n406 * (V_R - 41) + 154 * V_R + 319 * (V_R - V_L) = 0\n406*V_R - 16646 + 154*V_R + 319*V_R - 319*V_L = 0\nCombining terms, we get our second equation:\n**-319*V_L + 879*V_R = 16646  (Eq. 2)**\n\n**4. Solve the System of Linear Equations**\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, V_L and V_R:\n1.  `223*V_L - 76*V_R = 6027`\n2.  `-319*V_L + 879*V_R = 16646`\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination.\nUsing a calculator or solving by hand (using Cramer's rule or substitution):\nMultiply Eq. 1 by 879 and Eq. 2 by 76:\n196017*V_L - 66764*V_R = 5297733\n-24244*V_L + 66764*V_R = 1265096\nAdding the two new equations eliminates V_R:\n(196017 - 24244)*V_L = 5297733 + 1265096\n171773*V_L = 6562829\nV_L = 6562829 / 171773 ≈ 38.206 V\n\nNow substitute V_L back into Eq. 1 to find V_R:\n223 * (38.206) - 76*V_R = 6027\n8520.1 - 76*V_R = 6027\n76*V_R = 8520.1 - 6027 = 2493.1\nV_R = 2493.1 / 76 ≈ 32.804 V\n\n**5. Calculate the Current I**\nThe current I is the current flowing from Node L to Node R through the 14 Ω resistor.\nI = (V_L - V_R) / 14\nI = (38.206 - 32.804) / 14\nI = 5.402 / 14\nI ≈ 0.3858 A\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives 0.39 A. Let's provide a more precise answer, typically to three significant figures.\n\nI ≈ 0.386 A\n\nFinal check: The potential at Node L (38.2 V) is higher than the potential at Node R (32.8 V), so the current flows from left to right as indicated by the arrow for I. The result is physically consistent.\n\nThe value of the current I is approximately 0.386 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.386>>>"
