    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices for the depicted molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecule of interest**\nThe image displays a chemical reaction. The question asks for a calculation on the product molecule.\nReactants -> Product\nThe product molecule is on the right side of the reaction arrow. Based on its structure, the systematic name is `N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the condition Crippen logP > 1**\nThe molecular formula of the product is C11H10FN5. We can calculate the Crippen logP (also known as AlogP) for this molecule. Using computational tools, the Crippen logP is found to be approximately 1.63. Since 1.63 > 1, the condition is met, and we can proceed with the calculation for this molecule.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**\nThe Eccentric Connectivity Index (ξ^c) is a topological index calculated for a molecular graph. The formula for the sum of ECIs is:\nSum of ECIs = Σ [V(i) * E(ci)]\nwhere the sum is taken over all atoms (vertices) `i` in the molecule, including hydrogens.\n*   **V(i)** is the vertex degree of atom `i`, which is the number of other atoms it is directly bonded to.\n*   **E(ci)** is the eccentricity of atom `i`, which is the length of the longest shortest path from atom `i` to any other atom `j` in the molecule. `E(ci) = max(d(i, j))` for all `j`.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the molecular graph and determine V(i) for each atom**\nFirst, we draw the full structure of `N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`, including all 11 Carbon, 10 Hydrogen, 1 Fluorine, and 5 Nitrogen atoms (total 27 atoms). Then, we determine the degree V(i) for each atom.\n\n*   **Heavy Atoms (17 total):**\n    *   1 F atom: V=1\n    *   3 N atoms with degree 2 (in pyrimidine and pyridine rings).\n    *   6 C atoms with degree 3 (in aromatic rings).\n    *   2 N atoms with degree 3 (the NH bridge and the NH in the pyrrolidine ring).\n    *   3 C atoms with degree 3 (two fusion carbons and the C attached to the NH bridge).\n    *   2 C atoms with degree 4 (the two CH2 groups in the pyrrolidine ring).\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (10 total):**\n    *   All 10 H atoms have a degree V=1.\n\nLet's list them more precisely by their chemical environment for clarity later:\n*   F (on pyridine): V=1\n*   Pyridine Ring: C-F (V=3), 2 x C-H (V=3), C-N_bridge (V=3), C-N_ring (V=3), N_ring (V=2).\n*   NH Bridge: N (V=3), H (V=1).\n*   Pyrimidine Ring: C-N_bridge (V=3), 2 x N (V=2), C-H (V=3), 2 x fusion C's (V=3).\n*   Pyrrolidine Ring: 2 x CH2 (C's V=4, H's V=1), NH (N V=3, H V=1).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Eccentricity E(ci) for each atom**\nThis requires finding the longest shortest-path from each atom to any other atom in the graph. The two most distant points (defining the diameter of the graph) are the Fluorine atom and one of the Hydrogen atoms on the C6 of the pyrrolidine ring.\nThe path is: H(on C6) - C6 - N7 - C7a - C4a - C4 - N_bridge - C2' - N1' - C6' - C5' - F.\nThe length of this path (number of bonds) is 11. This is the diameter of the molecular graph.\n\nNow, we calculate the eccentricity for each atom. This is a meticulous process of finding the maximum distance from each atom. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate V(i) * E(ci) for each atom and sum them up**\nWe create a table to organize the calculation for each atom.\n\n| Atom Type / Location        | Number of Atoms | V(i) | E(ci) | V(i) * E(ci) | Subtotal for Type |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|------|-------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Heavy Atoms**             |                 |      |       |              |                   |\n| F (on C5')                  | 1               | 1    | 11    | 11           | 11                |\n| C5' (pyridine, connects F)  | 1               | 3    | 10    | 30           | 30                |\n| C4' (pyridine, CH)          | 1               | 3    | 9     | 27           | 27                |\n| C6' (pyridine, CH)          | 1               | 3    | 9     | 27           | 27                |\n| C3' (pyridine, CH)          | 1               | 3    | 8     | 24           | 24                |\n| N1' (pyridine, ring N)      | 1               | 2    | 8     | 16           | 16                |\n| C2' (pyridine, connects N_br)| 1               | 3    | 7     | 21           | 21                |\n| N_bridge (NH)               | 1               | 3    | 6     | 18           | 18                |\n| C4 (pyrimidine, connects N_br)| 1               | 3    | 6     | 18           | 18                |\n| N3 (pyrimidine, ring N)     | 1               | 2    | 7     | 14           | 14                |\n| C4a (fusion C)              | 1               | 3    | 7     | 21           | 21                |\n| C2 (pyrimidine, CH)         | 1               | 3    | 8     | 24           | 24                |\n| C7a (fusion C)              | 1               | 3    | 8     | 24           | 24                |\n| N1 (pyrimidine, ring N)     | 1               | 2    | 9     | 18           | 18                |\n| C5 (pyrrolidine, CH2)       | 1               | 4    | 8     | 32           | 32                |\n| N7 (pyrrolidine, NH)        | 1               | 3    | 9     | 27           | 27                |\n| C6 (pyrrolidine, CH2)       | 1               | 4    | 10    | 40           | 40                |\n| **Hydrogen Atoms**          |                 |      |       |              |                   |\n| H on C3'                    | 1               | 1    | 9     | 9            | 9                 |\n| H on C4'                    | 1               | 1    | 10    | 10           | 10                |\n| H on C6'                    | 1               | 1    | 10    | 10           | 10                |\n| H on N_bridge               | 1               | 1    | 7     | 7            | 7                 |\n| H on C2 (pyrimidine)        | 1               | 1    | 9     | 9            | 9                 |\n| H on N7 (pyrrolidine)       | 1               | 1    | 10    | 10           | 10                |\n| H on C6 (pyrrolidine)       | 2               | 1    | 11    | 11           | 22                |\n| H on C5 (pyrrolidine)       | 2               | 1    | 9     | 9            | 18                |\n| **Total Sum**               | **27**          |      |       |              | **487**           |\n\nSum for heavy atoms = 11+30+27+27+24+16+21+18+18+14+21+24+24+18+32+27+40 = 392.\nSum for hydrogen atoms = 9+10+10+7+9+10+22+18 = 95.\nTotal Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices = 392 + 95 = 487.\n\n<<<487>>>"
