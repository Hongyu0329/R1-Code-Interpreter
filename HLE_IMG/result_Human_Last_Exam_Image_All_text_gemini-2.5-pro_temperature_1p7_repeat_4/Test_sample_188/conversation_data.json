    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph G**\n\n*   The graph G has 5 vertices (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 7 edges.\n*   The edges are: (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n*   We can analyze the graph by decomposing it into simpler parts. A good approach is to isolate a vertex and analyze the remaining subgraph.\n*   Let's remove vertex 1. The remaining subgraph, let's call it H, is induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The edges in H are all the edges of G that do not involve vertex 1. These are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n*   The complete graph on 4 vertices, K4, has 6 edges. The subgraph H has 5 edges on 4 vertices. The missing edge is (2, 5).\n*   So, H is a K4 graph with one edge removed, specifically H = K4 - e, where e = (2, 5).\n*   The original graph G can be seen as the graph H with an additional vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5 of H.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computing the chromatic polynomial**\n\nWe will use a decomposition method based on the structure identified in Step 1. The chromatic polynomial of G, P(G, k), can be calculated by considering the colorings of its subgraph H = G - {1}.\n\nLet C be a proper k-coloring of H. To extend this to a proper coloring of G, we need to color vertex 1. The color of vertex 1 must be different from the colors of its neighbors, which are 2 and 5.\n*   If C(2) = C(5), then vertex 1 has only one forbidden color. There are (k-1) choices for C(1).\n*   If C(2) ≠ C(5), then vertex 1 has two forbidden colors. There are (k-2) choices for C(1).\n\nLet N_=(k) be the number of proper k-colorings of H where C(2) = C(5).\nLet N_≠(k) be the number of proper k-colorings of H where C(2) ≠ C(5).\n\nThe total number of colorings for G is given by:\nP(G, k) = (k-1) * N_=(k) + (k-2) * N_≠(k)\n\nWe know that P(H, k) = N_=(k) + N_≠(k). So, N_≠(k) = P(H, k) - N_=(k).\nSubstituting this into the equation for P(G, k):\nP(G, k) = (k-1)N_=(k) + (k-2)(P(H, k) - N_=(k))\nP(G, k) = (k-1 - k+2)N_=(k) + (k-2)P(H, k)\nP(G, k) = N_=(k) + (k-2)P(H, k)\n\nNow we need to compute P(H, k) and N_=(k).\n\n**Step 3: Compute P(H, k)**\n\n*   H is the graph K4 - e, where e is any edge.\n*   We use the deletion-contraction formula on K4: P(K4, k) = P(K4 - e, k) - P(K4.e, k).\n*   Rearranging this gives: P(K4 - e, k) = P(K4, k) + P(K4.e, k).\n*   The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kn is P(Kn, k) = k(k-1)...(k-n+1).\n    So, P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n*   The graph K4.e is formed by contracting an edge in K4. Contracting any edge in K4 results in K3.\n    So, P(K4.e, k) = P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n*   Therefore, P(H, k) = P(K4 - e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2).\n*   P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\n**Step 4: Compute N_=(k)**\n\n*   N_=(k) is the number of proper k-colorings of H = K4 - (2,5) where C(2) = C(5).\n*   If C(2) = C(5), this is equivalent to calculating the chromatic polynomial of the graph H' which is formed by identifying (merging) vertices 2 and 5.\n*   The graph H' has vertices {v_25, 3, 4}, where v_25 is the merged vertex.\n*   An edge exists between v_25 and another vertex (say, 3) if there was an edge from 2 to 3 or from 5 to 3 in H.\n    *   Neighbors of 2 in H are {3, 4}.\n    *   Neighbors of 5 in H are {3, 4}.\n    *   So, v_25 is connected to 3 and 4.\n*   The edge (3, 4) also exists in H.\n*   Thus, H' has vertices {v_25, 3, 4} and edges {(v_25, 3), (v_25, 4), (3, 4)}. This is the complete graph K3.\n*   Therefore, N_=(k) = P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final polynomial P(G, k)**\n\n*   Substitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the formula from Step 2:\n    P(G, k) = N_=(k) + (k-2)P(H, k)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + (k-2) * [k(k-1)(k-2)^2]\n*   Simplify the expression by factoring out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [1 + (k-2)^2]\n*   Expand the term in the brackets:\n    1 + (k-2)^2 = 1 + (k^2 - 4k + 4) = k^2 - 4k + 5.\n*   So, the final chromatic polynomial is:\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nThis can also be expanded to its full form:\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\nThe factored form is generally preferred.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
