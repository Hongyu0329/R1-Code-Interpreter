    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the timestamps of synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Analysis of the graph**\n\nThe graph is a raster plot showing the firing activity of 128 electrodes over a period of about 52 seconds.\n*   **X-axis:** Time in seconds (s).\n*   **Y-axis:** Electrode Number (from 0 to 128).\n*   **Data:** Each dot represents a neuronal spike (firing).\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many electrodes fire in a short time window, which appears as a dense vertical band of dots on the plot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts**\n\nWe will visually scan the graph from left to right to identify the main synchronized bursts and estimate the time of their peak activity (center of the burst).\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** There is a sharp, dense burst at the beginning of the recording. Its center is approximately at **t1 = 1 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** A clear burst occurs after the 10 s mark. Its center is estimated to be at **t2 = 12 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** Another burst, slightly less dense but still distinct, is centered around **t3 = 21 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A very strong and prolonged burst is visible. It starts around 34 s and ends around 38 s. The center of this entire event is taken as the midpoint, at approximately **t4 = 36 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final major burst is located near the end of the recording, with its center at approximately **t5 = 47 s**.\n\nThe identified timestamps for the synchronized bursts are: 1 s, 12 s, 21 s, 36 s, and 47 s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the peaks of two consecutive bursts. We have identified 5 bursts, so there will be 4 intervals between them.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 1 s = 11 s\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 21 s - 12 s = 9 s\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 21 s = 15 s\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4.\n    IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 47 s - 36 s = 11 s\n\nThe calculated IBIs are 11 s, 9 s, 15 s, and 11 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval**\n\nThe average IBI is the sum of all individual IBIs divided by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 11 s + 9 s + 15 s + 11 s = 46 s\n*   Number of IBIs = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of IBIs) = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\n**Step 4: Round the answer to two significant figures**\n\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.5 s. This value has three significant figures (1, 1, and 5).\n*   To round to two significant figures, we look at the third significant figure, which is 5. According to standard rounding rules, if the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, the preceding digit is rounded up.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 s rounded to two significant figures is 12 s.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Identification:** The major, network-wide synchronized events were chosen. Smaller or less-synchronized events were excluded as they might not qualify as \"synchronized bursts\" in the same category.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The center of the burst's activity was estimated as its timestamp. This is a common and reasonable convention for events with a duration. The estimations were cross-checked for consistency.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic for calculating intervals and the average was performed carefully.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final answer was rounded according to the specified precision, applying the standard rule for rounding numbers ending in 5.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  **Burst timestamps:** 1 s, 12 s, 21 s, 36 s, 47 s.\n2.  **Inter-burst intervals (IBIs):** 11 s, 9 s, 15 s, 11 s.\n3.  **Average IBI:** (11 + 9 + 15 + 11) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s.\n4.  **Rounding to two significant figures:** 11.5 s is rounded to 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
