    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\n1.  **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some groups, like paper wasps, the tips of male antennae are hooked or curled.\n2.  **Abdomen:** Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), making the tip of their abdomen appear more pointed. Males have a more rounded or blunt abdominal tip. Also, males often have one more visible abdominal segment than females (e.g., 7 vs. 6).\n3.  **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their faces (clypeus) than females.\n4.  **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The question specifies these taxa lack scopae on their legs. This is a key clue. It applies to all males (as they don't provision nests), cuckoo bees/wasps (females are parasites and don't collect pollen), and bees that carry pollen internally (like Hylaeidae) or on a ventral scopa under the abdomen (like Megachilidae). Females of most other bee families have conspicuous pollen-carrying scopae on their hind legs.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be cuckoo bees, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. They are identifiable by their striking black and white/pale markings. As cuckoo bees, the females do not collect pollen and thus lack scopae, fitting the question's criteria.\n*   **Insect A (Left):**\n    *   **Abdomen:** The most telling feature is the abdomen. It tapers to a simple, conical point. This is characteristic of a female cuckoo bee. We can also count 6 visible abdominal segments, which is typical for a female.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):**\n    *   **Abdomen:** The tip of the abdomen is somewhat obscured, but it does not appear to have the same simple, pointed tip as the bee on the left. In *Triepeolus*, males have a bilobed or pronged tip (pseudopygidium). While not perfectly clear, its shape is different from the confirmed female on the left.\n    *   **Build:** The overall build and subtle differences in appearance suggest sexual dimorphism. Since the left bee is a female, the right bee is most likely the corresponding male.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male**.\n*   **Pair A Conclusion:** Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. They are common nectar feeders, and the females lack pollen-collecting scopae.\n*   **Insect B (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The tips of the antennae are distinctly hooked or curled. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are straight from base to tip, with no curl. This is characteristic of female paper wasps.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female**.\n*   **Pair B Conclusion:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Identification:** The \"no leg scopae\" rule is critical here. While they resemble long-horned bees (Eucerini), the females of that group have very large leg scopae. A better fit is the family Megachilidae (leafcutter bees and relatives), where females carry pollen on a ventral scopa under the abdomen, not on their legs.\n*   **Insect C (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are extremely long, much longer than the head. This is a classic trait of many male bees, including many Megachilidae.\n    *   **Face:** The clypeus (the plate on the \"face\" below the antennae) is a conspicuous light yellow/white color, another common feature of male bees.\n    *   **Legs:** The front legs appear to have pale, somewhat flattened tarsi (feet), a modification sometimes seen in males for grasping females.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are of standard length for a bee, not elongated like the male on the left. This is consistent with a female.\n    *   **Pollen Collection:** It is on a flower, and its body shape is robust like a female gathering provisions. As a Megachilid, she would be using her hidden ventral scopa, which is consistent with the lack of visible leg scopae.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female**.\n*   **Pair C Conclusion:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Female, Male (F, M) = Index **4**\n*   **Pair B:** Male, Female (M, F) = Index **3**\n*   **Pair C:** Male, Female (M, F) = Index **3**\n\nThe sequence of indices is 4, 3, 3.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
