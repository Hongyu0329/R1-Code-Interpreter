The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the conformational rigidity of its bicyclic M端nchnone intermediate. The starting material, N-acetyl-proline, forms a fused-ring M端nchnone where the bridge connecting the N3 and C4 positions prevents the reversible ring-opening/ring-closing equilibrium that occurs in the acyclic M端nchnone of Reaction 2. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial because they establish that while the cycloaddition step is inherently regioselective (Reaction 1), the acyclic M端nchnone intermediate can scramble its C2 and C4 substituents (Reaction 2). Because this scrambling is impossible for the locked bicyclic intermediate in Reaction 3, the inherent regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is exclusively expressed, leading to a single product.
