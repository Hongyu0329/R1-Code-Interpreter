    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the key terms.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the sporophyte stage between two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, that allows for easy visual distinction. The \"sporophyte\" in mosses is the structure that produces spores and typically consists of a capsule (which holds the spores), a seta (the stalk), and a foot (which anchors it to the leafy gametophyte).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the names of the species for clues.**\nThe scientific names of organisms often provide descriptive clues.\n*   *Grimmia montana*: \"montana\" refers to mountains, indicating its habitat. It doesn't give a strong clue about its morphology.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta*: This name is very informative. \"Curvi\" is from the Latin *curvus* meaning \"curved\" or \"bent\". \"Seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name *curviseta* directly translates to \"curved stalk\".\n\n**Step 3: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   **Seta (Stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short and, most importantly, **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is \"immersed\" or \"emergent\". This means it sits upright, nestled within the upper leaves (perichaetial leaves) of the moss plant, as seen in the provided image. It does not project far out from the main clump of leaves.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   **Seta (Stalk):** As its name suggests, the defining feature of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its **distinctly curved (arcuate) seta**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** The curved seta causes the capsule to be pushed out from the leaves (\"exserted\") and then hang downwards or to the side in a nodding or pendent position. It doesn't sit upright within the leaves.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the main distinguishing feature.**\nThe primary and most obvious difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the shape and length of the seta, which in turn dictates the position of the capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an **upright, immersed capsule**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a **longer, strongly curved seta**, resulting in an **exserted, nodding or pendent capsule**.\n\nThis single feature—a straight vs. curved seta—is the key difference that allows one to distinguish between the two species \"at a glance\" when they are fertile.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed and sit upright among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its defining characteristic: a strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes its capsule to be exserted (pushed out from the leaves) and hang in a nodding or pendent position.>>>"
