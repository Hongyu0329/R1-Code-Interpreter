The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed and sit upright among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its defining characteristic: a strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes its capsule to be exserted (pushed out from the leaves) and hang in a nodding or pendent position.
