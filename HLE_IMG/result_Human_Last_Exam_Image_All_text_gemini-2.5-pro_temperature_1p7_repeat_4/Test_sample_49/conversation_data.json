    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency, often denoted as $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second) or $f_c$ (in Hertz), characterizes the boundary between the passband and stopband of a filter. For a simple first-order low-pass filter, it is the frequency at which the output signal's power is reduced to half of its DC (or low-frequency) value. This corresponds to the output voltage magnitude dropping to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ (or approximately -3 dB) of its DC value.\n\nThe given circuit acts as a low-pass filter because the output is taken across a capacitor `C` connected to ground. The general method to find the cutoff frequency for such a configuration is to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\nWe need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, and the Thevenin equivalent voltage, $V_{th}$, at the terminals of the capacitor `C` (i.e., between node $a_0$ and ground).\nThe circuit then simplifies to a standard RC low-pass filter:\n- A voltage source $V_{th}(s)$\n- In series with a resistor $R_{th}$\n- Both connected across the capacitor `C`.\n\nThe transfer function for this simplified circuit is $V_{out}/V_{th} = \\frac{1}{1+sR_{th}C}$. The cutoff frequency is given by the pole of this transfer function, which is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\nTherefore, our primary task is to calculate the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to:\n1. De-activate independent sources. The input voltage source `IN` is connected to node $c_0$. De-activating a voltage source means replacing it with a short circuit, so we ground node $c_0$.\n2. Remove the capacitor `C`.\n3. Calculate the equivalent resistance seen from node $a_0$ to ground.\n\nLooking into the circuit from node $a_0$:\n- There is a resistor `r` connecting node $a_0$ to node $d_1$.\n- The rest of the network is the infinite ladder connected to $d_1$ and other nodes, with $c_0$ being grounded.\nSo, the Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = r + R_{d1\\_gnd}$, where $R_{d1\\_gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance from node $d_1$ to ground (node $c_0$).\n\n**4. Calculating $R_{d1\\_gnd}$**\n$R_{d1\\_gnd}$ is the resistance between node $d_1$ and node $c_0$ in the infinite ladder network. This is a classic problem in resistive network theory. We can solve it using the method of superposition of common and differential modes for the voltage distribution in the ladder.\n\nLet's model the ladder as being infinite in both directions (from $n=-\\infty$ to $n=+\\infty$), which is a good approximation for a semi-infinite ladder when calculating resistance not too far from the boundary. We want to find the resistance between $d_1$ and $c_0$, which we'll denote as $R(d_1, c_0)$.\n\nLet's inject a current $I$ at node $d_1$ and extract it at node $c_0$. Let $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$. We need to find the voltage difference $u_1 - v_0$. Then $R(d_1, c_0) = (u_1 - v_0)/I$.\n\nThis problem can be solved by decomposing the network's behavior into a sum (common) mode $S_n = v_n + u_n$ and a difference (differential) mode $D_n = v_n - u_n$. The modes satisfy the following recurrence relations when driven by the current sources:\n- **Sum Mode:** $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = -r(J_{cn} + J_{dn})$\n- **Difference Mode:** $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = -r(J_{cn} - J_{dn})$\n\nThe current injection corresponds to $J_{d1}=I$ and $J_{c0}=-I$.\nSolving these difference equations for the potentials and combining them leads to the result for the resistance between nodes $d_1$ and $c_0$. This is a non-trivial derivation, and the result for an infinite ladder is:\n$R_{d1\\_gnd} = R(d_1, c_0) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$.\n\nThis is a known result for the resistance between diagonally adjacent nodes in a 2 x infinity resistive grid of equal resistors `r`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nNow we can calculate the total Thevenin resistance:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1\\_gnd} = r + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r = r\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we substitute $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff frequency:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)C}$\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{2}{rC(2 + \\sqrt{3})}$\n\nFurther rationalization gives:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{2(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{rC(2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{rC(4 - 3)} = \\frac{2(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{rC}$\n\nHowever, the form $\\frac{1}{rC(1 + \\sqrt{3}/2)}$ is also perfectly valid. Let's keep it in a form that clearly shows the steps.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)rC}$\n\nLet's present the answer in the rationalized form for elegance.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\n- Cutoff frequency formula: $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} C)$.\n- Thevenin Resistance: $R_{th} = r + R_{d1\\_gnd}$.\n- Resistance from $d_1$ to $c_0$: $R_{d1\\_gnd} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} r$.\n- $R_{th} = r(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$.\n- $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})C} = \\frac{2}{(2+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\nFinal expression: $\\omega_c = \\frac{2(2-\\sqrt{3})}{rC}$.\n\nFinal expression seems to be asked often in simpler forms. Let's provide the un-rationalized one as it is more direct.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})rC}$\n\nLet's provide the form $\\frac{2}{(2+\\sqrt{3})rC}$ which is cleaner than the one with fractions in the denominator.\n\n<<<$\\omega_c = \\frac{2}{(2+\\sqrt{3})rC}$>>>"
