    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes will exhibit \"shorter lifetimes\" when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). In the context of device applications like LECs or OLEDs, \"lifetime\" usually refers to the **operational lifetime**, which is a measure of the device's durability and is directly related to the chemical and photochemical stability of the emitter molecule. A shorter lifetime implies that the complex degrades more quickly under operating conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structures**\nAll four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) coordination compounds with the general formula [Ir(C^N)₂ (N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻.\n*   **Central Metal Ion:** Iridium(III) is the central metal ion.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** All four complexes have the same ancillary N^N ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). The tert-butyl groups mainly improve solubility and film morphology. Since this ligand is identical in all four complexes, it will not be the differentiating factor for their relative stabilities.\n*   **C^N Ligands:** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the 2- (ortho) and 4- (para) positions of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is the parent 2-phenylpyridine. It has no fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a single fluorine atom at the 2- (ortho) position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the 3- (meta) and 4- (para) positions of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Molecular Structure to Operational Lifetime (Stability)**\nThe operational lifetime of LECs based on these types of emitters is often limited by the chemical degradation of the complex. The primary factors influencing stability are the strengths of the chemical bonds within the ligands.\n*   **Bond Strength:** The carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond is significantly stronger (bond dissociation energy ≈ 485 kJ/mol) than the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond (≈ 413 kJ/mol). Replacing C-H bonds with C-F bonds on the ligand makes the molecule more resistant to chemical attack and degradation, thus increasing the operational lifetime.\n*   **Positional Importance of Fluorination:** Research in the field has shown that not all C-H bonds are equally vulnerable. One of the most susceptible sites for degradation on the phenylpyridine ligand is the C-H bond at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring (i.e., the C-H bond adjacent to the Ir-C bond). Placing a substituent, particularly a fluorine atom, at this position provides both steric hindrance and electronic stabilization, which significantly protects the complex from degradation pathways.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Complex Based on Stability Principles**\nLet's analyze the stability of each complex based on the presence or absence of the critical ortho-fluorine substituent.\n*   **Complex 1:** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho-position. This is a highly stabilizing feature. It also has a second fluorine at the para-position, further enhancing stability. This complex is expected to have a **long lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 2:** Has no fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring. All C-H bonds are present, including the vulnerable one at the ortho-position. This complex is expected to be the least stable and have the **shortest lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 3:** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho-position. This is the most critical position for stabilization. This complex is expected to have a **long lifetime**, although perhaps slightly shorter than Complex 1 which has an additional fluorine.\n*   **Complex 4:** Has two fluorine atoms, but critically, it lacks a fluorine at the ortho-position. The vulnerable ortho C-H bond is still present. While the meta and para fluorine atoms do provide some stabilization by strengthening the overall ligand structure, the absence of protection at the key ortho-position makes this complex significantly less stable than Complexes 1 and 3. Therefore, it is expected to have a **short lifetime**, although likely longer than Complex 2.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Answer**\nThe question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". Based on the analysis, the two complexes that lack the crucial ortho-fluorine stabilizing group are Complex 2 and Complex 4. They are the least stable and are therefore expected to degrade faster, leading to shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n*   **Long lifetime (more stable):** Complex 1, Complex 3 (due to ortho-fluorination)\n*   **Short lifetime (less stable):** Complex 2, Complex 4 (due to lack of ortho-fluorination)\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
