    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The score has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab Major or its relative minor, F minor.\n    *   **Tonic Center:** The piece begins and ends on chords rooted in F (F minor at the start, F at the end), and the progressions consistently resolve towards F minor. This confirms the key is F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 common time, typical for jazz standards.\n    *   **Form:** The structure appears to be AABA. There's an 8-bar A section that repeats (indicated by the 1st and 2nd endings), followed by an 8-bar B section (or \"bridge\"), and then a final 8-bar A section. This creates a 32-bar form, common for jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression):**\n    *   **A Section (Bars 1-8):**\n        *   `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`\n        *   `| C7 | F- | 1. C7 :|| 2. C7 |`\n        *   This progression is highly distinctive. The first four bars feature a chromatically descending bass line (F -> E -> Eb -> Db). This \"line cliché\" is a strong identifier. The specific chords used (F minor, E half-diminished 7, Eb minor 6, Db major 7) are characteristic of the bebop and hard bop eras. The G7 chord acts as a tritone substitution for Db7, creating a strong pull towards the C7 chord in the next measure. The C7 is the dominant (V) chord, leading back to the tonic F minor.\n    *   **B Section (Bridge - Bars 9-16, starting after the double bar line):**\n        *   `| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |`\n        *   `| Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n        *   This bridge features a series of sequential ii-V progressions and dominant chains.\n        *   `D-7b5 - G7` is a ii-V that leads to C minor or C major.\n        *   `C7 - F7` is a chain of dominant chords.\n        *   `Bb-7 - Eb7 - Ab` is a classic ii-V-I progression in the key of Ab major (the relative major of F minor).\n        *   `G - C7` is a common turnaround (II-V) to lead back to the tonic F minor for the final A section.\n\n3.  **Melodic Analysis:**\n    *   The melody is lyrical and built mostly on half notes and quarter notes, which contrasts with the complex harmony.\n    *   **A Section Melody:** The first phrase starts on the fifth of the key (C), descends, and outlines the harmony. For example, over the F- chord, the melody is C, F, G.\n    *   **Connecting Harmony and Melody:** The combination of a complex, chromatically descending chord progression with a simple, lyrical melody is a hallmark of the composer Tadd Dameron.\n\n4.  **Identification:**\n    *   The specific A section chord progression (`Fm | Eø7 | Ebm6 | Dbmaj7`) is the unmistakable signature of the Tadd Dameron composition **\"On a Misty Night\"**.\n    *   The bridge progression also perfectly matches the standard changes for \"On a Misty Night\".\n    *   Comparing the melody on the sheet music to known recordings and transcriptions of \"On a Misty Night\" confirms the identification. The melodic contour is identical.\n    *   The composer of \"On a Misty Night\" is **Tadd Dameron**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The handwriting on the lead sheet can be ambiguous, but the essential notes and chord roots are clear enough for identification. For example, `E-7b5` is the same chord as E half-diminished or `Eø7`. `Eb-6` is Eb minor 6.\n*   Minor variations in chord voicings or substitutions (like the `G7` in bar 4) are common in different versions of jazz lead sheets but do not change the core identity of the tune.\n*   Distinguishing this tune from other standards with similar features (e.g., \"Lady Bird\", also by Tadd Dameron, or other minor key tunes with descending bass lines) requires careful attention to both the A and B section progressions. The specific combination of both sections confirms the tune is \"On a Misty Night\".\n\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
