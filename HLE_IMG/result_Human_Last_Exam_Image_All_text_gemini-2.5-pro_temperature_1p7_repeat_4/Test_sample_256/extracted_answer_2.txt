True. In the upper right quadrant of the painting, there are characters that appear to be the letters "R" and "O" (or "N" and "O") from the Latin alphabet. This alphabet was not used by the ancient Southwest cultures that created the pictographs, meaning these letters are a later addition or graffiti.
