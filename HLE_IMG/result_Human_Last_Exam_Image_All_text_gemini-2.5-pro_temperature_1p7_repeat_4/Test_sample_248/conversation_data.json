    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the species that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organisms in the image.**\nThe photograph shows a wet, rocky surface typical of an intertidal zone. Several types of free-living marine invertebrates are visible:\n1.  **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, whitish-grey shells are attached to the rock. They cover a large portion of the surface. These are acorn barnacles.\n2.  **Large Snails:** Two prominent snails (gastropods) are in the center of the image. One has a light brown shell with visible spiral stripes. The other is a uniform light grey/white, possibly an older, eroded individual of the same species.\n3.  **Small Snails:** Several smaller, dark-colored, almost black snails are also present, often nestled among the barnacles.\n4.  **Tiny Organisms:** A smattering of very small, grey, circular specks is also visible on the rock surface, which are likely newly settled barnacle spat or very small periwinkles.\n\n**Step 2: Propose specific identifications for the key species.**\n*   **Large Snails:** The striped snail is visually identical to the **Common Periwinkle**, scientific name *Littorina littorea*.\n*   **Barnacles:** The acorn barnacles, based on their diamond-shaped aperture (opening) and association with the other species, are most likely the **Northern Rock Barnacle**, scientific name *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n*   **Small Snails:** The small, dark snails with ribbed shells, found high on the rock among the barnacles, are characteristic of the **Rough Periwinkle**, scientific name *Littorina saxatilis*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the geographic distribution of each species to find the definitive indicator.**\nThe question asks for a species that definitively proves the location is the Atlantic and not the Pacific coast. This requires a species found in the Atlantic but absent from the Pacific.\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** (Common Periwinkle): This species is native to the Northeast Atlantic (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now extremely common from Canada to Maryland. However, it has also been introduced to a few locations on the Pacific coast (e.g., San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound). Because it can be found, albeit rarely, on the Pacific coast, its presence is not a *definitive* (100% certain) indicator.\n\n*   ***Littorina saxatilis*** (Rough Periwinkle): This species is native to the North Atlantic, found on both European and North American shores. Crucially, it **is not found** on the Pacific coast of North America. Therefore, its presence would definitively indicate an Atlantic location.\n\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** (Northern Rock Barnacle): This is a dominant barnacle species throughout the North Atlantic, on both the European and North American sides. It **is not found** on the Pacific coast of North America, where it is replaced by other species like *Balanus glandula* and *Chthamalus dalli*. Therefore, its presence is also a definitive indicator of an Atlantic location.\n\n**Step 4: Select the best definitive indicator from the candidates.**\nBoth *Littorina saxatilis* and *Semibalanus balanoides* are species present in the photo whose ranges are restricted to the Atlantic Ocean. Either would be a correct answer. However, the barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*) are the most abundant and ecologically dominant organism in the image. They form the very foundation of the \"barnacle zone\" habitat shown. Their identification is supported by their shape and their co-occurrence with a classic Atlantic periwinkle assemblage. They are a fundamental indicator of a North Atlantic rocky shore ecosystem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe species that most ubiquitously defines the habitat in the photo and is exclusively found on the Atlantic coast (compared to the Pacific) is the Northern Rock Barnacle.\n\n<<<Semibalanus balanoides>>>"
