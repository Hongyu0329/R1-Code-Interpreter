    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction of Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario in Table 1 with the \"Proposed\" scenario in Table 2.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question specifically asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles traveled by the car itself, not the total miles traveled by all its occupants. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Weighted Calculation:** Since the absolute total number of trips is not provided, we must perform a weighted calculation to find a representative VMT value for each scenario. We do this by considering the proportion of trips that fall into each distance category.\n3.  **Segmented Calculation:** VMT must be calculated for each distance segment (0-3 miles, 3-5 miles, etc.) individually and then summed up. Using the \"Total\" column directly would lead to an incorrect result as it would not properly weight the different trip distances.\n4.  **Combining Car Modes:** Car VMT includes miles from both types of car trips listed: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The mode shares for these two categories must be added together to get the total car mode share for each distance segment.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe formula to calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category is:\n*Weighted VMT (category) = (Share of total trips) × (Total share of car modes in that category) × (Average trip distance for that category)*\n\nThe total weighted VMT for a scenario is the sum of the weighted VMT from all four distance categories.\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Weighted Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53% = 0.53\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 (share of total trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = **0.2544**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81% = 0.81\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 (share of total trips) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (avg distance) = **0.7128**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85% = 0.85\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 (share of total trips) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (avg distance) = **0.8925**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89% = 0.89\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 (share of total trips) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (avg distance) = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline Weighted VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Weighted Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3% = 0.03\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 (share of total trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = **0.0144**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27% = 0.27\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 (share of total trips) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (avg distance) = **0.2376**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41% = 0.41\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 (share of total trips) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (avg distance) = **0.4305**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49% = 0.49\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 (share of total trips) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (avg distance) = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed Weighted VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n*Percentage Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] × 100%*\n\n*   Reduction in VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.52195 × 100%\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
