The structures of the three products are:

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
    A dihydropyrrolizine core formed from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the azomethine ylide (derived from the starting material) and methyl propiolate. This adduct is then C-acetylated on the enamine β-carbon. The structure is methyl 5-acetyl-6-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7-carboxylate.
    The structure can be visualized as a fused five-five ring system (pyrrolizine skeleton). One ring contains the nitrogen atom which is substituted with the (4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl) group. The other five-membered ring has a C=C double bond, substituted with both an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).

*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
    This product is also derived from the initial cycloadduct. It has undergone oxidation to form an aromatic pyrrolizine core. Additionally, the imine group of the N-substituent has been oxidized to a nitrone. The structure features a flat aromatic pyrrolizine ring system with a methoxycarbonyl group. The nitrogen of the pyrrolizine ring is attached to the carbon of the nitrone substituent.

*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
    This product is formed from a side reaction of the starting material. It is the [2+2] cycloaddition adduct of the starting material and ketene (CH2=C=O), which is generated in situ from acetic anhydride. The reaction occurs between the C=N bond of the starting material's pyrroline ring and the C=C bond of ketene, forming a new four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to the pyrroline ring. The pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid part of the starting material remains intact.
