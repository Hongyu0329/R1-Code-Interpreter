    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\nThe goal is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K based on their visual characteristics.\n\n**1. Analysis of Specimen H:**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen has a reddish-brown color. Its most prominent feature is its texture, which is highly porous and full of small, interconnected holes or cavities. This is known as a vesicular texture. It looks like a volcanic cinder.\n*   **Careful Points:** The vesicular texture is a strong indicator of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. It forms when gases dissolved in magma escape as it erupts and cools rapidly at the surface, trapping the gas bubbles. The reddish color is often due to the presence of iron that has been oxidized.\n*   **Conclusion:** A rock with these characteristics (reddish-brown color, highly vesicular) is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Specimen J:**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is light-colored (off-white to light gray). Similar to specimen H, it has a highly vesicular texture, meaning it is filled with many small holes. It appears lightweight.\n*   **Careful Points:** The vesicular texture again points to an extrusive igneous origin. However, its light color distinguishes it from Scoria. Light-colored volcanic rocks are typically felsic, meaning they are rich in silica.\n*   **Conclusion:** A light-colored, low-density, vesicular volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**. It is essentially a frothy volcanic glass.\n\n**3. Analysis of Specimen I:**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is composed of numerous fragments (clasts) of other rocks. These fragments are of various sizes and colors and appear to be angular. The fragments are held together by a fine-grained matrix that looks like hardened ash.\n*   **Careful Points:** A rock made of cemented-together fragments is either a sedimentary rock (like breccia or conglomerate) or a pyroclastic igneous rock. Since the fragments (clasts) are angular rather than rounded, it is a type of breccia. Given the context of other volcanic samples (H and J) and the ash-like matrix, it's highly probable that this is of volcanic origin.\n*   **Conclusion:** This rock is composed of consolidated volcanic ash and larger angular fragments (lapilli). This type of pyroclastic rock is known as **Tuff** or **Volcanic Breccia**. \"Tuff\" is a common term for rocks formed from volcanic ash.\n\n**4. Analysis of Specimen K:**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained, or phaneritic, texture. The crystals are of different minerals: light-colored ones (white, off-white, pinkish - likely feldspar), some glassy gray ones (likely quartz), and some smaller dark minerals.\n*   **Careful Points:** The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock. The mineral composition, dominated by light-colored minerals like feldspar and quartz, indicates a felsic composition.\n*   **Conclusion:** A coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock with a felsic composition is identified as **Granite**.\n\nFinal Identification List:\n*   H: Scoria\n*   I: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\n*   J: Pumice\n*   K: Granite\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia), J is Pumice, K is Granite.>>>"
