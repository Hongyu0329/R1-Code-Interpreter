    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure.**\n    A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The basis atoms in fractional coordinates are at (0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2) within the conventional unit cell.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110].**\n    The notation [110] refers to a specific direction in the crystal lattice. We need to visualize what the atomic arrangement looks like when we project the 3D positions of the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] direction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC along [110].**\n    When projecting an FCC lattice along the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D repeating pattern.\n    1.  Consider a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction. The repeating unit cell in this projection is a rectangle.\n    2.  The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] directions of the crystal. The lengths of the sides are `a` and `aâˆš2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the cubic cell.\n    3.  When all atoms from the 3D lattice are projected onto this 2D plane, they form a pattern of a **centered rectangle**. This means there are atoms at the four corners of the rectangular unit cell and one atom exactly in the center of the rectangle.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the Four Given Patterns.**\n    We will now examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. We look at the 2D arrangement of the atoms projected onto the front-facing plane of each box.\n\n    *   **Image A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of rectangular units, but there are no atoms in the centers of these rectangles. This is a **simple rectangular** pattern, which is not what we are looking for.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms are shown within a unit cell that is drawn as a parallelogram due to the 3D perspective. Let's look at the arrangement on the front face. We can identify atoms at the four corners of the parallelogram and one atom located in the center of the parallelogram. A rectangle appears as a parallelogram in a perspective view. This **centered parallelogram** pattern matches our theoretical \"centered rectangle\" pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms are arranged in a clear **hexagonal** pattern. This pattern arises when viewing an FCC crystal along the [111] direction (the close-packed direction), not the [110] direction.\n\n    *   **Image D:** The atoms are arranged in a rectangular pattern. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangle and also atoms at the centers of two of the opposite sides (the horizontal sides in this depiction). This pattern is characteristic of a **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)** lattice viewed along the [110] direction, not an FCC lattice.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the Analysis.**\n    By comparing the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction (a centered rectangle) with the patterns shown in the images, we can conclude that Image B correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
