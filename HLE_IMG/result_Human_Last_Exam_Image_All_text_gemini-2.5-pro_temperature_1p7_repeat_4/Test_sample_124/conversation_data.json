    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total current flowing through the circuit. This is the total current supplied by the voltage source V2. We can find this using Ohm's Law, I_total = V / R_eq, where V is the source voltage and R_eq is the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Circuit's Structure**\nThe circuit has a voltage source V2 = 1V. The rest of the circuit consists of resistors connected to this source. Let's define the top wire connected to the positive terminal of V2 as Node A (+1V) and the bottom wire connected to the negative terminal (ground) as Node B (0V). The resistors are arranged in two main parallel branches between Node A and Node B.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Right Branch**\n*   This branch contains resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω).\n*   R8 is connected between Node A and R7. R7 is connected between R8 and Node B.\n*   Therefore, R7 and R8 are in series.\n*   The equivalent resistance of this branch is R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Left Branch**\n*   This branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n*   These resistors appear to be in series at first glance, but there is a wire that changes the configuration significantly.\n*   **Careful Point:** A wire connects Node A directly to the junction between resistor R2 and resistor R3.\n*   Let's analyze the effect of this wire:\n    *   **Resistor R3:** The top of R3 is connected to this wire, which is at the potential of Node A (+1V). The bottom of R3 is connected to Node B (0V). Thus, the voltage across R3 is 1V - 0V = 1V. This means R3 is directly in parallel with the voltage source.\n    *   **Resistors R1 and R2:** The top of the R1-R2 series combination is connected to Node A (+1V). The bottom of the R1-R2 series combination (which is the junction between R2 and R3) is also connected to Node A (+1V) via the wire.\n    *   The voltage across the series pair R1 and R2 is the potential difference between its two ends, which is 1V - 1V = 0V.\n    *   Since there is no voltage across R1 and R2, no current will flow through them (I = V/R = 0V / (3Ω + 7Ω) = 0A). They are effectively bypassed and do not contribute to the total current drawn from the source.\n*   Therefore, the entire left branch simplifies to just resistor R3 = 9 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Current**\nThe circuit simplifies to two components in parallel across the 1V source:\n1.  Resistor R3 = 9 Ω\n2.  The series combination of R7 and R8, R_right = 200 Ω\n\nWe can calculate the current through each parallel branch and add them together to find the total current.\n*   Current through the left branch (I_left), which is the current through R3:\n    I_left = V / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.1111 A\n*   Current through the right branch (I_right), which is the current through R7 and R8:\n    I_right = V / R_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n*   The total current (I_total) is the sum of the branch currents:\n    I_total = I_left + I_right = (1/9) A + (1/200) A\n\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator:\n*   I_total = (200/1800) A + (9/1800) A = 209/1800 A\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n*   I_total = 209 ÷ 1800 ≈ 0.11611... A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.116 A.\n\n<<<0.116>>>"
