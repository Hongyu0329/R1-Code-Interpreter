    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This is indicated by the bright, colored vertical lines on a black background. Each line corresponds to a specific wavelength (and thus a specific energy) of light emitted by an atom. When an element's atoms are excited (e.g., by heating or an electric current), their electrons jump to higher energy levels. When they fall back to lower levels, they emit photons of light at discrete, characteristic wavelengths. This pattern of lines is unique for each element, serving as its \"fingerprint.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectral Features**\nWe need to observe the key characteristics of the spectrum shown:\n*   The spectrum covers the entire visible range, from violet/blue on the left to red on the right.\n*   There are multiple distinct lines of varying brightness and color.\n*   **Red Region:** There is a very prominent, bright red line towards the far right.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct, bright yellow-orange line.\n*   **Green-Cyan Region:** There are several lines in this area, including at least one very bright green line and a prominent cyan (blue-green) line.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region:** This region contains numerous lines, with at least one or two standing out as brighter than the others.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Elemental Spectra**\nLet's compare this pattern to the spectra of some common elements:\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of only four prominent lines: one red, one cyan, one blue, and one violet. The spectrum in the image is far more complex, so it cannot be hydrogen.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Neon is famous for its bright glow in signs. Its spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of very bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum. The given spectrum has strong lines across all colors, not just red/orange. Thus, it's not neon.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** Mercury has strong lines in the violet, blue, green, and a yellow doublet. While a possibility, the overall pattern and number of lines, especially in the blue and red regions, don't perfectly match the classic mercury spectrum as well as another candidate.\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium has a rich spectrum with several prominent lines distributed across the visible range. Its characteristic bright lines include:\n    *   A bright red line (~667.8 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (~587.6 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~501.6 nm)\n    *   A bright cyan line (~492.2 nm)\n    *   A blue line (~471.3 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-violet line (~447.1 nm)\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Identification**\nThe pattern in the image aligns extremely well with the known emission spectrum of **Helium**. The presence of strong, distinct lines in the red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue-violet regions matches the \"fingerprint\" of Helium perfectly. The number of lines and their relative spacing and intensities are characteristic of this element.\n\nTherefore, the element represented by these spectral lines is Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
