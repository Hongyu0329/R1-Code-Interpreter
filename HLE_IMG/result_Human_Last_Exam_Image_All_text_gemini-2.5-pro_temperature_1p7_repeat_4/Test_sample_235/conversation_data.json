    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all the words in the poem.**\nAn erasure poem or collage poem utilizes words from a source text. In this image, we see several words. We must consider all textual elements that are part of the artistic composition.\n*   The words from the original page that have been left visible: \"THE FIRST STEP\" and the page number \"35\".\n*   The words that have been cut out and pasted onto the page: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\".\n\n**Step 2: Combine the words into a single poetic line or sentence.**\nTo analyze the overall metric pattern, we should combine these words into a single coherent thought, as might be intended in a one-line poem form. The arrangement suggests they can be read as a single sentence.\nA plausible reading is: \"The first step, thirty-five: rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\n**Step 3: Count the syllables of the combined words.**\nWe need to carefully count the syllables for each word or phrase:\n*   \"The first step\" = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 syllables.\n*   \"thirty-five\" (representing the number 35) = 2 + 1 = 3 syllables.\n*   \"rules\" = 1 syllable.\n*   \"and\" = 1 syllable.\n*   \"lines,\" = 1 syllable.\n*   \"an\" = 1 syllable.\n*   \"in-tri-cate\" = 3 syllables.\n*   \"spi-der's\" = 2 syllables.\n*   \"web\" = 1 syllable.\n*   \"work\" = 1 syllable.\n\nThe total syllable count is the sum of these parts: 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the answer choices based on the syllable count and metric form.**\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n*   **A. free verse:** This means the poem has no regular meter or rhyme. While the poem does not have a repeating stress pattern, the highly specific syllable count of 17 points to a specific form, making \"free verse\" a less accurate description.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of 10 syllables per line (5 iambs). Our poem has 17 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 17 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** This is a complex stanza form typically involving lines of 11 and 5 syllables with a specific trochaic and dactylic meter. This does not match our 17-syllable sentence.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This involves lines of about 6 syllables (3 iambs). Our poem has 17 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a poetic form invented by Allen Ginsberg, defined as a complete sentence consisting of exactly **17 syllables**. Our analysis shows the poem perfectly fits this definition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe total number of syllables from all the textual elements in the collage is 17. This precisely matches the definition of an \"American Sentence\".\n\n<<<F>>>"
