The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V and C1 domains** of the **RAGE receptor**.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. This is because its level of overexpression is shown to directly initiate and amplify key pathological processes, including apoptosis (via JNK/JUN) and neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration (via NFÎºB). Since a higher concentration of S100B directly drives the mechanisms responsible for disease progression, measuring its levels can help predict the future severity and course of the neurological disorder for a patient.
