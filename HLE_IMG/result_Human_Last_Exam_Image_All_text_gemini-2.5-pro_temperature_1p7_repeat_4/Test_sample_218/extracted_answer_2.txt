So, compound A is (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
Here is the image of the chemical structure of compound A.
[Image of (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene]
CH3-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. More precisely, for geraniol derivative, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3.
The image representation would be a chain of 8 carbons, with double bonds at C2 and C6, and methyl groups at C3 and C7.

CH3 - C = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH = C(CH3)2  <-- Geraniol Structure (OH at one end)
Let's re-draw based on starting material
    (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2OH
Deoxygenation leads to:
    (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3
```
This is the structure of (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
