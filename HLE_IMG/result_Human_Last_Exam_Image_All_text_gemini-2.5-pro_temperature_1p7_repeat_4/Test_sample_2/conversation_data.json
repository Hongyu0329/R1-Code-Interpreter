    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nThe algorithm is defined recursively. Let's break down the function `sort(a, n)`, where `a` is the array and `n` is the number of elements to consider (from index 0 to n-1).\n\n`def sort(a, n):`\n`  if n > 1:`\n`    # 1. First recursive call`\n`    sort(a, n - 1)`\n`    `\n`    # 2. Comparison and potential swap`\n`    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`\n`      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`\n`      `\n`      # 3. Second recursive call (conditional)`\n`      sort(a, n - 1)`\n\n- **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`, as an array with 0 or 1 element is inherently sorted.\n- **Recursive Step (`n > 1`):**\n    1. The first call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is intended to sort the subarray containing the first `n-1` elements, i.e., `a[0...n-2]`.\n    2. After this, it compares the last element of this sorted subarray (`a[n-2]`) with the next element (`a[n-1]`).\n    3. If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, they are out of order, so they are swapped.\n    4. Crucially, if a swap occurred, the element that was originally at `a[n-1]` is now at `a[n-2]`. This new element might be smaller than `a[n-3]` and thus disrupt the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. To fix this, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` a second time to re-sort the entire prefix.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. The work done inside the function `sort(a, n)` (excluding recursive calls) is constant: one comparison, and potentially one swap. Let's denote this constant time work as `O(1)`.\n\n- The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens and takes `T(n-1)` time.\n- The `if-`block contains a `swap` operation, which is `O(1)`, and a second recursive call, `sort(a, n-1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nThe **worst-case** scenario is when the `if` condition is always met, triggering the second recursive call for every step of the main recursion from `n` down to 2.\n\nIn the worst case, the time complexity can be expressed by the following recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) (first call) + O(1) (compare/swap) + T(n-1) (second call)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\nThe base case is `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n\n- `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n- `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n- `T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n- `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\nLet's expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n\n- `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum `(1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2))` is a geometric series with sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n\n- `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n- `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n- `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nAs `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `(d + c) * 2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, this is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify a Worst-Case Input**\n\nTo confirm our analysis, we need to ensure that a worst-case input exists that triggers the `if` condition consistently. Consider an array sorted in reverse order, e.g., `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n\n1.  `sort(a, n)` is called.\n2.  The first `sort(a, n-1)` call sorts the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` into `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The array becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n3.  The `if` condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `1 < n`, which is true for `n>1`.\n4.  A swap occurs, and the array becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n5.  The second `sort(a, n-1)` is called on the prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This is itself a worst-case input for `sort` of size `n-1` (the smallest element is at the end).\n\nThis pattern continues, ensuring that the second recursive call is made at each level of the recursion. Therefore, the worst-case complexity analysis holds.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Nature of Recursion:** The function calls itself with `n-1`, which ensures termination as `n` will eventually reach the base case of 1. So, the algorithm does terminate.\n2.  **Double Recursion:** The presence of two recursive calls on `n-1` inside the same function block is a strong hint of exponential complexity, similar to the naive recursive algorithm for Fibonacci numbers.\n3.  **Worst-Case Condition:** It's critical to verify that the worst-case condition (the `if` being true) can actually happen repeatedly. As shown with the reverse-sorted array, it can.\n4.  **Comparison to Standard Sorts:** This algorithm is much less efficient than standard `O(n^2)` sorts like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort, and vastly less efficient than `O(n log n)` sorts like Merge Sort.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
