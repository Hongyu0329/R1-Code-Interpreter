    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual clue.**\nThe first clue is an image with the description: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **The Image:** The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man, who is older with white hair, is presenting a trophy to a younger man with a beard.\n*   **Identify the People and Event:** Through reverse image search or by recognizing the individuals and the trophy, we can identify the scene. The younger man is Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player. The older man is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL). The trophy is the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's most valuable player.\n*   **The Event and Date:** This event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony. It took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The date in the clue (June 20) is likely based on news reporting time or is a minor discrepancy.\n*   **Conclusion from Clue 1:** The \"X Y\" mentioned in the clue refers to Nikita Kucherov, or a description of him.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clue.**\nThe second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Homonym Indication:** The phrase \"Another X Y\" suggests that \"X Y\" has at least two different meanings. One is related to the person/scene in the image, and the other is what this clue describes.\n*   **Identify the Substance:** This clue points to a substance or process involving mercury that is no longer in common use because mercury and its salts are toxic. There are several possibilities:\n    *   **Mercury fulminate (Hg(CNO)â‚‚):** A primary explosive used in blasting caps and percussion caps. It has been largely replaced by safer, less toxic substances.\n    *   **Felt Hat Making:** The use of mercury nitrate in the felt-making process (called \"carroting\") caused mercury poisoning among hat makers, leading to neurological damage and the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   **Calomel (Mercurous Chloride):** Once used in medicine as a laxative, its use has been discontinued due to mercury's toxicity.\n    *   **Vermilion:** A red pigment made from mercury sulfide (cinnabar), its use has declined due to toxicity.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\nWe need to find the \"X Y\" that links the image of Nikita Kucherov with the mercury-related substance.\n*   Let's test the potential answers from Step 2 against the image from Step 1.\n*   If X Y is \"Mad Hatter,\" the connection to Nikita Kucherov is very weak. There is no well-known link between him and hats or madness.\n*   If X Y is \"Vermilion,\" the connection could be his Russian nationality (the \"Red Machine\"), but this is also a bit of a stretch and not a common descriptor for him.\n*   If X Y is \"Mercury Fulminate,\" we need to see if this two-word phrase can describe Nikita Kucherov.\n    *   **Mercury:** Can refer to the Roman god (known for speed) or the adjective \"mercurial\" (meaning eloquent, clever, swift, or volatile). These traits can aptly describe a skillful and elusive athlete like Kucherov.\n    *   **Fulminate:** This verb means to explode with a loud noise or to express vehement protest. In a sporting context, it can describe an \"explosive\" player known for powerful shots or sudden bursts of scoring.\n    *   **Combination:** The metaphorical description \"Mercury Fulminate\" fits an athlete like Nikita Kucherov, who is known for his speed, skill, and explosive offensive talent.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe two-word phrase \"Mercury fulminate\" fits both clues perfectly:\n1.  **Clue 1:** Nikita Kucherov, pictured in the image, can be metaphorically described as a \"Mercury Fulminate\" player due to his swift, skillful, and explosive style of play.\n2.  **Clue 2:** \"Another Mercury fulminate\" is the chemical compound mercury(II) fulminate, an explosive primer whose use has largely ceased because of the toxicity associated with mercury.\n\nTherefore, \"X Y\" is Mercury fulminate.\n\n<<<Mercury fulminate>>>"
