    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given transformation to identify the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:**\n    *   The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), a cycloalkene.\n    *   The reaction condition is photochemical, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This is a critical piece of information, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical conditions.\n    *   The overall transformation involves the combination of these two molecules to form a single, more complex product with a polycyclic structure. The question states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Pericyclic Reactions:**\n    *   Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n    *   Given that two molecules combine to form one, at least one cycloaddition reaction is highly likely.\n    *   Aromatic rings like benzene and their derivatives are known to undergo photochemical reactions, including cycloadditions with alkenes and electrocyclic isomerizations (e.g., to Dewar benzene).\n\n3.  **Propose a Plausible Mechanistic Pathway (Sequence 1):**\n    *   **Reaction 1: [2+2] Photocycloaddition.** The first step can be a direct cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. One of the π bonds of the benzene ring (acting as a 2π component) can react with the π bond of cyclobutene (also a 2π component).\n        *   This is a [π2 + π2] cycloaddition. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n        *   The product of this step would be a tricyclic diene (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorotricyclo[4.2.2.0¹⁶]deca-2,4-diene, where the cyclobutene has added across the C1-C2 bond of the benzene ring). This intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety.\n    *   **Reaction 2: 4π Electrocyclic Reaction.** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a conjugated 4π-electron system (the 1,3-cyclohexadiene part). This system can undergo a photochemical electrocyclic ring closure.\n        *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is allowed to proceed in a conrotatory fashion under photochemical conditions.\n        *   This ring closure forms a new four-membered ring, leading to the final polycyclic product.\n\n4.  **Propose an Alternative Plausible Mechanistic Pathway (Sequence 2):**\n    *   **Reaction 1: Electrocyclic Reaction.** Hexafluorobenzene itself can undergo a photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n        *   This can be viewed as a 4π electrocyclic ring closure involving two of the double bonds of a Kekulé structure of benzene. This is a photochemically allowed (conrotatory) process.\n    *   **Reaction 2: [2+2] Photocycloaddition.** The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate can then react with cyclobutene.\n        *   One of the double bonds of Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene in a [π2 + π2] cycloaddition. This is also a photochemically allowed reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both plausible pathways involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order.\n    *   Pathway 1 involves a **[2+2] cycloaddition** followed by an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   Pathway 2 involves an **electrocyclic reaction** followed by a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   Therefore, the two kinds of pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The condition `hv` is key to applying the correct Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical reactions.\n*   The question asks for the *types* of reactions, not necessarily the specific order or the detailed structure of the intermediate/product, which can be complex and confusingly drawn.\n*   Both a [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclization are classic examples of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n*   Recognizing the photochemical reactivity of benzene and its derivatives is essential. Simple thermal reaction logic (like Diels-Alder) does not apply here.\n*   Although there are other modes of photoaddition to benzene (e.g., 1,3- and 1,4-addition), the sequence involving 1,2-addition ([2+2]) followed by electrocyclization is a very common and well-established pathway for reactions of this type. Similarly, the isomerization to Dewar-benzene followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition is also a known pattern. Both lead to the same conclusion about the reaction types.\n\nThe final answer is the identification of these two reaction types.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction."
