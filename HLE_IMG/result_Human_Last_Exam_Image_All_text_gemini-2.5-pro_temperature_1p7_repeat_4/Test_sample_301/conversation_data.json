    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Work 1 (Top Left):** This artwork depicts four cartoon-like fish, some with human faces, drawn in a whimsical and modern style using ink and light color washes. This playful and distinctive aesthetic is the signature style of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, a contemporary Chinese artist famous for his depictions of animals.\n\n2.  **Work 2 (Top Middle):** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (Guohua) of chrysanthemums. The brushwork is vigorous and confident, a style known as \"daxieyi\" (freehand sketch). The subject matter and the powerful execution are characteristic of **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**, a prominent artist of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic.\n\n3.  **Work 3 (Top Right):** This is a realistic portrait of a woman in ethnic dress, rendered in a style influenced by Western oil painting, particularly Soviet-era academic realism. The artwork is one of the most famous pieces of modern Chinese oil painting, titled \"Tajik Bride\" (塔吉克新娘), created by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n\n4.  **Work 4 (Middle Left):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic cursive script. The characters are fluid and lean with energetic strokes. This is a section from the famous calligraphic work \"Shao xing tie\" (苕溪诗帖) by the Song Dynasty master **Mi Fu (米芾)**, known for his highly personal and powerful style.\n\n5.  **Work 5 (Middle Center):** This is a modern abstract painting combining bold geometric shapes (circles representing the sun and moon) with ink wash elements resembling a traditional landscape. This fusion of Western abstract concepts and Chinese materials/aesthetics is the hallmark of **Liu Kuo-sung (刘国松, also known as Liu Guosong)**, a key figure in the modernization of Chinese painting.\n\n6.  **Work 6 (Middle Right):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, written in an elegant and graceful running script (xingshu). The beautiful, scholarly style is characteristic of the Yuan Dynasty master **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**, who was renowned for his skill in reviving and synthesizing classical calligraphic styles. This is his famous \"Postscript to the 'Record of the Auspicious Cranes'\".\n\n7.  **Work 7 (Bottom Left):** This piece of calligraphy is in a highly expressive running script, showing variations in character size and ink weight, conveying a strong sense of emotion. This is a famous section from the \"Huangzhou Cold Food Observance\" (黄州寒食帖), widely considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Chinese calligraphy, created by the Song Dynasty polymath **Su Shi (苏轼)**.\n\n8.  **Work 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a realistic oil painting of a young woman against a background of green leaves. The meticulous detail, soft lighting, and introspective mood are exemplary of the Neoclassical Realism movement in contemporary China. The artist is **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, and this is one of his most celebrated works.\n\n9.  **Work 9 (Bottom Right):** This is a figure painting of an elegant woman in an elaborate costume and headdress, suggestive of a celestial being or a court lady from ancient frescoes. The style, characterized by fine, flowing lines, rich colors, and an idealized sense of beauty, is the signature style of **Zhang Daqian (张大千)**, particularly his works from after his period of studying the Dunhuang cave murals.\n\n**List of authors from left to right, top to bottom:**\n\n1.  Han Meilin\n2.  Wu Changshuo\n3.  Jin Shangyi\n4.  Mi Fu\n5.  Liu Kuo-sung (Liu Guosong)\n6.  Zhao Mengfu\n7.  Su Shi\n8.  Yang Feiyun\n9.
