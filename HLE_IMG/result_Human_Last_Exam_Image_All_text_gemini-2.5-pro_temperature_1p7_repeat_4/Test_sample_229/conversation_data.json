    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine the song's title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Notation and Markings**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The sheet music is a \"lead sheet.\" It provides the main melody on a single staff and chord symbols (e.g., C, E7, F, G7) above it for accompaniment. This format is common for jazz and popular music.\n*   **Time Signature and Key:** The time signature is 4/4. There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, and the piece heavily revolves around a C major chord, indicating the key of C major.\n*   **Rhythm and Feel:** The melody is full of syncopation (notes that fall off the main beat) and rapid runs of eighth and sixteenth notes. This creates a high-energy, driving rhythm. A \"swing\" feel is implied by the style, where eighth notes are played with a long-short rhythm.\n*   **Harmony (Chords):** The chord progression uses standard jazz chords, including major, minor, and dominant 7th chords (C, G7, E7, Am, D-), as well as an augmented chord (G+). This type of harmony is characteristic of early jazz styles.\n*   **Structure:** The piece uses common musical road map signs like a Segno (`§`), a Coda (`⊕`), and the instruction \"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA\" (Dal Segno al Coda), which are typical for arranging jazz standards.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\nThe combination of these elements—a fast, virtuosic melody, swing rhythm, and jazz harmony played on what is typically an acoustic string ensemble (guitars and violin)—are all defining characteristics of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as **Jazz Manouche** or Sinti Jazz). This style was pioneered and popularized by guitarist Django Reinhardt in France during the 1930s.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title**\nThe melody and chord progression are those of a very famous song in the Gypsy Jazz repertoire. By playing or humming the first few bars, one can recognize the tune. This is the classic Gypsy Jazz arrangement of **\"Les Yeux Noirs\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\nThis question has two layers:\n1.  **Origin of the Melody:** \"Les Yeux Noirs\" is the French title for \"Очи чёрные\" (\"Ochi chyornye\"), which translates to \"Dark Eyes\" in English. It is a very famous traditional folk song from **Russia**.\n2.  **Origin of the Style/Arrangement:** The specific version of the song represented by this sheet music is a definitive piece of the Gypsy Jazz style. This style originated in **France** in the 1930s with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, led by Django Reinhardt.\n\nTherefore, the melody is Russian, but the iconic musical interpretation is French.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n*   **Title:** \"Les Yeux Noirs\" (English: \"Dark Eyes\"; Russian: \"Очи чёрные\").\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (also known as Jazz Manouche).\n*   **Country of Origin:** The original melody is a traditional folk song from Russia. This specific arrangement is a classic of the Gypsy Jazz style, which originated in France.\n\n<<<Title: Les Yeux Noirs (Dark Eyes), Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: The original melody is from Russia; this jazz arrangement style originated in France.>>>"
