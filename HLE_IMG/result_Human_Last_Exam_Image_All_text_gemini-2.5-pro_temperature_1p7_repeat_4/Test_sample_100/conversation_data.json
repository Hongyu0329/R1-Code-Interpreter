    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's break it down to count its atoms.\n1.  **Core Structure**: The core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system.\n    *   The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton consists of 7 atoms forming the bridged rings. In this case, one carbon is replaced by a nitrogen (at position 2), and another carbon is part of a carbonyl group (at position 3). The remaining atoms are C1, C4, C5, C6, C7.\n    *   Let's count the atoms and hydrogens on this bare skeleton (assuming H's fill the valencies):\n        *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   N2: 1 N (bonded to H initially)\n        *   C3: 1 C, 1 O (carbonyl C=O)\n        *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C5=C6 (double bond): 2 C, 2 H (one on each)\n        *   C7 (methylene bridge): 1 C, 2 H\n    *   So, the parent molecule 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one has the formula C6H7NO.\n\n2.  **Substituents**:\n    *   **PMB group**: This is a para-methoxybenzyl group, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. Its formula is C8H9O. It is attached to the nitrogen atom (N2), replacing the hydrogen atom that would be there on the parent molecule.\n    *   **CF3 group**: This is a trifluoromethyl group. Its formula is CF3. It replaces a hydrogen atom on the double bond (let's assume at C5).\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula of Starting Material**:\n    *   Start with the parent formula C6H7NO.\n    *   Replace N-H with N-PMB: remove H, add C8H9O. Formula becomes C6H6NO + C8H9O = C14H15NO2.\n    *   Replace C-H with C-CF3: remove H, add CF3. Formula becomes C14H14NO2 + CF3 = C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   So, the starting material has the molecular formula **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation**: CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in Formula**:\n    *   Subtract the PMB group: -C8H9O\n    *   Add a hydrogen atom: +H\n    *   Net change: -C8H8O\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1**: C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation. It will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the molecule to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in Formula**: One molecule of H2 is added across the double bond.\n    *   Add H2: +2H\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2**: C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation**: These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (or in this case, a lactam, which is a cyclic amide). The amide bond (N-C=O) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule.\n*   **Change in Formula**: One molecule of H2O is added to the substrate.\n    *   Add H2O: +2H, +1O\n*   **Formula of the Product**: C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    *   The product is an amino acid: the bicyclic structure opens up to form a substituted cyclopentane ring carrying an amino group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3). Counting the atoms in the resulting structure (a substituted cyclopentane amino acid) confirms this formula.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (deprotection): - C8H8O  -> Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (hydrogenation): + H2      -> Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (hydrolysis):    + H2O     -> Final Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
