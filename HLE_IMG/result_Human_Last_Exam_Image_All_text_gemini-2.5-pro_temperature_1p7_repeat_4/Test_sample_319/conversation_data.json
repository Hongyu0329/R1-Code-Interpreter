    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The question asks for the name of a specific \"phenomenon.\"\n    *   **Type of Phenomenon:** It is described as an \"illusion\" related to a \"perceptual ability.\"\n    *   **Key Analogy:** The phenomenon is compared to the Necker Cube's \"bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived in two different, stable 3D orientations. This suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous or incomplete stimulus in a specific, often coherent, way.\n    *   **Nature of the Ability:** The perceptual ability is described as \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious,\" indicating a fundamental process of sensory perception.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image consists of two plots, both representing a signal over time (horizontal axis).\n    *   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This graph visualizes sound, plotting frequency (vertical axis) against time (horizontal axis).\n        *   We see a persistent, thin horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency.\n        *   In the middle, this tone is clearly *interrupted* or replaced.\n        *   During the interruption, there is a vertical smear of blue, which represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies. This is characteristic of noise (like static, a cough, or a slam).\n        *   After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n        *   **Conclusion from Spectrogram:** Physically, the sound consists of a tone, followed by noise, followed by the same tone again. The tone is *not* continuous.\n    *   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time.\n        *   It starts as a clean, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone.\n        *   In the middle section, where the spectrogram shows the noise burst, the waveform becomes much more complex and irregular.\n        *   The overall presentation suggests that despite the physical interruption shown in the spectrogram, the auditory experience is one of a continuous, though complex, sound.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Clues from the Question and Image:**\n    *   The image shows a scenario where a continuous tone is physically broken and replaced by a burst of noise.\n    *   The text describes an illusion where our perception \"fills in\" missing information.\n    *   When people are presented with this exact auditory stimulus (a tone interrupted by a loud-enough noise), they typically do not perceive a gap in the tone. Instead, they perceive the tone as *continuing uninterrupted behind the noise*.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" is the \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" mentioned. The brain assumes that the more likely real-world event is a continuous sound being momentarily masked by another sound, rather than a sound stopping exactly when another one begins and starting again exactly when it ends.\n    *   This matches the description of an illusion where the brain constructs a coherent perception from incomplete data, similar to how it resolves the ambiguity of the Necker Cube into a stable 3D shape.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   This specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuing through a period where it is masked by another sound, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **perceptual restoration**. The effect related specifically to speech sounds (like a phoneme in a word) is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**, which is a famous example of this broader illusion. Given the stimulus is a simple tone, \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\" is the most accurate and general term.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Spectrogram vs. Perception:** It is crucial to distinguish between the physical reality of the sound (as shown accurately in the spectrogram) and the subjective perceptual experience of a listener. The illusion lies in the difference between the two.\n*   **The Role of Noise:** The illusion is strongest when the interrupting sound (the noise) is loud enough and has the right frequency characteristics to plausibly mask the original sound (the tone). If the interruption is silence, the listener correctly perceives a gap.\n*   **Necker Cube Analogy:** The comparison to the Necker Cube highlights the active, inferential nature of perception. The brain is not a passive recorder but an active interpreter that makes \"best guesses\" about the world based on sensory input and prior knowledge.\n\nBy combining the analysis of the visual data (the spectrogram and waveform) with the descriptive clues in the text, we can confidently identify the phenomenon.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
