    "Of course, I can help you with this organic chemistry problem. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** First, I'll determine the molecular formula of the starting compound by carefully counting each type of atom (C, H, N, O, F) in its structure, including the bicyclic core and the PMB and CF3 substituents.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (PMB Deprotection):** The reaction with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is a standard procedure to remove the para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group. I'll calculate the atomic change when the PMB group (C8H9O) is removed and replaced by a single hydrogen atom.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation):** The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond, which means two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis):** The final step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). This reaction cleaves the amide bond and adds one molecule of water (H2O) across it, forming a carboxylic acid and an amine.\n5.  **Calculate Final Formula:** I will start with the initial molecular formula and apply the changes from each step in sequence to find the formula of the final product.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations and shows the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef format_formula(atoms_dict):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atoms into a standard molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Order: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest.\n    order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n    formula = \"\"\n    for element in order:\n        if atoms_dict.get(element, 0) > 0:\n            formula += element\n            if atoms_dict[element] > 1:\n                formula += str(atoms_dict[element])\n    return formula\n\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular formula of the product through a three-step reaction.\"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\")\n    # The starting material is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one derivative.\n    # Core (C6H5NO): 6 C, 5 H, 1 N, 1 O\n    # CF3 substituent: 1 C, 3 F\n    # PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) substituent (C8H9O): 8 C, 9 H, 1 O\n    c_start = 6 + 1 + 8\n    h_start = 5 + 9\n    f_start = 3\n    n_start = 1\n    o_start = 1 + 1\n    \n    start_atoms = {'C': c_start, 'H': h_start, 'F': f_start, 'N': n_start, 'O': o_start}\n    print(f\"Starting Material Formula: {format_formula(start_atoms)}\")\n    print(f\"Initial counts: C={c_start}, H={h_start}, F={f_start}, N={n_start}, O={o_start}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: First reaction (PMB deprotection).\")\n    print(\"This reaction removes the PMB group (C8H9O) and adds one Hydrogen atom.\")\n    c_inter1 = c_start - 8\n    h_inter1 = h_start - 9 + 1\n    o_inter1 = o_start - 1\n    inter1_atoms = {'C': c_inter1, 'H': h_inter1, 'F': f_start, 'N': n_start, 'O': o_inter1}\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: {format_formula(inter1_atoms)}\")\n    print(f\"Atom counts: C={c_inter1}, H={h_inter1}, F={f_start}, N={n_start}, O={o_inter1}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Second reaction (Hydrogenation).\")\n    print(\"This adds one molecule of H2 across the C=C bond.\")\n    h_inter2 = h_inter1 + 2\n    inter2_atoms = {'C': c_inter1, 'H': h_inter2, 'F': f_start, 'N': n_start, 'O': o_inter1}\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: {format_formula(inter2_atoms)}\")\n    print(f\"Atom counts: C={c_inter1}, H={h_inter2}, F={f_start}, N={n_start}, O={o_inter1}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Third reaction (Lactam hydrolysis).\")\n    print(\"This adds one molecule of H2O to open the ring.\")\n    h_final = h_inter2 + 2\n    o_final = o_inter1 + 1\n    final_atoms = {'C': c_inter1, 'H': h_final, 'F': f_start, 'N': n_start, 'O': o_final}\n    print(f\"Final Product Formula: {format_formula(final_atoms)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Summary of atom count changes to find the final formula:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C)   = {c_start} - 8 = {c_inter1}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H) = {h_start} - 9 + 1 + 2 + 2 = {h_final}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F) = {f_start}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N) = {n_start}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O)   = {o_start} - 1 + 1 = {o_final}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"The final molecular formula equation is:\")\n    print(f\"C{final_atoms['C']}H{final_atoms['H']}F{final_atoms['F']}N{final_atoms['N']}O{final_atoms['O']}\")\n\n# Execute the calculation\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
