    "To determine the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction scheme, we will apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to each center, moving from left to right.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Stereocenter (in the acyl chloride reactant):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: -OMe, -CF3, -Ph (phenyl), and -COCl (acyl chloride).\n    *   **Assigning priorities (highest to lowest):**\n        1.  **-OMe**: The oxygen atom has the highest atomic number (8).\n        2.  **-COCl**: The carbon is attached to Cl (atomic number 17) and O (8).\n        3.  **-CF3**: The carbon is attached to three F atoms (atomic number 9).\n        4.  **-Ph**: The carbon is attached to other carbon atoms (atomic number 6).\n    *   **Determining Configuration:** The structure shows the lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) in the plane of the page, and the group with priority #3 (-CF3) on a dash (away). To assign the configuration, we can swap the group in the back (-CF3, #3) with the lowest priority group (-Ph, #4).\n    *   After the swap, -Ph (#4) is in the back. Now we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path is -OMe -> -COCl -> -CF3, which is counter-clockwise (S). Since we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite.\n    *   **Assignment:** (R).\n\n2.  **Second Stereocenter (in the alcohol reactant):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: -OH, -H, -CH2OMe, and -CH2CH(Me)2.\n    *   **Assigning priorities:**\n        1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has the highest atomic number.\n        2.  **-CH2OMe**: The carbon is attached to an oxygen.\n        3.  **-CH2CH(Me)2**: The carbon is attached to another carbon.\n        4.  **-H**: Hydrogen has the lowest priority.\n    *   **Determining Configuration:** The structure shows the lowest priority group (-H, #4) on a dash (away). We can directly trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path is -OH -> -CH2OMe -> -CH2CH(Me)2, which is clockwise.\n    *   **Assignment:** (R).\n\n3.  **Third Stereocenter (in the product ester, from the alcohol):**\n    *   The esterification reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution that does not affect the stereocenter of the alcohol. The C-O bond of the alcohol is not broken. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   The configuration remains the same as the starting alcohol.\n    *   **Assignment:** (R).\n\n4.  **Fourth Stereocenter (in the product ester, from the acyl chloride):**\n    *   The reaction also retains the stereochemistry of the acyl portion. The arrangement of atoms in 3D space does not change.\n    *   However, the -COCl group has changed to an ester group (-COOR'), which can alter the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Assigning new priorities:**\n        1.  **-OMe**: (unchanged)\n        2.  **-CF3**: (C-F, F, F) now outranks the ester group (C-O, O, O) because F (9) > O (8).\n        3.  **-COOR'**: The ester group.\n        4.  **-Ph**: (unchanged)\n    *   Notice the priorities of groups #2 and #3 have switched compared to the starting acyl chloride.\n    *   **Determining Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) is in the plane, and the group now ranked #2 (-CF3) is in the back. We swap -Ph (#4) with -CF3 (#2).\n    *   After the swap, -Ph (#4) is in the back. We trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path is -OMe -> -CF3 -> -COOR', which is clockwise (R). Since we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite.\n    *   **Assignment:** (S).\n\nThe final sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is (R), (R), (R), (S).\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The stereocenters are analyzed from left to right in the reaction scheme.\n    # 1.
