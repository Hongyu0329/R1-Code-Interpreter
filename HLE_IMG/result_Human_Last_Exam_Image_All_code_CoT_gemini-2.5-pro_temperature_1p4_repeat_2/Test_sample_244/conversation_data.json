    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I can identify its genus. The organism displays a flat, ribbon-like, dichotomously branching thallus that forms a dark, intricate mat on the tree bark. This growth pattern is characteristic of a type of thalloid liverwort.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the genus based on this distinctive morphology. The pattern strongly suggests a liverwort in the genus *Metzgeria*.\n2.  Create a simple Python script to state this identification, as per your request for a code-based solution.\n3.  The script will store the genus name in a variable and then print it.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species in the image based on its morphology.\n    The species is a liverwort with a distinctive flat, forked, ribbon-like thallus\n    forming a net-like mat on the tree bark.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus_name = \"Metzgeria\"\n    print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus_name}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"
