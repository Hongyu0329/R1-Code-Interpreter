    "This painting is a classic example of surrealism, known for its dreamlike and symbolic imagery. The artist masterfully combines different realities within a single room: a view of a glacial landscape, a doorway opening to the sea with a steamship, and another revealing a cityscape. By identifying these characteristic elements and the overall meticulous, fantastical style, we can determine the creator.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states the name of the artist.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist who painted the provided surrealist artwork.\n    The painting is titled \"La Quema de los Libros\" (The Burning of the Books) or \"Les Jeunes Amours\" (The Young Loves).\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Remedios Varo\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Remedios Varo>>>"
