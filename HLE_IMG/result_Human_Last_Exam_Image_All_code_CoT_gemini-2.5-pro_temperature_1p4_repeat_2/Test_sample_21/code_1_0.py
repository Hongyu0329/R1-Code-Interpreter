    # This scenario is a classic example of Ricardian Equivalence.
    # The key identity is:
    # Change in Current Account (ΔCA) = Change in National Saving (ΔS) - Change in Investment (ΔI)

    # National Saving is composed of private and public saving:
    # Change in National Saving (ΔS) = Change in Private Saving (ΔS_p) + Change in Public Saving (ΔS_g)

    # --- Step 1: Define the changes based on the problem statement ---

    # For demonstration, let's assume the fiscal expansion (increase in government spending, G) is 100 units.
    delta_G = 100

    # The problem states the increased government spending is completely offset by increased private saving.
    delta_S_private = delta_G

    # The expansion is debt-financed, so taxes (T) do not change (ΔT = 0).
    # Public saving is T - G, so the change is ΔT - ΔG.
    delta_T = 0
    delta_S_public = delta_T - delta_G

    # The problem gives no reason to assume investment (I) changes.
    delta_I = 0

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the total change in national saving (ΔS) ---
    delta_S_national = delta_S_private + delta_S_public

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the change in the current account (ΔCA) ---
    delta_CA = delta_S_national - delta_I
