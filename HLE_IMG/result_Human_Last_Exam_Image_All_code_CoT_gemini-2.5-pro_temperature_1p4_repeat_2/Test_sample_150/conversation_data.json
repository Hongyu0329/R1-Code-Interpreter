    "This multi-step synthesis involves several key organic reactions. I will trace the transformation through each step to determine the structure and name of the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl₃. The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is added to the benzene ring to form **Intermediate-1**, which is propiophenone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group on the ring is a meta-director. Therefore, bromine is added to the meta-position of the benzene ring, yielding **Intermediate-2**, 3-bromopropiophenone.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Intermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone) is reacted with H₂ over a palladium catalyst. This reaction reduces the benzylic ketone group completely to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This produces **Intermediate-3**, which is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination.** Intermediate-3 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propane) is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and benzoyl peroxide, which acts as a radical initiator. This set of reagents specifically brominates the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring). This reaction replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon with a bromine atom, resulting in the final **Product**.\n\nThe following Python code describes each step and identifies the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the final product of the multi-step reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Benzene + Propanoyl chloride --(AlCl3)--> Intermediate-1\n    intermediate_1_name = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The reaction of benzene with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3 is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\")\n    print(f\"This forms Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1_name}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    # Intermediate-1 --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Intermediate-2\n    intermediate_2_name = \"3-Bromopropiophenone (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: Propiophenone undergoes bromination.
