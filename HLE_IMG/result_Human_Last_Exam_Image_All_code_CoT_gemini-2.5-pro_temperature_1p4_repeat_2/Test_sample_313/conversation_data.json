    "Here is my plan to solve the riddle:\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1 (Image and Text):** I will identify the person and event in the image. The image shows ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov receiving an award on or around June 20, 2019. In hockey, a notable achievement is the \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals). This establishes a link between the image and the term \"Hat Trick\".\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2 (Text):** The second clue mentions a process using toxic mercury salts that is now obsolete. This refers to the historical method of making felt hats, where mercuric nitrate was used. This process, a \"trick\" of the hatter's trade, was hazardous and is no longer used. This links the obsolete, toxic process to \"hat\" making and a \"trick\".\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Both clues point to the term \"Hat Trick\". The first clue through the sports achievement associated with the person pictured, and the second clue through the historical hat-making \"trick\" involving mercury.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints out the components X (\"Hat\") and Y (\"Trick\") before stating the final combined answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by analyzing two clues to find the term 'X Y'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The components of the final answer\n    x = \"Hat\"\n    y = \"Trick\"\n\n    # Explanation for Clue 1\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the first clue (the image).\")\n    print(\"The person pictured is ice hockey superstar Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\")\n    print(\"A famous achievement in ice hockey is scoring three goals in a game, known as a 'hat trick'.\")\n    print(f\"This connects the image to the term '{x} {y}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation for Clue 2\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the second clue (the text).\")\n    print(\"The clue mentions another 'X Y' that is obsolete due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\")\n    print(\"This refers to the historical 'trick' of making felt hats, which used mercuric nitrate.\")\n    print(\"This process was dangerous and is no longer used, connecting an obsolete 'trick' to 'hat' making.\\n\")\n    \n    # Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion: Both clues point to the same two-word phrase.\")\n    print(f\"The value for X is: {x}\")\n    print(f\"The value for Y is: {y}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final answer 'X Y' is: {x} {y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
