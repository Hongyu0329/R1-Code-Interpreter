    "Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in this image. The prominent white, fuzzy sphere on the twig is an insect-induced gall, specifically an oak gall.\n\nGalls are abnormal plant growths created in response to an insect laying its eggs in the plant's tissue. The gall structure provides both food and a protective home for the developing insect larvae. In this case, a female gall wasp (family Cynipidae) laid her eggs in the stem of this oak tree. The chemicals from the eggs/larvae stimulated the tree to form this unique structure around them.\n\nTherefore, the eggs are laid inside the gall.\n\n```python\ndef insect_activity_and_egg_location():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the image for insect activity and determines where the insect lays its eggs.\n  \"\"\"\n  evidence = \"The large, white, fuzzy growth on the stem is an oak gall.\"\n  cause = \"It is created by a gall wasp that lays its eggs in the plant's tissue.\"\n  egg_location = \"The gall serves as a protective nursery, so the eggs and larvae are located inside the gall.\"\n\n  print(\"Is there evidence of insect activity in this image?\")\n  print(f\"Yes, {evidence}\")\n  print(\"\\nWhere will that insect lay its eggs?\")\n  print(f\"{cause} {egg_location}\")\n\ninsect_activity_and_egg_location()\n```\n<<<Yes, the large, white, fuzzy growth on the stem is an oak gall, which is evidence of insect activity. The gall wasp lays its eggs inside the stem of the oak tree, and the gall forms around them. Therefore, the eggs and subsequent larvae are located inside the gall.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
