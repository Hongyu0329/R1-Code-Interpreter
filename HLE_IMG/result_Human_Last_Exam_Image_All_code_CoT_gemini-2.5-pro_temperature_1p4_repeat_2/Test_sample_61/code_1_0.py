# Plan:
# 1. Define the molecular formula of the starting material, compound 1.
# 2. Define the groups that are effectively added and removed during the reaction sequence.
# 3. Calculate the final molecular formula by summing the atomic changes.

# Molecular formula of Compound 1 (Methyl 1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2-carboxylate)
c1 = 11
h1 = 10
o1 = 3

# The overall transformation is an alkylation followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation.
# This can be seen as a replacement of the H on the alpha-carbon with a benzyl group,
# and the replacement of the -COOMe group with an H atom.

# Added group: Benzyl group (C7H7)
add_c = 7
add_h = 7

# Removed group: Methyl carboxylate group (-COOMe), formula C2H3O2
remove_c = 2
remove_h = 3
remove_o = 2

# One H atom is lost from the alpha-carbon to make way for the benzyl group.
remove_h_alpha = 1

# One H atom is gained at the alpha-carbon after the -COOMe group is removed.
add_h_final = 1


# Calculate the final number of atoms for compound A.
final_c = c1 + add_c - remove_c
final_h = h1 - remove_h_alpha + add_h - remove_h + add_h_final
final_o = o1 - remove_o
