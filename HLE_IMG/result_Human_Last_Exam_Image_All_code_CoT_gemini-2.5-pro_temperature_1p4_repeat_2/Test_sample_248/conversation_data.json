    "This image displays a classic rocky intertidal community. To determine whether it's from the Atlantic or Pacific, we need to identify a species with a specific geographic range.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo shows acorn barnacles covering the rock surface, along with several species of snails. The most prominent snails are a striped one and a plainer one, which are identifiable as common periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*). There are also smaller, darker periwinkles.\n2.  **Analyze geographic distribution:**\n    *   The common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, is native to the northeast Atlantic (Europe) and is a very common invasive species on the northwest Atlantic coast (North America). While there are some very small, localized populations on the Pacific coast, its presence in such a thriving, natural-looking community strongly points to the Atlantic.\n    *   The barnacles are consistent with the appearance of the northern rock barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is found *exclusively* in the North Atlantic Ocean, on both the European and North American coasts. It is not found in the Pacific Ocean.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the barnacle *Semibalanus balanoides* would definitively place this photo on an Atlantic coast. Since the barnacles in the photo are visually consistent with this species, it serves as the definitive indicator.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this definitive indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_definitive_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the species in the image that definitively indicates an Atlantic,\n    rather than Pacific, coast location.\n\n    The image shows a community of organisms typical of the North Atlantic rocky shore.\n    This includes:\n    - Barnacles, identified as Semibalanus balanoides.\n    - Snails, including the common periwinkle, Littorina littorea.\n\n    While Littorina littorea is overwhelmingly Atlantic, it does have a very minor\n    introduced presence on the Pacific coast.\n\n    In contrast, the northern rock barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, is found\n    exclusively in the North Atlantic Ocean. Its presence is therefore a definitive\n    indicator that the location is on an Atlantic coast.\n    \"\"\"\n    definitive_species_name = \"Semibalanus balanoides\"\n    print(definitive_species_name)\n\nfind_definitive_species()\n```\n<<<Semibalanus balanoides>>>"
