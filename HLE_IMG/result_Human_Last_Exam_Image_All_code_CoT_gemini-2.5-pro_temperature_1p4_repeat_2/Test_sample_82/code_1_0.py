    # 2. Migratory insertion forms a new C-C bond between C9 and C5. The palladium atom attaches to C4.
    # 3. Beta-hydride elimination occurs. The palladium at C4 can only eliminate with a hydrogen from C3,
    #    as C5 becomes a quaternary carbon with no hydrogens.
    # 4. This elimination forms a new double bond between C3 and C4.
