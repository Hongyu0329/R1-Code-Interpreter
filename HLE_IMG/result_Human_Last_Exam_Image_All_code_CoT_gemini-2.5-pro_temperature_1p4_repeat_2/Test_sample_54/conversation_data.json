    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step (1 → 2) to identify reagent A.**\n    *   The starting material `1` is a complex oxygen-containing cationic heterocycle.\n    *   The product `2` shows that one of the oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic framework has been replaced by a nitrogen atom which is also bonded to an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   This `>N-NH2` group (a substituted hydrazine) strongly suggests that the reagent used to introduce it was **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. Hydrazine is a common nucleophile used to introduce two adjacent nitrogen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, **reagent A is hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step (2 → 3) to identify reagent B.**\n    *   This step involves a significant structural rearrangement from the skeleton of `2` to the pentacyclic core of a **quinacridinium** salt, which is structure `3`.\n    *   A key feature in product `3` is the presence of a new **n-propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃)** attached to one of the nitrogen atoms of the quinacridinium core.\n    *   This n-propyl group must be introduced by reagent B.\n    *   The scientific literature describes this specific synthesis. The intermediate formed from the reaction with hydrazine (`2`) is reacted with an aldehyde (`R-CHO`) to form the N-alkylated quinacridinium salt.\n    *   To get an N-propyl group, the aldehyde must be **propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO)**. The reaction involves a condensation followed by a complex acid-catalyzed cyclization and rearrangement cascade.\n    *   Therefore, **reagent B is propanal**.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to print the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the chemical reagents A and B for the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"Propanal (CH3CH2CHO)\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the chemical transformations shown:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B}\")\n\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine (NH2NH2) and Reagent B is Propanal (CH3CH2CHO).>>>"
