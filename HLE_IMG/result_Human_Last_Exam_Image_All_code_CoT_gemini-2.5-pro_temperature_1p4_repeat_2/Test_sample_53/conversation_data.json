    "My analysis of the provided image, which is a depiction on an ancient Greek vase, leads me to identify the scene as a famous episode from Greek mythology.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image shows a chariot scene on a red-figure vase.\n    *   A figure in ornate, non-Greek attire (a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap) is driving a chariot.\n    *   A second figure, draped in white, is next to the driver.\n    *   A nude male figure lies dead or dying on the ground below the chariot.\n    *   A winged figure hovers above the scene.\n    *   The style of the vase is Apulian red-figure, from Southern Italy, dating to the 4th century BCE.\n\n2.  **Connect to Mythology:** This combination of elements—a foreign sorceress, a flying chariot, and a dead youth—is characteristic of the myth of Medea. Specifically, it depicts her escape from Corinth after taking revenge on her husband Jason.\n\n3.  **Identify the Figures:**\n    *   **The Driver:** The figure in the Phrygian cap driving the chariot is **Medea**. The cap and elaborate clothing identify her as a foreigner from Colchis. She is the protagonist of this scene, actively leaving Corinth. The chariot is a magical one, often described as a gift from her grandfather, the sun-god Helios.\n    *   **The Fallen Figure:** The body on the ground is one of the two sons of Medea and Jason, whom she has just murdered.\n    *   **The Passenger:** The other figure in the chariot is sometimes interpreted as a ghostly image of the second child or a divine attendant.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** This is likely a personification of madness or a Fury, spurring Medea on in her terrible act.\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This refers to the main character who is departing the scene. In this mythological context, that figure is unequivocally Medea, who is making her escape after her acts of vengeance.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will write a simple python script to print the name of the figure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the main figure leaving in the chariot depicted on the ancient Greek vase.\n    The scene is from the myth of Medea. The figure driving the chariot, wearing distinctive foreign attire,\n    is Medea, escaping from Corinth after her revenge on Jason.\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Medea\"\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot is {figure_name}.\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
