    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** I will observe its color, texture, and features. It is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of holes). This indicates it's an extrusive igneous rock that cooled quickly, trapping gas. The color suggests a mafic or intermediate composition. This type of rock is commonly known as scoria.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** I will examine its composition and texture. It is made of various smaller rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This is characteristic of a clastic rock. Since the fragments are related to volcanic activity (based on context with other volcanic rocks), this is likely a tuff or a volcanic breccia.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** I will look at its color and texture. It is light-colored and, like H, very vesicular. A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is called pumice. It's so porous it can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** I will inspect its texture and mineral composition. This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The presence of large crystals of minerals like feldspar (light-colored, blocky) and others suggests it could be a granite or, given the very large crystal size, a pegmatite.\n5.  **Create Python Code:** I will write a Python script to store these identifications in a dictionary and then print out the identification for each specimen in a formatted manner.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria. This is a vesicular (holey) extrusive igneous rock. The reddish color comes from the oxidation of iron as it cooled.',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Tuff/Breccia. This rock is composed of consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments (clasts) ejected during a volcanic eruption.',\n        'J': 'Pumice. This is a light-colored, extremely porous (vesicular) volcanic rock formed during an explosive eruption. It has a low density and can often float on water.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite. This is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock. The large, visible crystals indicate it cooled very slowly deep within the Earth.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, description in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff/Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
