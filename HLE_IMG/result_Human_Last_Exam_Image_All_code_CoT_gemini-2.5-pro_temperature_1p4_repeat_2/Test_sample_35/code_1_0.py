    This function provides a detailed explanation regarding the S100B protein's receptor affinity
    and its role as a biomarker based on the provided diagram.

1. Receptor Identification:
The diagram shows that the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products, which is labeled as RAGE. The specific binding occurs at the extracellular portion of the RAGE receptor, which is composed of the V, C1, and C2 domains. S100B initiates its signaling cascade by binding to this region.

2. Marker Classification (Prognostic Marker):
S100B can be utilized as a prognostic marker in the pathology of neurological disorders. Here's the reasoning:
The diagram illustrates that the binding of S100B to RAGE activates downstream signaling pathways, including NFÎºB. The activation of this pathway directly leads to outcomes that determine the severity and progression of the disease: neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.
Because the concentration of S100B directly correlates with the extent of these damaging processes, measuring its levels can provide valuable information about the future course of the disease. Higher levels of S100B would indicate a more aggressive inflammatory state and thus predict a poorer clinical prognosis for the patient. Therefore, it serves not just as a supporting (adjunct) marker but as a predictive (prognostic) one.
