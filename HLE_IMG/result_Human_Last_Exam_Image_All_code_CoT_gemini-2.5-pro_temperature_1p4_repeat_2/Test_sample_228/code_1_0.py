    Analyzes the provided image to determine its primary theoretical influence.

    The image is a collage with key features pointing to a specific art movement and its theoretical underpinnings.
    - Style: Collage, juxtaposing disparate elements. This was a key technique for Surrealism.
    - Content: A human-animal hybrid, dream-like scenes, mythological references ("Persephone"), and fragmented, subconscious-sounding text.
    - Connection: These elements are hallmarks of the Surrealist movement. The Surrealists were explicitly and profoundly influenced by the psychoanalytic theories of the unconscious mind, dream analysis, and mythology.

    The theorist who provided this framework is Sigmund Freud.
