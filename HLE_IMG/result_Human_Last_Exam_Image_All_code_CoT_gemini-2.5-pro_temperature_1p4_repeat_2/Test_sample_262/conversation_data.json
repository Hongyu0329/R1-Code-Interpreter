    "This problem requires us to determine which of the four iridium complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). The operational lifetime of an LEC is largely determined by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter complex. Let's analyze the structural features of the four complexes that influence their stability.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **General Structure:** All four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes of the type `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`. The `C^N` ligands are cyclometalating phenylpyridine derivatives, and the `N^N` ligand is a bipyridine derivative. Stability in such complexes is often enhanced by two main strategies:\n    *   Introducing bulky substituents to sterically hinder degradation pathways.\n    *   Introducing electron-withdrawing groups (like fluorine) to increase electrochemical stability and strengthen metal-ligand bonds.\n\n2.  **Comparison of Ligands:**\n    *   **N^N Ligand (Bipyridine):** Complexes 1, 3, and 4 all feature 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (`dtbbpy`). The bulky tert-butyl groups provide significant steric protection around the metal center, which is known to improve device lifetime by preventing aggregation and unwanted bimolecular reactions. Complex 2, however, uses an unsubstituted 2,2'-bipyridine (`bpy`) ligand, which lacks this steric protection. Therefore, **Complex 2** is expected to be less stable and have a shorter lifetime compared to the others on this basis.\n\n    *   **C^N Ligand (Phenylpyridine):** Complexes 1, 3, and 4 all have the bulky `dtbbpy` ligand, but differ in the fluorination of their `C^N` ligands.\n        *   **Complex 4:** Uses unsubstituted phenylpyridine (`ppy`).\n        *   **Complex 3:** Uses 2-fluorophenylpyridine (`Fppy`).\n        *   **Complex 1:** Uses 2,4-difluorophenylpyridine (`dFppy`).\n    Fluorine is a strong electron-withdrawing atom. Its inclusion in the `C^N` ligand strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the ligand less likely to dissociate (a common degradation pathway). It also lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), making the complex more resistant to oxidation. Following this trend, the stability should increase with the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   Stability order: Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 4.\n    *   This means that **Complex 4**, with no fluorine atoms on its `C^N` ligands, is the least stable among this subgroup and is expected to have a shorter lifetime compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** We have identified two complexes that lack key stabilizing features:\n    *   **Complex 2** lacks bulky steric groups on the `N^N` ligand.\n    *   **Complex 4** lacks the stabilizing electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the `C^N` ligands.\n    Both of these deficiencies are known to lead to shorter device lifetimes. Therefore, Complexes [2] and [4] are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes based on their structural features\n    to predict their operational lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the structural features of each complex\n    complexes = {\n        1: {\"N^N_ligand\": \"dtbbpy (bulky)\", \"C^N_ligand\": \"dFppy (di-fluorinated)\"},\n        2: {\"N^N_ligand\": \"bpy (non-bulky)\", \"C^N_ligand\": \"dFppy (di-fluorinated)\"},\n        3: {\"N^N_ligand\": \"dtbbpy (bulky)\", \"C^N_ligand\": \"Fppy (mono-fluorinated)\"},\n        4: {\"N^N_ligand\": \"dtbbpy (bulky)\", \"C^N_ligand\": \"ppy (non-fluorinated)\"}\n    }\n\n    # Principles of stability for these emitters:\n    # 1.
