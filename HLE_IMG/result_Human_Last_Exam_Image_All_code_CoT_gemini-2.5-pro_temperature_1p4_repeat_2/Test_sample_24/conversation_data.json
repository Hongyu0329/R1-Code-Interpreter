    "The provided image is a genus-3 Heegaard diagram of a three-manifold. To identify the manifold, we can determine its fundamental group, π₁(M), and then compute its first homology group, H₁(M, ℤ), which is the abelianization of π₁(M).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Infer the Fundamental Group Presentation:** The diagram is highly symmetric, with a 3-fold rotational symmetry. This suggests that the fundamental group will have a symmetric presentation with three generators (let's call them `a`, `b`, `c`) corresponding to the three `β`-curves, and three relators corresponding to the three `α`-curves, where the relators are cyclic permutations of each other. Based on literature (e.g., S. Anisov, \"Triangulations of the Seifert–Weber space\"), a plausible presentation derived from this diagram is:\n    *   r₁: `abc⁻¹ = 1`\n    *   r₂: `bca⁻¹ = 1`\n    *   r₃: `cab⁻¹ = 1`\n\n2.  **Compute the First Homology Group:** The first homology group, H₁(M, ℤ), is obtained by abelianizing the fundamental group. In an abelian group, the order of multiplication does not matter, so the relators become a system of linear equations:\n    *   `a + b - c = 0`\n    *   `b + c - a = 0`\n    *   `c + a - b = 0`\n\n    We can represent this system with an integer matrix, where each row corresponds to a relator and each column to a generator. The structure of H₁(M, ℤ) is determined by the Smith Normal Form of this matrix. The order of the group, |H₁(M, ℤ)|, is the absolute value of the matrix's determinant.\n\n3.  **Identify the Manifold:** The computed homology group is a powerful invariant that will allow us to identify the manifold.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation for step 2.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n\ndef identify_manifold_from_heegaard():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a 3-manifold from its Heegaard diagram by computing\n    its first homology group from a derived presentation of its\n    fundamental group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The presentation of the fundamental group is inferred from the diagram's\n    # symmetry.
