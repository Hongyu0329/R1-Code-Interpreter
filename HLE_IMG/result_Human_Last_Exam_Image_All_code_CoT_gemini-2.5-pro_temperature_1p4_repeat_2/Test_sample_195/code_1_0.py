  This function formulates and prints the equation for f(x) based on its graphical features.
  The features used are:
  - X-intercepts at -b, b, d giving the numerator: (x+b)(x-b)(x-d)
  - Vertical asymptotes at a, c giving the denominator: (x-a)(x-c)
  - A slant asymptote y=x which confirms the structure and relates the parameters.
