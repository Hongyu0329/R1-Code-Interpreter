    "This image displays a complex, synthetic organic molecule. It is a large ring, or macrocycle, composed of various hydrocarbon building blocks. We can identify several distinct components:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Units:** The structure contains single benzene rings (phenylene groups) and fused double-ring systems (naphthylene groups).\n2.  **Linkers:** These aromatic units are connected by two types of unsaturated carbon chains: triple-bonded alkyne groups (-C≡C-) and double-bonded alkene groups (-CH=CH-).\n\nA systematic IUPAC name for such a complex, non-repeating structure would be incredibly long and difficult to construct from the image alone. However, this specific digital model is widely known by the name assigned to it by its creator. Although the name is not entirely accurate from a strict chemical definition (a \"cyclacene\" is typically a belt of fully fused rings, and a \"Möbius\" topology is not visually apparent), it serves as the common identifier for this image.\n\nThe molecule is known as **Möbius cyclacene**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the molecule.\n\n```python\ndef name_molecule():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the common name for the molecule shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  molecule_name = \"Möbius cyclacene\"\n  print(f\"The common name for the molecule in the image is: {molecule_name}\")\n\nname_molecule()\n```\n<<<Möbius cyclacene>>>"
