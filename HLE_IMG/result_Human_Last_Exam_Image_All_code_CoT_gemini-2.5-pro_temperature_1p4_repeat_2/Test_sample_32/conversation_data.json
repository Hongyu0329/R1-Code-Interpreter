    "The primary way to distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance, when sporophytes are present, is by observing the seta, which is the small stalk that holds the spore capsule.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that will print a detailed explanation of this key difference.\n\n1.  **Identify the key structure:** The question asks about the sporophyte. The main parts of a moss sporophyte are the foot, seta (stalk), and capsule.\n2.  **Compare the species:**\n    *   For *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight. This holds the capsule in an erect position, nestled among the leaves.\n    *   For *Grimmia curviseta*, the specific epithet *curviseta* gives a major clue: \"curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" is the stalk. Its seta is characteristically curved or arched, causing the capsule to bend over or nod.\n3.  **Formulate the output:** The Python script will use a `print()` function to display a clear, formatted string explaining this difference.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the main sporophytic difference between\n    Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    \n    # The key distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n    \n    description = (\n        f\"The main difference in the sporophyte between {species1} and {species2} that helps distinguish them at a glance is the seta.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"In {species1}, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"In {species2}, the seta is distinctly curved or arched (its name 'curviseta' means 'curved stalk'), causing the capsule to be nodding or cernuous.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(description)\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, while in *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
