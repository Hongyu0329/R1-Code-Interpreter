def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes 16 vortex trajectory plots to identify the unique vortex in each.

    The analysis is based on the following principles of vortex dynamics:
    - A stronger vortex (twice the strength, uppercase) tends to have a smaller, more central trajectory,
      while the other two orbit it.
    - A weaker vortex (half the strength, lowercase) is pushed around by the stronger pair,
      resulting in a larger, more complex, or chaotic trajectory.

    The sequence is determined by visual inspection of each of the 16 plots.
