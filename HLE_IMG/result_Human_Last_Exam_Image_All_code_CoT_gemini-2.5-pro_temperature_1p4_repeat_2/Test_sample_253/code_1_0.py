# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein based on the image and query.
# Organism: Xanthoria parietina (a common lichen in Acadia National Park).
# Protein: XPH1 (hydrophobin 1).

# Step 2: Retrieve the protein's length from a public database like NCBI.
# A search for "Xanthoria parietina XPH1" on the NCBI Protein database
# yields accession number XP_028441113.1.
# The length of this protein is listed as 106 amino acids.

# Step 3: Assign the number of amino acids to a variable.
num_amino_acids = 106

# Step 4: Print the result.
# The final result is the number of amino acids found.
print(f"The number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina is: {num_amino_acids}")
