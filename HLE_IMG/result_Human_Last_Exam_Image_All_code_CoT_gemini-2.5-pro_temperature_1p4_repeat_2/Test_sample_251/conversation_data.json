    "To determine the longest R-R interval in seconds from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG settings:** The paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. On a standard ECG grid, this means each large square (5 mm) represents 0.2 seconds, and each small square (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Identify the longest interval:** By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we can find the longest pause between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks). This is clearly visible in the fourth strip, where there's a significant pause compared to the rest of the rhythm.\n3.  **Measure the interval:** We'll count the number of large squares between the peaks of the R-waves that define this longest interval. The distance is 7 large squares.\n4.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:** We will multiply the number of large squares by the time duration of one large square.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# ECG paper speed information\n# 1 large square = 5 mm\n# Paper speed = 25 mm/sec\n# Time per large square = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds\n\n# Measure the longest R-R interval in large squares from the ECG strip\nlongest_rr_interval_large_squares = 7\n\n# Define the time duration of one large square in seconds\ntime_per_large_square_sec = 0.2\n\n# Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = longest_rr_interval_large_squares * time_per_large_square_sec\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result\nprint(\"To find the longest R-R interval in seconds:\")\nprint(\"1.
