def solve():
    """
    This function reports the solution to the cellular automata mapping problem.

    The mapping is determined by analyzing the properties of the rules shown in images A-H
    and matching them to the single-step evolution results shown in images 1-8.

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1.  Deduce properties of the 8 rules (A-H) from their 20-step evolution patterns.
    2.  Estimate the statistical outcome (density and texture) of applying each rule for a single step on a random grid.
    3.  Compare these estimations with the observed patterns in images 1-8.

    This leads to the following unique mapping:
    - A -> 2
    - B -> 6
    - C -> 5
    - D -> 8
    - E -> 7
    - F -> 3
    - G -> 1
    - H -> 4
