    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot**: First, I will identify the knot shown in the diagram. I'll count its crossings and observe its structure. The knot has 7 crossings and is alternating (the strand goes over, then under, then over, etc.). By comparing it with the standard knot catalog (the Rolfsen table), this knot is identified as the **7₄ knot**.\n\n2.  **Determine Chirality (Handedness)**: The Rasmussen invariant depends on the knot's chirality (whether it's the \"right-handed\" or \"left-handed\" version). I'll examine the crossings to determine the diagram's writhe. By convention, all crossings in this diagram are negative. The standard diagram for the 7₄ knot has all positive crossings. Therefore, the knot shown in the picture is the **mirror image** of the standard 7₄ knot. We can denote it as **-7₄**.\n\n3.  **Find the Known Invariant**: I will use the known, tabulated value of the Rasmussen s-invariant for the standard 7₄ knot. This value is widely available in knot theory resources like the KnotInfo database. The value is **s(7₄) = -6**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Mirror Property**: The Rasmussen invariant has a simple relationship for mirror images: the invariant of the mirror knot is the negative of the original knot's invariant. That is, **s(K!) = -s(K)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Using the value for the standard 7₄ knot and the mirror property, I will calculate the s-invariant for the knot in the image.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image by identifying\n    the knot, using its tabulated invariant value, and applying the mirror property.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identification of the knot.\n    # The knot diagram shows a 7-crossing alternating knot.
