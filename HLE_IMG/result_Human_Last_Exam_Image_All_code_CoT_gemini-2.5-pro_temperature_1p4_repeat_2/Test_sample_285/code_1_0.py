    This function analyzes four triangulations (A, B, C, D) based on visual
    inspection to identify violators of the Delaunay empty circle property.

    The primary heuristic used is that Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum
    angle, avoiding long, skinny "sliver" triangles. Sliver triangles have large
