    "Based on the provided chemical transformation, we can deduce the types of pericyclic reactions involved by breaking down the process into plausible steps, consistent with known photochemical reactions of aromatic compounds and alkenes.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation:** The reaction shows hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄) reacting under UV light (`hν`) to form a single, complex polycyclic product (C₁₀H₄F₆). This indicates an addition reaction followed by rearrangement. The formation of a complex cage from simpler rings under photochemical conditions strongly suggests a sequence of pericyclic reactions.\n\n2.  **Identify the first pericyclic reaction:** The most common photochemical reaction between benzene and an alkene is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. This reaction is photochemically allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. One of the π-bonds of hexafluorobenzene reacts with the π-bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring, linking the two molecules. This creates an initial, unstable adduct.\n\n3.  **Identify the second pericyclic reaction:** The initial adduct formed in step 2 is known to be thermally unstable and rearranges to the more stable final product shown. This rearrangement is a classic **[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement**, also known as a **Cope rearrangement**. This is the second pericyclic reaction. Although the Cope rearrangement is typically a thermal process, it is an integral part of this overall photochemical transformation, and the question asks for the two pericyclic reactions that constitute the transformation. The energy from the photochemical excitation can lead to intermediates that readily undergo this type of rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a [2π+2π] cycloaddition and a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the types of pericyclic reactions involved in the chemical transformation.\n  \"\"\"\n  reaction1 = \"[2π+2π] cycloaddition\"\n  reaction2 = \"[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (Cope rearrangement)\"\n  \n  print(\"The two pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n  print(f\"1. A {reaction1}\")\n  print(f\"2. A {reaction2}\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a [2π+2π] cycloaddition and a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.>>>"
