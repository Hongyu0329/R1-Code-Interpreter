    "The plant in the image is identifiable as *Daphniphyllum macropodum*, likely the 'Nishikiba' or 'Variegated' cultivar, which is native to Japan, China, and Korea. However, this species is not endemic to a single island.\n\nThe question's phrasing, specifically \"was endemic to,\" strongly suggests the plant in question is now extinct in the wild or its conservation status has changed significantly. A famous botanical example that fits this description is the Saint Helena Olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). This plant was endemic to the island of Saint Helena but is now unfortunately extinct. The last wild tree died in 1994, and the last cultivated specimen perished in 2003.\n\nGiven the contradiction between the image and the specific wording of the question, the most logical approach is to answer based on the textual clue \"was endemic,\" which points directly to a case like the Saint Helena Olive.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island based on the clues in the prompt.\n    The prompt asks for the island to which a specific plant \"was endemic\".\n    This phrasing points to a plant that is likely extinct, such as the\n    St Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica), which was endemic to Saint Helena.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
