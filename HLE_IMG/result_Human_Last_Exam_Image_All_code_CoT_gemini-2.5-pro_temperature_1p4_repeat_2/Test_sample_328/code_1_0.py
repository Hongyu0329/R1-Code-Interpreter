    Determines the unique parameter for each of the 16 plots.

    The logic is based on matching the physical behavior predicted by the parameters (b, c, d)
    with the visual characteristics of the solutions.

    - Plots 10 & 15: Clean soliton interactions suggest b=d=0.
      10: Soliton pass-through/breather (focusing case) -> C (c=1, b=d=0)
      15: Soliton repulsion (defocusing case) -> c (c=-1, b=d=0)

    - Plots 3,5,7,12: Strong saturation suggests d is the unique, non-zero parameter, or a similar case.
      3 & 5: Look like symmetric counterparts. Saturation to red (3) vs blue (5).
      -> 3: D (d=1, b=c=0), 5: d (d=-1, b=c=0)
      7 & 12: Asymmetric versions of the above.
      -> 7: D (d=1, b=c=-1), 12: d (d=-1, b=c=1)

    - Plots 1 & 6: Related to d=0 cases.
      6: Dispersal to a neutral background -> 0 (d=0, b=c=-1)
      1: Complex pattern with multiple stable states -> 0 (d=0, b=c=1)

    - The remaining plots are assigned based on a consistent pairing of codes, assuming each
      of the 8 codes {B,b,C,c,D,d,Z,0} appears twice (the 'z' code is unused).
      This leaves 10 plots to be assigned codes {B,B,b,b,C,C,c,c,Z,Z}.
      11 & 13: Saturation plots.
      -> 11: c (c=-1, b=d=1, red sat.), 13: C (c=1, b=d=-1, blue sat.)
      The rest {2,4,8,9,14,16} are wavy/chaotic and are assigned to the {B,b,Z} pairs.
      Red/Positive tending plots {2,9,14} get red-saturating codes {B,b,Z}.
      Blue/Negative tending plots {4,8,16} get blue-saturating codes {B,b,Z}.
