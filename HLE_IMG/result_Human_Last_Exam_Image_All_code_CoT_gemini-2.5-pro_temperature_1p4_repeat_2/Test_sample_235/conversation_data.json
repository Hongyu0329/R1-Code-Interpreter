    "My plan is to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem by analyzing its structure and syllable count.\n\n1.  **Identify the complete text:** Erasure poems often incorporate elements from the source page beyond the most obvious cutout words. I will assume the poem includes the page's title (\"THE FIRST STEP\") and the page number (\"35\"), in addition to the cutout words (\"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\").\n2.  **Construct the poem's sentence:** Reading these elements together forms a single sentence: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n3.  **Count the syllables:** I will count the syllables for each word in this reconstructed sentence to find the total.\n4.  **Match with options:** I will compare the total syllable count and structure against the definitions of the given poetic forms. The \"American Sentence\" is a specific form that consists of a single sentence with exactly 17 syllables.\n5.  **Write Python code:** The code will list the words of the poem, display the syllable count for each part, and print the full equation adding up to the total number of syllables, thereby demonstrating the analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poem_metric():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the erasure poem by counting syllables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the full text of the poem, including title and page number,\n    # and determine the syllable count for each word.\n    # The poem is interpreted as: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n    poem_words = [\n        \"The\", \"first\", \"step\", \n        \"thirty\", \"five\", \n        \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines\", \n        \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", \n        \"work\"\n    ]\n    \n    syllable_counts = [\n        1,  # The\n        1,  # first\n        1,  # step\n        2,  # thir-ty\n        1,  # five\n        1,  # rules\n        1,  # and\n        1,  # lines\n        1,  # an\n        3,  # in-tri-cate\n        2,  # spi-der's\n        1,  # web\n        1   # work\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total syllable count and create the equation string.\n    total_syllables = sum(syllable_counts)\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, syllable_counts))\n\n    # Step 4: Print the analysis.\n    print(\"The complete text of the erasure poem is likely constructed from the title, page number, and cutout words:\")\n    print(f\"'{' '.join(poem_words)}'\")\n    print(\"\\nTo determine the metric pattern, we count the syllables of each word:\")\n    \n    # Display words with their syllable counts\n    for i in range(len(poem_words)):\n        print(f\"- {poem_words[i]}: {syllable_counts[i]} syllable(s)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of syllables is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_syllables}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nA single sentence containing exactly 17 syllables is known as an 'American Sentence'.\")\n    print(\"This matches the structure of the poem.\")\n\nanalyze_poem_metric()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
