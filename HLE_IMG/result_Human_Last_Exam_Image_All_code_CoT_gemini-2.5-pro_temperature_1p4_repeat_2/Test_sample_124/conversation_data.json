    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we first need to calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit. Then, we can use Ohm's Law (I = V / R).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to simplify the circuit and find the equivalent resistance:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit's topology:** We need to identify how the resistors are connected. By labeling the nodes (junction points), we can simplify the circuit diagram.\n    *   Let's call the top wire (connected to the positive terminal of V2) `Node A`.\n    *   Let's call the bottom wire (connected to the negative terminal/ground) `Node B`.\n    *   We can see that a wire connects the junction of R2 and R3 directly to `Node A`. This simplifies the connection of R3 and R2.\n    *   There is another wire connecting the junction of R1 and R2 to the junction of R7 and R8. This means these two points are at the same electrical potential. Let's call this `Node C`.\n\n2.  **Simplify Resistor Groups:**\n    *   **Resistors R1 and R2:** R1 is connected between `Node A` and `Node C`. R2 is connected between `Node C` and `Node A`. This means R1 and R2 are in parallel.\n    *   **Resistor R8:** R8 is connected between `Node A` and `Node C`. Therefore, R8 is in parallel with R1 and R2. We can calculate the equivalent resistance of this parallel group (`Rp1 = R1 || R2 || R8`).\n    *   **Resistor R7:** R7 is connected between `Node C` and `Node B`. It is in series with the parallel group (`Rp1`).\n    *   **Branch 2:** The combination of `Rp1` and `R7` forms one branch of the circuit, connected between `Node A` and `Node B`. The total resistance of this branch is `R_branch2 = Rp1 + R7`.\n    *   **Resistor R3:** R3 is connected between `Node A` and `Node B`, making it directly parallel to the rest of the circuit.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance (Req):**\n    *   The entire circuit simplifies to two parallel branches connected to the voltage source: one branch is just R3, and the other branch is `R_branch2`.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance `Req` is the parallel combination of R3 and `R_branch2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   Using Ohm's law, the total current flowing from the source V2 is `I_total = V2 / Req`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the total current.\n\n```python\n# Define the values of the components from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel group of R1, R2, and R8.\nprint(\"Step 1: Resistors R1, R2, and R8 are in parallel.\")\nprint(f\"1/Rp1 = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8 = 1/{R1} + 1/{R2} + 1/{R8}\")\ninv_Rp1 = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8\nRp1 = 1 / inv_Rp1\nprint(f\"Rp1 = {Rp1:.4f} 立\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: This parallel group (Rp1) is in series with R7.\nprint(\"Step 2: The parallel group (Rp1) is in series with R7.\")\nprint(f\"R_branch2 = Rp1 + R7 = {Rp1:.4f} + {R7}\")\nR_branch2 = Rp1 + R7\nprint(f\"R_branch2 = {R_branch2:.4f} 立\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: The branch containing R_branch2 is in parallel with R3. Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req).\nprint(\"Step 3: This entire branch (R_branch2) is in parallel with R3.\")\nprint(f\"1/Req = 1/R_branch2 + 1/R3 = 1/{R_branch2:.4f} + 1/{R3}\")\ninv_Req = 1/R_branch2 + 1/R3\nReq = 1 / inv_Req\nprint(f\"Req = {Req:.4f} 立\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Use Ohm's Law to find the total current from the voltage source V2.\nprint(\"Step 4: Use Ohm's Law to find the total current (I_total).\")\nprint(f\"I_total = V2 / Req = {V2} V / {Req:.4f} 立\")\nI_total = V2 / Req\nprint(f\"The total current flowing through the circuit is: {I_total:.4f} A\")\n```\n<<<0.1209>>>"
