    "My plan to solve this mass spectrometry problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Weight (MW):** I will identify the molecular ion peak (M⁺), which is the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that corresponds to the intact molecule. Based on the spectrum and table, the highest significant m/z cluster starts at 262. Thus, the nominal molecular weight is 262 u.\n\n2.  **Identify Presence of Halogens:** The cluster of peaks at m/z 262, 264, and 266 indicates the presence of chlorine atoms. The (M+2) and (M+4) peaks are characteristic of chlorine's isotopic distribution (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl). The pattern roughly suggests the presence of two chlorine atoms.\n\n3.  **Propose a Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Assuming two chlorine atoms, the mass contributed by chlorine is 2 * 35 = 70 u (using the nominal mass of the most abundant isotope, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule is 262 - 70 = 192 u.\n    *   I will analyze the major fragments to deduce the composition of this remaining part. A very significant fragment is seen at m/z 190. The mass difference between the molecular ion (262) and this fragment (190) is 72 u. This corresponds to the loss of two molecules of HCl (2 * 36 u, using nominal masses H=1, Cl=35).\n    *   The loss of 2HCl from the parent molecule (let's denote it as `R'H₂Cl₂`) would result in a fragment `R'`. This `R'` fragment has a mass of 190 u.\n    *   Assuming the molecule contains carbon, hydrogen, and likely oxygen (common in such compounds), I'll find a plausible formula for a fragment with mass 190. The formula C₁₄H₆O fits perfectly: (14 * 12) + (6 * 1) + (16 * 1) = 168 + 6 + 16 = 190.\n    *   If the fragment C₁₄H₆O resulted from the loss of 2H and 2Cl, the original molecule's formula must be C₁₄H₈Cl₂O.\n    *   I will verify the molecular weight of this proposed formula: (14 * 12) + (8 * 1) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 16) = 168 + 8 + 70 + 16 = 262 u. This matches the observed molecular ion peak.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name:** The formula C₁₄H₈Cl₂O has a high degree of unsaturation, suggesting a polycyclic aromatic structure. The C₁₄ skeleton is characteristic of anthracene or phenanthrene. The formula C₁₄H₁₀O corresponds to anthrone. Therefore, the unknown compound is likely a dichloro-derivative of anthrone. I will propose a plausible IUPAC name for such a structure.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize and present these calculations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Atomic masses (nominal mass of the most abundant isotope) ---\n    mass_C = 12\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_O = 16\n    mass_Cl = 35\n    mass_HCl = mass_H + mass_Cl\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Molecular Ion Peak\n    m_z_M_plus = 262\n    print(f\"Step 1: The molecular ion peak (M+) is identified at m/z = {m_z_M_plus}.\")\n    print(\"The presence of M+2 (m/z=264) and M+4 (m/z=266) peaks suggests the molecule contains chlorine.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Hypothesize number of Chlorine atoms and calculate residual mass\n    num_Cl = 2\n    mass_of_Cl_part = num_Cl * mass_Cl\n    residual_mass = m_z_M_plus - mass_of_Cl_part\n    print(f\"Step 2: Assuming {num_Cl} chlorine atoms based on the isotope pattern.\")\n    print(f\"The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{m_z_M_plus} (M+) - {num_Cl} * {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {residual_mass}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze fragmentation to deduce the molecular formula\n    # A major fragment is at m/z = 190.
