    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Determine Reading Order:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from right to left, and from top to bottom. Therefore, the sequence of characters is: top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left.\n2.  **Identify Characters:** The script used is Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū), an ancient calligraphic style. I will identify each character one by one.\n    *   **Top-Right:** The character is `馬` (mǎ), meaning \"horse\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** The character is `到` (dào), meaning \"to arrive\".\n    *   **Top-Left:** The character is `成` (chéng), meaning \"to succeed\" or \"to accomplish\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** The character is `功` (gōng), meaning \"success\" or \"merit\".\n3.  **Form the Phrase:** When combined in the correct order, these characters form the well-known Chinese idiom `馬到成功` (mǎ dào chéng gōng).\n4.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:** In simplified Chinese, the idiom is written as `马到成功`. It is a congratulatory phrase meaning \"to wish someone speedy success\" or \"instant success.\"\n\nHere is the python code to display the simplified Chinese content.\n\n```python\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the simplified Chinese characters from the seal.\n  The idiom is 马到成功 (mǎ dào chéng gōng).\n  \"\"\"\n  char1 = \"马\"  # Simplified for 馬 (mǎ) - horse\n  char2 = \"到\"  # (dào) - to arrive\n  char3 = \"成\"  # (chéng) - to succeed\n  char4 = \"功\"  # (gōng) - success\n\n  print(f\"The characters on the seal read: {char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\")\n  print(\"This is a Chinese idiom 'mǎ dào chéng gōng', which means to wish someone speedy and instant success.\")\n\nget_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<马到成功>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
