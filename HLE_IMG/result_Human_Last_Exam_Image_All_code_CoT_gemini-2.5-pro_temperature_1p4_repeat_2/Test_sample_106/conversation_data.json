    "This is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a \"backbone rearrangement\" common in triterpenoid chemistry. The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the alcohol followed by the loss of water to form a carbocation. This carbocation then undergoes a cascade of 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts to form a more stable intermediate, which finally eliminates a proton to form the alkene product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the substituent migrations:\n1.  **Carbocation formation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 is protonated and eliminated as water, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Rearrangement cascade:**\n    *   A series of 1,2-shifts occurs to move the positive charge across the molecule's backbone from left to right.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C-4 to C-3. Carbocation moves to C-4.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C-5 to C-4. Carbocation moves to C-5.\n    *   A hydride (H) shifts from C-10 to C-5. Carbocation moves to C-10.\n    *   A methyl group (originally at C-9) shifts from C-9 to C-10. This methyl group is now at **Position 2**. The carbocation moves to C-9.\n    *   A hydride (originally at C-8) shifts from C-8 to C-9. This hydrogen is now at **Position 3**. The carbocation moves to C-8.\n    *   A methyl group (originally at C-14) shifts from C-14 to C-8. This methyl group is now at **Position 4**. The carbocation moves to C-14.\n    *   A methyl group (originally at C-13) shifts from C-13 to C-14. This methyl group is now at **Position 5**. The carbocation moves to C-13.\n3.  **Elimination:** A proton is lost from C-12 to form the final stable alkene with a double bond between C-12 and C-13.\n\nBased on this mechanism, we can determine the identity of each numbered substituent:\n*   **Position 1:** This methyl group is on C-4 of the starting material and remains a methyl group.\n*   **Position 2:** The hydrogen originally at C-10 is replaced by a methyl group that migrates from C-9.\n*   **Position 3:** The methyl group originally at C-9 is replaced by a hydrogen that migrates from C-8.\n*   **Position 4:** The hydrogen originally at C-8 is replaced by a methyl group that migrates from C-14.\n*   **Position 5:** The methyl group originally at C-14 is replaced by another methyl group that migrates from C-13.\n\nThis leads to the following assignments. The Python code below will print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions in the product of the\n    Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"CH3\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as requested\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n    final_answer = \", \".join(output_parts)\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
