def find_unknots():
  """
  This function identifies the indices of knots that are isotopic to the unknot from the provided image.
  
  Knot Analysis:
  - K1: Figure-eight knot (4_1), not an unknot.
  - K2: A complicated diagram that simplifies to the unknot via a series of Reidemeister moves (I and II).
  - K3: A deceptive diagram that simplifies to the unknot (can be untangled with an R-II move, then an R-I move).
  - K4: Cinquefoil knot (5_1), not an unknot.
  - K5: Another complex diagram that simplifies to the unknot via a series of Reidemeister moves.
  - K6: Stevedore knot (6_1), not an unknot.
  
  The indices of the unknots are 2, 3, and 5.
