    "Based on the chess position shown in the image, it's White's turn to move and deliver checkmate in two moves.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to find the solution:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:** First, I'll assess the board, focusing on the Black king's position at `e4`. The king is very exposed.\n    *   The escape square `d3` is covered by White's bishop on `g1`.\n    *   The escape squares `d4` and `f5` are covered by White's queen on `a4`.\n    *   This leaves the square `e3` as a potential escape route for the Black king.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate First Moves for White:** I need to find a move for White that leads to a forced checkmate on the next turn, regardless of what Black does.\n    *   An immediate check like `1. Re3+` seems promising, but it fails. After `1. Re3+`, the Black king can move to `d4` (`1... Kd4`), escaping the immediate mating net.\n    *   Therefore, a \"quiet\" move (one that doesn't give a check) is likely the solution. The goal of this move is to take away Black's remaining options and set up an unstoppable threat.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Move:** The winning move is **`1. Rh5-h3`**.\n    *   This move critically covers the `e3` square, removing the Black king's last potential flight square.\n    *   It creates a primary threat of `2. Rf3-e3#`.\n\n4.  **Analyze Black's Responses:** Now, let's see how Black can respond to `1. Rh3`.\n    *   **Scenario A: Black captures the threatening rook.** Black's best try is `1... Qxf3`, removing the piece that was going to deliver the mate. However, this opens up a new line for White. White can now play `2. Ne7-g6#`. The knight delivers check, and all the king's squares are covered by the queen (`d4`, `f5`), the bishop (`d3`), and now the rook that moved to `h3` (which covers `e3`).\n    *   **Scenario B: Black makes any other move.** If Black does anything else, like moving their queen or rook without capturing (`1... Qd6` for example), White proceeds with the original plan: `2. Rf3-e3#`. This is now checkmate because all the king's flight squares are covered, and importantly, the king cannot capture the rook on `e3` because it would still be in check from the White rook on `h3` (this is called a \"discovered check\" rule violation).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The move `1. Rh3` forces checkmate in all variations. I will now generate the Python code to print this solution clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step solution for the provided chess puzzle.\n    White to move and checkmate in two moves.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The checkmate in 2 moves is found with a quiet first move that restricts the black king.\")\n    print(\"Here is the solution:\")\n    \n    # White's first move\n    # The notation includes the piece, starting square, and ending square for clarity.\n    print(\"\\nMove 1: White plays Rh5-h3\")\n    \n    # Explanation of the two main variations after Black's reply.\n    print(\"\\nThis single move forces checkmate on the next turn, regardless of Black's reply.\")\n    print(\"There are two main possibilities for Black:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Variation 1: If Black plays 1...
