    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It appears to be a deceased fish. Based on the distinctive hexagonal, plate-like armor, it is identifiable as a boxfish. Boxfish have scales that are fused together to form a solid, box-like carapace.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
