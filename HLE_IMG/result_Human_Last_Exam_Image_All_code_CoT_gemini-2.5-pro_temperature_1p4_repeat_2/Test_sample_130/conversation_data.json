    "Based on the provided image of the emission spectrum, my plan is to identify the element by analyzing the pattern of the spectral lines.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum's Characteristics:** The image displays an emission spectrum with a vast number of bright lines spread across the entire visible range, from violet/blue on the left to red on the right. The key feature is the high density and complexity of these lines. There isn't a simple, repeating pattern; instead, the lines appear very numerous and closely packed in some regions.\n\n2.  **Compare with Known Elemental Spectra:**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** Has a very simple spectrum in the visible range (the Balmer series), with only four prominent lines (410 nm, 434 nm, 486 nm, 656 nm). This does not match the complexity shown.\n    *   **Helium:** Has more lines than hydrogen but its spectrum is still composed of a relatively small number of distinct, well-separated lines. This also doesn't match the observed density.\n    *   **Iron (Fe):** Is famous for having one of the most complex atomic spectra, with thousands of emission lines crowded across the entire visible spectrum. This characteristic \"busy\" appearance is a strong fingerprint for iron.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The high density of spectral lines is the defining characteristic shown in the image, which strongly points to the element Iron (Fe).\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to formalize this conclusion. The script will contain representative spectral line data for Hydrogen, Helium, and Iron. It will then print a comparison, highlighting why the complex pattern seen in the image matches that of Iron and outputting some of Iron's many spectral lines as evidence.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing the visual characteristics of its\n    emission spectrum with known data.
