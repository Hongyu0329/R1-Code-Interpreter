    "The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a biological process in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus. The process shown is **hyphal branching**.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Image L:** This panel shows a straight fungal hypha (a single filament) with clear cross-walls called septa. The arrowhead points to a septum.\n2.  **Image M:** A small bulge, the beginning of a new branch, starts to form on the side of the hypha, near the septum indicated by the arrowhead.\n3.  **Image N:** The bulge has grown into a distinct new branch, causing the main hypha to bend. The new branch is extending outwards, representing new growth.\n\nThis process allows the fungus to expand its network (mycelium) to search for nutrients and colonize new areas.\n\nI will now provide a simple Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the biological process depicted in the image series.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal Branching\"\n  organism_type = \"a filamentous organism, likely a fungus\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process_name} in {organism_type}.\")\n  print(\"\\nHere is a step-by-step description of the sequence (L -> M -> N):\")\n  \n  step_l = \"Panel L shows a mature hyphal filament with cell compartments separated by cross-walls (septa).

A small bulge is forming on the side wall of the hypha, adjacent to the septum.\"\n  step_n = \"Panel N shows the established new branch growing out from the parent hypha. This is a fundamental way fungi expand their mycelial network.\"\n  \n  print(f\"1. {step_l}\")\n  print(f\"2. {step_m}\")\n  print(f\"3. {step_n}\")\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<The process depicted in the image is hyphal branching in a filamentous fungus.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
