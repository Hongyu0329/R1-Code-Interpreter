# Step 1: Analyze Pair A.
# The left insect is a male (longer antennae, blunt abdomen).
# The right insect is a female (pointed abdomen).
# Combination is M, F, which is index 3.
index_A = 3

# Step 2: Analyze Pair B.
# The left wasp is a male (curled antennae tips).
# The right wasp is a female (straight antennae).
# Combination is M, F, which is index 3.
index_B = 3

# Step 3: Analyze Pair C.
# The left bee is a female (large pollen-filled scopae on hind legs).
# The right bee is a male (very long antennae, no scopae).
# Combination is F, M, which is index 4.
index_C = 4

# Step 4: Format the answer as requested.
# The final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.
