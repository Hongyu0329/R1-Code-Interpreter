    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, I will examine the key features of sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps). The main characteristics to look for are antenna length and shape, the number of abdominal segments, and the presence or absence of specialized pollen-carrying hairs (scopae).\n\nHere is my step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has relatively long antennae and a blunter abdomen tip, which is characteristic of males.\n    *   The insect on the right has a distinctly pointed abdomen, which houses the ovipositor (stinger), indicating it is a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   The key feature here is the antennae. The wasp on the left has antennae with curled tips, a classic indicator of a male wasp in the family Vespidae.\n    *   The wasp on the right has straight antennae, identifying it as a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is **Male, Female (M, F)**, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   The bee on the left has large, dense brushes of hair on its hind legs that are heavily loaded with pollen. These are scopae, and their presence makes this bee a female. (Note: This contradicts the prompt's description of the collected taxa, but we must identify the insect as pictured).\n    *   The bee on the right has conspicuously long antennae (giving the group its \"long-horned\" name), lacks scopae, and has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus). These are all defining traits of a male in this group.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is **Female, Male (F, M)**, which corresponds to index **4**.\n\nCombining these findings, the indices for pairs A, B, and C are 3, 3, and 4, respectively.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze Pair A.\n# The left insect is a male (longer antennae, blunt abdomen).\n# The right insect is a female (pointed abdomen).\n# Combination is M, F, which is index 3.\nindex_A = 3\n\n# Step 2: Analyze Pair B.\n# The left wasp is a male (curled antennae tips).\n# The right wasp is a female (straight antennae).\n# Combination is M, F, which is index 3.\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Analyze Pair C.\n# The left bee is a female (large pollen-filled scopae on hind legs).\n# The right bee is a male (very long antennae, no scopae).\n# Combination is F, M, which is index 4.\nindex_C = 4\n\n# Step 4: Format the answer as requested.\n# The final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 4>>>"
