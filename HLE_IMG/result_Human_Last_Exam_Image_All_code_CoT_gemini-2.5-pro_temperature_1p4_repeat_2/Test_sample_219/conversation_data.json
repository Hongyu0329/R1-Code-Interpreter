    "My plan to solve this task is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to locate the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These events are visible as dense vertical bands of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** I will estimate the approximate start time (in seconds) for each of these major synchronized bursts from the x-axis.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out each step, including the burst times, the individual intervals, the final calculation, and the result rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The bursts are the dense vertical collections of firing events.\n# By inspecting the x-axis (Time (s)), we can estimate their start times.\nburst_timestamps = [2, 17, 36, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\nintervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {intervals.tolist()}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the average IBI.\naverage_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n# Step 5: Display the full calculation and the final answer.\n# The format 'g' is used for general number formatting, and '.2' specifies two significant digits.\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval is calculated as: ({intervals[0]} + {intervals[1]} + {intervals[2]}) / 3 = {average_interval:.4f} s\")\nprint(f\"Rounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is: {average_interval:.2g} s\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
