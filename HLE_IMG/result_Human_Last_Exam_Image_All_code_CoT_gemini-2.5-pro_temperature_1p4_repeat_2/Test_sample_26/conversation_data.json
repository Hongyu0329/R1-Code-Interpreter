    "Here is my plan to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30.\n\n1.  **Identify the measure**: First, I will locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The measures are numbered, and measure 28 is explicitly marked. Measure 30 is two measures after that.\n2.  **Identify the notes**: I will identify all the notes being played in measure 30 in both the right and left hands.\n    *   Right Hand: The arpeggio consists of the notes F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n    *   Left Hand: The chord consists of the notes F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n3.  **Determine the chord quality**: I will analyze the intervals between the notes (F♯, A, C, E♭) to identify the chord.\n    *   F♯ to A is a minor third.\n    *   A to C is a minor third.\n    *   C to E♭ is a minor third.\n    A chord built from a stack of minor thirds is a fully diminished seventh chord. The root is F♯, so this is an F♯ fully diminished seventh chord (F♯°7).\n4.  **Analyze the harmonic function**: I need to determine the role of this chord in the context of the piece.\n    *   The home key of the sonata is C minor. The dominant (V) of C minor is G minor.\n    *   Fully diminished seventh chords most often function as leading-tone chords, resolving up by a half-step to their tonic.\n    *   The root of our chord is F♯. A half-step up from F♯ is G. This means the F♯°7 chord is acting as the leading-tone chord to G.\n    *   Looking at the following measure (m. 31), the harmony is indeed a G minor chord, confirming the resolution.\n5.  **Construct the Roman numeral**: I will combine the findings to create the correct Roman numeral.\n    *   The chord is the leading-tone chord of G. In Roman numerals, the leading-tone chord is `vii`.\n    *   Since it's a fully diminished seventh chord, we use the `°7` symbol. So, we have `vii°7`.\n    *   Because it is functioning as the leading-tone chord of the dominant (V, which is G in the key of C minor), we write it as an applied or secondary chord: `vii°7/V`.\n6.  **Create Python script**: I will write a Python script that prints out the final Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, mvt. 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
