    # Step 1: Determine k
    # From analysis, <x3> in Sim 4 is ~16.65.
    # The equation <x3> ≈ Re/5 = 50*k/5 = 10k holds approximately for Sim 4.
    # 16.65 ≈ 10k  => k ≈ 1.665. The closest integer is 2.
    k = 2

    # Step 2: Determine the plot labels for horizontal axes x1, x2, x3, x4
    # x1 -> i (by elimination)
    # x2 -> h (range explodes in Sim 2 with change B)
    # x3 -> f (large positive values on H-axis)
    # x4 -> g (other plot with V-axis x5)
    axis_mapping = "ihfg"

    # Step 3: Determine the altered parameters for each simulation
    # Sim 1: Baseline, no change.
    param_1 = "0"
    # Sim 2: Change in 'b' (increased) caused x2 to explode.
    param_2 = "B"
    # Sim 3: Change in 'c' (increased) caused larger oscillations in x1, x2.
    param_3 = "C"
    # Sim 4: Change in 'c' (decreased) caused x3 oscillations to shrink.
    param_4 = "c"
    
    param_changes = f"{param_1}{param_2}{param_3}{param_4}"

    # Step 4: Assemble the final string
    final_answer = f"{k}{axis_mapping}{param_changes}"
