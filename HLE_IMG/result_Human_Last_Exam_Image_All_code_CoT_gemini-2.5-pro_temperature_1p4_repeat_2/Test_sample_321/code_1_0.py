# The final answer is the sequence of parameter identifiers corresponding to plots 1 through 9.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis:
# p1 = 2 (μ_s)
# p2 = 5 (a_i)
# p3 = 3 (μ_n)
# p4 = 13 (q_s)
# p5 = 7 (c_l)
# p6 = 15 (q_f)
# p7 = 6 (f_s)
# p8 = 8 (μ_h)
# p9 = 14 (q_l)

solution_sequence = [2, 5, 3, 13, 7, 15, 6, 8, 14]

# Format the output as a string sequence {p1, p2, ..., p9}
solution_string = "{" + ",".join(map(str, solution_sequence)) + "}"
