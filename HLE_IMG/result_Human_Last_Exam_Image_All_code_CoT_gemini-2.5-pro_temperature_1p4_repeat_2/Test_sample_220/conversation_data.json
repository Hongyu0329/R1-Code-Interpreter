    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we need to know the expected 2D projection of the atoms. I will write a Python script to calculate this theoretical pattern.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the atomic positions within a standard FCC unit cell.\n2.  Create a larger crystal structure by repeating this unit cell to make the pattern clear.\n3.  Apply a mathematical projection to these 3D coordinates that simulates viewing the crystal along the [110] direction. This transforms the 3D points into 2D points.\n4.  Analyze the resulting 2D pattern. An FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction should produce a \"centered rectangular\" pattern.\n5.  Compare this theoretical pattern with the visual evidence in images A, B, C, and D to find the match. The code will print the analysis, including a check of the pattern shown in Image A.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the 2D projection pattern of an FCC lattice\n    viewed along the [110] direction to identify the correct image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
