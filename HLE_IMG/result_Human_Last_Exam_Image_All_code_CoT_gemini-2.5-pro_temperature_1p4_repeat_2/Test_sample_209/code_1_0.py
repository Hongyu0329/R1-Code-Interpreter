# The user wants me to identify the giraffe that matches the target.
# I will analyze the spot patterns of the target giraffe and compare them to options A, B, C, D, E, and F.
#
# Analysis of Target: I will focus on the area on the side of the body, above the front leg.
# There is a distinct vertical column of three spots.
# - The top spot is somewhat angular.
# - The middle spot is smaller and more rounded.
# - The bottom spot is larger and irregularly shaped.
#
# Comparison:
# - A: Different color and pattern.
# - B: The color is similar, and the vertical column of three spots is identical in shape and placement to the target.
# - C: Different color and pattern.
# - D: Spots are much darker and the pattern is different.
# - E: The spot pattern does not match the target's key features.
# - F: The pattern does not match the target's key features.
#
# Conclusion: The spot pattern in image B is a clear match for the target giraffe.
