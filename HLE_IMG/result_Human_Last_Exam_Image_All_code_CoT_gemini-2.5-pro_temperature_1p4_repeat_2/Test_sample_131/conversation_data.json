    "My plan to identify the alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the provided chemical structure to identify its key functional groups and skeletal framework.\n2.  The molecule is tetracyclic (has four fused rings).\n3.  It contains two nitrogen atoms, both integrated into the ring system.\n4.  It has one carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which classifies it as a lactam.\n5.  This specific ring system is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids, particularly the lupanine group.\n6.  By comparing the structure, including the stereochemistry indicated by the wedges and dashes, with known alkaloids, I can identify it as Lupanine.\n7.  I will then use a Python script to print this name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the name of the alkaloid compound\n  shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The chemical structure provided is that of Lupanine.\n  compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n  print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
