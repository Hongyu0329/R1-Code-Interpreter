    "This is a great jazz standard! I can identify it from the melody and the characteristic chord progression.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Melody**: The first few notes of the melody, starting with the pickup, are Ab, G, C, C, C, Bb. This is a very recognizable melodic phrase.\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression**: The progression starts with a minor line clich√©: `F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`, `Dbmaj7`. This descending bassline (F, E, Eb, Db) under a minor chord is a strong clue.\n3.  **Combine the Clues**: By searching for a jazz standard in F minor that uses this melody and chord progression, I can confidently identify the tune.\n4.  **Identify the Composer**: Once the title is known, I will look up the composer.\n5.  **Output the Answer**: I will write a Python script to print the title and composer.\n\nThe song is \"Alone Together\", and the music was composed by Arthur Schwartz (with lyrics by Howard Dietz).\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Alone Together\"\n  composer = \"Arthur Schwartz\"\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Alone Together, Composer: Arthur Schwartz>>>"
