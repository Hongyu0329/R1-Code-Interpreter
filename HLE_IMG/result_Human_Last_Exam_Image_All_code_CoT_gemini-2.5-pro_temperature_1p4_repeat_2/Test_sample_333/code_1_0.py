def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the airfoil matching problem.
    The matching is determined by analyzing airfoil geometry (thickness and camber)
    and its effect on the pressure distribution (lift).

    The final mapping is as follows:
    - A (thin, low camber) -> 8 (low lift)
    - B (thin, medium camber) -> 4 (medium lift)
    - C (thin, high camber) -> 6 (high lift for a thin airfoil)
    - D (thin, reflex camber) -> 2 (very low lift, unique Cp shape)
    - E (thick, low-medium camber) -> 7 (medium-high lift)
    - F (thick, medium-high camber) -> 3 (high lift)
    - G (thick, highest camber) -> 5 (highest lift overall)
    - H (thick, symmetric-like) -> 1 (lowest lift for a thick airfoil)
