    "The full name of the artist who created the painting is likely Francisco Pisco, signing as F. Pisco.\n\nBased on an analysis of the signature in the bottom right corner of the watercolor, the name appears to be \"F. Pisco\" and it is dated \"38\", presumably for the year 1938. Research has identified a 19th-century painter by the name of F. Pisco who created landscape paintings. While some records suggest this artist was active in the United States or Germany, the name \"Pisco\" itself has Portuguese and Spanish connections. A search for artists in Portugal has also revealed a contemporary artist named VÃ­tor Pisco.\n\nThe location depicted in the painting is likely in the region of Muxagata, Portugal, an area known for its landscapes and the nearby Ribeira de Piscos. This connection, along with the style of the watercolor landscape, which is consistent with early 20th-century art, and the signature, points towards Francisco Pisco. An auction record for a rural landscape oil painting by an \"F. Pisco\" from the 19th century suggests a history of this artist painting landscape scenes. The signature on the watercolor, \"F. Pisco 38\", suggests he was still active in 1938.\n\n<<<Francisco Pisco>>>"
