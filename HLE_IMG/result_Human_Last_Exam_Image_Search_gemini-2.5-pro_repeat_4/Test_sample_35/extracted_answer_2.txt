Based on the provided information, the S100B protein shows a strong affinity for the V-C1 domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be utilized as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker for neurological disorders. It serves as an adjunct marker due to its lack of specificity for any single disease, requiring it to be used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods. However, because its levels correlate with the severity, progression, and outcome of various neurological conditions by reflecting the degree of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, it is also a powerful prognostic marker.
