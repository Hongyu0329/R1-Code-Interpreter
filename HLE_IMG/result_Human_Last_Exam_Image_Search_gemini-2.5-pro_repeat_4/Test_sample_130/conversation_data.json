    "The element with the spectral lines shown in the image is **Uranium (U)**.\n\nEach element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts like a fingerprint, allowing for its identification. The spectrum in the image displays a large number of emission lines across the visible range, from blue to red. This high complexity is characteristic of heavy elements with many electrons, such as uranium.\n\nUranium, in particular, is known for its very rich and complex emission spectrum, containing thousands of individual lines. This characteristic makes it useful for applications like wavelength calibration in astronomical spectrographs. The visual pattern presented in the image, with its dense collection of lines in the blue, green, and red regions, is widely identified as the visible emission spectrum of uranium. Isotopic shifts can occur in the uranium spectrum, but the overall pattern remains a key identifier.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
