    "The characters on the seal are read from top to bottom, right to left. They are written in an ancient Chinese script known as seal script. The phrase is \"長樂未央\" (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng).\n\nIn simplified Chinese, this is written as **长乐未央**.\n\nThis is a well-known classical phrase which translates to \"eternal happiness without end\" or \"everlasting joy\". It was also the name of the main imperial palace, Weiyang Palace, during the Han Dynasty. Seals bearing these characters are quite common and can be found in various materials.\n\nThe characters are identified as:\n*   **Top Right:** 長 (cháng), which is simplified to **长** (long, eternal).\n*   **Bottom Right:** 樂 (lè), which is simplified to **乐** (joy).\n*   **Top Left:** 未 (wèi), which is the same in simplified Chinese (not, have not).\n*   **Bottom Left:** 央 (yāng), which is the same in simplified Chinese (center, end).\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
