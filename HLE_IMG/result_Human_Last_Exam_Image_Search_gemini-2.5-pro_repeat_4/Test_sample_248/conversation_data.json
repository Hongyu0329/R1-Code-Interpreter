    "The species that definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nThis snail, identifiable by its conical shell with a pointed apex, is native to the northeast Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast around the 19th century and has since become a common, and often dominant, species in the intertidal zone from Labrador, Canada, to Delaware, USA. While there have been sporadic introductions and discoveries of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast, it has not become established there in the way it has in the Atlantic. The presence of a thriving population, as suggested by the multiple individuals in the photo, is a strong indicator of a North Atlantic location.\n\nAdditionally, the barnacles in the image resemble *Semibalanus balanoides*, the common rock barnacle. This species is also primarily found in the North Atlantic and on the Pacific coast of North America, it only reaches as far south as British Columbia. The co-occurrence of *Littorina littorea* and *Semibalanus balanoides* is a classic sign of a North Atlantic rocky intertidal community.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
