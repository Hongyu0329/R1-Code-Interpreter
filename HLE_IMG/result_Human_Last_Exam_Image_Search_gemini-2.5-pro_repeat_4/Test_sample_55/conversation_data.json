    "The chord circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, is a G-sharp diminished triad, functioning as a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor. The V (dominant) chord in D minor is A major.\n*   **Notes:** The circled notes in the bass clef on the second beat of measure 8 are G♯, B, and D. These three notes form a G♯ diminished triad.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** The G♯ is the leading tone to A. Therefore, the G♯ diminished triad (G♯-B-D) functions as the leading-tone chord to the dominant (A major). This type of chord is known as a secondary or applied leading-tone chord because it tonicizes a chord other than the tonic. In this context, it creates a strong pull toward the A major chord that follows in measure 9.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The correct Roman numeral is **vii°/V** (read as \"seven diminished of five\"). This indicates a diminished triad built on the leading tone (the seventh degree) of the dominant key.\n\n<<<vii°/V>>>"
