    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is **Italy**.\n\nThe three historical events, all significant and traumatic in modern Italian history, are:\n\n*   **The Piazza Fontana bombing (red line):** This terrorist attack occurred in Milan on December 12, 1969, killing 17 people and injuring 88. The annual spike in search interest around this date reflects its commemoration. This event is considered by many to be the beginning of the tumultuous period in Italian history known as the \"Years of Lead\".\n\n*   **The Capaci bombing (blue line):** This was a Mafia assassination on May 23, 1992, that killed Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife, and three police escort agents near the town of Capaci in Sicily. The search trends show a consistent peak every year in late May, corresponding to the anniversary of this pivotal event in Italy's fight against the Mafia.\n\n*   **The Bologna massacre (yellow line):** A neo-fascist terrorist bombing at the Bologna Central Railway Station on August 2, 1980, killed 85 people and wounded over 200. It is the most serious terrorist attack in the country's post-war history and the recurring peaks in early August mark its anniversary.\n\nThese three events are deeply embedded in the collective memory of Italy, and their anniversaries prompt a yearly spike in public interest and searches, as clearly depicted in the graph.\n\n<<<Italy>>>"
