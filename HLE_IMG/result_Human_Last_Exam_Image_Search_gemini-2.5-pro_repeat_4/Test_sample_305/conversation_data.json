    "The product advertised with the slogan \"Women are winning the War – of Freedom\" was Tampax. However, the name \"Tampax\" is not derived from French.\n\nAnother prominent advertiser during this period, which does have a French-derived name, was the cosmetics and fragrance company **Bourjois**. This Paris-based company advertised its products, such as \"Evening in Paris\" perfume and powder, to British women throughout the war. These advertisements promoted maintaining femininity and morale, which was considered a component of the war effort on the home front. While not explicitly stated as overcoming \"inherent limitations\" in a physical sense, the appeal to glamour and normalcy was a way to counteract the hardships and anxieties of wartime life.\n\nGiven the specific constraints of the question—a product advertised to women workers in WWII Britain with a French-derived name—Bourjois is the most fitting answer, even if the provided image was used for a different product.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
