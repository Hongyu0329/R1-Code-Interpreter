    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a compound with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume the presence of one nitrogen atom.\n\n### 2. Elemental Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis**: The spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals. The signals from ~126-145 ppm are in the aromatic region, and the signals from ~19-50 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis**: This experiment reveals the types of carbon atoms:\n    *   One negative signal corresponds to one **CH₂** (methylene) group.\n    *   Five positive signals correspond to five **CH** (methine) or **CH₃** (methyl) groups.\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm is absent in the DEPT-135 spectrum, indicating it is a **quaternary carbon** (C).\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT**:\n    *   Aromatic region: 145.1 (C), 128.5 (CH), 127.3 (CH), 126.3 (CH). This pattern (one quaternary C and three CH) is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring, assuming equivalence of the ortho and meta carbons, which would result in 6 total aromatic carbons.\n    *   Aliphatic region: One CH₂, and from the remaining two signals (49.6 and 19.2), one must be a CH and the other a CH₃. The upfield shift of 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group. Therefore, the aliphatic portion consists of one **CH**, one **CH₂**, and one **CH₃** group.\n*   **Molecular Formula Derivation**:\n    *   Based on the carbon types, the molecule contains at least 9 carbons (6 aromatic + 3 aliphatic).\n    *   Let's test the formula C₉H₁₃N:\n        *   Molecular Weight = (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (14.01) ≈ 135.23. This matches the M⁺ peak of 135.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation** for C₉H₁₃N = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 4. A degree of unsaturation of 4 corresponds perfectly to a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. Structure Elucidation from NMR and IR\n*   **Structure Fragments**: Based on the analysis so far, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n    *   A C₃H₈N side chain composed of a CH, a CH₂, a CH₃, and an NH₂ group (to account for the N and remaining 2 hydrogens).\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis**:\n    *   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet)**: This corresponds to the 5 protons of the monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet)**: A doublet signal integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of a CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). This confirms a `-CH(CH₃)-` fragment.\n    *   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet)**: This complex signal likely corresponds to the remaining protons: the CH proton and the two CH₂ protons.\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis**: The spectrum shows characteristic peaks for aromatic C-H stretching (>3000 cm⁻¹), aliphatic C-H stretching (<3000 cm⁻¹), and aromatic C=C stretching (~1450-1600 cm⁻¹). A broad signal around 3300 cm⁻¹ could indicate an N-H stretch from the amine group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure**:\n    1.  We start with the phenyl group: C₆H₅-.\n    2.  We have the side-chain fragments: -CH(CH₃)-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂.\n    3.  Connecting these fragments leads to two primary possibilities for the C₃H₇-NH₂ side chain:\n        *   **Structure A**: 1-Phenylpropan-2-amine (`C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`)\n        *   **Structure B**: 2-Phenylpropan-1-amine (`C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`)\n    4.  The provided ¹³C NMR chemical shifts are: 49.6 (CH), 43.5 (CH₂), and 19.2 (CH₃). In Structure A, the CH₂ group is attached to the phenyl ring, and the CH group is attached to the amine. This arrangement matches the observed chemical shifts well: benzyl CH₂ groups are typically around 40-45 ppm, and CH groups attached to an amine are around 50 ppm. Literature data for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine in DMSO-d6 shows shifts of C-ipso: 140.6, Ar-CH: 129.6-126.3, CH: 48.8, CH₂: 46.8, and CH₃: 23.8 ppm, which is a strong match with the provided data.\n    5.  Therefore, the compound is identified as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n### 4. Final IUPAC Name\nThe longest carbon chain with the principal functional group (amine) is propane. The amine is on carbon 2, and the phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
