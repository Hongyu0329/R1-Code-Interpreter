    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to a **Class I** caries classification according to G.V. Black's system.\n\nThis classification is used for caries affecting the pits and fissures on the occlusal (chewing) surfaces of posterior teeth (molars and premolars). The image clearly shows decay within the grooves and pits on the top surface of a molar.\n\nG.V. Black's classification system, developed over a century ago, categorizes carious lesions based on their location on the tooth. Class I includes decay on the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars, the facial and lingual surfaces of molars, and the lingual surfaces of maxillary incisors. The image also shows what appears to be recurrent or secondary caries, which is decay that forms adjacent to an existing restoration. However, the location of the lesion on the occlusal surface is the primary determinant for its classification as Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
