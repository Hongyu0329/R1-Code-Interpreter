    "The figure leaving the chariot is the sorceress **Medea**.\n\nThis South Italian red-figure vase, dated to around 400 B.C., depicts the dramatic climax of Euripides' tragedy, *Medea*. In an act of terrible revenge against her unfaithful husband Jason, Medea has murdered their two children. The scene captures her escape from Corinth.\n\nKey elements in the image identify the figures and the story:\n*   **Medea:** She is the central figure in the chariot, framed by a halo or nimbus that signifies her divine grandfather, the sun god Helios. It is Helios who provides the magical, flying chariot for her escape. In some depictions, including this one, she wears foreign attire, like a Phrygian helmet or cap, alluding to her origins in Colchis.\n*   **The Chariot:** The chariot is drawn by winged, serpent-like dragons, a clear indicator of its magical and divine nature.\n*   **The Figure on the Ground:** The nude body lying on the ground is one of the two sons she has just slain. His pathetic placement beneath the departing chariot highlights the brutality of the act.\n\nThe vase is attributed to the Policoro Painter, an artist who worked in Southern Italy. The scene is a powerful representation of the play's conclusion, where Medea, having committed horrific acts, evades mortal justice through divine intervention.<<<Medea>>>"
