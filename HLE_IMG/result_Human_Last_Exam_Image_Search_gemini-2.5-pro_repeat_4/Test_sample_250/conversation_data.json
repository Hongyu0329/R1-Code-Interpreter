    "The jazz standard in the image is titled \"What a Difference a Day Makes.\" The music was composed by María Grever in 1934, originally with Spanish lyrics under the title \"Cuando Vuelva a Tu Lado.\" English lyrics were written by Stanley Adams in the same year.\n\nMaría Grever was a Mexican composer who also wrote the original Spanish lyrics to the song. Despite living in the United States for much of her life and achieving significant success, including starting her own music corporation, her contributions to the Great American Songbook are often overlooked. \"Cuando Vuelva a Tu Lado\" translates to \"when I return to your side.\" The song gained significant popularity in the U.S. after Dinah Washington's 1959 recording.\n\n<<<What a Difference a Day Makes by María Grever>>>"
