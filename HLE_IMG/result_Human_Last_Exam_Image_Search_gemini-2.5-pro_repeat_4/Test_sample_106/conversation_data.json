    "This reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of the starting material, friedelinol, which initiates a cascade of shifts known as a backbone rearrangement, ultimately forming the product, multiflorene. To determine the substituents at the numbered positions in the product, we must trace how the original methyl groups (CH3) and hydrogens (H) on the molecular backbone rearrange.\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The reaction starts when the alcohol group (-OH) is protonated by the acid (HCl) and leaves as a water molecule (H₂O), creating a carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Rearrangement Cascade:** A series of shifts of neighboring hydride ions (H⁻) and methyl groups (CH₃⁻) occurs to move the positive charge across the molecule and form a more stable structure. This specific transformation from the friedelane skeleton to the multiflorene skeleton follows a well-established pathway.\n3.  **Determining the Substituents:** By tracking the migrating groups, we can identify what is left at each position.\n    *   **Position 1:** This position on the A/B ring junction (C-4 in standard nomenclature) originally has two methyl groups. In this rearrangement, these methyls do not migrate. Therefore, the substituent at position 1 remains a methyl group. **1 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2:** This position (C-10) originally has a methyl group. During the rearrangement, a hydrogen atom from the adjacent position (C-9, which becomes position 3) migrates to position 2. Therefore, the substituent at position 2 in the product is a hydrogen. **2 = H**.\n    *   **Position 3:** This position (C-9) originally has a hydrogen atom, which migrates to position 2. A methyl group from the adjacent position (C-8, which becomes position 4) then migrates to position 3. Therefore, the substituent at position 3 is a methyl group. **3 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 4:** This position (C-8) originally has a methyl group, which migrates to position 3. A hydrogen atom from the adjacent position (C-14, which becomes position 5) migrates to position 4. Therefore, the substituent at position 4 is a hydrogen. **4 = H**.\n    *   **Position 5:** This position (C-14) originally has a hydrogen atom, which migrates to position 4. A methyl group from the neighboring C-13 then migrates to position 5. Therefore, the substituent at position 5 is a methyl group. **5 = CH3**.\n\nBased on the mechanism of the backbone rearrangement:\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
