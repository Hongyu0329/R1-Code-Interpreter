    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry\n\nThe image shows a large circular sector from which two triangular regions are removed, leaving the shaded areas. Our approach will be to calculate the area of the entire large sector and then subtract the areas of the two unshaded triangles.\n\n### 2. Determining the Angle of the Sector\n\nLet's analyze the blue region's construction first. We can see a right-angled triangle formed by:\n*   The center of the circle (let's call it O).\n*   A vertex on the arc (let's call it V).\n*   A point on the leftmost radius (let's call it P), such that the line segment PV is perpendicular to the radius OP.\n\nIn this right-angled triangle OPV:\n*   The hypotenuse is the radius of the circle, OV = 34.\n*   One leg is the vertical line segment, PV = 17.\n*   The angle at the center, ∠POV, is labeled as 2θ.\n\nWe can find the sine of this angle:\nsin(2θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 17 / 34 = 1/2\n\nFrom this, we can determine the angle:\n2θ = arcsin(1/2) = 30°\nθ = 15°\n\nThe total angle of the large circular sector is indicated to be 4θ.\nTotal Angle = 4θ = 4 * 15° = 60°\n\n### 3. Calculating the Area of the Full Sector\n\nThe area of a circular sector is given by the formula `(Angle / 360°) * π * r²`.\n*   Angle = 60°\n*   Radius (r) = 34\n\nArea_sector = (60 / 360) * π * 34²\nArea_sector = (1 / 6) * π * 1156\nArea_sector = 578π / 3\n\n### 4. Calculating the Area of the Unshaded Triangles\n\nThere are two unshaded right-angled triangles that are identical in size due to symmetry. Let's calculate the area of one of them. We already know:\n*   Hypotenuse = 34\n*   One leg = 17\n\nWe need to find the length of the other leg (OP) using the Pythagorean theorem:\nOP² + 17² = 34²\nOP² = 34² - 17²\nOP² = 1156 - 289 = 867\nOP = √867 = √(289 * 3) = 17√3\n\nThe area of one triangle is `(1/2) * base * height`:\nArea_triangle = (1 / 2) * (17√3) * 17\nArea_triangle = 289√3 / 2\n\nSince there are two identical unshaded triangles, their total area is:\nTotal_Area_unshaded = 2 * (289√3 / 2) = 289√3\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Shaded Area\n\nThe total shaded area is the area of the full sector minus the total area of the two unshaded triangles.\n\nTotal_Shaded_Area = Area_sector - Total_Area_unshaded\nTotal_Shaded_Area = 578π / 3 - 289√3\n\nThe note about the overlapping area suggests that the blue and red regions could be defined in a way that they intersect. However, even under interpretations that include an overlap (for example, by defining the blue and red regions based on overlapping sectors), the final area of the union of the shaded regions remains the same. The simplest and most direct method is to subtract the clearly unshaded areas from the total sector.\n\nThe final expression for the total shaded area is:\n**578π/3 - 289√3**\n\nThis can also be factored as **289 * (2π/3 - √3)**.\n\n<<<578*pi/3 - 289*sqrt(3)>>>"
