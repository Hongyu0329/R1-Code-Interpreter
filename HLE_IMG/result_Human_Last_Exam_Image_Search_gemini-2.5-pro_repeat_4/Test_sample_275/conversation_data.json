    "Based on the analysis of the provided RT-PCR results, here are the identified splice species:\n\nThe different splice species are identified by the unique bands produced in the various PCR reactions shown in panels B through I. Each unique band or set of correlated bands across different experiments represents a distinct spliced mRNA transcript.\n\n1.  **Species from Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This reaction reveals the most diversity for transcripts starting in the E1 region and ending in the L1 region. Four distinct bands are visible, representing four separate splice species:\n    *   **Species 1:** Produces the 450 bp band (band 1). This species is also detected in Panel H (band 1), Panel C (band 1, 584 bp), and Panel B (band 1, 190 bp).\n    *   **Species 2:** Produces the 419 bp band (band 2). This species is also detected in Panel H (band 2), Panel C (band 2, 553 bp), and Panel B (band 2, 159 bp). The 31 bp size difference between this and Species 1 indicates a small alternative splicing event.\n    *   **Species 3:** Produces the 378 bp band (band 3).\n    *   **Species 4:** Produces the 187 bp band (band 4).\n\n2.  **Species from Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This reaction uses the same forward primer as panel I but a different reverse primer (L2R instead of L1R).\n    *   **Species 5:** Produces a single prominent band of 1,005 bp. Since this transcript contains the L2 region but is amplified with the E1F1 primer, it represents a splicing pattern distinct from the four identified in panel I.\n\n3.  **Species from Panels D (E1F2/E5R) and F (E1F2/L2R):** These reactions use the E1F2 primer, which specifically detects transcripts containing the 929^3465 splice junction.\n    *   **Species 6:** A single transcript is detected, yielding a 551 bp product in panel D and a consistent 972 bp product in panel F. This confirms one unique splice species defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n\n4.  **Species from Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This reaction uses the E1F3 primer, which detects transcripts containing the 929^3506 splice junction. Two distinct bands indicate two different species sharing this specific splice.\n    *   **Species 7:** Produces the 1,003 bp band (band 1).\n    *   **Species 8:** Produces the 931 bp band (band 2). The 72 bp difference between them points to an additional downstream alternative splicing event.\n\nIn summary, by systematically analyzing the unique products from each primer combination, a total of 8 distinct splice species can be identified from the provided image.\n\n<<<8>>>"
