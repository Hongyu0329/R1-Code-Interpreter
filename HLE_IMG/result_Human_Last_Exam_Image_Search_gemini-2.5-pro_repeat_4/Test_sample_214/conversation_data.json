    "The artwork and poem in question, \"The Other Clouds,\" is an erasure poem by the American poet Mary Ruefle, featured in her 2006 book, *A Little White Shadow*. An erasure poem is created by taking an existing text and obscuring the majority of it to form a new work from the remaining words.\n\nIn an interview, Mary Ruefle described her erasure process as a \"form\" of poetry with a specific constraint: she can only use the words available on a given page of the source text. While she typically writes in free verse, she considers the restriction of erasure to be a compelling form, one she can't resist. She has referred to this process as \"writing with my eyes instead of my hands.\"\n\nCritics and reviewers have often described the resulting short, fragmented poems in *A Little White Shadow* as being similar to other concise poetic forms. They have been compared to \"haiku-like mini-fables\" and \"hauntingly perplexing koans\". The style is also seen as creating sideways aphorisms from the original 19th-century source text written by Emily Malbone Morgan.\n\nTherefore, the text adheres to the poetic form of **erasure**, which in this collection results in poems that are stylistically similar to haikus or koans due to their brevity and evocative nature.\n\n<<<erasure>>>"
