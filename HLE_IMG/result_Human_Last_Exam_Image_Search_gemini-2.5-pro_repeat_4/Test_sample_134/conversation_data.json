    "The molecule shown is Cyclocarbon, an allotrope of carbon with the molecular formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds. This structure makes it a polyyne and a cyclocarbon.\n\nFirst synthesized in 2019 by researchers from IBM and the University of Oxford, cyclocarbon was created on a sodium chloride surface at a temperature of 5 Kelvin. Its structure was confirmed using high-resolution atomic force microscopy, which revealed the alternating bond pattern rather than a cumulene structure with consecutive double bonds.\n\nCyclocarbon is the smallest stable cyclocarbon and is noted for its high reactivity. Scientists are exploring its potential for creating other carbon allotropes and for applications in molecular electronics.\n\n<<<Cyclocarbon>>>"
