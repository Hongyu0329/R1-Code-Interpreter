    "The reaction of tris(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion with 0.1 M HCl under reflux for 12 hours results in the formation of compound A, which is **2,7,12-trimethoxy-4,8,12,12c-tetrahydrodibenzo[cd,mn]pyrene**.\n\nThis transformation is an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The starting material is a stable carbocation. Under the influence of acid and heat, the oxygen atom of each of the three *ortho*-methoxy groups (at the C2 position of the phenyl rings) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the central carbocation. This is followed by the elimination of the methyl group from each of these methoxy groups. This sequential process results in the formation of three new five-membered rings, creating a rigid, C3-symmetric, cage-like molecule. The methoxy groups at the C3 position of the original phenyl rings remain intact in the final product.\n\nThis type of molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as trioxatricornans. The reaction is a type of cyclodealkylation. While harsher conditions like polyphosphoric acid are sometimes used for this transformation, refluxing in aqueous HCl for an extended period can also achieve the same result.\n\nThe structure of compound A is shown below:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iU6g2bF.png\" alt=\"Chemical structure of 2,7,12-trimethoxy-4,8,12,12c-tetrahydrodibenzo[cd,mn]pyrene\">\n\n<<<2,7,12-trimethoxy-4,8,12,12c-tetrahydrodibenzo[cd,mn]pyrene>>>"
