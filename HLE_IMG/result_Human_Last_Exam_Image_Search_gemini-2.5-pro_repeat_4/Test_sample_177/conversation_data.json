    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to determine the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\nThe total Car VMT is the sum of the VMT for each trip distance category. The VMT for each category is calculated by multiplying the share of total trips for that distance, the share of car trips within that distance category, and the average trip distance.\n\n**1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT (VMT_B)**\n\nFirst, for each distance category in Table 1, we sum the mode shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" to get the total car mode share.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category by multiplying the share of total trips, the total car mode share, and the average trip distance. We can assume a total of 'N' trips for this calculation.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544 * N\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128 * N\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925 * N\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480 * N\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT (VMT_B):**\nVMT_B = (0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480) * N = 4.7077 * N\n\n**2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT (VMT_P)**\n\nWe repeat the same process for Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNow, calculate the weighted VMT for the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144 * N\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376 * N\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305 * N\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680 * N\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT (VMT_P):**\nVMT_P = (0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680) * N = 2.2505 * N\n\n**3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe percentage reduction is calculated using the formula: ((VMT_B - VMT_P) / VMT_B) * 100.\n\n*   **Reduction:** ((4.7077 * N - 2.2505 * N) / (4.7077 * N)) * 100\n*   **Reduction:** ((4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077) * 100\n*   **Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100\n*   **Reduction:** 52.195%\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
