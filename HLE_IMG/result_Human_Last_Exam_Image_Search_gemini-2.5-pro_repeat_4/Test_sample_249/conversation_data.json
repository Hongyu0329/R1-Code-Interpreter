    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. Based on its distinctive honeycomb-like pattern, it is a **Pineapplefish**.\n\nThe scientific name for this fish is ***Cleidopus gloriamaris***.\n\nThis fish is also known as the knightfish or the coat-of-mail fish because of the armor-like scales covering its body. Its name \"gloriamaris\" is Latin for \"glory of the sea\". The scales are yellow to whitish with black rear margins, which creates the striking pineapple-like pattern. Pineapplefish are found in the waters off of Australia and are known to be nocturnal, sheltering in caves and under ledges during the day. They possess bioluminescent organs on their lower jaw that glow, which are thought to help them attract prey at night.\n\n<<<Cleidopus gloriamaris>>>"
