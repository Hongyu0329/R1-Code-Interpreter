    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens and information from geological resources, here is the identification of each rock:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Its color is due to the oxidation of iron. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is ejected from a volcano.\n\n*   **I: Breccia** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture indicates that the broken pieces were not transported far from their source before being cemented into rock. Breccia can be sedimentary or volcanic in origin.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This specimen is a light-colored, fine-grained volcanic rock with a very high number of small vesicles, giving it a frothy appearance. Pumice is formed from gas-rich lava that cools rapidly. Due to its high porosity, it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This is a coarse-grained igneous rock with exceptionally large, interlocking crystals. Pegmatite forms from magma that cools very slowly, allowing large crystals to grow. The visible crystals appear to be a mix of light-colored minerals like feldspar and quartz, and darker minerals.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
