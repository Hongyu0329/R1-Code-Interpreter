    "This picture was taken in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nThe image shows the interior of the Hasso Plattner School of Design Thinking Afrika (d-school Afrika), located on the Middle Campus of the University of Cape Town. The building, designed by KMH Architects, was inaugurated in October 2022.\n\nA defining feature of the building, and the one clearly visible in the photograph, is its unique atrium. It is enclosed by a 75-meter-long, glass-clad steel gridshell structure. The glass itself is fritted, or fitted with opaque dots, to reduce glare and solar heat, creating the distinct pattern of light and shadow seen in the image. This innovative design has earned the building prestigious awards for its technical excellence.\n\n<<<Cape Town>>>"
