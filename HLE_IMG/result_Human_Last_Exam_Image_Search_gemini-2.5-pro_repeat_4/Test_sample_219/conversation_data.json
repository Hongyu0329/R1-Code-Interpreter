    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph:\n\n1.  **Identification of Synchronized Bursts:** The graph shows five distinct synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of high firing activity across numerous electrodes.\n\n2.  **Timestamps of Bursts:** The approximate time of the center of each burst is estimated as:\n    *   Burst 1: 3 s\n    *   Burst 2: 16 s\n    *   Burst 3: 27 s\n    *   Burst 4: 37 s\n    *   Burst 5: 49 s\n\n3.  **Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):** The time difference between each consecutive burst is calculated:\n    *   IBI₁ = 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n    *   IBI₂ = 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI₃ = 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI₄ = 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\n4.  **Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval:** The average of these intervals is:\n    (13 + 11 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\n5.  **Rounding to Two Significant Figures:** Rounding the result to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 16 s, 27 s, 37 s, and 49 s. The average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n<<<12>>>"
