    "The bryophyte depicted in the image, characterized by its distinctly braided, feather-like appearance, belongs to the genus *Ptilium*.\n\nThis moss is easily identified by its large, light green shoots that are regularly and pinnately branched, resembling a small feather or plume. The leaves are strongly curved to one side, a feature known as being falcate-secund, which gives the branches their neat, combed, or braided look.\n\nA very common and representative species of this genus is *Ptilium crista-castrensis*, often called knight's plume moss or ostrich-plume feather-moss. This species is frequently found on the forest floor in boreal and northern forests. While some species of the genus *Hypnum* also have falcate-secund leaves, the highly regular, feather-like branching of *Ptilium* is a key distinguishing feature.\n\n<<<*Ptilium*>>>"
