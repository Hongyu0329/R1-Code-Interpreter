    "The protein shown in the image is **Parkin**.\n\nThis image displays the crystal structure of the full-length rat Parkin protein. It is specifically identified by the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry **4K95**.\n\nKey features of the Parkin protein visible in this structure include:\n*   **A multi-domain structure:** Parkin is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, which is shown in light blue. The larger portion of the protein, shown in dark blue, contains a series of RING-like domains (RING0, RING1, IBR, and RING2).\n*   **Autoinhibited state:** This particular structure captures Parkin in an autoinhibited, or inactive, state. In this conformation, the catalytic site, which includes the residue Cysteine 431 (Cys431), is blocked.\n*   **Function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase:** Parkin plays a crucial role in the cellular process of tagging other proteins with ubiquitin, which often marks them for degradation. This function is vital for cellular quality control, particularly in maintaining the health of mitochondria.\n*   **Relevance to Parkinson's disease:** Mutations in the gene that codes for Parkin (the *PARK2* gene) are a major cause of the autosomal recessive juvenile form of Parkinson's disease. The protein's role in protecting neurons is a significant area of research.\n\nThe image from PDB entry 4K95 is widely used in scientific literature and databases to represent the overall fold and domain arrangement of the Parkin protein.\n\n<<<Parkin>>>"
