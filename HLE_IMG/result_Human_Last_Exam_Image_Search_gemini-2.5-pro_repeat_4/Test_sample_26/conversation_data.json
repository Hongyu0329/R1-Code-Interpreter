    "The chord in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata is best understood in its harmonic context. The sonata is in C minor, and this section functions as a transition.\n\nTo determine the Roman numeral, let's analyze the notes present in measure 30:\n*   **Left Hand:** Plays broken chords outlining G and B natural, then D and F sharp.\n*   **Right Hand:** Plays the notes G, B natural, D, and F sharp together.\n\nThese notes (G-B♮-D-F♯) form a G major 7th chord (Gmaj7). In the key of C minor, the G major triad (G-B♮-D) is the dominant chord, which is represented by the Roman numeral V.\n\nThe F sharp is a non-diatonic tone (it is not in the key of C minor). This specific chord, a major 7th built on the dominant, is sometimes referred to as Vmaj7. Some harmonic analyses consider the F-sharp to be an augmented 6th, which is a type of chromatic alteration that creates tension and leads to the following chord. The chord resolves to a C minor chord (i) in the next measure. The entire passage from measures 27 to 34 consists of broken chords based on the dominant (V) of C minor, creating anticipation for the arrival of a new thematic area.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral is **Vmaj7**.\n\n<<<Vmaj7>>>"
