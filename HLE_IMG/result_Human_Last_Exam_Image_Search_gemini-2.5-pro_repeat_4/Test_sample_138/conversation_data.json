    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n*   **Individual A (Left):** This bee has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen. In the genus *Coelioxys*, this is characteristic of a female, who uses this specialized abdomen to pierce the nests of other bees to lay her eggs.\n*   **Individual A (Right):** This bee has a blunter abdomen that ends in multiple spines or prongs. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M).\n\n**Pair B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n*   **Individual B (Left):** This wasp has distinctly curled or hooked tips on its antennae. This is a key feature used to identify male paper wasps.\n*   **Individual B (Right):** This wasp has straight antennae without curled tips. Additionally, its face appears to have more extensive black markings compared to the yellower faces often seen in males.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F).\n\n**Pair C: *Melissodes* (Long-horned Bees)**\n*   **Individual C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, a defining characteristic of male long-horned bees. Many male *Melissodes* also have a yellow or pale patch on their face (clypeus), which is visible in the image.\n*   **Individual C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae compared to the individual on the left. Females of this genus have shorter antennae and are typically more robust with densely-haired hind legs for collecting pollen.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F).\n\nMatching these conclusions to the provided options:\n*   A: F, M corresponds to option **4**.\n*   B: M, F corresponds to option **3**.\n*   C: M, F corresponds to option **3**.\n\n4, 3, 3<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
