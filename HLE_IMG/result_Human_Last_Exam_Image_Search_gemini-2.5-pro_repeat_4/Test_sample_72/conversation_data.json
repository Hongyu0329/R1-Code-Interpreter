    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions: a 4π electrocyclization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nThe first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This type of reaction, which involves the formation of a sigma bond and the conversion of a conjugated π-system into a cyclic one, is known as an electrocyclic reaction. Specifically, it is a 4π-electron electrocyclization. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions, a 4π electrocyclization is photochemically allowed.\n\nThe second step is the reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. This is a cycloaddition reaction, where two molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct. In this case, a double bond from the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring. This is classified as a [2+2] cycloaddition. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed pericyclic reactions and are a common method for synthesizing strained four-membered rings.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  **Electrocyclic reaction** (photochemical 4π electrocyclization)\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition**\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
