    "Based on the principles of organometallic chemistry and the provided search results, the stability and, consequently, the lifetime of these iridium complexes in LECs are strongly influenced by the fluorination of the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n\n### Analysis of Complex Structures:\n*   **Complex 1:** Features two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands. It is the most heavily fluorinated complex, with a total of four fluorine atoms on the C^N ligands.\n*   **Complex 2:** Is a heteroleptic complex with one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (two fluorine atoms) and one non-fluorinated 2-phenylpyridine ligand.\n*   **Complex 3:** Contains two 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligands, with a total of two fluorine atoms, one on each ligand.\n*   **Complex 4:** Has two non-fluorinated 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. This complex is commonly known as [Ir(ppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺.\n\n### Stability and Lifetime Considerations:\n\n1.  **Ir-C Bond Strength:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Its presence on the phenyl ring strengthens the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of the cyclometalating ligand. A stronger bond is more resistant to cleavage, which is a known degradation pathway in these complexes.\n2.  **Oxidative Stability:** Fluorination lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), making the complex more resistant to oxidation. Oxidative degradation is a major cause of failure in LEC devices.\n3.  **Degradation via De-fluorination:** While fluorination can enhance bond strength and oxidative stability, it also introduces a potential degradation pathway. Under the harsh operating conditions of an LEC (high electric fields, presence of mobile ions), the C-F bonds themselves can break in a process called de-fluorination, leading to device failure.\n4.  **Experimental Evidence:**\n    *   Historically and in several studies, it was observed that increasing the fluorine content in a series of cationic iridium(III) complexes *decreases* the stability and lifetime of the corresponding LECs. One study noted a lifetime reduction from 370 hours (for a reference complex) to about 60 hours for a complex with two fluorine atoms, and down to 3.3 hours for one with four fluorine atoms. This negative correlation suggests that degradation pathways involving the C-F bond, such as de-fluorination, can be dominant.\n    *   Complexes without fluorination on the cyclometalating ligands, like Complex 4 ([Ir(ppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺), can also suffer from degradation, potentially through the loss of the ancillary (dtbbpy) ligand, especially under thermal stress induced by device operation.\n    *   However, the view that fluorination is always detrimental to lifetime has been challenged by more recent studies. Optimized device structures and specific fluorination patterns have led to highly stable LECs. Despite this, a general trend observed in some systematic studies points to shorter lifetimes with increased fluorination.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the evidence that increased fluorine content can lead to decreased stability in green-emitting LECs due to pathways like de-fluorination, the most heavily fluorinated complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n*   **Complex 1** has the highest fluorine content (four F atoms).\n*   **Complex 2** and **Complex 3** have intermediate fluorine content (two F atoms each).\n*   **Complex 4** has no fluorine atoms on the C^N ligands.\n\nThe trend of decreasing lifetime with increasing fluorine content, as reported in the literature, would suggest that Complex 1 is the most susceptible to degradation, followed by Complexes 2 and 3. Complex 4, being fluorine-free, avoids the C-F bond-related degradation pathways. Therefore, the complexes containing fluorine are more likely to exhibit shorter lifetimes under certain operating conditions compared to their non-fluorinated counterpart, due to the possibility of de-fluorination. The question asks which of them are *expected* to show shorter lifetimes, and based on significant literature, the fluorinated ones are prime candidates for this vulnerability. Specifically, the high fluorine content in Complex 1 makes it particularly susceptible. Complex 2, being heteroleptic with one non-fluorinated and one di-fluorinated ligand, presents a mix of stability features. The non-fluorinated ligand is a potential weak point for oxidation, while the fluorinated one is at risk of de-fluorination. Complex 3 has two mono-fluorinated ligands.\n\nGiven the reports of significantly reduced lifetimes with increasing fluorine content, Complex 1 (four F atoms) and Complex 3 (two F atoms) are expected to be less stable than the non-fluorinated Complex 4. Complex 2 also contains fluorine and a potentially less stable non-fluorinated ligand. Therefore, the fluorinated complexes,, and are the most likely candidates for shorter lifetimes compared to the potentially more stable non-fluorinated variant under certain degradation models, although Complex 4 is not immune to its own degradation pathways. However, the most direct evidence points to a strong negative correlation between fluorine content and lifetime. This makes the fluorinated complexes the most probable answer.\n\nConsidering the choices, the group of fluorinated complexes is the most logical selection based on the cited degradation mechanism.\n\n<<<K>>>"
