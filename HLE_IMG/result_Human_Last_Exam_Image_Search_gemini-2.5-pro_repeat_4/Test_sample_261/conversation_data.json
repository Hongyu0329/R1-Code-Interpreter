    "The book that features the presented fragment on its cover is **\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\"** the first book in the immensely popular series by J.K. Rowling. The specific illustration is from the original American edition, with cover art created by Mary GrandPré.\n\nThe image fragment displays a unicorn that is situated on the left side of the full wrap-around dust jacket of the U.S. version of the book. While the front cover primarily depicts Harry Potter in front of the Hogwarts Express, the complete artwork reveals other magical elements in the background, including the unicorn. This edition was first published by Scholastic in 1998 and is the American counterpart to the original U.K. edition titled \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" which features different cover art by Thomas Taylor.\n\nThe artwork by Mary GrandPré became iconic for American readers and was used for all seven books in the U.S. series. The inclusion of the unicorn on the cover hints at the magical creatures and perilous adventures that Harry encounters within the story, including a significant scene in the Forbidden Forest involving a unicorn.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
