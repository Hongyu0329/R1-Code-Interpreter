    "The image and description point to a phenomenon known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as the pure tone shown in your image, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like white noise. If the interrupting noise is loud enough to have masked the original sound, the human brain perceives the original sound as continuing uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise. The spectrogram in the top part of your image illustrates the physical reality: the horizontal blue line representing the tone is physically absent during the vertical blur of noise. However, the perceptual experience is one of continuity.\n\nThis reveals a common and useful perceptual ability: our brains \"fill in\" missing sensory information, which helps in understanding sounds in noisy environments. A well-known example of this is the **phonemic restoration effect**, where a missing speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence is replaced by a noise like a cough, yet listeners perceive the word and sentence as intact.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of multistable, or bistable, perception. In both the visual Necker Cube and the auditory continuity illusion, the brain resolves ambiguous or incomplete sensory input to create a stable, coherent perception.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
