    "Yes, the animal in the image is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle. Based on its appearance—a black body with a prominent reddish-orange band across the upper part of its wing cases and long, segmented antennae—it is identifiable as a flower longhorn beetle.\n\nTwo closely related species with this appearance are *Stenurella melanura* and *Stictoleptura rubra*. However, the beetle in the image most closely resembles the female *Stenurella melanura*. This species is characterized by its narrow body, black head and pronotum, and reddish elytra that may have a black tip and a black line along the suture where the wing cases meet. They are commonly found on flowers from late spring to summer.\n\nThe scientific name for this animal is *Stenurella melanura*.\n\n<<<Stenurella melanura>>>"
