    "The words in the erasure poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nTo determine the metric pattern, let's first count the syllables in this line:\n*   rules (1)\n*   and (1)\n*   lines (1)\n*   an (1)\n*   in-tri-cate (3)\n*   spi-der's (2)\n*   web (1)\n*   work (1)\n\nThe total number of syllables is 11. This immediately makes several of the options unlikely, such as iambic pentameter (10 syllables), alexandrine (12 syllables), loose iambic trimeter (~6 syllables), and the American sentence (17 syllables). This leaves free verse and sapphic as possibilities.\n\nThe Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines followed by a 5-syllable line. The 11-syllable line, known as a Sapphic hendecasyllable, follows a specific stress pattern:\n**stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the words of the poem:\n\n| **rules** (S) | **and** (U) | **lines,** (S) | **an** (U) | **in**- (S) | -tri-cate (U-U) | **spi**- (S) | -der's (U) | **web** (S) | **work** (U/S) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee/Spondee |\n\nThe line \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\" fits this 11-syllable pattern perfectly. The final foot can be a trochee (Stressed-unstressed) or a spondee (Stressed-Stressed), both of which are acceptable variations.\n\nFurthermore, a discussion by the apparent artist of this specific erasure poem confirms that it is part of a \"found sapphic\" taken from the book *The Modern Palmist*. The full stanza is provided, confirming the structure.\n\nTherefore, the words follow a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
