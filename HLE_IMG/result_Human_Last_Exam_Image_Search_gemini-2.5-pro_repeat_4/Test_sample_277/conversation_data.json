    "The image provided is completely black, so the molecules in question are not visible. To determine the relationship between them (conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers), I need to be able to see their structures.\n\nPlease provide the image of the molecules, and I will help you identify the correct type of isomers."
