    "Based on the analysis of the sheet music and the search results, the piece is a piano arrangement of \"Unravel,\" the opening theme from the anime *Tokyo Ghoul*. The original song is by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure. The specific arrangement appears to be the one by Animenz, a well-known pianist and arranger of anime music on piano. This is indicated by the complexity and style of the piano writing, including the running sixteenth-note passages and the overall virtuosic feel, which are characteristic of Animenz's arrangements.\n\n<<<Unravel - Tokyo Ghoul>>>"
