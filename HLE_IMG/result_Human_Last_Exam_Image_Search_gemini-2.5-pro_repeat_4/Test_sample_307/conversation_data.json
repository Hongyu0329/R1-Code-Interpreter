    "The previous searches provided general information but did not pinpoint the exact source of the image, which is necessary for a precise calculation. The visual estimation remains the most viable path, but it is inherently imprecise. The core of the problem seems to be identifying the parameters of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\nLet's try one more targeted search. I'll search for a specific paper that might contain these plots. The paper \"Classical and quantum evaluation of the Wigner 3j symbol\" by J. Augspurger and J. D. Bekenstein sounds promising as it likely involves visualizations. Another potential source is the work by Rasch and Yu (2003) on efficient computation, which might include figures for performance demonstration.\n\nLet's also search for the image on Figshare, a repository for figures and data.\n\nAfter multiple attempts, I have been unable to locate the original source of the image, which would contain the precise parameters `(j1, j2, j3, m1, m2, m3)` for each of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols. Without these parameters, a numerical calculation of the infinity-norms is impossible.\n\nHowever, the problem is likely intended to be solved by visual inspection, as the differences in color intensity and distribution are quite apparent. The infinity-norm of a matrix is the maximum absolute row sum (`max_i Σ_j |a_ij|`). In the provided visualizations, the absolute value `|a_ij|` of a matrix element corresponds to the intensity of its color (either red or green), with white representing zero.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Maximum Infinity-Norm:**\n    To find the matrix with the maximum infinity-norm, we must look for the plot that has the \"brightest\" row overall. This means finding the plot where a single horizontal row contains the most intense combination of red and green squares.\n    *   **Plot 3** stands out in this regard. Its central horizontal rows contain several squares of deep, saturated red and green. This high concentration of intense colors in a single row suggests that the sum of the absolute values of its elements is the largest among all nine plots.\n    *   Plot 9 also displays bright colors, but they appear slightly less saturated than in plot 3. Other plots are either paler overall or have their intense colors more spread out.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Minimum Infinity-Norm:**\n    To find the matrix with the minimum infinity-norm, we look for the plot that is the most \"washed-out\" or pale. This indicates that the magnitudes of all its elements are small, and therefore the sum along any row will also be small.\n    *   **Plot 6** is the palest of the nine. All its squares are light shades of red and green, indicating small element magnitudes. Compared to the others, it has the lowest overall color intensity. Therefore, its maximum absolute row sum is visually the smallest.\n\n**Conclusion from Visual Inspection:**\n\nBased on a careful visual analysis, plot 3 corresponds to the Wigner 3-j symbol with the maximum infinity-norm, and plot 6 corresponds to the one with the minimum infinity-norm.\n\nThe problem asks for a numerical ratio, which cannot be determined from the image alone. There might be a trick or a hidden clue I am missing. Let's reconsider the possibility of a well-known result or a standard example.\n\nIf we assume the plots correspond to a specific, common set of parameters, we might be able to find it. A common visualization is for `(j, j, j; m1, m2, -m1-m2)`.\n\nLet's assume there is a known, exact answer and the visual analysis is just a guide. It's possible the ratio is a simple integer or a fraction that can be deduced from the properties of these symbols. The Regge symmetries introduce a factor of `(-1)^J`. The infinity norm is insensitive to this sign.\n\nLet's assume the problem is from a specific context or competition where the source is known. Without that context, a precise numerical answer is out of reach.\n\nHowever, if forced to provide a quantitative answer based on a likely source, I would need to find that source. Let's try one final, very specific search, assuming the image comes from the paper by Rasch and Yu, which is a key reference in the field for computation and visualization. A reverse image search on this specific image would be the most direct path. Since I cannot do that, I have to rely on textual searches which have been exhausted.\n\nLet's step back. The question is precise. This implies a precise answer exists. The visual information is clear in its ordering (plot 3 > all others > plot 6). The ratio must come from the actual values. Without finding the source, any numerical answer is a guess.\n\nLet's assume the question is flawed and only a qualitative answer is possible. The ratio of the max norm (plot 3) to the min norm (plot 6) is visually significant, certainly greater than 2, maybe in the 5-10 range, but this is pure speculation.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot provide a confident numerical answer. I will state what can be deduced.\n\n**Final attempt:** Maybe there is information in the image file itself? Filename? Metadata? I cannot access this. The numbered squares suggest a figure from a paper.\n\nLet's assume this is a trick question and the ratio is related to some fundamental property. For example, maybe the ratio of the largest possible 3j symbol value to the smallest non-zero one for a given `j`. This seems too complex.\n\nThe most plausible scenario is that this image is from a source that provides the parameters, and I have failed to find it.\n\nLet's assume that I have found the source and it is \"Figure 4 from 'Semiclassical approximations to 3j- and 6j-coefficients for quantum-mechanical coupling of angular momenta' by Schulten and Gordon (1975)\". I will now search for this paper to see if it contains the image and the required data.\n\nDespite extensive searches for the origin of the provided image, including specific scientific papers known for visualizing Wigner symbols, the exact source and the parameters for the nine plots could not be located. Without this information, a precise numerical calculation of the infinity-norm for each symbol is impossible.\n\nHowever, the problem is structured in a way that strongly suggests a solution based on visual analysis. The infinity-norm of a matrix corresponds to the maximum absolute row sum. In the color-coded plots, this translates to finding the horizontal row with the highest total color intensity (where intensity is the deviation from white, be it red or green).\n\n*   **Maximum Infinity-Norm**: A visual inspection of the nine plots reveals that plot **③** contains the most intense colors. Specifically, its central horizontal rows feature multiple squares of deep, saturated red and green, more so than any other plot. This concentration of high-magnitude values in a single row indicates that it possesses the highest infinity-norm among the nine symbols.\n\n*   **Minimum Infinity-Norm**: Conversely, plot **⑥** is noticeably the palest and most \"washed-out\" of the set. The colors are faint shades of red and green, signifying that the magnitudes of its elements are uniformly small. Consequently, any row sum will be comparatively low, leading to the conclusion that it has the minimum infinity-norm.\n\nSince the specific numerical values of the Wigner 3-j symbols are not available, it is impossible to calculate the exact numerical ratio. The question requires a precise value which cannot be delivered without the original data. If this problem were from a specific context (like a competition or textbook), the parameters would likely be provided. Based purely on the visual information, only a qualitative assessment is possible.\n\nTherefore, without the necessary data for a quantitative answer, I cannot fulfill the request for a numerical ratio.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer based on the information given.>>>"
