    "To determine the longest R-R interval on the provided ECG rhythm strip, we need to analyze the grid and the specified paper speed.\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed**: The speed is noted in the top-left corner as 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Grid Calibration**: On a standard ECG grid, one large square is 5 mm wide.\n3.  **Time Calculation**: With a paper speed of 25 mm/sec, the time represented by one large square is calculated as:\n    Time = Distance / Speed = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n4.  **Identifying the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, the most significant pause between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes) is found on the fourth line of the tracing.\n5.  **Measurement**: This specific long interval begins on a heavy vertical grid line and ends on another heavy vertical grid line. Counting the number of large squares between these two R-waves reveals there are exactly 8 large squares.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: To find the duration of this interval in seconds, we multiply the number of large squares by the time per square:\n    Longest R-R Interval = 8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
