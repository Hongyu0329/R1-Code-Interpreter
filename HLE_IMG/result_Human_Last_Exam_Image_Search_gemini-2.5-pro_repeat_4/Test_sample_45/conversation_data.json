    "The tiling in the image has **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n### Analysis of the Tiling\n\nThis intricate pattern is a type of plane tessellation known as a **2-uniform tiling**. A close inspection reveals that the tiling is constructed from three types of polygons:\n*   **Blue dodecagons** (12-sided figures)\n*   **Yellow squares** (4-sided figures)\n*   **Orange rhombi** (4-sided figures)\n\nAt first glance, the pattern appears to have centers of both 4-fold symmetry (at the center of the squares) and 6-fold or 12-fold symmetry (at the center of the blue shapes). However, a key principle in crystallography, the **crystallographic restriction theorem**, states that a periodic, repeating pattern in two dimensions cannot simultaneously possess both 4-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetry. A pattern can have rotational symmetries of order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6, but not 4 and 6 in the same lattice.\n\nGiven this rule, one of the apparent symmetries must be a local appearance rather than a true symmetry of the entire infinite tiling. Authoritative geometric sources classify this specific tiling pattern as having the **wallpaper group p6m**.\n\n### The p6m Symmetry Group\n\nThe p6m symmetry group is one of the 17 wallpaper groups and is characterized by the following rotational symmetries:\n*   **6-fold rotation:** The highest order of rotational symmetry is 6-fold (rotations by 60째). In this tiling, the centers of the blue dodecagons are the points of 6-fold rotation.\n*   **3-fold rotation:** As a subgroup of 6-fold rotation, there are also centers of 3-fold rotation (120째) at the same locations.\n*   **2-fold rotation:** The group also includes centers of 2-fold rotation (180째).\n\nThe areas centered on the yellow squares, while appearing to have 4-fold symmetry, do not represent true rotational symmetry points for the entire pattern. Rotating the complete tiling by 90째 around the center of a square would not result in an identical overlay of the entire pattern. Therefore, the definitive rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
