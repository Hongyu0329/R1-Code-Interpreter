    "The knot in the picture is the Conway knot, also known as `K11n34` in the Alexander-Briggs notation. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer invariant that provides valuable information about the knot, particularly concerning its sliceness.\n\nFor the Conway knot (`C`), its Rasmussen invariant `s(C)` is 0.\n\nThis fact is central to the famous proof by Lisa Piccirillo that the Conway knot is not smoothly slice. A fundamental property of the Rasmussen invariant is that if a knot is smoothly slice, its `s`-invariant must be 0. However, the converse is not always true. The Conway knot is a prime example of a non-slice knot with a Rasmussen invariant of 0. This made the question of its sliceness a long-standing problem in knot theory.\n\nPiccirillo's innovative proof involved constructing another knot that has the same knot trace as the Conway knot. She then showed that this new knot has a non-zero Rasmussen invariant (`s(K') = 2`), which proved it was not slice. Since the two knots have the same slice status, this demonstrated that the Conway knot is also not smoothly slice.\n\nThe Conway knot is related by mutation to the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot, and they share the same Jones, Alexander, and Conway polynomials. The Rasmussen invariant of the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot (`K11n42`) is also 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
