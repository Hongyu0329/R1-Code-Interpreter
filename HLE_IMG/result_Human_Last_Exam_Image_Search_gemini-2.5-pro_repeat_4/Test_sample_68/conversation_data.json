    "This coin originates from **New France**.\n\nThe coin seen in the image is a 9 Deniers piece, struck in 1721 or 1722 under the authority of King Louis XV. The inscription \"COLONIES FRANÃ‡OISES\" indicates it was specifically intended for use in the French colonies.\n\nThese copper coins were minted in France at the Rouen (mint mark \"B\") and La Rochelle (mint mark \"H\") mints. They were authorized by an edict in June 1721 to provide small change for France's territories in the New World, which at the time included New France (encompassing Quebec, Acadia, and Louisiana) and the French West Indies.\n\nAlthough intended for broad colonial use, a large shipment of these coins was sent to Canada in 1722. However, the colonists were reluctant to use them, preferring silver-based coins, and a significant number were returned to France in 1726. Subsequently, many of these coins were sent to Louisiana, where they circulated more successfully. They were also known to have circulated in the British North American colonies and later even in French colonies in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDue to its primary intended destination and initial introduction, the coin is most closely associated with New France, which covered vast territories in North America.\n\n<<<New France>>>"
