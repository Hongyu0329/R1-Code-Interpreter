    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant:** The starting material is a substituted cyclobutene. Based on the connectivity shown, it is **1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobutene**. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon is specified, with the methyl group (Me) pointing up (wedge) and the methoxy group (OMe) pointing down (dash).\n\n2.  **Reaction Conditions and Mechanism:** The reaction is heated (Δ), indicating a thermal electrocyclic reaction. For a 4π electron system like cyclobutene, the thermal ring opening occurs via a **conrotatory** mechanism, according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate Diene:** The ring opening of the C3-C4 sigma bond in 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobutene leads to the formation of a conjugated diene.\n    *   The atoms of the cyclobutene ring `C1(OMe)=C2(H)-C3(H2)-C4(Me,OMe)` rearrange to form the diene `H2C(3)=CH(2)-C(1)(OMe)=C(4)(Me,OMe)`.\n    *   The chemical structure of this diene is **2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene**.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of the Diene:** The conrotatory ring opening of the chiral starting material can proceed in two ways (clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation), which are diastereomeric transition states. This leads to the formation of two diastereomeric dienes, which are the (E) and (Z) isomers with respect to the C1=C4 double bond (in the original cyclobutene numbering, which corresponds to the C3=C4 bond in the diene `H2C=CH-C(OMe)=C(Me,OMe)`). Let's call them **Diene-E** and **Diene-Z**. We can assume that both are formed in the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**\n    *   **Diene:** The mixture of Diene-E and Diene-Z (2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene) formed in Step 1.\n    *   **Dienophile:** Ethyl acrylate (`H2C=CH-CO2Et`).\n\n2.  **Regiochemistry:** The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. By analyzing the product structures provided, we can deduce the regiochemistry. A retro-Diels-Alder analysis of product A reveals that it is formed from the diene identified above, reacting in a specific \"ortho\" orientation. We will assume this regiochemistry for both Diene-E and Diene-Z.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry (Endo Rule):** The problem states that the Diels-Alder reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion. The endo rule dictates that the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the `-CO2Et` group) is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the substituents on the \"inside\" of the C-shaped s-cis conformation of the diene.\n\n**Analysis of the reaction for each diene isomer:**\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene-Z:**\n    1.  In the s-cis conformation of Diene-Z, the methyl group (Me) at C4 and the vinyl group at C3 are on the \"inside\".\n    2.  According to the endo rule, the `-CO2Et` group will be *cis* to the \"inside\" methyl group in the product.\n    3.  This leads to a product where the Me group at C6 and the `-CO2Et` group at C4 are on the same side of the cyclohexene ring (both wedge or both dash).\n    4.  Looking at the options, **Product C** (and its enantiomer D) has this *cis* relationship.\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene-E:**\n    1.  In the s-cis conformation of Diene-E, the methoxy group (OMe) at C4 and the vinyl group at C3 are on the \"inside\", while the methyl group (Me) at C4 is on the \"outside\".\n    2.  According to the endo rule, the `-CO2Et` group will be *cis* to the \"inside\" methoxy group (OMe at C4) in the product.\n    3.  This means the `-CO2Et` group will be *trans* to the \"outside\" methyl group (Me at C4).\n    4.  This leads to a product where the Me group at C6 and the `-CO2Et` group at C4 are on opposite sides of the cyclohexene ring (one wedge, one dash).\n    5.  Looking at the options, **Product G** (and its enantiomer H) has this *trans* relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence starts with a single chiral cyclobutene, which undergoes ring-opening to form a mixture of two diastereomeric dienes (E and Z). Each of these dienes then undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction to form a specific diastereomeric product.\n\n*   Diene-Z yields Product C (or D).\n*   Diene-E yields Product G (or H).\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are C and G (or their respective enantiomers D and H, depending on the absolute configuration of the starting material). The question asks for the two products, which are the two diastereomers formed.\n\nThe two products are **C** and **G**.\n\n<<<C, G>>>"
