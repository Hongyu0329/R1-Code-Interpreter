    "The black, hair-like organism in the photo is a type of **slime mold**.\n\nThese fascinating organisms are not true fungi but belong to their own group, the Myxomycetes. The structures visible in the photo are their reproductive stage, consisting of tiny stalks (sporangiophores) that support spore-filled cases (sporangia) at their tips. These stalks lift the spores into the air for better dispersal.\n\nWhile it is difficult to identify the exact species without microscopic examination, the appearance is characteristic of slime molds in the genus ***Stemonitis***, also known as Chocolate Tube Slime or Tree Hair. Another possibility is the genus ***Comatricha***, which also forms small, dark, stalked sporangia.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like organism on which the slime mold is growing is a type of bracket fungus, also called a polypore. Based on its shape and zoned coloring, it is likely **Turkeytail** (*Trametes versicolor*), a very common fungus found on dead wood. The slime mold is using the fungus as a surface to grow on, likely feeding on bacteria, fungal spores, and other microscopic organic matter found there.\n\n<<<Slime mold (likely Stemonitis or Comatricha genus)>>>"
