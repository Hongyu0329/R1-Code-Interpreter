    "The medallion is ascribed by archaeologists to the **1st century CE**.\n\nThis dating is based on its strong resemblance to artifacts discovered in the Khokhlach kurgan, a Sarmatian burial mound near Novocherkassk, Russia. The finds from this site, famously known as the Novocherkassk Hoard, are predominantly dated to the 1st century CE.\n\nThe hoard contained numerous gold items from the grave of a high-status Sarmatian woman, possibly a priestess. A prominent piece from this collection, a golden diadem, features a central figure with Hellenistic characteristics, indicating a blend of Sarmatian and Greco-Roman artistic styles. The imagery on the medallion, particularly the figure with ram's horns, is a well-known motif in Hellenistic art, often associated with Alexander the Great and the deity Zeus-Ammon.\n\nThe style and iconography of the medallion are consistent with the cultural and artistic exchanges occurring between the Sarmatians and the Greco-Roman world during this period. Archaeological analysis of similar Sarmatian artifacts with foreign influences from this region also points to a timeframe between the late 1st century BC and the 1st or 2nd centuries AD.\n\n<<<1st century CE>>>"
