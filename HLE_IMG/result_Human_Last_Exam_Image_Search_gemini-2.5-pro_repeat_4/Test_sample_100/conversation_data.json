    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material. The structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene derivative.\n*   **Bicyclic core with substituents:**\n    *   The basic bicyclic framework is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.\n    *   It has a ketone (C=O) group at the C7 bridge.\n    *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is attached to the double bond.\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is substituted with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group.\n*   **Atom Counting:**\n    *   **PMB group (-CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃):** 8 Carbon atoms (1 from CH₂, 6 from the benzene ring, 1 from OCH₃), 9 Hydrogen atoms (2 from CH₂, 4 from the ring, 3 from OCH₃), and 1 Oxygen atom. Formula: C₈H₉O.\n    *   **Bicyclic core:** Let's count the atoms of the parent structure without the PMB group and with an H on the nitrogen: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one. This core has 7 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms, 3 Fluorine atoms, 1 Nitrogen atom, and 1 Oxygen atom (from the C=O group). Formula: C₇H₆F₃NO.\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** Adding the PMB group (C₈H₉O) to the core (C₇H₅F₃NO, after removing H from N) gives:\n    *   C: 7 + 8 = 15\n    *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   **Starting Material Formula: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**\n\n**Step 2: First Reaction (CAN, ACN/H₂O)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from amines and alcohols.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom, which is then protonated, resulting in a secondary amine (-NH-).\n*   **Change in Formula:** This reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and adds a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen. The net change is the loss of a C₈H₈O fragment.\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O = **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Second Reaction (Pd/C, H₂, MeOH)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a standard system for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** Two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule.\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = **C₇H₈F₃NO**. The structure is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one.\n\n**Step 4: Third Reaction (4 N HCl, 70 °C)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hot aqueous hydrochloric acid.\n*   **Transformation:** This is the crucial step. While several reactions are possible, the most plausible transformation under these conditions for this substrate is the hydrolysis of the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group to a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. Although CF₃ groups are generally stable, they can be hydrolyzed under acidic (or basic) conditions, and the specific structure of the substrate can influence reactivity.\n    *   The overall hydrolysis reaction is: R-CF₃ + 2H₂O → R-COOH + 3HF\n*   **Change in Formula:** The three fluorine atoms are replaced by two oxygen atoms and one hydrogen atom (-F₃ + O₂H).\n*   **Final Product Formula:**\n    *   Starting from Intermediate 2: C₇H₈F₃NO\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 1 = 9\n    *   F: 3 - 3 = 0\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 2 = 3\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₇H₉NO₃**.\n\nThe final product is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one-6-carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C₇H₉NO₃>>>"
