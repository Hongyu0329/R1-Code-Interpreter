    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to understand the atomic arrangement in this specific projection.\n\nIn an FCC crystal structure, atoms are located at each corner and in the center of all six faces of the cubic unit cell. When this structure is viewed along the direction, the atoms project onto the (110) plane, creating a distinct pattern.\n\nThis projected pattern is a centered rectangle. The (110) plane in an FCC lattice contains atoms that form a rectangle, with an additional atom located in the center of that rectangle. This arrangement arises from the stacking of atomic layers. One layer of atoms forms a rectangular grid, and the subsequent layer is shifted so that its atoms are positioned in the center of the rectangles of the first layer. The view along shows these layers superimposed.\n\nNow let's examine the given images:\n*   **Image A:** Shows two offset columns of atoms, which does not form a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **Image B:** Clearly displays a centered rectangular pattern. You can see atoms at the corners of a rectangle on the front face of the outlined box, with another atom directly in the center of that rectangle. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image C:** Shows a sparse and distorted pattern that does not clearly represent the centered rectangle.\n*   **Image D:** Presents a simple rectangular grid of atoms, lacking the central atom characteristic of the FCC view.\n\nBased on this analysis, Image B correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
