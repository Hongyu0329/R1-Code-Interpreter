    "The provided sheet music is the opening of the second scene of Richard Strauss's one-act opera, *Salome*.\n\nThis identification is based on several key elements within the score:\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large orchestra, characteristic of Richard Strauss's style. The specified instruments include 2 grand flutes (\"2 gr. Fl.\"), oboe (\"I. Hob.\"), English horn (\"engl. Horn\"), and bassoon (\"I. Fag.\"), alongside a substantial string section with first and second violins (\"I. Viol.\", \"II. Viol.\"), violas (\"Br.\"), and cellos (\"Celli\").\n*   **Musical Style:** The chromaticism and lush harmonies are hallmarks of Strauss's late-Romantic and early-modernist period.\n*   **Textual Clues:** The German instruction \"(Vorhang)\" translates to \"(Curtain),\" indicating the start of a new scene. While *Salome* is a one-act opera, it is divided into four scenes. This music marks the beginning of the second scene, where Salome enters. The instruction \"(mit Dämpfer)\" means \"(with mute),\" a common directive for string instruments.\n\nRichard Strauss composed *Salome*, his opus 54, between 1904 and 1905. The opera is based on Hedwig Lachmann's German translation of Oscar Wilde's 1891 play *Salomé*. It premiered in Dresden on December 9, 1905. The work is renowned for its dramatic intensity and its rich, complex orchestration, which requires over 100 musicians.\n\n<<<Salome>>>"
