    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the orientation of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly curved or arcuate seta. This curvature gives the capsule a bent or inclined appearance relative to the stem. This single feature of a straight versus a curved seta is the most straightforward way to differentiate the sporophytes of these two moss species visually.\n\n<<<The seta of *Grimmia montana* is straight, while the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is curved.>>>"
