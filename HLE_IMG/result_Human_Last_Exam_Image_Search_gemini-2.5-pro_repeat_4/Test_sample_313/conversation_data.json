    "The correct term for X Y is **Mad Hatter**.\n\nThis answer is derived from connecting the two distinct clues provided: an image from an awards ceremony and a fact about the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n**The Image:** The photograph was taken at the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The man on the right receiving the award is Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, who won the Vezina Trophy for the first time. The man on the left presenting the award is Ron Hextall, a former star goaltender and a previous winner of the Vezina Trophy. Hextall was renowned for his aggressive and volatile style of play, which earned him a reputation for being \"crazy\" and resulted in a record-breaking number of penalty minutes for a goalie.\n\n**The Mercury Connection:** The phrase \"mad as a hatter\" originated in the 18th and 19th centuries from the hat-making industry. Felt hats were processed using mercury nitrate, a toxic compound. Hatmakers, or \"hatters,\" who were frequently exposed to mercury vapors often developed mercury poisoning, which led to neurological damage and symptoms like tremors and psychosis. This condition became known as \"Mad Hatter's disease.\"\n\nThe two clues connect through Ron Hextall. As a goaltender—a player who wears protective headgear similar to a hat—and with his famously aggressive (\"mad\") on-ice behavior, he embodies the term \"Mad Hatter\" in a modern, metaphorical sense. Therefore, a \"Mad Hatter\" is pictured at the event.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
