    "The absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by assigning an R or S configuration to each of its three chiral centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The chiral centers are analyzed from left to right as C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**1. Configuration at C2 (the carbon with the -OH group):**\n*   **Groups attached:** -OH, -CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (let's call it the C3 group), -CH3, and an implicit -H.\n*   **Priorities:** Based on atomic number, the priorities are: (1) -OH, (2) the C3 group, (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n*   **Determination:** In the given drawing, the -OH group is on a wedge (out of the page) and the -CH3 group is on a dash (into the page). This means the C-C3 bond and the C-H bond are in the plane of the page. To determine the configuration when the lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane, we can mentally swap it with the group on the dash (-CH3). After the swap, the -H group is in the back. The path from priority 1 (-OH) to 2 (C3 group) to 3 (-CH3) is now counter-clockwise, which would indicate an S configuration. However, because we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, C2 is **R**.\n\n**2. Configuration at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group):**\n*   **Groups attached:** -C(OH)(CH3) (the C2 group), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C4 group), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and an implicit -H.\n*   **Priorities:** The priorities are determined by comparing the atoms attached to each group. The order is: (1) the C2 group (bonded to O), (2) the C4 group (bonded to C, C, N at the next position), (3) -CH2CH3, (4) -H.\n*   **Determination:** The ethyl group is on a wedge, and the bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. This implies the lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash, pointing away from the viewer. Tracing the path from priority 1 (C2) to 2 (C4) to 3 (ethyl) describes a clockwise circle. Therefore, C3 is **R**.\n\n**3. Configuration at C4 (the rightmost chiral carbon):**\n*   **Groups attached:** -CH2NH2, the C3 group, -CH3, and an implicit -H.\n*   **Priorities:** The priority order is: (1) -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to a nitrogen), (2) the C3 group, (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n*   **Determination:** The methyl group is shown on a wedge. For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies the lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash, pointing away. The path from priority 1 (-CH2NH2) to 2 (C3 group) to 3 (-CH3) is counter-clockwise. Therefore, C4 is **S**.\n\nCombining the configurations of the three chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
