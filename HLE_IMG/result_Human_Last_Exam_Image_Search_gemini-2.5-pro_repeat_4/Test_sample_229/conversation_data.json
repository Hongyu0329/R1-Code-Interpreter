Although the piece is instrumental in its essence, lyrics have been added over the years.\n\nThe musical style, choro, is a genre of Brazilian popular instrumental music that originated in Rio de Janeiro in the 19th century. It is often characterized by its upbeat tempo, syncopated rhythms, and virtuosic melodies, typically featuring instruments like the flute, guitar, and cavaquinho. Despite the name \"choro,\" which means \"lament\" or \"cry,\" the music is often fast-paced and cheerful.
