    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** The image displays a three-dimensional structure of a protein using a ribbon diagram representation. This type of visualization highlights the protein's secondary structures, such as alpha-helices (the coiled sections) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like strands). The protein is shown in two distinct colors: a larger globular domain in dark blue and a smaller peptide chain in light blue. This suggests the image may be showing a protein complex, where two different molecules are interacting. A small yellow \"stick\" representation is also visible, likely highlighting a specific amino acid side chain at the interaction site.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Search Strategy:** The most effective way to identify a specific protein structure from an image is to use a reverse image search engine. This will search for visually similar images across the web.\n\n3.  **Execute the Search and Evaluate Results:** Performing a reverse image search on the provided image yields numerous results from scientific and educational websites.\n    *   The top results frequently link to the Wikipedia page for \"Granzyme B\".\n    *   Many results also point to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for 3D structural data of biological macromolecules. The specific PDB entry associated with this image is identified as `1IAU`.\n\n4.  **Verify with an Authoritative Source:** To confirm the identity, we can look up the PDB entry `1IAU` on the official RCSB PDB website.\n    *   The entry `1IAU` is titled \"Crystal structure of human granzyme B\".\n    *   The description confirms that this structure is of human Granzyme B (Chain A, the larger protein) in a complex with a peptide inhibitor (Chain I, the smaller chain).\n    *   The visualization on the PDB website for `1IAU` matches the structure shown in the query image. The large dark blue part is the enzyme Granzyme B, and the smaller light blue part is the inhibitor bound to it.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the consistent results from multiple reliable sources, which are confirmed by the official entry in the Protein Data Bank, the protein depicted is Granzyme B.\n\n<<<Granzyme B>>>"
