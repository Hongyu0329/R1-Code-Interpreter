    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The image shows an impression taken from a large gold medallion. The style of the relief artwork is distinctly Hellenistic Greek.\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:** The medallion features a double portrait. The figure on the left is a male ruler wearing a royal diadem and an *aegis* (a scaly goatskin cloak, an attribute of Zeus) draped over his shoulder, symbolizing his divine authority. The figure on the right is a female ruler, who is veiled and also wears a diadem. This specific iconography is characteristic of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.\n3.  **Identification of Figures and Artifact:** Based on scholarly analysis and comparison with other artifacts, this specific object is known as the \"Tarentum Medallion.\" It was discovered in a tomb in the ancient Greek city of Tarentum (modern Taranto, Italy). The figures are identified as Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and his queen, Berenice I.\n4.  **Dating the Artifact:** This medallion is a posthumous commemorative issue. It was not minted during the lifetime of Ptolemy I and Berenice I. Instead, numismatists and historians have established that it was minted under the authority of their son and successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He issued these large gold medallions to honor and deify his parents as the *Theoi Soteres* (\"Savior Gods\"), thereby reinforcing his own legitimacy.\n5.  **Establishing the Time Period:** The reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus lasted from 283 BC to 246 BC. The medallion must have been created within this timeframe.\n6.  **Determining the Century:** The entire period of Ptolemy II's reign (283-246 BC) falls squarely within the 3rd century BC (which spans from 300 BC to 201 BC).\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Style:** The purely Hellenistic style of the portraiture and attributes is a key chronological marker, distinguishing it from later Roman art.\n*   **Identification:** It is important to correctly identify the figures as Ptolemy I and Berenice I based on their attributes (especially the aegis), rather than confusing them with other Ptolemaic rulers or Alexander the Great.\n*   **Commemorative Nature:** The date of the artifact is determined by the reign of the issuer (Ptolemy II), not the lifetimes of the individuals depicted (Ptolemy I and Berenice I).\n*   **Context:** The discovery of this Egyptian medallion in Italy points to the extensive diplomatic and economic reach of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the early Hellenistic period.\n*   **Answering the Question:** The question explicitly asks for the century, so the final answer should state the century, not a specific year or reign.\n\nBased on this analysis, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century B.C.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
