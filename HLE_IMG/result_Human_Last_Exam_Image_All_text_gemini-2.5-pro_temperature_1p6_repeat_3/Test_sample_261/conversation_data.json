    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image fragment.**\n    The image shows a painterly illustration of a silvery or pale blue unicorn. The creature is depicted in motion, galloping or rearing up. Its horn is visible, and it has an ethereal, almost ghostly appearance. The unicorn is emerging from a dark, shadowed area on the left. To the right, there is the edge of a large, ornate, golden-brown object that looks like a pillar, a door frame, or the edge of a large, decorated mirror. The overall style suggests a fantasy novel, likely aimed at a young adult audience.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on iconic imagery.**\n    The combination of a silvery unicorn, a dark setting (suggestive of a forest), and a magical, classical-looking frame is highly reminiscent of the Harry Potter series. The specific appearance of the unicorn matches descriptions from the first book, where it is found in the Forbidden Forest. The artist's style is very similar to that of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original US editions of the Harry Potter books.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locate the specific cover art.**\n    Let's examine the cover of the first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (the US title for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*). The full, wrap-around cover art by Mary GrandPré for this book is very detailed. The front cover famously depicts Harry Potter on a broomstick reaching for the Golden Snitch. However, the artwork extends onto the spine and the back cover.\n\n*   **Step 4: Match the fragment to the full cover.**\n    On the spine and back portion of the original US dust jacket for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, the illustration continues. It features the Mirror of Erised, which has an ornate golden frame. To the left of the mirror, peeking out from behind the frame, is the very same silvery unicorn shown in the fragment. The dark background, the unicorn's color and pose, and the golden, decorated frame from the fragment perfectly match this section of the book cover.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the title.**\n    Since the fragment is a direct detail from the cover illustration of the original US edition of the first Harry Potter book, the title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
