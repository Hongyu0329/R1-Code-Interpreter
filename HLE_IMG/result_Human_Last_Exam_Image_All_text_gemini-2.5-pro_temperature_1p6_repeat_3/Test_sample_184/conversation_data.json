    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the two final products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction - 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The first reactant is a cyclobutene derivative. Let's analyze its structure. It's a cyclobut-1-ene ring. At C3, there is a methoxy group (MeO) pointing down (dash). The implicit hydrogen is pointing up (wedge). At C4, there is a methyl group (Me) pointing up (wedge) and a methoxy group (MeO) pointing down (dash).\n2.  **Stereochemistry of Substituents:** The two methoxy groups at C3 and C4 are on the same side of the ring (both dash), so they are *cis* to each other. The hydrogen at C3 and the methyl group at C4 are also on the same side (both wedge), so they are also *cis*.\n3.  **Reaction Conditions and Mechanism:** The reaction is carried out under thermal conditions (Δ). For a 4π electron system (2e⁻ from the π bond and 2e⁻ from the σ bond being broken), the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict a **conrotatory** ring opening.\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** For a conrotatory ring opening, substituents that are *cis* on the cyclobutene ring lead to a diene where the corresponding groups are on the same side relative to the diene backbone (i.e., forming either an (E,E) or (Z,Z)-diene). Conversely, *trans* substituents lead to an (E,Z)-diene.\n5.  **Formation of the Reactive Diene:**\n    *   Since the key substituent pairs ({MeO, MeO} and {H, Me}) are *cis*, the ring opening will produce either an (E,E)- or a (Z,Z)-diene.\n    *   The diene's connectivity is derived by breaking the C3-C4 bond, leading to a 1,4-dimethoxy-1-methylbuta-1,3-diene: `(Me)(MeO)C=CH-CH=C(H)(OMe)`.\n    *   The (Z,Z)-isomer would be sterically hindered and unable to adopt the s-cis conformation required for the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction.\n    - The (E,E)-isomer, `(1E,3E)-1,4-dimethoxy-1-methylbuta-1,3-diene`, can readily adopt the necessary s-cis conformation. Therefore, this is the reactive diene intermediate.\n    - In the s-cis conformation of the (E,E)-diene, the \"inward-pointing\" groups are the methyl (Me) group from C1 and the hydrogen (H) from C4. The \"outward-pointing\" groups are the methoxy (OMe) groups from C1 and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction - Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The diene is the `(1E,3E)-1,4-dimethoxy-1-methylbuta-1,3-diene` formed in Step 1. The dienophile is ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`).\n2.  **Regiochemistry:** The product options provided (A-H) all show the same connectivity, which corresponds to an \"ortho\" cycloaddition. This means C1 of the diene `(C(Me,OMe))` bonds to the α-carbon of the dienophile `(CH(CO2Et))`, and C4 of the diene `(CH(OMe))` bonds to the β-carbon of the dienophile `(CH2)`. We will proceed with this regiochemistry.\n3.  **Stereochemistry (Endo Rule):** The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an *endo* fashion. This means the electron-withdrawing group (`-CO2Et`) of the dienophile is oriented towards the π-system of the diene in the transition state.\n4.  **Diastereoselectivity:** The dienophile is achiral, but the diene is chiral (it was formed from a single enantiomer of the cyclobutene). The dienophile can attack the planar diene from two different faces (top or bottom), leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Two Products**\n\nLet's visualize the two endo transition states. We can define the plane of the diene and describe substituents as being \"up\" or \"down\". Let's orient the s-cis diene so the \"inward\" groups (Me and H) are \"up\" and the \"outward\" groups (both OMe groups) are \"down\".\n\n*   **Mode 1: Attack from the Top Face**\n    *   The dienophile approaches from the \"top\".\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the `-CO2Et` group points \"down\" (towards the diene). The hydrogen on the α-carbon points \"up\".\n    *   The relative stereochemistry of the product is determined by the positions in the transition state:\n        *   At the quaternary center (from C1): Me is up (wedge), OMe is down (dash).\n        *   At the center with the ester (from Cα): `CO2Et` is down (dash).\n        *   At the center with the other OMe (from C4): OMe is down (dash).\n    *   This stereochemical arrangement matches **Product E**.\n\n*   **Mode 2: Attack from the Bottom Face**\n    *   The dienophile approaches from the \"bottom\".\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the `-CO2Et` group points \"up\" (towards the diene). The hydrogen on the α-carbon points \"down\".\n    *   The resulting relative stereochemistry is:\n        *   At the quaternary center (from C1): Me is up (wedge), OMe is down (dash).\n        *   At the center with the ester (from Cα): `CO2Et` is up (wedge).\n        *   At the center with the other OMe (from C4): OMe is down (dash).\n    *   This stereochemical arrangement matches **Product G**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two products formed from the 4π electrocyclic ring opening followed by an endo Diels-Alder cycloaddition are E and G.\n\n(Note: The product structures A-H all depict a `MeO-C=CH` enol ether moiety. This contradicts the expected `CH=CH` double bond from the Diels-Alder reaction of the derived diene. This is likely a systematic error in the drawing of the options. The analysis of the stereochemistry of the substituents on the saturated carbons of the ring is independent of this feature and leads to the unique selection of E and G as the products.)\n\nThe two products are E and G.\n\n<<<E and G>>>"
