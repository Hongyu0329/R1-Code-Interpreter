    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to identify the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants**: Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system, and cyclobutene (C₄H₄), a cyclic alkene with a 2π-electron system. The drawing of cyclobutene highlights two *cis*-hydrogens on the saturated carbons, which likely indicates retention of this stereochemistry.\n*   **Product**: A complex tricyclic molecule. Its structure appears to be a linear fusion of three four-membered rings. A detailed atom count on the product drawing reveals a formula of C₁₀F₆H₂, which is inconsistent with the combination of reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₄ would give C₁₀F₆H₄). This suggests either the loss of H₂ during the reaction or a simplification/error in the drawings. We will proceed by analyzing plausible reaction pathways based on the reactant types and assume the drawings may be schematic.\n*   **Reaction Conditions**: The reaction is carried out under irradiation with light (hv), indicating that photochemical processes are involved. The problem explicitly states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Plausible Photochemical Pericyclic Reactions**\nPericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. Their stereochemical outcomes under thermal or photochemical conditions are governed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. For a transformation involving two reactants under photochemical conditions, we can consider sequences of the following reaction types:\n*   **Electrocyclic reactions**: Intramolecular ring-closing or ring-opening reactions. For photochemical reactions:\n    *   4n π-electron systems undergo conrotatory cyclization/opening.\n    *   (4n+2) π-electron systems undergo disrotatory cyclization/opening.\n*   **Cycloadditions**: Reactions where two or more molecules combine to form a ring. For photochemical reactions:\n    *   [m+n] cycloadditions where m+n = 4q (e.g., [2+2], [4+4]) are allowed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner.\n    *   [m+n] cycloadditions where m+n = 4q+2 (e.g., [4+2], [6+2]) are forbidden in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner but allowed if one component reacts antarafacially.\n\n**Step 3: Propose and Evaluate Reaction Pathways**\nLet's consider possible two-step sequences of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Pathway A: Initial [2+2] Cycloaddition followed by an Electrocyclic Reaction**\n1.  **[2π+2π] Cycloaddition**: Hexafluorobenzene can react with cyclobutene via one of its double bonds in a photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloaddition. This would form a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative. This is the first pericyclic reaction.\n2.  **4π Electrocyclic Reaction**: The intermediate formed contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety, which is a 4π-electron system. Under photochemical conditions, this system can undergo a conrotatory electrocyclic ring closure to form a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane skeleton. This would be the second pericyclic reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: This pathway consists of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. However, the resulting tricyclic product has a \"branched\" fusion of the three rings, which does not match the \"linear\" fusion depicted in the product drawing.\n\n**Pathway B: Initial Electrocyclic Reaction followed by a [2+2] Cycloaddition**\n1.  **6π Electrocyclic Reaction**: Hexafluorobenzene can undergo a photochemically allowed disrotatory 6π electrocyclic reaction to form its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). The formation of this Dewar isomer is particularly favorable for hexafluorobenzene compared to benzene itself. This is the first pericyclic reaction.\n2.  **[2π+2π] Cycloaddition**: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene has two strained double bonds and can readily react with cyclobutene in a photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloaddition. One of the C=C bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene adds to the C=C bond of cyclobutene. This is the second pericyclic reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: This pathway also consists of two plausible, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Similar to Pathway A, the predicted product has a branched ring fusion, which is topologically different from the linear fusion shown. However, given the ambiguities in the product drawing and stoichiometry, this pathway is chemically very sound.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBoth plausible pathways, A and B, involve one electrocyclic reaction and one cycloaddition reaction.\n*   Pathway A involves a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and a **4π electrocyclic reaction**.\n*   Pathway B involves a **6π electrocyclic reaction** and a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\nBoth sets of reactions are valid interpretations. However, the initial valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its more stable (than the parent hydrocarbon analog) Dewar isomer is a very characteristic and well-documented photochemical reaction for this substrate. The subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition of the strained Dewar benzene is also a very favorable process. This makes Pathway B a highly compelling explanation.\n\nTherefore, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved are an **electrocyclic reaction** and a **cycloaddition reaction**. Being more specific based on the most likely pathway:\n\n1.  A **6π electrocyclic reaction** (valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene).\n2.  A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** (addition of cyclobutene to the Dewar benzene intermediate).\n\n<<<6π electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
