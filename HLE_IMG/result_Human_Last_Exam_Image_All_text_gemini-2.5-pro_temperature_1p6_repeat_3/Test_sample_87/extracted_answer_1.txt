**Product A:**
The structure is a dihydropyrrolizine derivative, which is a bicyclic system formed by the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The azomethine ylide derived from the N-acetylated and decarboxylated starting material adds to methyl propiolate. The resulting structure is a fused 5-5 ring system (a pyrrolizidine skeleton) with an acetyl group on the nitrogen, a methoxycarbonyl group on the newly formed ring, and the original pyrroline substituent.

[Image of structure A: A 5-membered pyrrolidine ring is fused with another 5-membered dihydropyrrole ring at the N and adjacent C atom, forming a bicyclo[3.3.0]aza-octene system (pyrrolizidine skeleton). The nitrogen atom at the bridgehead is acetylated (N-COCH₃). The pyrroline substituent (a 5-membered ring with a C=N bond) is attached to the carbon adjacent to the bridgehead nitrogen in the original pyrrolidine ring moiety. The newly formed ring contains a double bond, with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) attached to one of the sp² carbons.]
```
**Product B:**
The structure is a bicyclic compound containing the original pyrrolidine ring fused to a seven-membered ring. This is formed by the initial Michael addition of the secondary amine of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular condensation between the carboxylic acid group and the newly added ester group, with elimination of methanol. The structure retains the pyrroline substituent on the pyrrolidine ring.

[Image of structure B: A 5-membered pyrrolidine ring is fused to a 7-membered ring. The shared bond is between the N atom and the C2 atom of the pyrrolidine. The 7-membered ring contains a C=C double bond and an anhydride-like O-C(=O)-[...]-C(=O) functional group. The pyrroline substituent is attached to the C2 atom of the pyrrolidine ring.]
```
**Product C:**
This is the product of simple N-acetylation of the starting material. The secondary amine of the pyrrolidine ring reacts with acetic anhydride to form an N-acetyl amide.
