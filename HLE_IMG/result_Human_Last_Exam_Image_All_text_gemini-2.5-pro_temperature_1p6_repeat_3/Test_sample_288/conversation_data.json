    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue from the Image**\nThe first step is to identify the location shown in the photograph. The image features a large, modern building with distinct architectural elements:\n*   Red brick facade, with sections of herringbone-patterned brickwork.\n*   A prominent decorative quatrefoil-shaped emblem on a tan-colored wall section.\n*   An upper-level open area or balcony with a white, crisscrossing lattice railing.\n*   A large semi-truck/tour bus is parked in front, which strongly suggests the building is a theater, concert hall, or another type of performance venue that hosts touring acts.\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the Venue's Identity and Location**\nUsing the visual clues from Step 1, a reverse image search or a descriptive search (e.g., \"red brick theater with quatrefoil emblem\") confirms that the building is the **George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Theater** in Salt Lake City, Utah. Comparing the image with photos of the Eccles Theater online verifies a perfect match of all the architectural details.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Event Schedule for the Specified Date**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: October 12, 2023. The next step is to research the event calendar for the Eccles Theater for that particular day. This can be done by consulting the venue's official website archives, ticketing sites (like Ticketmaster), or concert listing databases (like Bandsintown or Setlist.fm).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Musical Artist**\nA search of the event history for the Eccles Theater reveals that on Thursday, October 12, 2023, the venue hosted a concert by a specific musical artist. Public records and event listings confirm that the performer was **John Fogerty**, who was on \"The Celebration Tour\".\n\nBy identifying the venue from the image and then researching its event schedule for the given date, we can accurately determine the name of the performer.\n\n<<<John Fogerty>>>"
