    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in total Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). VMT measures the distance traveled by vehicles, regardless of the number of occupants. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Combining Car Modes:** To find the total car VMT, we must consider all car trips. This means we need to sum the mode shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" for each distance category.\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a weighted sum. The VMT for each distance category must be weighted by the \"share of total trips\" that fall into that category.\n4.  **Formula for VMT:** For each distance category, the contribution to the total VMT can be calculated using the formula:\n    `VMT contribution = (Share of Total Trips) x (Total Car Mode Share) x (Average Trip Distance)`\n5.  **Final Reduction Calculation:** The percentage reduction is calculated using the standard formula:\n    `% Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Car Mode Share for each distance category in both scenarios.**\n\n*   **Baseline (Table 1):**\n    *   0-3 miles: 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   3-5 miles: 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   5-10 miles: 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   10+ miles: 42% + 47% = 89%\n\n*   **Proposed (Table 2):**\n    *   0-3 miles: 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   3-5 miles: 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   5-10 miles: 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   10+ miles: 16% + 33% = 49%\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the relative total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.**\n\nTo find the total VMT, we sum the VMT contributions from each distance category. We can use the share values directly, as any total number of trips would cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 (share of trips) * 0.81 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 (share of trips) * 0.85 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 (share of trips) * 0.89 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 2.8480\n*   **Total Baseline VMT (Relative):** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the relative total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.**\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 (share of trips) * 0.27 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 (share of trips) * 0.41 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 (share of trips) * 0.49 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 1.5680\n*   **Total Proposed VMT (Relative):** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
