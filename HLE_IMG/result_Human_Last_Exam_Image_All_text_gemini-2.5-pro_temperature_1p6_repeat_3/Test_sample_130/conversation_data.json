    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image and the Concept**\nThe image provided is a bright-line emission spectrum. When atoms of a gas are excited (for example, by passing an electric current through it), they emit light at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, it creates a pattern of colored lines called an emission spectrum. Each chemical element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts as a \"fingerprint\" allowing scientists to identify it. The image shows the visible portion of the spectrum, with shorter wavelengths (violet, blue) on the left and longer wavelengths (orange, red) on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nWe need to carefully observe the pattern of the spectral lines in the image: their colors, positions, and relative brightness.\n*   **Red Region (right side):** There is at least one prominent, bright red line, along with a few other fainter red lines.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct, bright yellow-orange line. This is a very important feature.\n*   **Green-Cyan Region (middle):** There are multiple lines in this region. One line in the cyan (blue-green) area is particularly bright, and there are several other distinct green lines.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region (left side):** There are numerous lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum, with at least one prominent blue-violet line.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Spectrum with Known Elemental Spectra**\nLet's compare this pattern with the spectra of some common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is relatively simple. It has four prominent lines: a bright red line (H-alpha at 656 nm), a cyan line (H-beta at 486 nm), a blue-violet line (H-gamma at 434 nm), and a violet line (H-delta at 410 nm). **Crucially, hydrogen does not have a prominent line in the yellow part of the spectrum.** The spectrum in the image has a strong yellow line and is more complex than hydrogen's, so we can rule out hydrogen.\n\n*   **Sodium (Na):** The spectrum of sodium is famous for being dominated by a very strong pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow region (at 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm). While the image shows a yellow line, it also shows many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The spectrum is not dominated by the yellow line in the way sodium's is. Thus, it's not sodium.\n\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium has a more complex spectrum with several strong lines spread across the visible range. Its characteristic lines include:\n    *   A bright red line (~668 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (~587 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~502 nm)\n    *   A bright cyan line (~492 nm)\n    *   A bright blue-violet line (~447 nm)\n    *   Several other lines in the violet.\n    This pattern, especially the combination of a bright red line, a very distinct and bright yellow line, and multiple strong lines in the green and blue regions, is an excellent match for the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe observed spectral lines, particularly the presence of a strong line in the yellow region in addition to prominent lines in the red, green, and blue, perfectly match the known emission spectrum of Helium. The image is a classic representation of the bright-line spectrum for the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
