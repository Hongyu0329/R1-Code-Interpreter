    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image shows a close-up of an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The background is a soft green and yellow, suggesting a natural outdoor setting with more of the same type of plant.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Animal (Insect)**\nTo identify the animal, we need to observe its physical characteristics carefully. The provided crops help to see the details more clearly.\n*   **Classification:** The animal has six legs, a pair of antennae, and a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), which are characteristic features of an insect. It appears to be a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera, based on its body shape and what looks like a piercing-sucking mouthpart (rostrum), although the rostrum itself isn't perfectly clear.\n*   **Coloration and Markings:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern of black and bright orange-red.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black.\n    *   **Thorax:** The pronotum (the dorsal part of the first thoracic segment, right behind the head) is predominantly bright orange-red. There seems to be a black mark or stripe in the center of the pronotum.\n    *   **Wings:** From this side view, the wings (hemelytra) appear mostly black.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** Both the legs and the antennae are entirely black.\n*   **Size and Shape:** It is a relatively small, oval-shaped insect.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Plant**\nThe insect is on a plant with numerous small, bright yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike or cluster. This floral structure is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and autumn wildflower in North America. Many insects are known to feed on or frequent goldenrod.\n\n**Step 4: Comparing Features to Known Insect Species**\nBased on the distinctive black and orange-red coloration, the body shape, and its presence on a flowering plant, we can narrow down the possibilities.\n*   The pattern is reminiscent of several insects, such as boxelder bugs, milkweed bugs, or certain soldier beetles.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** These are typically more grayish-black with red or orange lines, and their shape is slightly more elongated. The insect in the photo has large patches of solid orange-red, not just lines.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug has a different pattern, typically an orange body with a prominent black band across the wings.\n*   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*):** While also found on goldenrod and having black and yellow/orange colors, the soldier beetle has a softer body, a different head/pronotum shape, and is a beetle (order Coleoptera), not a true bug.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This species is a very strong match.\n    *   It belongs to the order Hemiptera (true bugs).\n    *   Its typical coloration includes a black head, a red/orange pronotum with a black heart-shaped or irregular spot in the center, and red/orange markings on the wings that often form an \"X\" shape against a black background.\n    *   The insect in the image perfectly matches the description of the head and pronotum of *Lygaeus kalmii*. While the classic \"X\" on the back isn't fully visible from this angle, the visible parts of the body, the color pattern, the black legs, and black antennae are all highly characteristic of this species. They are commonly found not only on milkweed but also on other flowering plants like goldenrod.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe physical features of the insect—specifically the black head, the orange-red pronotum with a central black mark, and the overall body plan—are a definitive match for the Small Milkweed Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
