The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the **RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products)** receptor.

This protein can be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. The reasoning is that the signaling pathway initiated by S100B binding to RAGE leads directly to the core pathological features of disease progression, namely **neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration**, as shown in the diagram. A higher level of S100B would likely correlate with a greater degree of these detrimental outcomes, thus predicting a more severe disease course or a poorer prognosis for the patient. While its lack of specificity (being involved in multiple unrelated diseases) means it could also be used as an adjunct marker, its direct link to the mechanisms that drive disease progression gives it a powerful prognostic value.
