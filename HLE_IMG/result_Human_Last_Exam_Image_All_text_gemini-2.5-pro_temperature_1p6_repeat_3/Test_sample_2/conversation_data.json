    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive sorting algorithm.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the recursion stops. An array of size 0 or 1 is considered sorted.\n    -   **Recursive Step (`n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first calls itself to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array, i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. Let's assume this call works correctly. After this, `a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It compares the last element (`a[n-1]`) with the newly established maximum of the prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: If the last element is smaller, it's swapped with the element before it.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: **Crucially**, if a swap occurred, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again*. This is because the new element at index `n-2` (which was originally at `n-1`) might be out of order with the rest of the `a[0...n-3]` prefix. This second call is intended to re-sort the entire `a[0...n-2]` prefix.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by `sort(a, n)`. The time taken by `swap` and comparison is constant, `O(1)`.\n    -   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens and takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    -   The `if` block contains a `swap` (`O(1)`) and a second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes another `T(n-1)` time.\n    -   We need to find the worst-case scenario. The worst case happens when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, triggering the second recursive call.\n    -   Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n        `T(n) = T(n - 1)  + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    -   The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    We need an input that ensures the `if` condition is met at every level of the recursion. A reverse-sorted array is the perfect candidate for this.\n    -   Consider `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    -   When `sort(a, n)` is called, it first calls `sort(a, n-1)`. This will sort the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` into `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    -   Next, it checks `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]`, which is `if 1 < n`. This is true for `n > 1`.\n    -   A swap occurs, and `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n    -   The second `sort(a, n-1)` is called on the prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This subarray also has its smallest element at the end, meaning this subproblem will also exhibit worst-case behavior.\n    -   This pattern continues all the way down the recursion.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`.\n    Let's expand it:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    `= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    `= 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    Generalizing this pattern for `k` steps:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n    The sum is a geometric series `(2^k - 1)`.\n    So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n    We want to reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    The dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order of `2^n`.\n    So, `T(n) = O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n-   **Termination:** The algorithm does terminate. The recursive calls are on a smaller value of `n` (`n-1`), and there's a base case at `n <= 1`.\n-   **Correctness vs. Efficiency:** The algorithm is logically correct and will sort any given array. However, its method is extremely inefficient. Re-sorting the entire prefix after a single swap is the source of the exponential complexity.\n-   **Worst Case vs. Best Case:** The question specifically asks for the worst-case complexity. The best-case (for an already sorted array) would be `O(n)`, because the second recursive call is never made. The recurrence would be `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n-   **Recognizing the Pattern:** The recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` is a classic example that leads to exponential complexity, similar to the naive recursive Fibonacci algorithm. The number of calls to the function grows exponentially with `n`, forming a full binary call tree of depth `n-1`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is determined by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
