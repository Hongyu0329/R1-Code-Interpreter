The two pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic ring opening followed by an electrocyclic ring closure. Specifically, the first reaction is a 4π-electron conrotatory electrocyclic opening of the cyclobutene ring, and the second is a 6π-electron disrotatory electrocyclic closure of the resulting [10]annulene intermediate.
