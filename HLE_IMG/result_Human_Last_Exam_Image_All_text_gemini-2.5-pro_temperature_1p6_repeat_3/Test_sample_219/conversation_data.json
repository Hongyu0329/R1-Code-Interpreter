    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, a common visualization for neural spike data.\n*   **X-axis:** Time in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   **Y-axis:** Electrode Number, from 0 to 128.\n*   **Data Points:** Each black dot represents a spike (an action potential) recorded by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n*   **Synchronized Bursts:** These are periods of intense, coordinated firing across a large number of electrodes. Visually, they appear as dense, vertical bands on the plot.\n*   **Objective:**\n    1.  Identify the time of each synchronized burst.\n    2.  Calculate the time intervals between consecutive bursts (Inter-Burst Intervals or IBIs).\n    3.  Compute the average of these IBIs.\n    4.  Report the final answer to two significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nBy visually inspecting the raster plot, we can identify the major synchronized bursts. We will estimate the center time for each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** A dense vertical band of activity is centered at approximately **3 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** A very clear and dense burst is centered at **10 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The next synchronized event is centered at approximately **18 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** Another clear burst is centered at **26 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** A burst occurs centered around **33 s**.\n*   **Burst 6:** The next dense event is centered at **38 s**.\n*   **Burst 7:** A strong burst is visible, centered at **45 s**.\n*   **Burst 8:** The final burst in the observed window is centered at **50 s**.\n\n**Identified Burst Timestamps:** 3 s, 10 s, 18 s, 26 s, 33 s, 38 s, 45 s, 50 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe IBI is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have 8 bursts, which will give us 7 intervals.\n\n*   **Interval 1:** 10 s - 3 s = **7 s**\n*   **Interval 2:** 18 s - 10 s = **8 s**\n*   **Interval 3:** 26 s - 18 s = **8 s**\n*   **Interval 4:** 33 s - 26 s = **7 s**\n*   **Interval 5:** 38 s - 33 s = **5 s**\n*   **Interval 6:** 45 s - 38 s = **7 s**\n*   **Interval 7:** 50 s - 45 s = **5 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 7 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 47 s\n*   **Number of IBIs:** 7\n*   **Average IBI:** 47 s / 7 ≈ 6.71428... s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 6.71428... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 6 and 7.\n*   The third digit is 1, which is less than 5, so we do not round up.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 6.7 s.\n\nFinal Summary:\n*   **Burst Timestamps:** ~3s, 10s, 18s, 26s, 33s, 38s, 45s, 50s.\n*   **Inter-Burst Intervals:** 7s, 8s, 8s, 7s, 5s, 7s, 5s.\n*   **Average Inter-Burst Interval:** 47s / 7 ≈ 6.7 s (to two significant figures).\n\n<<<6.7>>>"
