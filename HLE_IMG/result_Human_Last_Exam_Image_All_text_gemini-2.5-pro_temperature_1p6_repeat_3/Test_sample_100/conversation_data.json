    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula.\n*   The core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system.\n*   It has a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group attached to the nitrogen atom. The formula of a PMB group is C8H9O.\n*   It has a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group attached to the C=C double bond.\n*   Let's count all the atoms in the starting material:\n    *   **PMB group (CH3O-C6H4-CH2-)**: 8 Carbon atoms, 9 Hydrogen atoms, 1 Oxygen atom.\n    *   **Bicyclic core**:\n        *   It contains a five-membered ring and a six-membered ring sharing two bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and a methylene bridge (C7).\n        *   Carbons (excluding substituents): C1, C3(carbonyl), C4, C5, C6, C7. This is 6 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens on the core: one H on C1, one H on C4, one H on C5, and two H's on C7. Total H on core = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hydrogens.\n        *   The double bond is between C5 and C6. The H on C6 is substituted by the CF3 group.\n        *   The nitrogen atom is at position 2, and it's bonded to the PMB group.\n        *   The carbonyl oxygen is at position 3.\n    *   **CF3 group**: 1 Carbon atom, 3 Fluorine atoms.\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material**:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 8 (from PMB) + 6 (from core) + 1 (from CF3) = 15\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 9 (from PMB) + 5 (from core) = 14\n    *   **Fluorines (F)**: 3 (from CF3)\n    *   **Nitrogens (N)**: 1 (from the lactam ring)\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 1 (from PMB) + 1 (from lactam carbonyl) = 2\n*   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 (Starting Material → Intermediate 1)**\n*   **Reagents**: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction Type**: Oxidative deprotection. CAN is a common reagent used to remove the PMB protecting group from amines and alcohols. The PMB group is oxidized and cleaved from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation**: The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1**:\n    *   (Formula of Starting Material) - C8H8O\n    *   (C15H14F3NO2) - (C8H8O) = C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 1 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 (Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2)**\n*   **Reagents**: Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction Type**: Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   **Transformation**: The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring of Intermediate 1 is reduced by adding one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2**:\n    *   (Formula of Intermediate 1) + H2\n    *   (C7H6F3NO) + (H2) = **C7H8F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 2 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 (Intermediate 2 → Product)**\n*   **Reagents**: 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction Type**: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam. A lactam is a cyclic amide. Acidic hydrolysis cleaves the amide bond (C-N bond within the ring).\n*   **Transformation**: The lactam ring is opened by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2), which would be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+) under the acidic conditions. The molecular formula is typically reported for the neutral species.\n*   **Net change**: Addition of H2O to the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   (Formula of Intermediate 2) + H2O\n    *   (C7H8F3NO) + (H2O) = C7 H(8+2) F3 N O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclopentane containing a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, and a trifluoromethyl group. The exact structure is a cis-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid derivative.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (-C8H8O): C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\n*   Step 2 (+H2): C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\n*   Step 3 (+H2O): C7H10F3NO2 (Final Product)\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
