    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image for identifiable features.** The image displays a residential property in what appears to be a rural or semi-rural setting. Key features include a beige-colored, single-story ranch-style house with a green roof, a large gravel driveway, and two large metal outbuildings (garages/sheds) also with green roofs. There is a prominent wooden utility pole in the foreground.\n\n*   **Step 2: Locate specific clues within the images.** One of the cropped images shows a close-up of the utility pole. Affixed to this pole are black numbers on a white background. The numbers are \"455\". This is most likely the street number for the property.\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the visual information and clues to find the location.** A reverse image search, combined with the house style and the number \"455\", suggests the property is in the American Midwest. The search points to a specific address.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the location using online mapping services.** By searching for the property on Google Maps, it can be confirmed that the house at 455 E 275 S in Lebanon, Indiana, matches the image exactly. The Street View perspective is identical to the provided picture, including the house, the outbuildings, the driveway, and the utility pole with the number 455.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the town and check the population criteria.** The address confirms the property is part of Lebanon, Indiana. The question requires the town to have a population of over 5,000. A quick search shows that the population of Lebanon, Indiana was approximately 16,662 as of the 2020 census, which fulfills the condition.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Answer Formulation.** The question asks for the name of the town only. Based on the verification, the town is Lebanon.\n\n<<<Lebanon>>>"
