    "This problem describes a complex acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The reaction involves dehydration followed by a series of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts, commonly known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or, more specifically in this context, a backbone rearrangement. The goal is to determine the identity (H or CH3) of five specific substituents in the final product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:\n\n**Step 1: Protonation and Dehydration**\nThe reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the reactant by the acid catalyst (HCl). This converts the -OH group into a good leaving group (-OH2+). Subsequently, water (H2O) is eliminated, forming a secondary carbocation at the carbon where the hydroxyl group was attached (let's use standard triterpenoid numbering, C3).\n\n**Step 2: Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade ([1,2] shifts)**\nThe initial secondary carbocation at C3 is relatively unstable and initiates a cascade of shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations. The positive charge migrates across the molecule's backbone. We will track the movement of the carbocation and the corresponding migration of methyl (CH3) groups and hydrogen (H) atoms. The numbered positions in the product correspond to substituents at carbons C4 (pos 1), C10 (pos 2), C5 (pos 3), C8 (pos 4), and C14 (pos 5).\n\n*   **Initial State of Key Carbons:**\n    *   C4: has two CH3 groups.\n    *   C5: has one H atom.\n    *   C10: has one CH3 group.\n    *   C8: has one CH3 group.\n    *   C14: has one CH3 group.\n    *   C13: has one H atom.\n\n*   **Rearrangement Sequence:**\n    1.  **C3(+) is formed.**\n    2.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** A methyl group migrates from C4 to C3. The carbocation moves to C4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation. C4 now has one remaining CH3 group.\n    3.  **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen atom on C5 migrates to C4. The carbocation moves to C5 (tertiary). C4 now has one CH3 group and one H atom.\n    4.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group on C10 migrates to C5. The carbocation moves to C10 (tertiary). C5 now has a CH3 group.\n    5.  **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen atom on C9 migrates to C10. The carbocation moves to C9 (tertiary). C10 now has an H atom.\n    6.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group on C8 migrates to C9. The carbocation moves to C8 (tertiary).\n    7.  **[1,2]-CH3 shift:** The methyl group on C14 migrates to C8. The carbocation moves to C14 (tertiary). C8 now has a (different) CH3 group.\n    8.  **[1,2]-H shift:** The hydrogen atom on C13 migrates to C14. The carbocation moves to C13 (tertiary). C14 now has an H atom.\n\n**Step 3: Elimination**\nThe rearrangement cascade terminates when the carbocation is at C13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent carbon C12. This forms a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, yielding the final product.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Final Substituents**\nNow we can determine the identity of the substituents at the numbered positions in the final product based on the result of the rearrangement cascade.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 started with two CH3 groups. One CH3 migrated away to C3. One H migrated in from C5. Therefore, C4 ends up with one CH3 group and one H atom. The label \"1\" points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C10):** C10 started with a CH3 group. This CH3 migrated to C5. An H atom migrated in from C9. Therefore, C10 ends up with an H atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C5):** C5 started with an H atom. This H atom migrated to C4. A CH3 group migrated in from C10. Therefore, C5 ends up with a CH3 group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C8):** C8 started with a CH3 group. This CH3 migrated to C9. Another CH3 group migrated in from C14. Therefore, C8 ends up with a CH3 group.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C14):** C14 started with a CH3 group. This CH3 migrated to C8. An H atom migrated in from C13. Therefore, C14 ends up with an H atom.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nCombining these results gives the final answer.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
