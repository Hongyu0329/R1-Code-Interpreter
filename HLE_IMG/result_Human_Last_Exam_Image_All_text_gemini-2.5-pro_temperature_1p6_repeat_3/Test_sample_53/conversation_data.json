    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image depicts a scene from ancient Greek pottery, specifically a red-figure vase. The central action involves a chariot. We can see:\n    *   A chariot drawn by at least one white horse (partially shown on the left).\n    *   Two figures within the chariot. One appears to be driving, wearing an ornate, possibly Phrygian, cap and a decorated tunic. The other figure is shrouded in drapery.\n    *   A large white wing is visible above the chariot, suggesting the presence of a winged, supernatural being (like Eros or Nike).\n    *   A nude male figure is shown in the process of falling violently from the back of the chariot. He is upside down, suggesting a fatal accident or attack.\n    *   The background features decorative palmette motifs, common on Greek vases.\n    *   At the bottom, a wave pattern (running dog or Vitruvian scroll) serves as a ground line.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the action.**\n    The primary and most dramatic action is the fall of the nude male figure. The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" most logically refers to this individual, who is exiting the chariot in a catastrophic manner.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the scene to Greek mythology.**\n    Scenes of fatal chariot accidents are a recurring theme in Greek mythology. Several myths involve a hero dying by being thrown or dragged by a chariot:\n    *   **Phaethon:** Son of Helios, he lost control of the sun chariot and was struck down by Zeus's thunderbolt, falling from the sky.\n    *   **Oenomaus:** A king who raced and killed suitors for his daughter's hand, he was eventually killed when his own chariot, sabotaged by Pelops and his charioteer Myrtilus, fell apart during a race.\n    *   **Hippolytus:** Son of Theseus, he was falsely accused by his stepmother Phaedra. His father cursed him, and the god Poseidon sent a bull from the sea to terrify Hippolytus's horses. The horses bolted, and Hippolytus became entangled in the reins and was dragged to his death.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific myth depicted.**\n    This particular vase composition is a well-known depiction of the **Death of Hippolytus**.\n    *   The falling figure is **Hippolytus**. He was a devout follower of the virgin goddess Artemis and scorned Aphrodite, the goddess of love.\n    *   His downfall was orchestrated by a vengeful Aphrodite. The figures in the chariot are sometimes identified as divine personifications related to the tragedy. For instance, the winged figure is often interpreted as **Eros** (the embodiment of destructive passion) or Lyssa (the personification of mad rage), sent to drive the horses wild. The driver figure might be a fury or another agent of the gods' will.\n    *   The scene captures the climax of the tragedy as described in Euripides' play *Hippolytus*, where a messenger reports how the hero was thrown from his chariot and killed.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the identity of the figure.**\n    Based on the iconographic evidence and the common identification of this scene in art history, the nude male figure falling from the chariot is the mythological hero Hippolytus.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
