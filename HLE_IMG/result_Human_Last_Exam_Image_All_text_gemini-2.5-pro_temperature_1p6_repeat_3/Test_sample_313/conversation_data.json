    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information and identify the key elements.**\n*   **The Person:** The man on the right, receiving the award, is the central figure. By searching for images from major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, we can identify the event as the 2019 NHL Awards (which actually took place on June 19, 2019). The man receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   **The Accomplishment:** On that night, Nikita Kucherov won several major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award for the most outstanding player. This established him as the undisputed \"top\" player in the league for the 2018-2019 season.\n*   **The Clue's Target:** The question asks for \"X Y\", which must be related to the scene depicted.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a historical use of mercury. The most famous example of this is in the felting process for making hats. Mercuric nitrate was used to treat animal furs to make them into felt. This process was toxic and caused neurological damage to the workers, known as \"hatters,\" leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Therefore, the \"X Y\" we are looking for is likely a type of hat made using this process. A prime candidate is the \"Top Hat,\" which was commonly made from felt.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the visual and textual clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a two-word term \"X Y\" that describes both the person/event in the picture and the object related to mercury.\n*   Let's test the candidate \"Top Hat\".\n    *   **Connection to the picture:** Nikita Kucherov, as the MVP and top scorer of the NHL, can be metaphorically described as the \"Top Hat\" of the hockey world for that season. He was at the pinnacle, or \"top,\" of his profession.\n    *   **Connection to the textual clue:** The classic felt \"Top Hat\" was manufactured using a process involving mercury salts. This method has been discontinued (\"ceased to be used\") because of its high toxicity.\n*   Both clues are satisfied by the term \"Top Hat\". The connection to the image is a clever play on words based on the player's status as the best in his field.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date in the question (June 20) is off by one day from the actual event date (June 19), but it's close enough to correctly identify the 2019 NHL Awards.\n*   The identity of the person (Nikita Kucherov) is crucial. His achievement as the \"top\" player provides the link.\n*   The solution relies on understanding the double meaning of \"Top Hat\": literally as an object made with a now-obsolete toxic process, and metaphorically as a person at the top of their field.\n*   Other potential leads, such as the etymology of Kucherov's name (\"coachman\") or his team name (\"Lightning\"), lead to less satisfactory connections with the textual clue. \"Top Hat\" provides the most elegant and complete solution.\n\n<<<Top Hat>>>"
