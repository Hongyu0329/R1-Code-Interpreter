The result should be interpreted as positive. The amplification curve shows a characteristic sigmoidal shape and crosses the fluorescence threshold at a Ct value of 30.8, which is below the assay's cut-off of 40 cycles. This indicates that the target sequence was present in the sample and was successfully amplified.
