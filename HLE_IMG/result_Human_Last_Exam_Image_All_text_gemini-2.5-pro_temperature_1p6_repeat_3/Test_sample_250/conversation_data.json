    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   **First Chord and Note:** The first measure starts with an F note in the melody over an \"F-\" chord symbol, which signifies F minor. This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, common for jazz standards.\n*   **Form:** The structure appears to be a 32-bar AABA form. There is an 8-bar \"A\" section that repeats (indicated by the repeat signs with 1st and 2nd endings), followed by a contrasting 8-bar \"B\" section (or bridge), and a final 8-bar \"A\" section.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic Analysis**\nThe melody has several highly distinctive features:\n1.  **Opening Phrase:** The tune starts with the notes F, C, C. This is the root note followed by the fifth, a very clear and strong opening.\n2.  **Chromatic Movement (Bars 3-4):** The most revealing part of the melody is the chromatic movement.\n    *   In measure 3, the melody moves from a B-natural (♮) down to a B-flat (♭).\n    *   In measure 4, the melody moves from a G-flat (♭) up to a G-natural (♮).\n    This sequence of specific chromatic steps is very unique and serves as a powerful identifier for the tune.\n\n**Step 3: Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression)**\n*   **\"A\" Section:** The chords are approximately `Fm | % | Eø7 Eb6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | % | Fm | C7 ||`. The progression is mostly standard for F minor, moving through chords that lead back to the tonic. The `Eø7 Eb6` measure is slightly unusual, but the movement from `Dbmaj7` to `G7` to `C7` is a common pattern leading back to F minor.\n*   **\"B\" Section (Bridge):** The bridge chords are `Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bbm7 | Eb7 | Ab | (G C7) ||`. This is a classic progression. It starts on the vi chord of F minor (`Dø7`), then cycles through dominant chords (`G7 -> C7 -> F7`), before moving to a ii-V-I (`Bbm7 - Eb7 - Ab`) in the relative major key (A♭ major). This type of bridge is famously associated with tunes like Dizzy Gillespie's \"A Night in Tunisia\" and others.\n\n**Step 4: Identification**\n*   Based on the unique melodic contour, especially the `B♮ -> B♭` and `G♭ -> G♮` chromaticism, and the combination of a minor-key \"A\" section with a \"Tunisia\"-style bridge, the piece can be confidently identified.\n*   These features are the signature characteristics of the jazz standard **\"Stablemates\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Stablemates\" is the renowned saxophonist and composer **Benny Golson**.\n\n**Step 5: Confirmation and Discrepancies**\n*   Comparing the sheet music to standard published versions of \"Stablemates\" confirms the identification. The melody is an exact match.\n*   The chord progression is also a match, though this handwritten chart contains a common variant and a likely error.\n    *   **Variant:** The bridge often uses `Cmaj7` for two bars, but the progression `C7 | F7` seen here is a very common substitution used by many jazz musicians.\n    *   **Likely Error:** In measure 3, the standard chord is `A7(b9)`. The melody notes `B♮` (the 9th of A7) moving to `B♭` (the flat-9th) fit perfectly over an `A7(b9)` chord. The `E♭-6` written in the chart is most likely a transcription error.\n\nDespite minor variations in this particular lead sheet, the core melodic and harmonic identity of the tune is unmistakably that of \"Stablemates\" by Benny Golson.\n\n<<<Title: Stablemates, Composer: Benny Golson>>>"
