    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Musical Notation:**\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, which is common for many genres.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, indicating the key is C Major or A minor. The piece starts and ends on C major chords, strongly suggesting the key is C Major.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody is characterized by its fast-paced, running sixteenth notes and significant use of syncopation (rhythms that accent the off-beats). This rhythmic complexity is a key identifier.\n    *   **Harmony:** The circled letters (C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-, A-) are chord symbols for an accompanying instrument like a guitar or piano. The chord progression is typical of popular music and includes secondary dominants (E7) and minor chords, adding harmonic interest.\n    *   **Tempo and Articulation:** While partially obscured, the tempo marking at the top appears to indicate a medium-to-fast tempo (possibly \"Moderato\" or \"Medium\"). The frequent use of slurs and staccato dots indicates a lively and articulated performance style.\n    *   **Form:** The instructions \"D.S. al Coda\" (indicated by the Segno symbol ùÑã and the \"To Coda\" ùÑå mark) along with the \"CODA\" section define the song's structure, which is common in popular and jazz music.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n    *   The most telling feature is the highly syncopated and energetic rhythm, which is a hallmark of many Latin American music genres.\n    *   The melody is virtuosic and flowing, which, combined with the harmony and rhythm, points specifically towards a Brazilian style.\n    *   The specific genre that fits this description perfectly is **Choro**. Choro is an instrumental Brazilian music genre known for its fast tempos, complex syncopation, and virtuosic improvisation. It predates and influenced Samba and Bossa Nova.\n\n3.  **Identify the Song Title and Origin:**\n    *   The melody is extremely famous and recognizable. The main melodic theme begins (in the second full system, second measure) with the notes: C, C, D, E, F, E, D, C. Before that, the characteristic opening phrase (first system, third measure) is E, E, F, G, A, G, F, E.\n    *   This melody belongs to the song **\"Tico-Tico no Fub√°\"**.\n    *   \"Tico-Tico no Fub√°\" was composed in 1917 by the Brazilian composer Zequinha de Abreu. Therefore, its country of origin is **Brazil**. The title translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal.\" The music is meant to evoke the image of a bird pecking rapidly at cornmeal.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Rhythm:** The syncopation is the primary clue pointing to a Latin style.\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression supports a popular, non-classical genre.\n*   **Melody:** The specific sequence of notes is highly recognizable.\n*   **Genre:** The combination of virtuosity, rhythm, and instrumental focus strongly indicates the Choro genre.\n*   **Origin:** Identifying the song's title allows for a definitive confirmation of its Brazilian composer and origin.\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub√°\nMusical Style: Choro\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
