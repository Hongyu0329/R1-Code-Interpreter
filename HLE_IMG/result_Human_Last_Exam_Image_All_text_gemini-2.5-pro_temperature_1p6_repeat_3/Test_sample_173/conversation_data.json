    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the time signature of the musical measure shown in the image. The time signature tells us two things: the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** This staff is rhythmically simpler, making it a good starting point.\n    *   The first note is a chord (E and B). It is a quarter note (filled note head with a stem). This is beat 1.\n    *   The second note is a B. It is also a quarter note. This is beat 2.\n    *   The third note is a C#. It is also a quarter note. This is beat 3.\n    *   The fourth note is a B. It is also a quarter note. This is beat 4.\n    *   Counting these notes, we have a total of four quarter notes in the bass clef.\n    *   Four quarter notes in a measure corresponds to a 4/4 time signature.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Top Staff):** We will now verify this finding by analyzing the more complex rhythm in the top staff. Both staves in a piece of piano music must have the same total rhythmic value within a measure.\n    *   The notes are grouped by beams. In common time, beaming often groups notes within a single beat.\n    *   **Group 1 (Beat 1):** We see a sixteenth-note chord, a sixteenth rest, and two more sixteenth notes. The total duration of these four events is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4. This is a full quarter note beat.\n    *   **Group 2 (Beat 2):** We see four sixteenth notes beamed together. The total duration is 4 x 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This is another full quarter note beat.\n    *   **Group 3 (Beat 3):** We again see four sixteenth notes beamed together. Their total duration is also 1/4. This is the third quarter note beat.\n    *   **Group 4 (Beat 4):** We see another group of four sixteenth notes. Their total duration is also 1/4. This is the fourth quarter note beat.\n    *   Adding the durations of all the groups: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4. The total duration in the treble clef is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Both the treble clef and the bass clef contain a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes. This means there are four beats in the measure, and the quarter note gets the beat. This corresponds to the time signature 4/4.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Note Values:** It is crucial to correctly identify the duration of each note and rest. Quarter notes (like in the bass clef) have a filled head and a stem. Sixteenth notes (like in the treble clef) have a filled head, a stem, and two beams (or flags). A sixteenth rest has a specific symbol with two hooks.\n*   **Beaming:** The way notes are beamed together is a strong clue to the metric structure. Grouping sixteenth notes in fours is characteristic of time signatures like 2/4, 3/4, or 4/4, where each group represents a single quarter-note beat.\n*   **Consistency Between Staves:** In piano music, the total duration of notes and rests in a single measure must be the same for both the right-hand and left-hand staves.\n*   **Evaluating Options:** Based on our count of four quarter notes per measure, we can check the answer choices.\n    *   A. 2/4 (two quarter notes) - Incorrect.\n    *   B. 3/4 (three quarter notes) - Incorrect.\n    *   C. 4/4 (four quarter notes) - Correct.\n    *   D. 3/8 (three eighth notes) - Incorrect. This is equivalent to one and a half quarter notes.\n    *   E. 9/8 (nine eighth notes) - Incorrect. This is equivalent to four and a half quarter notes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
