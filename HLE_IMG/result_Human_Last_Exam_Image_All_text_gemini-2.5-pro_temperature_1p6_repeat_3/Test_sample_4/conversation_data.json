    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Jones polynomial of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Knot Diagram**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By careful inspection of the diagram, we can count the number of times the knot crosses itself. Let's number them systematically. There are 9 crossings in this particular projection of the knot.\n2.  **Check for alternativity:** An alternating knot diagram is one in which the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as you travel along the single continuous strand. Let's trace a path. Start at the top left of the diagram, on the arc that passes over crossing C3 and then over crossing C8. Since we encounter two 'over' crossings in a row without an 'under' crossing in between, this is a non-alternating diagram.\n3.  **Calculate the writhe (w):** The writhe is the sum of the signs of all crossings. The sign of a crossing is +1 for a right-handed crossing and -1 for a left-handed crossing. We can determine the sign using the right-hand rule or by observing the rotation needed to align the under-strand with the over-strand.\n\n    Let's determine the sign for each of the 9 crossings:\n    *   C1 (bottom-left): +1\n    *   C2 (mid-left): +1\n    *   C3 (top-left): +1\n    *   C4 (top-middle): +1\n    *   C5 (top-right): -1\n    *   C6 (mid-right): -1\n    *   C7 (bottom-right): +1\n    *   C8 (center-top): +1\n    *   C9 (center-bottom): -1\n\n    Summing these signs gives the writhe:\n    w = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 6 - 3 = +3.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Knot**\n\n*   We have a non-alternating knot diagram with 9 crossings and a writhe of +3.\n*   We could look for it in knot tables among the 9-crossing knots (e.g., 9_{43}, 9_{44}, 9_{46}, 9_{47}, which have writhe ±3). However, this specific diagram is very well-known in knot theory.\n*   This diagram is the standard 9-crossing representation of the **Conway knot**. The Conway knot is actually an 11-crossing knot, meaning its minimal crossing number is 11. In the Alexander-Briggs notation, it is denoted as **11_{n34}**. The diagram shown is therefore a non-minimal projection.\n*   The fact that the minimal crossing number is 11 means this knot is not equivalent (isotopic) to any knot with 9 crossings. Therefore, we must find the polynomial for the Conway knot (11_{n34}), not a 9-crossing knot.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Jones Polynomial**\n\n*   Since the knot is identified as the Conway knot (11_{n34}), we need to find its Jones polynomial, V(t). We can look this up in reliable knot theory resources like the Knot Atlas or Wolfram MathWorld.\n*   The Jones polynomial for the Conway knot is:\n    V(t) = t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t²\n*   Our calculated writhe (w=+3) corresponds to the chirality of the knot as it is standardly presented, so we do not need to take the polynomial of the mirror image (which would involve substituting t with t⁻¹).\n\n**Step 4: Format the Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the polynomial p(t) to be formatted in decreasing degree order.\n*   Rearranging the terms of V(t):\n    p(t) = t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
