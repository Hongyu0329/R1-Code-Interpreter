    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**1. Work in the top-left corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts four stylized fish with human-like expressions, looking at a fishhook. The style is cartoonish, whimsical, and carries a sense of social commentary or humor. This distinctive style is characteristic of the renowned Chinese cartoonist Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄).\n*   **Author:** Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄).\n\n**2. Work in the top-middle:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The brushwork is confident and elegant. In the upper left corner, there is a signature and a red seal. The signature characters can be identified as \"白石\" (Báishí), which is the art name of Qi Baishi (齐白石), one of the most famous modern Chinese painters. The subject and style are consistent with his work.\n*   **Author:** Qi Baishi (齐白石).\n\n**3. Work in the top-right corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic portrait of a woman, likely from an ethnic minority group in China. The painting demonstrates mastery of Western oil painting techniques, particularly in its depiction of light, texture, and the subject's character. This style, known as Neoclassicism or Classical Realism in China, is the hallmark of Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊). This particular work is one of his well-known portraits of ethnic women.\n*   **Author:** Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊).\n\n**4. Work in the middle-left corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very expressive and uninhibited Cursive Script (草书). The characters flow into one another with energetic, almost frantic, brushstrokes. This wild and emotional style is famously associated with the Ming dynasty artist Xu Wei (徐渭), who was known for his highly individualistic and expressive approach to both painting and calligraphy.\n*   **Author:** Xu Wei (徐渭).\n\n**5. Work in the middle-center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This work combines Western abstract art elements with traditional Chinese aesthetics. It features two large circles (a red sun and an orange sun/moon) dominating the composition, placed above a landscape rendered with traditional ink wash techniques. This fusion of abstraction, geometric forms, and the spirit of Chinese landscape is the signature style of Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中), a pivotal figure in the modernization of Chinese art.\n*   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中).\n\n**6. Work in the middle-right corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is Chinese calligraphy in Regular Script (楷书), but with a very unique and recognizable style. The characters are elongated, and the strokes have a distinctive structure. The text itself is a colophon (a commentary written on a work of art). This particular calligraphic style is that of Huang Tingjian (黄庭坚), one of the Four Masters of the Song dynasty. His style is known for its tightly controlled center and radically extended outer strokes.\n*   **Author:** Huang Tingjian (黄庭坚).\n\n**7. Work in the bottom-left corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is perhaps the most famous piece of calligraphy in Chinese history. It is written in Semi-cursive Script (行书, also known as Running Script). The flow, balance, and elegance of the characters are unparalleled. This is a section from the \"Preface to the Poems Collected from the Orchid Pavilion\" (兰亭集序, Lantingji Xu). The work is universally attributed to Wang Xizhi (王羲之) of the Eastern Jin dynasty, who is revered as the \"Sage of Calligraphy.\"\n*   **Author:** Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\n**8. Work in the bottom-middle:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a hyper-realistic oil painting of a young woman with a pensive expression, set against a dark, leafy background. The technical skill is exceptional, creating a lifelike and poignant portrait. This style of Academic Realism or Classical Realism is the signature of the contemporary artist Yang Feiyun (杨飞云). This specific painting is one of his most famous works.\n*   **Author:** Yang Feiyun (杨飞云).\n\n**9. Work in the bottom-right corner:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a figure painting of a beautifully adorned woman, likely a dancer or a court lady, rendered with ink and color on paper. The lines are fluid and graceful, and the subject is idealized. The style, particularly the elegant depiction of beautiful women (仕女) and the influence from Dunhuang cave murals, is a key characteristic of the master painter Zhang Daqian (张大千). His works of this genre are highly celebrated.\n*   **Author:** Zhang Daqian (张大千).\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Qi Baishi, Jin Shangyi, Xu Wei, Wu Guanzhong, Huang Tingjian, Wang Xizhi, Yang Feiyun, Zhang Daqian>>>"
