    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the depicted process:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure in the images.**\nThe images (L, M, and N) show micrographs of a long, filamentous structure. This structure is divided into distinct compartments by cross-walls. This morphology is characteristic of a fungal hypha, with the cross-walls being septa. The internal contents appear granular, which is consistent with the cytoplasm of a living cell.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the changes occurring across the different panels.**\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively straight hypha. The cells are well-defined by the septa. An arrowhead points to a septum, which appears intact. This panel might represent a normal or initial state.\n*   **Panel M:** Shows a similar hypha, but there is a noticeable abnormality. At the location of a septum (indicated by the arrowhead), the side of the hyphal wall is bulging outwards. This suggests that the cell wall has weakened at this specific point and is failing to contain the internal pressure.\n*   **Panel N:** Depicts a more advanced stage of the process seen in panel M. The bulge at the septum (again marked by an arrowhead) is larger and more pronounced. The entire hypha is bent and distorted at this weak point.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the observations to name the process.**\nThe sequence of events illustrated by the panels—a localized weakening of the cell wall, followed by bulging under internal pressure, and progressive deformation—is the classic representation of **cell lysis** or **bursting**. In cells with a cell wall, like fungi, high internal turgor pressure pushes against the wall. If any part of the wall becomes weak, the pressure causes it to swell and eventually rupture, leading to cell death.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Subject:** The subject is a fungal hypha, not a bacterium or a plant root hair, based on its septate, filamentous structure.\n*   **Location of the event:** The bulging consistently occurs at the septa, as highlighted by the arrowheads. This indicates that the septal region is the point of weakness. This is a common phenomenon in fungal mutants with defects in cell wall integrity or after treatment with certain antifungal drugs.\n*   **The nature of the process:** This is a destructive, catastrophic event for the cell. The bulging is not a normal growth process (like branch formation, which would be more organized) but a failure of structural integrity.\n*   **Terminology:** The process is accurately described as lysis, cell bursting, or more specifically, **hyphal lysis**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe images depict the process of hyphal lysis (or bursting), where a weak spot in the fungal cell wall, located at a septum, leads to bulging and eventual rupture due to internal turgor pressure.\n\n<<<Hyphal lysis (or cell bursting)>>>"
