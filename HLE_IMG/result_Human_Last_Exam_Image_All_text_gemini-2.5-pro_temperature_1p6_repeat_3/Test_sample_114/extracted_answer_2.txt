The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the steric and electronic asymmetry of the münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. Unlike the symmetrical intermediate in Reaction 1 and 2, the proline-derived intermediate has two distinct reactive termini: a less hindered C-2 bearing a methyl group and a bulky, bridgehead C-4. This asymmetry creates a strong preference for a single orientation of cycloaddition with the asymmetric alkyne, leading to one major product. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish a crucial baseline: the isotope scrambling in Reaction 2 confirms that the münchnone from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine is symmetrical, and this symmetry results in a lack of selectivity between its two chemically equivalent termini. Therefore, the selectivity observed in Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of the asymmetry which is absent in the intermediate from Reactions 1 and 2.
