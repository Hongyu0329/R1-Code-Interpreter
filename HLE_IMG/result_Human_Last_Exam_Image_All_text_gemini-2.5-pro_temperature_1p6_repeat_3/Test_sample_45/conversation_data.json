    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the given tiling. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation about a central point. The number of times it matches is called the \"order\" or \"fold\" of the symmetry. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the components of the tiling**\nThe tiling is a repeating pattern composed of three types of polygons:\n1.  Dark blue regular hexagons.\n2.  Light yellow squares.\n3.  Orange rhombi (four-sided figures with equal sides).\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential centers of rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we must identify points in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire tiling so that it maps onto itself. We should check the centers of the various shapes and the vertices where shapes meet.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Check the center of a hexagon**\n*   Let's pick one of the dark blue hexagons and consider its center as a potential point of rotation.\n*   A regular hexagon by itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after every 60° rotation).\n*   Now, we must check if the surrounding pattern also aligns. Each side of the blue hexagon is bordered by a light yellow square.\n*   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° (360° / 6) around the center of the hexagon, the hexagon itself maps onto its original position. Each of the six surrounding squares moves into the position previously occupied by the next square. The entire pattern of surrounding shapes perfectly aligns.\n*   Therefore, the center of each blue hexagon is a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Check the center of a square**\n*   Let's pick one of the light yellow squares and consider its center.\n*   A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after every 90° rotation).\n*   Let's check the surrounding pattern. Each side of the square is bordered by a dark blue hexagon.\n*   If we rotate the tiling by 90° (360° / 4) around the center of the square, the square maps onto itself, and each of the four surrounding hexagons moves into the position of the next one. The pattern aligns perfectly.\n*   Therefore, the center of each yellow square is a center of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Check other points for lower symmetries**\n*   The pattern also has points of 2-fold rotational symmetry. For example, the center of any orange rhombus is a point of 2-fold symmetry (a 180° rotation maps the pattern onto itself). The midpoints of the edges shared by two hexagons are also centers of 2-fold rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling**\nA tiling can possess multiple types of rotational symmetry at different points. We have found centers of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a tiling, it is standard practice to state the highest order of rotational symmetry that exists within the pattern.\n\n*   The orders of rotational symmetry found are 2, 4, and 6.\n*   The highest order is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry, with the centers of rotation located at the center of each dark blue hexagon.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
