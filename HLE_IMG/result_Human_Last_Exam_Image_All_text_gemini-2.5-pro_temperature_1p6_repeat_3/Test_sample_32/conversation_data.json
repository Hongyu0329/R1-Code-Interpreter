    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the primary, most easily visible difference (\"at a glance\") between the sporophytes of two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the foot, the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains spores).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   **Seta:** The seta (the stalk supporting the capsule) of *Grimmia montana* is very short and, critically, it is **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is typically immersed (hidden among the upper leaves) or slightly emergent (peeking just above the leaves).\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** The capsule is held erect.\n*   **Observation from the image:** The image provided shows moss capsules that are sessile or on very short, straight stalks, nestled amongst the gametophyte tissues. This is consistent with the description of *Grimmia montana* or other related species with immersed capsules.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   **Seta:** The scientific name itself provides the biggest clue. \"*Curviseta*\" is Latin for \"curved seta\". The seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is distinctively and strongly **curved** or arcuate, like a hook or a swan's neck (cygneous).\n*   **Capsule Position:** The curved seta holds the capsule out and away from the leaves, so it is exserted (fully exposed).\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** Due to the curved seta, the capsule often hangs downwards or nods to the side (cernuous).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two species to find the main difference.**\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Has a **short, straight seta** resulting in an erect, immersed or emergent capsule.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Has a **long, strongly curved (arcuate) seta** resulting in an exserted, nodding capsule.\n\n**Conclusion: Identify the key distinguishing feature.**\nThe most striking and immediate difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **seta**. One is straight, and the other is strongly curved. This fundamental difference in the seta leads to very different overall appearances of the sporophyte, making them easy to tell apart when fertile.\n\n<<<The main difference that allows distinguishing the two species at a glance is the curvature of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and hang to the side or nod downwards."
