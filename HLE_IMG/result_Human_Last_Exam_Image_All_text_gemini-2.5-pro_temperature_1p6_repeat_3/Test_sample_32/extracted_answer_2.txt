The main difference that allows distinguishing the two species at a glance is the curvature of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and hang to the side or nod downwards.
