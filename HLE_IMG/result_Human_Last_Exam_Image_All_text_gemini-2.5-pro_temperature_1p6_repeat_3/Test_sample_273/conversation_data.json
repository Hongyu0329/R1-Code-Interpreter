    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular structure and chiral centers.**\n\n1.  First, let's understand the connectivity of the atoms in the skeletal structure. The vertices and ends of lines represent carbon atoms unless specified otherwise.\n    *   The structure has a central carbon chain. Let's label the carbons for clarity.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which should receive the lowest possible number in the main chain.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the -OH group has 5 carbon atoms. We number it from left to right to give the OH group the locant '2'.\n        *   C1: The methyl group at the bottom left.\n        *   C2: The carbon attached to C1, -OH, and C3.\n        *   C3: The central carbon, attached to C2, C4, and an ethyl group.\n        *   C4: The carbon attached to C3, a methyl group, and a -CH2NH2 group.\n        *   C5: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   This numbering scheme corresponds to the IUPAC name: **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\n2.  Next, identify the chiral centers (stereocenters). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **C2:** is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the molecule (-C3 group). These four groups are different, so C2 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C3:** is bonded to -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), the C2 part of the molecule, and the C4 part of the molecule. These four groups are different, so C3 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C4:** is bonded to -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the C3 part of the molecule. These four groups are different, so C4 is a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, we need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to substituents on each chiral center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\nThe priority is based on the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\n**Analysis of C2:**\n\n1.  **Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)(C4...) (Carbon attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen: (C,C,H))\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon attached to three hydrogens: (H,H,H))\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n2.  **3D Geometry:** At C2, the bond to C3 is in the plane, while the bonds to -OH and -CH3 are dashes (going into the page). To maintain tetrahedral geometry, the implicit -H atom must be on a wedge (coming out of the page).\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (4, -H) is pointing towards the viewer. We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. This path (OH → C3 → CH3) is clockwise (CW). Because the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the rule: CW corresponds to **S**.\n    *   **Configuration at C2 is (S).**\n\n**Analysis of C3:**\n\n1.  **Priorities:**\n    1.  -C2H(OH)(CH3) (C attached to O, C, H)\n    2.  -C4H(CH3)(CH2NH2) (C attached to C, C, H) -> *Tie-break with group 3: C4 is bonded to C5(N) and C(Me), while C(Et) is bonded to C(Me) and H. So C4 group > Et group.*\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl) (C attached to C, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n2.  **3D Geometry:** At C3, the bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. The ethyl group is on a wedge (front). Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a dash (back).\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (4, -H) is pointing away from the viewer. We trace the path 1 → 2 → 3. This path (C2 → C4 → Et) is counter-clockwise (CCW). Since the lowest priority group is in the back, CCW corresponds to **S**.\n    *   **Configuration at C3 is (S).**\n\n**Analysis of C4:**\n\n1.  **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (C attached to N, H, H; Nitrogen Z=7)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)(C2...) (C attached to C, C, H; Carbon Z=6)\n    3.  -CH3 (C attached to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n2.  **3D Geometry:** At C4, the bond to C3 is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (front), and the -CH3 group is on a dash (back). The implicit -H atom must lie in the plane.\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (4, -H) is in the plane. We can use the swap method. Let's swap the lowest priority group (-H) with the group pointing back (-CH3, priority 3).\n    *   In the *swapped* molecule, -H is on a dash (back), and -CH3 is in the plane.\n    *   Now, trace the path 1 → 2 → 3: -CH2NH2 → C3-group → -CH3. This path is from front → left → planar, which describes a clockwise (CW) direction.\n    *   The swapped molecule has an R configuration. Since we performed one swap, the original molecule has the opposite configuration, which is **S**.\n    *   **Configuration at C4 is (S).**\n\n**Step 3: Combine the configurations.**\n\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are C2=(S), C3=(S), and C4=(S).\n\nFinal Answer: The absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4S)>>>"
