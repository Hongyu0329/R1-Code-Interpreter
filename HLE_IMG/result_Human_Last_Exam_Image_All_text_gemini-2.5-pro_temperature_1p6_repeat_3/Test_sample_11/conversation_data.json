    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The provided image is a crop from the top-left corner of a larger picture. It displays a sequence of horizontal color bands. From top to bottom, we can identify:\n    1.  A solid black band at the top.\n    2.  A thin white horizontal stripe below the black band.\n    3.  A solid dark red band below the white stripe.\n\n*   **Step 2: Search for national flags matching this pattern.**\n    We are looking for a national flag that has, at its top, a black stripe, followed by a white stripe, and then a red stripe. This specific combination (Black-White-Red horizontal tricolor) was the flag of the German Empire (1871–1918) and the Republic of Upper Volta (1959–1984). However, these are historical entities, and \"Guess the Country\" games typically refer to current sovereign states.\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider alternative interpretations and common puzzle tricks.**\n    Since no current national flag directly matches this pattern, it's highly likely that the image has been altered to make the puzzle more challenging. A common trick is to flip or rotate the image. Let's consider a vertical flip.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the pattern after a hypothetical vertical flip.**\n    If we flip the image vertically, the order of the stripes from top to bottom would be:\n    1.  Red\n    2.  White\n    3.  Black\n    This Red-White-Black horizontal tricolor is a very common design, known as the Arab Liberation Flag.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the country using the flipped pattern.**\n    Several countries use the Red-White-Black horizontal stripe pattern:\n    *   **Yemen:** Its flag is a simple Red-White-Black tricolor with no other symbols.\n    *   **Egypt:** Its flag is a Red-White-Black tricolor with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   **Syria:** Its flag is a Red-White-Black tricolor with two green stars in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   **Iraq:** The current flag is Red-White-Black with \"Allahu Akbar\" written in green Kufic script on the white stripe.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final determination.**\n    The image shows a corner piece of the flag with only plain color stripes and no part of any central emblem (like an eagle or stars). While this corner view would be identical for Egypt, Syria, and Yemen, the simplest and most fundamental version of this flag design belongs to Yemen. In such puzzles, when no emblem is visible, the answer is typically the country with the plain version of the flag. Therefore, the original flag is that of Yemen, presented upside down as a trick.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
