    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observations**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, also known as common time.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate speed (Andante).\n*   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, indicating the key of C major or its relative, A minor. However, the heavy use of accidentals (F#, C#, G#, D# etc.) suggests the piece modulates frequently or is written in a different key with accidentals used instead of a key signature. The first full measure is centered around a G major chord.\n*   **Dynamics:** There are very stark dynamic contrasts. The piece begins `p` (piano, soft), then suddenly jumps to `f` (forte, loud) in measure 3. It then shifts to `mp` (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) and `mf` (mezzo-forte, moderately loud). This wide dynamic range is characteristic of Romantic-era music.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Musical Content**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, quiet melody in the right hand (B-C-D-E-D-C-B) over a sustained G major harmony in the left hand. This section serves as a calm introduction.\n*   **Measure 3:** There is an abrupt and dramatic change in character. The dynamic shifts to `f`, and the texture becomes much denser and more technically demanding. Both hands play fast, broken chords and octaves in a descending pattern. This kind of virtuosic, showy passage is a hallmark of composers like Franz Liszt.\n*   **The \"Friska\" Theme:** The theme starting in measure 3 is extremely famous. This energetic, driving, and folk-like theme is the core of the piece's identity. This section is often referred to as the \"friska\" (fresh/fast part) in the context of Hungarian folk music styles like the Cs치rd치s.\n*   **Measures 4-11:** The music continues with variations and developments of this fast, virtuosic material. We see complex chordal passages, fast runs, and broken octave patterns, all reinforcing the energetic and brilliant character established in measure 3. The passage in measure 11 with the fast upward arpeggio is also a very typical Lisztian flourish.\n\n**Step 3: Identification**\n*   The combination of a slow, improvisatory-sounding introduction (like the *lassan* section of a Cs치rd치s) followed by a wildly energetic and famous fast section (*friska*) is the defining structure of **Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2**.\n*   While the key in this arrangement has been simplified (likely to G major/A minor for ease of playing), the themes, textures, and overall character are unmistakable. The theme starting at measure 3 is one of the most recognized melodies in classical music, famously used in cartoons like \"The Cat Concerto\" (Tom and Jerry) and \"Rhapsody Rabbit\" (Bugs Bunny).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe musical excerpt is a simplified arrangement for piano of the famous **Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2** by **Franz Liszt**.\n\n<<<Franz Liszt - Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2>>>"
