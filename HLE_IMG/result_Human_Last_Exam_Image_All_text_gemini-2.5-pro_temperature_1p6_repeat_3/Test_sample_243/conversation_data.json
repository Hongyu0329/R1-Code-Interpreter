    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the plant's features:** The image displays a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key characteristics are:\n    *   **Leaf color and pattern:** The leaves are dark green.\n    *   **Venation:** They have a very prominent and intricate network of lighter, creamy-white or pale green veins. This is known as reticulate or netted venation.\n    *   **Leaf shape:** The leaves are elliptical to lanceolate (lance-shaped).\n    *   **Leaf arrangement:** At the tips of the stems, the leaves are arranged in a whorl (radiating from a single point). In the main picture, a whorl of four leaves is clearly visible at the center.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant species:** The combination of whorled leaves and the unique netted venation strongly points to a specific plant. While some other plants have netted veins (like *Fittonia*, or virally infected plants), the overall look (shrub-like habit, leaf shape) matches a plant known as *Geniostoma ligustrifolium*. More specifically, it perfectly matches the variety *Geniostoma ligustrifolium* var. *crassum*. This variety is famous for this exact leaf pattern.\n\n3.  **Determine the endemic location:** The question asks for the name of the island where this plant was endemic. Research on *Geniostoma ligustrifolium* var. *crassum* reveals that it is endemic to a very specific location.\n    *   The species *Geniostoma ligustrifolium* is native to New Zealand.\n    *   The variety *crassum*, seen in the picture, is endemic exclusively to the **Three Kings Islands** (Māori: Manawatāwhi), a small group of islands located about 55 km northwest of the North Island of New Zealand.\n\n4.  **Address the phrasing of the question:** The question asks for \"the island\" (singular), while the plant is endemic to an island *group*. However, \"Three Kings Islands\" is the proper name of this specific, isolated geographical location. The use of the past tense \"was endemic\" is also fitting, as the plant was once found only there but is now widely propagated in gardens for its ornamental value.\n\n5.  **Final conclusion:** Based on the visual identification of the plant as *Geniostoma ligustrifolium* var. *crassum*, its endemic home is the Three Kings Islands.\n\n<<<Three Kings Islands>>>"
