    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nIn an FCC crystal structure, atoms are located at the eight corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe direction [110] in a cubic system corresponds to a vector pointing from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a, a, 0), where 'a' is the lattice constant. Viewing the crystal along this direction means we are projecting all the atomic positions onto a plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Projected Atomic Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen an FCC lattice is viewed along the [110] direction, the atoms are seen to be arranged in a specific 2D pattern. Let's analyze the atomic planes perpendicular to the [110] direction.\n1.  The atoms in an FCC lattice form layers of planes. The planes perpendicular to the [110] direction are the (110) planes.\n2.  These (110) planes are not all identical in their atomic arrangement. They stack in an alternating sequence, let's call it ...ABAB...\n3.  The atoms within each 'A' plane form a simple rectangular grid.\n4.  The atoms within each 'B' plane also form a simple rectangular grid, identical to the 'A' plane's grid.\n5.  However, the 'B' planes are shifted relative to the 'A' planes. Specifically, the atoms in the 'B' plane are located directly above the centers of the rectangles formed by the atoms in the 'A' plane.\n6.  When we project these stacked planes onto a single 2D plane (as we do when viewing along the [110] direction), the two patterns are superimposed. The result is a pattern with atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an additional atom in the center of that rectangle. This pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Options**\nNow, let's examine each of the four images to see which one displays a centered rectangular pattern. The images show a small 3D volume of the lattice, and we need to consider the projection of all the atoms within the depicted volume onto the viewing plane (the plane of the image).\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are two layers visible (front and back), but when projected, they form a denser simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the center of the rectangles formed by other atoms. This pattern is not a centered rectangle. (It resembles a BCC structure viewed along [100]).\n\n*   **Image D:** This image displays a pattern with distinct hexagonal symmetry. The atoms are arranged in a honeycomb-like or hexagonal fashion. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction, or an HCP lattice viewed along its c-axis [0001]. This is not a centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atomic arrangement is complex and does not form a simple or centered rectangular pattern. One can outline a rectangle with four atoms, but the other atoms are not located at its center. This does not match the expected pattern.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image clearly shows the features of a centered rectangular lattice. We can identify a rectangle formed by four atoms (two on the top edge and two on the bottom edge of the central rectangular group). Critically, there is an atom located in the center of this rectangle. The atoms are shown on different planes (indicated by size and shading/depth cues), consistent with the ABAB stacking of (110) planes. Although the rectangle in the diagram appears to be nearly a square (aspect ratio ~1), in textbooks and schematic illustrations, the topological correctness (i.e., being a \"centered rectangle\") is more important than the exact geometric aspect ratio (which should theoretically be √2 ≈ 1.414). Among the choices, this is the only one that represents a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a centered rectangular pattern. Image B is the only option that shows this specific atomic arrangement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
