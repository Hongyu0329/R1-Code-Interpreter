    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between two chemical molecules and find the correct type of isomerism.\n\n**Careful Points and General Strategy**\n\nTo determine the relationship between two molecules, we follow a systematic process:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** First, count the number of each type of atom (e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen) in both molecules.\n    *   If the molecular formulas are different, the molecules are not isomers. They are different compounds entirely.\n    *   If the molecular formulas are the same, they are isomers of some type, and you proceed to the next step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Connectivity:** Next, examine the way the atoms are connected to each other (the bonding sequence).\n    *   If the connectivity is different, the molecules are **constitutional isomers** (also called structural isomers). For example, butane (a straight chain of 4 carbons) and isobutane (a branched chain of 4 carbons) have the same formula (C₄H₁₀) but different connectivity.\n    *   If the connectivity is the same, you proceed to the next step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Spatial Arrangement:** If the molecules have the same formula and connectivity, their relationship depends on their three-dimensional arrangement.\n    *   **Identical:** Try to superimpose one molecule onto the other by rotating it in space (without breaking any bonds). If they are perfectly superimposable, they are **identical** molecules.\n    *   **Stereoisomers:** If they are not superimposable, they are stereoisomers. We then need to distinguish between two main types of stereoisomers:\n        *   **Conformational Isomers (Conformers):** These are stereoisomers that can be interconverted simply by rotating around single bonds. A classic example is the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of cyclohexane. They are different shapes of the *same* molecule that are in rapid equilibrium.\n        *   **Configurational Isomers:** These are stereoisomers that *cannot* be interconverted by bond rotation; bonds must be broken and reformed. This category includes enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images). When \"stereoisomers\" is presented as an option distinct from \"conformers,\" it usually refers to these configurational isomers.\n\n**Analysis of the Specific Problem**\n\nThe image provided in the question is black and does not show any molecules. Therefore, it is impossible to directly apply the steps above.\n\nHowever, this type of question is very common in chemistry, and it is highly likely that the missing image was intended to show a classic example of isomerism. A frequent and fundamental example used to illustrate the difference between isomer types is the pair of molecules **butane** and **2-methylpropane (isobutane)**.\n\nLet's assume these were the molecules in the image and apply our analysis:\n\n*   **Molecule 1:** Butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃)\n*   **Molecule 2:** 2-Methylpropane (isobutane) (CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃)\n\n1.  **Step 1: Molecular Formula**\n    *   Butane has 4 carbon atoms and 3+2+2+3 = 10 hydrogen atoms. Formula: C₄H₁₀.\n    *   2-Methylpropane has 4 carbon atoms and 3+1+3+3 = 10 hydrogen atoms. Formula: C₄H₁₀.\n    *   The molecular formulas are identical. They are isomers.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Connectivity**\n    *   In butane, the carbons are connected in a continuous, unbranched chain.\n    *   In 2-methylpropane, the carbon chain is branched. The connectivity is different.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the two molecules have the same molecular formula (C₄H₁₀) but different atom connectivity, they are **constitutional isomers**. This corresponds to option (b).\n\n<<<B>>>"
