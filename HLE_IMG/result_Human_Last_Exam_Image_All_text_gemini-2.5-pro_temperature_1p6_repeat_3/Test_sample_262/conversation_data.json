    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. A shorter lifetime corresponds to lower chemical or photochemical stability, leading to faster degradation of the complex during device operation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures:** The four structures are all cationic octahedral Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structural motif: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `(C^N)` represents a cyclometalating ligand and `(N^N)` represents a bidentate ancillary ligand.\n    *   **Metal Center:** The central metal is Iridium(III) in all four complexes.\n    *   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes have the same ancillary ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is constant across all complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their relative stabilities.\n    *   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the nature of their two cyclometalating C^N ligands. These ligands are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine. The Iridium is bonded to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring, forming a five-membered chelate ring. The stability of these complexes is critically dependent on the strength of the Ir-C bond.\n\n3.  **Relate Ligand Substitution to Complex Stability:** A well-established strategy to enhance the stability and lifetime of such Iridium complexes is the fluorination of the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand.\n    *   **Electronic Effect of Fluorine:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When substituted onto the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect.\n    *   **Effect on Bond Strength:** This electron withdrawal from the phenyl ring strengthens the carbon-metal (Ir-C) bond. A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more resistant to bond cleavage, which is a common degradation pathway under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation.\n    *   **General Principle:** Consequently, a higher degree of fluorination on the C^N ligands generally leads to a more stable complex and a longer device lifetime. Conversely, ligands with fewer or no fluorine substituents will form less stable complexes with shorter lifetimes.\n\n4.  **Compare the C^N Ligands in Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Contains two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligands. Each ligand has two fluorine atoms. This complex is homoleptic with respect to its C^N ligands and is expected to be quite stable.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Contains one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (two fluorine atoms) and one 2-phenylpyridine ligand (zero fluorine atoms). The presence of the un-fluorinated ligand is a significant point of weakness. The Ir-C bond to this ligand will be substantially weaker than those in fluorinated analogues. This makes Complex 2 highly susceptible to degradation.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Contains one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (two fluorine atoms) and one 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (one fluorine atom). While the monofluorinated ligand is more stable than the un-fluorinated one in Complex 2, it is less stable than the difluorinated ligand. This complex is also expected to be less stable than one containing only di- or tri-fluorinated ligands.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Contains two 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine ligands. Each ligand has three fluorine atoms. This complex has the highest degree of fluorination and is therefore expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime of the four.\n\n5.  **Rank the Complexes by Expected Lifetime:** Based on the degree of fluorination of the least stable C^N ligand in each complex, we can predict the order of stability (and therefore lifetime) from longest to shortest:\n    **Longest Lifetime** <-- **Complex 4** (trifluorinated) > **Complex 1** (difluorinated) > **Complex 3** (contains a monofluorinated ligand) > **Complex 2** (contains an un-fluorinated ligand) --> **Shortest Lifetime**\n\n6.  **Identify Complexes with \"Shorter Lifetimes\":** The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter\" lifetimes. This is a relative comparison. Compared to the highly stable complexes 1 and 4, complexes 2 and 3 possess \"weaker links\" in the form of less-fluorinated (or un-fluorinated) ligands. Therefore, Complex 2 and Complex 3 are the ones expected to exhibit shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The presence of an un-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand in Complex 2 and a mono-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand in Complex 3 makes them less stable than the fully difluorinated Complex 1 and the fully trifluorinated Complex 4. Thus, complexes [2] and [3] are expected to have shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The stability of organometallic complexes used in OLEDs/LECs is often dominated by the strength of the metal-carbon bond.\n*   Electron-withdrawing groups, like fluorine, on the cyclometalating phenyl ring strengthen the M-C bond and increase complex stability.\n*   The lifetime of a heteroleptic complex (like 2 and 3) is often limited by the stability of its least stable ligand.\n*   The term \"shorter lifetimes\" is relative. We are looking for the least stable compounds within the provided set.\n*   Complex 2 is expected to have the shortest lifetime, and Complex 3 is expected to have the second shortest lifetime.\n\nFinal Answer based on the analysis is the combination of Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n<<<H>>>"
