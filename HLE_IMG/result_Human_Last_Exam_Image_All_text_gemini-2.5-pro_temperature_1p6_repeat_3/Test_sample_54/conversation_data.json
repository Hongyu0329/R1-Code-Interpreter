    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Analysis of the first reaction (Formation of compound 2)**\n\n1.  **Identify the structures of reactant 1 and product 2.**\n    *   Compound **1** is a large, polycyclic aromatic cation containing oxygen atoms in ether-like bridges. The overall structure, although drawn in a complex way, is analogous to a xanthenylium salt, which is a derivative of a pyrylium salt. Pyrylium salts are six-membered aromatic rings containing a positively charged oxygen atom.\n    *   Compound **2** is the product formed from **1**. By comparing its structure to **1**, we can see that one of the oxygen-containing bridges has been replaced by a nitrogen-containing bridge. Specifically, a `C-O-C` linkage from the pyrylium-like system in **1** has been converted to a `C-N(NH₂)-C` linkage in **2**. The resulting structure is an N-aminoacridinium salt, which is an analogue of an N-aminopyridinium salt.\n\n2.  **Determine Reagent A.**\n    *   The transformation from a pyrylium/xanthenylium salt (**1**) to an N-aminopyridinium/N-aminoacridinium salt (**2**) is a known class of reactions in heterocyclic chemistry.\n    *   This conversion is achieved by reacting the oxygen-containing heterocycle with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂).\n    *   The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by the hydrazine on the electrophilic ring, leading to ring-opening, followed by cyclization and dehydration to form the new nitrogen-containing aromatic ring. One of the nitrogen atoms of hydrazine is incorporated into the ring, and the other remains as an amino (`-NH₂`) substituent on that nitrogen.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent A is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n    *   *Careful point:* The drawing of compound **2** also shows an additional `NH` bridge, which might suggest a more complex reaction or a mistake in the drawing. However, the formation of the key `>N-NH₂` group is the most characteristic transformation, strongly indicating hydrazine as the reagent.\n\n**Analysis of the second reaction (Formation of compound 3)**\n\n1.  **Identify the structures of reactant 2 and product 3.**\n    *   Compound **2** is the N-aminoacridinium salt formed in the first step. Its key functional group is the N-amino moiety (`>N-NH₂`).\n    *   Compound **3** is the final product. Comparing its structure to **2**, the most significant change is at the same nitrogen atom. The `>N-NH₂` group in **2** has been replaced by an `>N-propyl` group (`>N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) in **3**.\n\n2.  **Determine Reagent B.**\n    *   We need a reagent that can replace the `-NH₂` group on the ring nitrogen with a `-CH₂CH₂CH₃` (propyl) group.\n    *   A simple alkylating agent like propyl iodide would typically alkylate an NH group, not perform this type of substitution on a quaternary, positively charged nitrogen atom.\n    *   A reagent like propionaldehyde would react with the amino group to form a hydrazone (`>N-N=CH-Et`), but the subsequent steps to form an N-propyl group are not direct.\n    *   A plausible chemical reaction that accomplishes this transformation is the **Zincke reaction**. In the Zincke reaction, a pyridinium salt bearing a leaving group on the nitrogen reacts with a primary amine (R-NH₂). The process involves nucleophilic attack by the amine, ring-opening, and then re-cyclization to form a new pyridinium salt where the nitrogen is now substituted with the alkyl group (R) from the attacking amine. The original N-substituent is expelled.\n    *   In this case, the N-aminoacridinium salt (**2**) acts as the Zincke substrate, and the amino group (`-NH₂`) is the leaving group (it leaves as hydrazine). To introduce a propyl group, the reagent must be **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent B is **propylamine**.\n    *   *Careful point:* The reaction scheme also shows the loss of several methoxy groups between **2** and **3**. This demethylation can be a side reaction occurring under the conditions (e.g., elevated temperature) often required for the Zincke reaction, especially in the presence of an amine.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is responsible for converting the oxygen-containing heterocycle (**1**) to an N-amino derivative (**2**). This points to **hydrazine**.\n*   **Reagent B** is responsible for replacing the N-amino group of **2** with an N-propyl group to form **3**. This points to **propylamine** via a Zincke reaction.\n\nFinal Answer Identification:\n*   Reagent A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)\n*   Reagent B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is Propylamine>>>"
