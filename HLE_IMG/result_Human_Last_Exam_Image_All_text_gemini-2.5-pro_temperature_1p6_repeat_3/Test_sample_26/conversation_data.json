    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The piece is in the key of C minor, which has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This is the tonic key we use as a reference for the analysis.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The measure is clearly marked on the score. It is the third measure on the second system of the page.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in the Measure:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays D octaves. The lowest and most prominent note, which determines the bass of the harmony, is D.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays four notes over the course of the measure: F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n\n4.  **Assemble and Spell the Chord:** Combining all the notes present in the measure, we have the following pitch collection, with D in the bass: D - F♯ - A - C - E♭.\n\n5.  **Determine the Chord's Root, Quality, and Inversion:**\n    *   Let's stack the notes in thirds starting from the bass note, D.\n    *   **D** (Root)\n    *   **F♯** (Major Third above D)\n    *   **A** (Perfect Fifth above D)\n    *   **C** (Minor Seventh above D)\n    *   These four notes (D-F♯-A-C) form a **D dominant seventh chord (D7)**.\n    *   The remaining note is **E♭**. The interval from the root D up to E♭ is a minor ninth.\n    *   Therefore, the full chord is a **D dominant seventh with a flatted ninth**, written as **D7(♭9)**.\n    *   Since the root of the chord (D) is in the bass, the chord is in **root position**.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Chord's Function within the Harmonic Context:**\n    *   To understand what this chord *does*, we need to see where it is going. The chord in the next measure (measure 31) is a **G7 chord** (G in the bass, with G, B♭, D, F in the right hand).\n    *   The D7 chord naturally resolves to a G chord (either major or minor). In music theory, a chord that functions as the dominant of another chord (that isn't the tonic) is called a **secondary dominant**.\n    *   In our home key of C minor, the G chord is the **dominant (V)**.\n    *   The chord in measure 30, D7(♭9), is functioning as the dominant of G. Therefore, its function is the \"dominant of the dominant\".\n\n7.  **Write the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for the dominant chord is **V**.\n    *   The Roman numeral for the \"dominant of the dominant\" is written as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n    *   To be more precise and include the quality of the chord (a dominant seventh with a flatted ninth), the full Roman numeral is **V⁷(♭9)/V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Accidentals are Key:** The F♯ is an accidental and is crucial for identifying the chord as a dominant seventh (D7) rather than a diminished chord. A major third is characteristic of a dominant chord.\n*   **Secondary Dominants:** This passage is a classic example of using secondary dominants to create harmonic tension and lead strongly to a chord other than the tonic. The V/V chord intensifies the arrival of the V chord.\n*   **Chord Extensions:** The E♭ is not a simple non-chord tone; it is a chord extension (the ♭9) that adds color and tension to the dominant function.\n*   **Context is Everything:** Analyzing a single chord in isolation can be misleading. Looking at the preceding and, most importantly, the following chords is essential to correctly identify its function. The resolution to G7 in measure 31 confirms the function of the D7(♭9) chord.\n\n<<<V⁷(♭9)/V>>>"
