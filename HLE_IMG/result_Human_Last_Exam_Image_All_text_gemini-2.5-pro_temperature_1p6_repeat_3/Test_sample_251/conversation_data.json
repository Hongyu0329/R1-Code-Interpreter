    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ECG Calibration**\nThe information provided at the top left of the ECG, \"25 mm/sec; 1 cm/mV\", gives us the standard calibration settings. The crucial part for measuring time is the paper speed:\n*   **Paper Speed:** 25 mm/sec. This means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Time per Grid Square**\nThe ECG paper is marked with a grid of small and large squares.\n*   **Small Square (1 mm):** Time = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n*   **Large Square (5 mm):** Time = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\nSo, to find the duration of an interval, we can count the number of large squares and multiply by 0.2 seconds.\n\n**Step 3: Visually Scan for the Longest R-R Interval**\nWe need to examine the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R waves (the prominent upward spikes).\n*   The ECG shows several rows of a continuous rhythm. For the most part, the rhythm is regular, with the R-R intervals being fairly consistent.\n*   Upon inspection, a distinct long pause is visible on the fourth row of the tracing, which begins near the timestamp `0:06:08`. This gap between two QRS complexes is visibly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n**Step 4: Measure the Longest Interval in Grid Squares**\nNow, we will focus on this long pause and measure its duration by counting the grid squares between the peaks of the R waves that border it.\n*   Locate the peak of the R wave just before the long pause.\n*   Locate the peak of the R wave that terminates the long pause.\n*   By counting the large squares between these two peaks, we can see that the interval spans almost exactly **7 large squares**.\n    *   We can confirm this by aligning the peak of the first R wave with a vertical line on the grid and counting across to the peak of the second R wave. The distance aligns very closely with 7 large grid blocks.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the Measurement to Seconds**\nUsing the value calculated in Step 2, we can convert the measurement from large squares into seconds.\n*   Longest R-R Interval = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n*   Longest R-R Interval = 7 large squares × 0.2 seconds/large square\n*   Longest R-R Interval = **1.4 seconds**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe longest R-R interval is located in the fourth rhythm strip and measures 7 large squares, which corresponds to a duration of 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
