    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the sheet music.**\n    The image is a page from an orchestral score. We can see parts for several instruments.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the instruments.**\n    The instruments listed are:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten / 2 Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (Erste Oboe / 1st Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (Englisches Horn / English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (Erstes Fagott / 1st Bassoon)\n    *   `I. Viol.` (Erste Violine / 1st Violins), divided into `1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, and `(die übrigen)`\n    *   `II. Viol.` (Zweite Violine / 2nd Violins)\n    *   `Solo Br.` (Solo Bratsche / Solo Viola) and `(die übrigen)` Br. (the rest of the violas)\n    *   `Celli` (Cellos), divided into `1. Pult` and `(die übrigen)`\n    This indicates a large, late-Romantic orchestra.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the text and musical directions.**\n    *   The instrument names and other text are in German. For example, `gr.` for `große`, `engl.` for `Englisches`, `(die übrigen)` for \"the rest,\" and `(mit Dämpfer)` for \"with mute.\" This strongly suggests a German or Austrian composer.\n    *   A very important clue is the text `1 (Vorhang)` above the staff for the first violins. `Vorhang` is the German word for \"curtain.\" This indicates that at rehearsal mark 1, the curtain rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act. This music is therefore the prelude to Act II.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the musical content.**\n    *   The music is highly chromatic and tonally ambiguous, characteristic of late-Romanticism.\n    *   The most prominent and recognizable musical feature is the frantic, ascending passage in the first violins (1. Pult). The notes are B, C-sharp, D-sharp, E, F-sharp, G-sharp. This theme continues to ascend rapidly.\n    *   The overall character is one of agitation, excitement, and anticipation. It begins quietly (`p`, `pp`) and quickly builds to `mf` (mezzo-forte).\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize the clues and identify the work.**\n    *   We are looking for a German opera from the late-Romantic period.\n    *   The music is the prelude to Act II, starting as the curtain rises.\n    *   The agitated, rapidly ascending chromatic theme in the violins is the most distinctive element.\n    *   This specific theme is famously the opening of the prelude to Act II of Richard Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde*. The music perfectly depicts the feverish anticipation of Isolde as she waits for Tristan. All other details—the orchestration, the German markings, and the dramatic context—align with this identification.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The piece of music is the opening of Act II of the opera *Tristan und Isolde* by Richard Wagner.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
