    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the artwork's features**\nThe image displays a circular bas-relief, also known as a tondo. The medium appears to be sculpted, likely from marble, stone, or glazed terracotta, given the smooth finish and the era it seems to represent. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, with naturalistic figures, flowing drapery, and a clear, balanced composition.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the subject matter and inscription**\nThe scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest, standing on the left by an altar with a candle, is giving communion to a group of five kneeling figures (a child, two men in clerical or monastic robes, and two women). This sacrament is the Eucharist, or Holy Communion. Below the scene, within the tondo's frame, there is an inscription on a scroll-like banner that reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be translated from a mix of Latin and early Italian/French as \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is another name for the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the style to a specific artistic school or artist**\nThe sculptural style, particularly the combination of graceful figural representation with a decorative, often colored (though here seen in black and white), glazed finish, is a hallmark of the della Robbia family workshop in Florence. This workshop, founded by Luca della Robbia, was famous for its tin-glazed terracotta sculptures throughout the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\n**Step 4: Search for the specific artwork**\nA search combining the key elements—\"della Robbia,\" \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" \"tondo,\" and \"altarpiece\"—leads to a specific work: the *Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments*. This altarpiece contains seven tondi, each representing one of the sacraments.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the specific detail and its author**\nThe tondo in the photograph is a perfect match for the tondo representing the Eucharist in the *Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments*. This altarpiece is located in the church of Santi Fabiano e Sebastiano in Fognano (a hamlet of Brisighella), Italy. Art historians attribute this work to **Andrea della Robbia**, the nephew of Luca della Robbia and a master sculptor who took over the family workshop.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe detail is from the *Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments*, and its author is the renowned Italian Renaissance sculptor Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
