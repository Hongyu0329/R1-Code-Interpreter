    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the problem and the goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The circuit contains resistors and a single capacitor, forming an RC filter. The cutoff frequency of an RC filter is the frequency at which the circuit's response has dropped to a certain level, typically -3dB. For a simple low-pass RC filter, the angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $C$ is the capacitance and $R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\nIn our circuit, the capacitor $C$ is connected between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). Therefore, to find the cutoff frequency, we must first determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, of the infinite ladder network as seen from node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\n**2. Calculating the Thévenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to:\n1.  De-activate the independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source connected at node $c_0$. De-activating it means setting its voltage to zero, which is equivalent to shorting node $c_0$ to ground.\n2.  Calculate the equivalent resistance seen from node $a_0$ looking into the network.\n\nLet's denote the node $a_0$ as $d_0$ for consistency with the labeling of the ladder rungs ($d_1, d_2, ...$). So we need to find the resistance from $d_0$ to ground, with $c_0$ also connected to ground. We can use nodal analysis to solve this problem.\n\n**3. Setting up the Nodal Analysis Equations**\nLet $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltage potentials at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively, for $n \\ge 0$.\nThe network is an infinite ladder of repeating sections for $n \\ge 1$. For any interior node $c_n$ (with $n \\ge 1$), the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equation is:\n$\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{d,n}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n+1}}{r} = 0$\nMultiplying by $r$, we get:\n$3V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1} - V_{dn} - V_{c,n+1} = 0$ (Eq. 1)\n\nSimilarly, for any interior node $d_n$ (with $n \\ge 1$), the KCL equation is:\n$\\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{c,n}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n+1}}{r} = 0$\n$3V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1} - V_{cn} - V_{d,n+1} = 0$ (Eq. 2)\n\nThis is a system of coupled second-order linear homogeneous difference equations.\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\nWe look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A \\cdot k^n$ and $V_{dn} = B \\cdot k^n$. Substituting this into the equations gives a characteristic equation for $k$:\n$(k^2 - 3k + 1)^2 - k^2 = 0$\nThis equation yields four roots for $k$: $k=1$ (double root), $k = 2+\\sqrt{3}$, and $k=2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor the voltages to remain bounded as $n \\to \\infty$, we must discard the solution $k=2+\\sqrt{3} > 1$. The general solution is a linear combination of the decaying mode $k_d = 2-\\sqrt{3}$ and the constant mode $k=1$.\nFor the $k_d$ mode, it can be shown that $A=-B$. For the $k=1$ mode, $A=B$.\nSo the general solution form is:\n$V_{cn} = P \\cdot (k_d)^n + Q$\n$V_{dn} = -P \\cdot (k_d)^n + Q$\nwhere $P$ and $Q$ are constants determined by boundary conditions.\n\n**5. Applying Boundary Conditions to find $R_{th}$**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at $d_0$, we imagine injecting a current $I_0$ at node $d_0$ and calculating the resulting voltage $V_{d0}$. Then $R_{th} = V_{d0} / I_0$. The other boundary condition is that node $c_0$ is grounded, so $V_{c0} = 0$.\n\n*   **Boundary Condition at $c_0$**:\n    Using the general solution at $n=0$: $V_{c0} = P \\cdot (k_d)^0 + Q = P + Q$.\n    Since $V_{c0}=0$, we have $P+Q=0$, which means $Q=-P$.\n    The solutions become:\n    $V_{cn} = P((k_d)^n - 1)$\n    $V_{dn} = -P((k_d)^n + 1)$\n\n*   **Finding $R_{th}$**:\n    The voltage at node $d_0$ is $V_{d0} = -P((k_d)^0 + 1) = -2P$.\n    The injected current $I_0$ at node $d_0$ must flow through the resistor connecting $d_0$ to $d_1$. So, by KCL at $d_0$:\n    $I_0 = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{d1}}{r}$\n    We have $V_{d1} = -P((k_d)^1 + 1) = -P(k_d+1)$.\n    $I_0 = \\frac{-2P - (-P(k_d+1))}{r} = \\frac{-2P + Pk_d + P}{r} = \\frac{P(k_d-1)}{r}$\n    Now we can calculate $R_{th}$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{I_0} = \\frac{-2P}{P(k_d-1)/r} = \\frac{-2r}{k_d-1}$\n    Substituting $k_d = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{-2r}{(2-\\sqrt{3})-1} = \\frac{-2r}{1-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\n    To simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(\\sqrt{3}+1)$\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thévenin equivalent resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$\n\nIf the question implies the cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz, the relationship is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$.\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$\nTypically, when expressed in terms of circuit components without specifying units, the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is provided.\n\n<<<1/(rC(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
