    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the total current flowing out of the voltage source V2. This is often called the total circuit current. According to Ohm's Law, the total current (I_total) is the total voltage (V_total) divided by the total equivalent resistance (R_total) of the circuit.\n    *   I_total = V_total / R_total\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Layout:**\n    *   We have a 1V DC voltage source (V2).\n    *   The circuit consists of two main branches connected in parallel to the voltage source.\n    *   The left branch contains resistors R1, R2, and R3.\n    *   The right branch contains resistors R7 and R8.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Right Branch:**\n    *   Resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω) are connected in series.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of this branch (R_right_eq) is the sum of their individual resistances.\n    *   R_right_eq = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Left Branch:**\n    *   This branch contains R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n    *   The connections in this branch are not a simple series arrangement. We must carefully trace the wires.\n    *   Let's label the top wire (connected to the positive terminal of V2) as Node A, and the bottom wire (connected to ground) as Node B. The voltage at Node A is 1V, and the voltage at Node B is 0V.\n    *   There is a wire connecting Node A directly to the point between resistor R2 and resistor R3. Let's call this point Node D.\n    *   Because of this direct wire connection, Node D is at the same potential as Node A. So, the voltage at Node D is also 1V.\n    *   Now, let's look at the components:\n        *   Resistor R3 is connected between Node D (1V) and Node B (0V). Therefore, the voltage across R3 is 1V - 0V = 1V. R3 will draw current.\n        *   Resistors R1 and R2 are connected in series with each other. This series combination is connected between Node A (1V) and Node D (1V).\n        *   The voltage across the R1-R2 series combination is the potential difference between Node A and Node D, which is 1V - 1V = 0V.\n        *   According to Ohm's law (I = V/R), if the voltage across a component is zero, the current flowing through it is also zero. Therefore, no current flows through R1 and R2. They are effectively bypassed or shorted out of the circuit's current calculation.\n    *   Thus, for the purpose of calculating current, the left branch behaves as if it only contains resistor R3.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of the left branch (R_left_eq) is 9 Ω.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_total):**\n    *   The simplified left branch (R_left_eq = 9 Ω) and the right branch (R_right_eq = 200 Ω) are in parallel with each other.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance is calculated using the formula for parallel resistors:\n        1 / R_total = 1 / R_left_eq + 1 / R_right_eq\n        1 / R_total = 1/9 + 1/200\n        To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9 * 200 = 1800.\n        1 / R_total = (200/1800) + (9/1800)\n        1 / R_total = 209 / 1800\n        R_total = 1800 / 209 Ω ≈ 8.61 Ω.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   Now we use Ohm's Law with the total voltage and total equivalent resistance.\n    *   V_total = V2 = 1 V.\n    *   R_total = 1800 / 209 Ω.\n    *   I_total = V_total / R_total = 1 V / (1800 / 209 Ω)\n    *   I_total = 209 / 1800 A.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   I_total = 209 / 1800 ≈ 0.11611... A.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.116 A.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   The most critical point is correctly identifying the effect of the wire that connects the top rail to the junction between R2 and R3. This is not a simple series/parallel combination and requires careful analysis of node potentials.\n*   This wire creates a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2, meaning no current flows through them.\n*   The circuit simplifies to R3 being in parallel with the series combination of R7 and R8.\n*   The total current is the sum of the currents in the two simplified parallel branches.\n---\n\n<<<0.116>>>"
