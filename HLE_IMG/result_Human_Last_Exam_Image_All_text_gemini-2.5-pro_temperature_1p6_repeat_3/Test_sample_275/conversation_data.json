    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo identify and count the total number of unique messenger RNA (mRNA) splice species detected by the series of Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) experiments shown in the image. A unique splice species is a distinct mRNA molecule formed by a specific combination of exons.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Primer Specificity:** Each primer pair amplifies a specific segment of the transcribed RNA. The choice of forward and reverse primers determines which transcripts are detected.\n2.  **Splice-Junction Primers:** Primers E1F2 and E1F3 are described as spanning specific splice junctions (929^3465 and 929^3506, respectively). This means they will *only* amplify transcripts that contain these exact splices, making them powerful tools for identifying specific splice species.\n3.  **Early vs. Late Transcripts:** The use of reverse primers in the early region (E4R, E5R) versus the late region (L2R, L1R) allows for the differentiation between early transcripts (ending at polyA site A_E) and late transcripts (ending at polyA site A_L). These are fundamentally different classes of species.\n4.  **Multiple Bands:** When a single primer pair produces multiple bands in a lane, it signifies the presence of multiple splice variants that all share the primer binding sites but differ in the sequence between them (e.g., inclusion or exclusion of an exon).\n5.  **PCR Cycle Number:** A higher number of PCR cycles (e.g., Panel I vs. Panel H) can increase sensitivity and reveal less abundant splice species that might not be visible at lower cycle numbers. The most sensitive experiment gives the most complete picture for that primer set.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of Early Transcripts (using early reverse primers E4R, E5R):**\n    *   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This PCR uses the forward primer E1F1 and the early reverse primer E4R. It reveals two distinct bands (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp). This indicates the presence of **2 distinct early splice species** that are both initiated from an exon containing the E1F1 site.\n    *   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This is consistent with Panel B, showing two bands with the same 31 bp size difference. It confirms the two species but does not identify new ones.\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This PCR uses the splice-junction-specific primer E1F2 (929^3465). It shows one single band (551 bp). This identifies **1 new early splice species** defined by the presence of the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   *Sub-total for Early Species:* 2 (from E1F1) + 1 (from E1F2) = **3 species**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Late Transcripts (using late reverse primers L2R, L1R):**\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This PCR uses the splice-junction primer E1F2 (929^3465) and a late reverse primer. It reveals a single band (972 bp). This identifies **1 distinct late splice species** containing the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This PCR uses the splice-junction primer E1F3 (929^3506) and a late reverse primer. It reveals two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp). This identifies **2 distinct late splice species**, both containing the 929^3506 splice but differing in another splicing event downstream.\n    *   **Panels H & I (E1F1/L1R):** These panels use the general forward primer E1F1 with a late reverse primer L1R. Panel I, with a higher cycle number (30 cycles), provides the most sensitive detection. It shows four distinct bands (band 1: 450 bp; band 2: 419 bp; band 3: 378 bp; band 4: 187 bp). This indicates there are **4 distinct late splice species** that are all initiated from an exon containing the E1F1 site. Panel E is consistent with this, showing that these 4 species are not resolved when a different reverse primer (L2R) is used.\n    *   *Sub-total for Late Species:* 1 (from E1F2) + 2 (from E1F3) + 4 (from E1F1) = **7 species**.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Count:**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each experiment and grouping the findings based on the specific primers used, we can sum the unique species identified:\n\n*   Early Species detected with E1F1 primer: 2\n*   Early Species detected with E1F2 primer: 1\n*   Late Species detected with E1F1 primer: 4\n*   Late Species detected with E1F2 primer: 1\n*   Late Species detected with E1F3 primer: 2\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\nBased on the evidence from all the RT-PCR experiments, a total of 10 different splice species can be identified.\n\n<<<10>>>"
