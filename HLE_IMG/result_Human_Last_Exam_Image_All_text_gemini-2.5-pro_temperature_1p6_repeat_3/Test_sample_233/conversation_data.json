    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request and Image:** The goal is to determine the catalog ID of the specific Ingvar runestone shown in the image fragment. The image displays a section of a runestone with runic text carved into horizontal bands. This banded style is a significant clue.\n\n2.  **Identify the Runic Script:** The characters are from the Younger Futhark, the runic alphabet used during the Viking Age, which is consistent with the era of the Ingvar runestones (c. 1041 AD).\n\n3.  **Transliterate the Visible Runes:** We can transliterate the runes (convert them to Latin letters) to understand the text, which is key to identifying the stone. We will analyze the three visible rows of text.\n    *   **Top Row:** Reading from left to right, we can see the runes for `...ain : þino : a...`. In Old Norse, this fragment is likely part of the common runestone phrase `[st]ain : þino : a[ftiR]...`, which means \"[st]one this in memory of...\". The symbols `:` are word separators.\n    *   **Middle Row:** The visible runes transliterate to `...r : þurstain : f...`. This strongly suggests the end of the word `[afti]r` followed by the personal name `Þorstain` (Thorsteinn) and the beginning of another word `f[elaka]` (partner/comrade).\n    *   **Bottom Row:** The runes here transliterate to `...ka : sin : auk...`. This fragment corresponds to the end of the word `[fela]ka` (partner), followed by `sin` (his), and `auk` (and).\n\n4.  **Reconstruct the Text Fragment:** Piecing together the transliterated parts, we get a coherent text sequence: `...[st]ain : þino : a[ftiR] : Þorstain : [fela]ka : sin : auk...` which translates to \"...this stone in memory of Þorsteinn, his partner, and...\".\n\n5.  **Search and Identify the Runestone:** Now we search for an Ingvar runestone that contains this specific text and name. The Ingvar runestones are a well-documented group. A search for an Ingvar stone mentioning a \"Þorsteinn\" as a \"felagi\" (partner) and featuring the distinct horizontal banded carving style points to one specific stone.\n\n6.  **Confirmation:** The runestone with the ID **U 654**, located at Varpsund in Uppland, Sweden, has the following inscription: `... þaiR : raistu : stain : þino : aftiR : þorstain : felaka : sin : auk : ikuar...` (\"...they raised this stone in memory of Þorsteinn, their partner and Ingvarr's...\"). This inscription perfectly matches the text deciphered from the image fragment. The visual style of U 654, with its straight horizontal bands, also matches the image precisely.\n\nTherefore, the image is a fragment of the Ingvar runestone U 654.\n\n<<<U 654>>>"
