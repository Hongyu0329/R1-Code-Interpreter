    "This is a Kakuro puzzle. The goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The number in a black square is a \"clue\". A clue in the bottom-left of a black square is the sum for the horizontal block of white squares to its right. A clue in the top-right is the sum for the vertical block of white squares below it. Digits within a block must be unique.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step-by-step, focusing on the two top white squares. Let's call them `A` (left) and `B` (right).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the clues related to the top two squares, `A` and `B`.**\n\n1.  **Horizontal Clue (H10):** The black square to the left of `A` and `B` has the clue `10` in its bottom-left triangle. This means the sum of the horizontal block to its right is 10. This block consists of cells `A` and `B`.\n    *   `A + B = 10`\n    *   Possible pairs for (A,B), since digits can't be repeated: (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6) and their reverses.\n\n2.  **Vertical Clue (V17):** The black square above cell `A` has the clue `17` in its top-right triangle. This means the sum of the vertical block of cells starting with `A` is 17.\n\n3.  **Vertical Clue (V29):** The black square above cell `B` has the clue `29` in its top-right triangle. This means the sum of the vertical block of cells starting with `B` is 29.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the vertical clues to find constraints on `A` and `B`.**\n\n1.  **Analyze V29:** A sum of 29 must be analyzed by the number of cells in its block.\n    *   Minimum sum for 3 unique digits (1-9) is 1+2+3=6. Maximum sum is 9+8+7=24. It is impossible to get a sum of 29 in 3 cells.\n    *   This implies that the vertical block for the sum 29 must have at least 4 cells. Tracing the column down from cell `B` shows that it is indeed 4 cells long.\n    *   We need to find the combinations of 4 unique digits that sum to 29. The highest digits must be used. Let's try combinations:\n        *   9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30 (too high)\n        *   9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29 (This is a unique combination)\n        *   9 + 8 + 6 + ... the remaining digit would have to be 6, which is not unique.\n    *   Therefore, the four cells in the column below clue `29` must contain the digits {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n    *   Since `B` is the first cell in this column, **`B` must be one of {5, 7, 8, 9}.**\n\n**Step 3: Combine the constraints from H10 and V29.**\n\n*   We know `A + B = 10`.\n*   We know `B` must be 5, 7, 8, or 9.\n*   Let's check the possibilities for `B`:\n    *   If `B = 5`, then `A = 5`. This is not allowed as digits in a block (`A` and `B`) must be unique.\n    *   If `B = 7`, then `A = 3`. This is a valid pair {3, 7}.\n    *   If `B = 8`, then `A = 2`. This is a valid pair {2, 8}.\n    *   If `B = 9`, then `A = 1`. This is a valid pair {1, 9}.\n*   So, the pair of numbers in the top squares (A,B) must be one of: `{3, 7}`, `{2, 8}`, or `{1, 9}`.\n\n**Step 4: Use clue V17 and other clues to determine the correct pair.**\n\n1.  **Analyze V17:** `A` is the first cell in a column that sums to 17. Let's analyze the length of this column. The structure of the grid shows that the column starting with `A` is 3 cells long before being interrupted. Let the cells be `A`, `C`, and `G`.\n    *   `A + C + G = 17`.\n\n2.  **Analyze H6:** On the left side of the puzzle, there is a horizontal clue `6`. It corresponds to a 2-cell run. Based on the grid layout, this run's first cell is the same cell we labeled `G`. Let the cells in this run be `G` and `H`.\n    *   `G + H = 6`.\n    *   The possible unique digit pairs for this sum are {1, 5} and {2, 4}.\n    *   Therefore, **`G` must be one of {1, 2, 4, 5}.**\n\n3.  **Combine the constraints on `A` and `G`.** We know `A+C+G=17`, and `G` must be from `{1, 2, 4, 5}`. Let's test our candidate pairs for `(A,B)`:\n    *   **Case 1: (A,B) = {1, 9}**. So `A = 1`. The equation for V17 is `1 + C + G = 17`, which simplifies to `C + G = 16`.\n        *   We check the possible values for `G` from `{1, 2, 4, 5}`.\n        *   If `G=1`, `C=15` (impossible). `G` also cannot be `1` because `A` is `1`.\n        *   If `G=2`, `C=14` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=4`, `C=12` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=5`, `C=11` (impossible).\n        *   This case is impossible. So `{1, 9}` is not the correct pair.\n\n    *   **Case 2: (A,B) = {2, 8}**. So `A = 2`. The equation for V17 is `2 + C + G = 17`, which simplifies to `C + G = 15`.\n        *   We check the possible values for `G` from `{1, 2, 4, 5}`. `G` cannot be `2` because `A` is `2`.\n        *   If `G=1`, `C=14` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=4`, `C=11` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=5`, `C=10` (impossible).\n        *   This case is impossible. So `{2, 8}` is not the correct pair.\n\n    *   **Case 3: (A,B) = {3, 7}**. So `A = 3`. The equation for V17 is `3 + C + G = 17`, which simplifies to `C + G = 14`.\n        *   We check the possible values for `G` from `{1, 2, 4, 5}`.\n        *   If `G=1`, `C=13` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=2`, `C=12` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=4`, `C=10` (impossible).\n        *   If `G=5`, `C=9`. This is a valid solution (`A=3`, `G=5`, `C=9` are all unique).\n        *   This case is possible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough a process of elimination, the only pair of numbers for the top two squares that is consistent with the puzzle's other clues is {3, 7}.\n\nThe two numbers are 3 and 7.\n\n<<<3,7>>>"
