    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the prompt's clues.**\n*   **\"Illusion\"**: The phenomenon is a perceptual effect where what we experience differs from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   **\"Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: This comparison is crucial. The Necker Cube is a visual stimulus that can be perceived in two different, stable ways (the cube facing down-and-to-the-right or up-and-to-the-left). The brain settles on one interpretation at a time. This suggests the phenomenon in question also involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous sensory input and choosing a stable perception.\n*   **\"Surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This indicates it's a fundamental process of perception that happens automatically, without our deliberate control.\n*   **\"Elements related to...\"**: The image shows the components that create this illusion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the image.**\n*   The image contains two plots, which are standard representations of sound.\n*   **Top plot (Spectrogram)**: This shows frequency (on the y-axis) over time (on the x-axis). We see a constant, single-frequency tone represented by the steady horizontal line. In the middle, this line is interrupted and replaced by a vertical bar of sound spread across many frequencies. This vertical bar represents a short burst of noise.\n*   **Bottom plot (Waveform)**: This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a simple, regular sine wave (a pure tone). In the middle, the waveform becomes complex and random (noise). It then resumes a periodic pattern.\n*   **Synthesis of image content**: Both plots depict the same event: a pure tone is playing, it is completely replaced for a short duration by a burst of noise, and then the tone (or a similar one) resumes. Physically, the tone is not present during the noise burst.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues and the image.**\n*   The physical stimulus is \"tone-noise-tone\".\n*   The prompt describes an illusion. The illusion in this specific case is that when a person listens to this sound, they don't perceive \"tone-noise-tone\". Instead, they perceive the original tone as continuing *uninterrupted* through the noise. The noise is perceived as a separate event layered on top of a continuous tone.\n*   The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, creating a perception of continuity that is not physically present in the signal. This is a powerful, automatic \"restoration\" effect.\n*   This matches the Necker Cube analogy: the brain is presented with an ambiguous stimulus (is the tone interrupted by noise, or is there a continuous tone with noise added on top?). It resolves this ambiguity by choosing the more probable real-world scenario, which is a continuous sound being momentarily obscured by another sound.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\n*   This auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuous even when it is briefly interrupted by another sound (like noise), is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n*   It is also sometimes referred to as **perceptual restoration of sound** or **temporal induction**. When the sound being restored is speech, it is known as the phonemic restoration effect, which is a specific example of this more general principle.\n\nGiven the visual evidence of a non-speech tone, the most accurate and general name is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
