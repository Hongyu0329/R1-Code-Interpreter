    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\nThe starting material is a bicyclic lactam with a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n*   The core bicyclic structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system. Let's count the atoms in this core framework:\n    *   Carbons in the ring system: 6 (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7).\n    *   Nitrogen in the ring system: 1 (at position 2).\n    *   Oxygen in the ring system: 1 (carbonyl oxygen at C3).\n*   Let's add the substituents:\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is attached to the double bond (at C5 or C6). This group contains 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms.\n    *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom. The PMB group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. Its molecular formula is C8H9O (1 C in CH2 + 6 C in the benzene ring + 1 C in OCH3 = 8 C; 2 H in CH2 + 4 H on the ring + 3 H in OCH3 = 9 H; 1 O in OCH3).\n*   Now, let's sum up all the atoms in the starting material:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count from the structure. Bridgehead H's (at C1, C4) = 2. Methylene bridge H's (at C7) = 2. Alkene H (at the unsubstituted end of the double bond) = 1. PMB group H's = 9. Total H = 2 + 2 + 1 + 9 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 (from CF3).\n    *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 (in the lactam ring).\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 (from the carbonyl) + 1 (from the PMB group) = 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\nThe first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O). CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this case, it removes the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom.\n*   The reaction is: R-N-PMB → R-NH.\n*   The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen.\n*   Change in molecular formula:\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the PMB group: -C8, -H9, -O1.\n    *   Add one hydrogen atom: +H1.\n    *   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n*   Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\nThe second reaction involves catalytic hydrogenation with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   Intermediate 1 has one C=C double bond within its bicyclic ring system.\n*   Hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   Change in molecular formula: +H2.\n*   Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\nThe final step is the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 using aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl) at 70 °C. Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). Acidic hydrolysis cleaves the amide bond.\n*   The lactam ring is opened by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The N-C=O bond is broken. An -OH group is added to the carbonyl carbon (forming a carboxylic acid), and an -H atom is added to the nitrogen (forming an amine).\n*   Change in molecular formula: +H2O.\n*   Molecular formula of the final Product:\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final Product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is an amino acid, specifically 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. (Note: In the acidic solution, the amine would be protonated to an ammonium salt, but the molecular formula typically refers to the neutral compound).\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n*   Start: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (deprotection): -C8H8O -> C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (hydrogenation): +H2 -> C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (hydrolysis): +H2O -> C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe analysis is consistent.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
