**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A polycyclic compound containing a pyrrole ring. The structure is formed by the cycloaddition of dipole C with methyl propiolate followed by CO2 extrusion. The pyrrole ring is substituted with a methyl ester group.

*Structure sketch:* A pyrrole ring is fused to the original pyrrolidine ring at the N1-C5 bond. The pyrrole is substituted with a methyl ester group and a hydrogen atom from the alkyne. The N1 atom of the pyrrolidine is still attached to the original pyrroline-derived group.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
A polycyclic compound containing a pyrrole ring and a fused isoxazolidine ring.

*Structure sketch:* The starting material is oxidized to form `1-(pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-N-oxide`. This dipole reacts with methyl propiolate. The product has a pyrrole ring attached to a pyrrolidine ring, which is in turn fused to an isoxazolidine ring substituted with a methyl ester group.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
A mesoionic 1,3-dipole of the münchnone type.

*Structure sketch:* The structure is an anhydro-5-oxo-oxazolium hydroxide, fused to the pyrrolidine ring at the N1-C2 bond. The nitrogen of the oxazolone ring (N1 of pyrrolidine) is substituted by the original pyrroline-derived group. This compound acts as the 1,3-dipole for the formation of A.

Here are the drawn structures:
**Product C:**
A fused münchnone structure derived from the starting material and acetic anhydride.
 

**Product A:**
The [3+2] cycloaddition product of C and methyl propiolate, after extrusion of CO2.
 

**Product B:**
The [3+2] cycloaddition product of an N-oxide dipole (derived from an oxidized form of the starting material) and methyl propiolate.
