    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nFirst, we must establish the key of the piece. The key signature shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of E♭ major or its relative minor, C minor. The sonata is famously in C minor, which is confirmed by the harmonic language throughout the movement. The tonic key is C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Measure 30**\nThe provided score shows measure numbers. The second system of staves begins with measure 28. Counting from there, the third measure in that system is measure 30. This measure is highlighted within the black circle on the image.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Notes in Measure 30**\nWe need to identify all the notes being played in this measure to determine the chord.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on the note G (G2 and G3) on the downbeat. This establishes G as the bass note of the harmony.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a sequence of sixteenth notes. The notes on the main beats are:\n    *   Beat 1: The beat begins with E♮ and G.\n    *   Beat 2: The beat begins with B♮ and D.\n    *   The E♮ is a non-chord tone (an appoggiatura or passing tone). The primary notes that outline the harmony are G, B♮, and D.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Chord**\nCombining the principal notes from both hands, we have G in the bass, and G, B♮, and D in the upper parts. The collection of notes G - B♮ - D forms a G major triad.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Chord's Function and Roman Numeral**\nNow, we analyze the function of this G major triad within the key of C minor.\n*   The note G is the fifth scale degree of C. Therefore, this is a dominant chord.\n*   In a natural minor scale (C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭), the triad built on the dominant (G) would be G minor (G-B♭-D), represented by a lowercase Roman numeral 'v'.\n*   However, in common practice harmony, the seventh scale degree of a minor key is typically raised to create a \"leading tone,\" which pulls more strongly towards the tonic. In C minor, the seventh degree (B♭) is raised to B♮.\n*   Using this raised leading tone, the dominant triad becomes G-B♮-D, which is a G major chord.\n*   A major dominant chord is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral.\n*   Since the chord is built on the fifth scale degree (G) and is major, the correct Roman numeral is **V**.\n*   The chord is in root position because the root of the chord (G) is in the bass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord in measure 30 is a G major triad, which functions as the major dominant in the key of C minor. The correct Roman numeral is V. This is confirmed by the resolution to the tonic C minor chord (i) in the following measure (m. 31).\n\n<<<V>>>"
