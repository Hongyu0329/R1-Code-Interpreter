    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. When an element is heated or has an electric current passed through it, its electrons get excited to higher energy levels. As they fall back to their normal levels, they emit light at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, it creates a series of bright colored lines on a dark background. This pattern of lines is unique for each element and acts as its \"fingerprint.\" The image shows this pattern for an unknown element, with colors ranging from violet/blue on the left to red on theright.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we need to carefully observe the prominent lines and their relative positions and intensities.\n*   **Violet/Blue Region:** There are several distinct lines. One strong line is visible in the blue-violet part of the spectrum, and another is in the deeper violet (though less bright).\n*   **Green Region:** The most striking feature of this entire spectrum is a very bright, dominant green line. This is a major clue. There are other, fainter lines in the teal and green areas as well.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct pair of lines (a doublet) visible in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n*   **Red Region:** There are several lines in the red region, though they appear less intense than the main green and blue lines.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, let's compare these features to the known visible spectra of some common elements.\n*   **Hydrogen:** Has a very simple spectrum with four prominent lines in the visible range (one red, one blue-green, two violet). The spectrum in the image is much more complex.\n*   **Helium:** Has several bright lines, including a strong red, a very strong yellow, and others in the green and blue. The pattern is different from the image, which is dominated by a single, very intense green line.\n*   **Sodium:** Is famous for its very strong yellow doublet (two lines very close together). While the image has yellow lines, it also has very strong lines in the green and blue, which are not characteristic of a pure sodium spectrum.\n*   **Neon:** Is known for its large number of bright lines in the red and orange parts of the spectrum, giving neon signs their characteristic color. The spectrum in the image has strong green and blue lines, which rules out neon.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** The emission spectrum of mercury is well-known and characterized by several key lines:\n    *   A strong violet line (~405 nm).\n    *   A strong blue-violet line (~436 nm).\n    *   A very intense, dominant **green line (~546 nm)**.\n    *   A bright yellow doublet (~577/579 nm).\n    This set of prominent lines is a perfect match for the features we observed in the image. The extremely bright green line is the most definitive characteristic of mercury's visible spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe pattern of spectral lines in the image, particularly the very intense green line combined with strong blue-violet and yellow lines, is the unique fingerprint of the element mercury. This is the spectrum you would see from a mercury-vapor lamp.\n\n<<<Mercury>>>"
