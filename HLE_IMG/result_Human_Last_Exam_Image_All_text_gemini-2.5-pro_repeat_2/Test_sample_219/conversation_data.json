    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nThe provided image is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity (spikes) of multiple neurons over time.\n- The y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128), with each horizontal line corresponding to the activity recorded by one electrode.\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds (s).\n- Each black dot represents a spike, or a neuron firing.\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons across many electrodes fire in a coordinated and rapid succession. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands in the raster plot.\n\nBy examining the graph, we can identify four distinct, prominent synchronized bursts:\n1.  **Burst 1:** A dense vertical band of activity is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** Another clear burst is centered around **t₂ = 15 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** A third major burst is centered at **t₃ = 35 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A final burst is visible towards the end of the recording, centered at approximately **t₄ = 49 s**.\n\nTherefore, the timestamps of the identified synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 15 s, 35 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. With four identified bursts, we can calculate three IBIs:\n- **IBI₁:** The interval between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n  IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 2 s = 13 s.\n- **IBI₂:** The interval between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n  IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 35 s - 15 s = 20 s.\n- **IBI₃:** The interval between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n  IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 49 s - 35 s = 14 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals (which is 3).\n- Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n- Average IBI = (13 s + 20 s + 14 s) / 3\n- Average IBI = 47 s / 3\n- Average IBI ≈ 15.667 s\n\n**Step 4: Round the Final Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n- The calculated value is 15.667... s.\n- The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n- The third digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we must round up the preceding digit (5).\n- Rounding 15.667... to two significant figures gives 16.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 16 s.\n\n<<<16>>>"
