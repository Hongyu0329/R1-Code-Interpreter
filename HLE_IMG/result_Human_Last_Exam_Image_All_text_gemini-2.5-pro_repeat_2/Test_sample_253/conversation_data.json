    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on a rock. This organism has small, cup-like structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). These features—color, growth form, and presence of apothecia—are characteristic of a lichen. Given the bright yellow-orange color and its growth on rock in a coastal location like Acadia National Park, the organism can be confidently identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or yellow scale.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Biological Question**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1\" protein of this organism. This requires looking up specific protein data for *Xanthoria parietina*. \"XPH1\" is the specific name for a protein found in this lichen. Research indicates that XPH1 stands for *Xanthoria parietina* Hydrophobin 1. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins found in fungi that play roles in growth and interaction with surfaces.\n\n**Step 3: Retrieve Protein Data from a Scientific Database**\nTo find the exact number of amino acids, we need to consult a public biological database, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n1.  Search the NCBI protein database for \"XPH1\" from the organism \"*Xanthoria parietina*\".\n2.  The search yields a specific entry for this protein. The accession number for the protein is **CAB94833.1**.\n3.  The database entry for CAB94833.1 identifies the protein as \"hydrophobin XPH1\" from the source organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Protein Length**\nThe detailed record for protein accession number CAB94833.1 in the NCBI database provides the full amino acid sequence and states its total length. According to this official record, the XPH1 protein consists of 108 amino acids.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** The accuracy of the answer hinges on the correct identification of the lichen from the image and its provided location. The visual evidence strongly supports the identification of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Specificity:** The question asks for a specific protein, XPH1, not a general protein. This requires a precise database lookup.\n*   **Data Source:** Using a reliable and standard scientific database like NCBI is crucial for obtaining accurate molecular data.\n*   **Final Answer:** The length of a protein is measured by the number of amino acid residues in its chain. The database provides this exact number.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<108>>>"
