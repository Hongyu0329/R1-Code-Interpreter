The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular V (variable-type immunoglobulin) and C1 domains of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE).

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. The reasoning, based on the provided diagram, is that S100B is not merely associated with the disease but is an upstream trigger for the core pathological mechanisms. Its binding to RAGE initiates signaling cascades (via JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that lead directly to apoptosis, proinflammatory cytokine production, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression is directly linked to the activity and progression of the disease, allowing it to predict the clinical outcome or course of the neurological disorder.
