    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak**\nThe molecular ion peak is the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that corresponds to the intact molecule. Looking at the high m/z region of the spectrum and table, we see a cluster of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This is likely the molecular ion cluster. The nominal molecular weight of the compound is therefore 260 u (corresponding to the peak with the lightest isotopes). The pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M⁺, M+2, M+4, M+6) is characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine or bromine atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Chlorine/Bromine Atoms**\nLet's analyze the isotopic cluster of the molecular ion:\n- m/z 260 (I = 34.8%)\n- m/z 262 (I = 29.0%)\n- m/z 264 (I = 12.9%)\n- m/z 266 (I = 3.22%)\n\nThe theoretical relative intensities for a compound with multiple chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) are:\n- 1 Cl: M:(M+2) ≈ 3:1\n- 2 Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4) ≈ 9:6:1\n- 3 Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ≈ 27:27:9:1 (or ≈ 1:1:0.33:0.04)\n\nLet's normalize the experimental intensities relative to the most intense peak in the cluster, m/z 260 (I=34.8%):\n- Ratio ≈ 1 : (29.0/34.8) : (12.9/34.8) : (3.22/34.8) ≈ 1 : 0.83 : 0.37 : 0.09.\nThis pattern is reasonably close to the theoretical pattern for a compound with **three chlorine atoms**. The match isn't perfect, which can be due to experimental conditions or overlapping fragments, but it's the most plausible fit.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n- **Base Peak:** The most intense peak in the spectrum is the base peak, which is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n- **Major Fragmentation Pathway:** Let's look at the relationship between the molecular ion and the base peak. The mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This is a very common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds.\n    M⁺ ([CₓHᵧCl₃]⁺) → [M-Cl]⁺ ([CₓHᵧCl₂]⁺) + Cl•\n- **Analysis of the Base Peak Cluster:** The fragment at m/z 225 should therefore contain two chlorine atoms. Let's check its isotope pattern:\n    - m/z 225 (I = 100%)\n    - m/z 227 (I = 66.7%)\n    - m/z 229 (I = 22.2%)\n    The theoretical ratio for two Cl atoms is M:(M+2):(M+4) ≈ 9:6:1. Normalizing to the M+2 peak (often cleaner), the ratio M:M+2 is 9:6 = 1.5. Our experimental ratio is 100:66.7 = 1.5. This is a perfect match, confirming the fragment at m/z 225/227 contains **two chlorine atoms**.\n- **Sequential Loss of Chlorine:** We can see a cascade of chlorine loss:\n    - Peak at m/z 190: This corresponds to the loss of another Cl atom from the base peak (225 - 35 = 190). So, [CₓHᵧCl]⁺. The isotope peak at m/z 192 confirms one Cl atom.\n    - Peak at m/z 155: This corresponds to the loss of the last Cl atom (190 - 35 = 155). This is the bare hydrocarbon skeleton, [CₓHᵧ]⁺.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula**\nFrom the fragmentation, the hydrocarbon skeleton [CₓHᵧ]⁺ has a mass of 155 u.\n- To find the formula, we can divide by the mass of carbon (12): 155 / 12 ≈ 12.9. So, let's try C₁₂.\n- Mass of C₁₂ = 12 * 12 = 144 u.\n- Mass remaining for hydrogen = 155 - 144 = 11 u. This corresponds to 11 hydrogen atoms.\n- Therefore, the hydrocarbon skeleton is **C₁₂H₁₁**.\n- The molecular formula of the original compound is C₁₂H₁₁ with three chlorine atoms, which is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n- Let's verify the nominal molecular weight: (12 * 12) + (11 * 1) + (3 * 35) = 144 + 11 + 105 = 260 u. This matches our initial assignment.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\nThe formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n- The degree of unsaturation = C - H/2 - X/2 + 1 = 12 - 11/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 12 - 5.5 - 1.5 + 1 = 6.\n- A DoU of 6 suggests a structure containing both rings and double bonds, for example, a phenyl group (DoU=4) and a cyclohexene ring (DoU=2).\n- A structure that fits this formula and fragmentation is a trichlorinated phenylcyclohexene derivative. The loss of chlorine from the saturated part of the ring would be a favorable fragmentation process.\n- Based on known spectra of similar environmental contaminants, a plausible structure is **1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-4-ene**.\n    - The C₁₂H₁₁ skeleton is composed of a phenyl group (C₆H₅) and a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₆).\n    - The three chlorine atoms are substituents on the cyclohexene ring.\n    - This structure is consistent with the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and the observed fragmentation pattern. The loss of the allylic chlorine at C3 would be particularly favorable, leading to a stable cation, which could explain the high intensity of the [M-Cl]⁺ peak.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-4-ene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-4-ene>>>"
