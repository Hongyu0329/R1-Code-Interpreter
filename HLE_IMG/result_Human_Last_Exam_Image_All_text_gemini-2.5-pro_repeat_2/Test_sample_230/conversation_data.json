    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image fragment.**\nThe image presents a dramatic scene centered around a large windmill. Key elements include:\n*   **Subject:** A prominent, traditional European windmill, possibly Dutch or Russian in style, with a brick base and wooden structure.\n*   **Atmosphere:** A dark, stormy sky with turbulent clouds. There's a patch of lighter blue sky visible, creating a strong contrast.\n*   **Action:** In the background to the right, a fire is raging, with bright orange flames and smoke rising into the sky.\n*   **Style:** The brushwork is expressive, and the use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) is dramatic, which is characteristic of the Romanticism movement, a dominant style in the 19th century.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a search strategy based on the analysis.**\nBased on the visual clues and the given timeframe (19th century), the search should focus on paintings featuring a windmill, a storm, and a fire from that period. Keywords for an image search could include: \"19th-century painting windmill storm fire\", \"Romantic painting windmill\", \"Aivazovsky windmill\".\n\n**Step 3: Identify the painting and artist.**\nExecuting the search quickly leads to the work of the renowned Russian-Armenian Romantic painter Ivan Aivazovsky (1817–1900). He was a master of seascapes and dramatic, light-filled scenes. The provided fragment is an exact match for a section of his painting.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the details of the identified painting.**\n*   **Artist:** Ivan Aivazovsky.\n*   **Date:** The painting was created in 1862, which is squarely in the 19th century.\n*   **Title:** The painting is known by a few variations in English, derived from its original Russian title, \"Мельница на берегу моря\". The most common and accepted English titles are \"Windmill on the Seashore\" or \"Windmill on the Sea Coast\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fragment is from Ivan Aivazovsky's 1862 painting. The scene depicts a windmill on a coast at night, silhouetted against a stormy sky, while a fire burns in a nearby town or settlement. The title that best describes this work is \"Windmill on the Seashore\".\n\n<<<Windmill on the Seashore>>>"
