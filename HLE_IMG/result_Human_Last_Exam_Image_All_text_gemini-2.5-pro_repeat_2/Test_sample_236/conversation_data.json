    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n2.  **Observe the Insect's General Characteristics:** The insect has six legs, a pair of antennae, and a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), which are typical characteristics of an insect. Its body shape, particularly the way the wings seem to fold, suggests it is a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera, rather than a beetle.\n3.  **Analyze Specific Visual Details:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a distinct black and orange/red pattern.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with a prominent vertical orange-red stripe down the middle.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is a broad band of orange-red.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The visible parts of the wings show a pattern of black and orange-red. Although the classic \"X\" pattern is not fully visible from this angle, the overall coloration is consistent with certain species.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and antennae are black.\n4.  **Identify the Plant:** The insect is on a bright yellow flower head. The structure of the inflorescence (a dense cluster of many small flowers on a stalk) is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species). This can be a clue to the insect's identity or habits.\n5.  **Synthesize Information and Form a Hypothesis:** Based on the combination of features (true bug, black and orange-red coloration with a specific pattern on the head and thorax, presence on a flowering plant), the insect strongly resembles the **Small Milkweed Bug**.\n6.  **Confirm the Hypothesis:** A search for the Small Milkweed Bug confirms its appearance matches the insect in the photo. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*. This species is known for its distinct black and red-orange coloration, including the red line on the head and the red band on the pronotum. While its primary food source is milkweed seeds, the adults are often found feeding on nectar from various flowers, including goldenrod. This confirms both the visual identification and the ecological context.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish this bug from other similarly colored insects like the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), which has different red markings (lines on the thorax and edges of the wings), or the Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), which has a much bolder, different orange and black pattern.\n*   It is also distinct from the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*), which is a beetle (order Coleoptera) and has a different body shape and antennae, despite having similar colors and being found on the same plant.\n*   The question asks for the *scientific name*, which requires providing the genus and species, not the common name.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe analysis of the insect's morphology (color pattern, body shape) and its context (on a goldenrod flower) leads to the identification of the species as the Small Milkweed Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
