The two major products, A and B, are the regioisomers formed from the 1,2-addition of a benzoyloxy group and a tert-butoxy group across the double bond of styrene.

**Compound A:** 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate
 

**Compound B:** 1-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate
 

The problem does not specify which peak corresponds to A and which to B. The structures shown above represent the two products formed. Typically, the isomer formed via the more stable benzylic radical intermediate (2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate) would be the major product.
