    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clef joined together), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Key Signature:** There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature, which typically indicates the key of G major or E minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The 'C' symbol indicates common time, which is 4/4.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (♩ = 80), which is a moderate tempo (Andante/Moderato).\n*   **Dynamics:** The piece begins softly (*p*, piano), then has a sudden shift to loud (*f*, forte) in measure 3. There are further dynamic markings like *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte), indicating a wide expressive range.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Musical Content and Style**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a quiet, lyrical melody in the right hand over simple chords in the left hand. The harmony begins clearly in G major. The melodic line is G-B-D-G-F#-E-D-C. The C natural against the G major harmony creates a poignant, modern sound.\n*   **Measure 3 onwards:** There is a dramatic change in character. The music becomes loud, fast, and virtuosic. The right hand plays rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios that span a wide range of the keyboard. The left hand plays powerful, low-register chords.\n*   **Harmonic Progression:** The arpeggios begin on a C# minor chord (measure 3), then move through other minor keys like G# minor (measure 5). This harmonic movement and the virtuosic texture are characteristic of late Romantic piano music (like Liszt) or modern virtuosic piano arrangements.\n*   **Overall Impression:** The structure—a quiet, melancholic introduction followed by a sudden, passionate, and technically demanding section—is a very strong clue. While it resembles the style of a Romantic-era étude, the specific melody in the opening is not from a standard classical piece.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Piece**\n*   The combination of the specific opening melody and the subsequent virtuosic arpeggio section is highly recognizable to fans of anime music.\n*   This pattern perfectly matches the famous piano arrangement of \"Unravel,\" the opening theme song for the anime series *Tokyo Ghoul*.\n*   The original song is by the band \"TK from Ling tosite sigure.\" This sheet music is from a popular and notoriously difficult piano arrangement, most likely the one created by the pianist Animenz. The arrangement captures the emotional intensity of the original rock song and translates it into a virtuosic piano solo.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the melodic theme, the structure, the virtuosic style, and the overall emotional arc, the piece is a piano arrangement of \"Unravel\" from the anime *Tokyo Ghoul*.\n\n<<<\"Unravel\" from Tokyo Ghoul>>>"
