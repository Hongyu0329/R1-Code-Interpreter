    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n**1. Identify the Musical Context**\n*   **Piece:** Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). Combined with the title, this confirms the piece is in the key of **D minor**.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is C (common time), which is 4/4.\n*   **Location:** The circled notes are on the third beat of measure 8.\n\n**2. Identify the Notes in the Circled Area**\n*   We need to look at the notes played together on the third beat of the measure.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an arpeggiated figure consisting of the notes **G**, **B♭**, and **D**.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a two-note chord (**B♭** and **D**) on the beat. (The C♯ that follows is a quick non-chord tone leading to the next beat).\n\n**3. Determine the Chord and its Inversion**\n*   Combining the notes from both hands, the complete chord consists of the notes **G, B♭, and D**.\n*   These three notes form a **G minor triad**.\n    *   The root is G.\n    *   The interval from G to B♭ is a minor third.\n    *   The interval from G to D is a perfect fifth.\n*   The lowest sounding note is the **G** in the bass clef. When the root of the chord (G) is the lowest note, the chord is in **root position**.\n\n**4. Determine the Roman Numeral**\n*   Roman numeral analysis relates chords to the established key, which is D minor.\n*   Let's list the scale degrees of D minor:\n    *   1st (tonic): D\n    *   2nd (supertonic): E\n    *   3rd (mediant): F\n    *   **4th (subdominant): G**\n    *   5th (dominant): A\n    *   6th (submediant): B♭\n    *   7th (leading tone): C♯ (from the harmonic minor scale)\n*   The chord is built on **G**, which is the **fourth** scale degree (the subdominant).\n*   The chord quality is **minor** (a G minor triad).\n*   In Roman numeral notation:\n    *   The number for the fourth degree is **IV**.\n    *   Lowercase numerals are used for minor chords, so we use **iv**.\n    *   Since the chord is in root position, no inversion figures are needed.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe notes G, B♭, and D form a G minor chord in root position. In the key of D minor, G is the subdominant (fourth degree). Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is **iv**.\n\n<<<iv>>>"
