    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nThe function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its steps for `n > 1`:\n\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then compares the last element of the current scope (`a[n-1]`) with the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`).\n3.  `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: If the last element is smaller, it's swapped with the second-to-last element. This action is similar to a single step in Bubble Sort, moving a smaller element towards the beginning of the array.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: **Crucially**, if a swap occurred, the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements might have been disrupted. For example, if `a[0...n-2]` was `[2, 5, 10]` and `a[n-1]` was `7`, after swapping `10` and `7`, the prefix becomes `[2, 5, 7]`. This is fine. But if the prefix was `[2, 8, 10]` and `a[n-1]` was `7`, swapping `10` and `7` makes the prefix `[2, 8, 7]`, which is now unsorted. To fix this potential disruption, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again.\n\n**2. Formulate the Recurrence Relation**\n\nTo analyze the time complexity, we define `T(n)` as the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function in the worst case.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing, which takes constant time. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n    *   One recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   A constant number of operations for comparison and a potential swap, which is `O(1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, and a second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is made. This also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nThe worst-case scenario happens when the second recursive call is always triggered. This occurs, for example, when the input array is sorted in descending order.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n**3. Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nLet's expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. We set `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series which equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n**4. Determine the Big-O Complexity**\n\nThe dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(c' + c) * 2^(n-1)`, which is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe algorithm makes two recursive calls on a problem of size `n-1` in the worst case. This leads to an exponential growth in the number of operations.\n\n*   A: O(n) - Incorrect.\n*   B: O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n*   C: O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n*   D: O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n*   E: O(2^n) - Correct. The recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` resolves to exponential complexity.\n*   F: does not terminate - Incorrect. The problem size `n` decreases with each recursive call, ensuring termination.\n\n<<<E>>>"
