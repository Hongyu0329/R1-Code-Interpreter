    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard's title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Musical Elements**\n*   **Key Signature:** There is one flat (B♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key is either F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   **First Chord:** The first chord is F minor (F-). The piece ends on an F chord, and the harmony throughout strongly suggests F minor as the tonal center.\n*   **Time Signature:** The 'C' with a vertical line through it is called \"alla breve\" or cut time, indicating a 2/2 time signature. This is common for jazz ballads and medium-tempo tunes.\n*   **Form:** The piece has a clear structure. There is an 8-bar section (A section) that repeats (indicated by the repeat sign and the 1st/2nd endings). This is followed by a different 8-bar section (the bridge, or B section), and then the A section returns for the final 8 bars. This AABA structure is extremely common in jazz standards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Harmony (Chord Progression)**\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars):** The progression begins | F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |. This creates a descending chromatic bass line (F, E, E♭, D♭), which is a very famous and recognizable harmonic device known as a \"line cliché\". While the specific chords can vary between arrangements, this descending pattern in a minor key is the hallmark of a particular famous standard. The progression continues with chords like C7 and F-, with the C7 acting as the dominant (V) chord leading back to the tonic F minor.\n*   **B Section (Bridge - bars 9-16):** The bridge starts with | D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |... This section modulates. The D-7♭5 to G7 is a ii-V progression leading to C. The C7 to F7 is a V-I motion leading into a new key area. The progression continues | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ |, which is a classic ii-V-I progression into A♭ major (the relative major of F minor). This modulation to the relative major in the bridge is also a key characteristic. The final G C7 turnaround leads back to the home key of F minor for the final A section.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   **A Section:** The melody starts with a repeated note (F), then ascends stepwise (G, A), then moves down (E♭, D, C, B).\n*   **Crucial Point:** The melodic contour and its relationship with the underlying descending harmony are highly distinctive. The melody F-F-G-A♭-E♭-D-C-B is the iconic opening of \"My Funny Valentine\" when transposed to F minor. The note in the second measure is written as an A-natural, which would be a deviation from the standard melody (which uses A-flat). However, in handwritten jazz charts (\"fake sheets\"), small errors or common alterations are frequent. Given that every other element—the rest of the melody, the chord progression's function, and the overall form—points directly to one song, this single note is likely a transcription error or a common jazz alteration.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Song**\n*   The combination of the minor key, the AABA form, the signature descending chromatic line cliché in the A section, the modulation to the relative major in the bridge, and the melodic contour strongly identifies the piece.\n*   These are all defining characteristics of the jazz standard **\"My Funny Valentine\"**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   \"My Funny Valentine\" is a show tune from the 1937 musical *Babes in Arms*.\n*   The music was composed by **Richard Rodgers**, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the form, harmony, and melody, the jazz standard is \"My Funny Valentine\", composed by Richard Rodgers.\n\n<<<Title: My Funny Valentine, Composer: Richard Rodgers>>>"
