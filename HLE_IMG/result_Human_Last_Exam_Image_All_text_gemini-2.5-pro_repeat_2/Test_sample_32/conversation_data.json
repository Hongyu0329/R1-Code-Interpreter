    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the **main difference** in the **sporophyte** between two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The difference should be one that allows for distinction **\"at a glance\"**, meaning it should be a readily visible, macroscopic feature.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Botanical Structure:** The question focuses on the **sporophyte**. In mosses, the sporophyte is the diploid generation that produces spores. It typically consists of three parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte and absorbs nutrients. It is not visible externally.\n    *   **Seta:** A stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape can be highly variable and are important diagnostic features.\n    *   **Capsule (Sporangium):** A container at the top of the seta where spores develop. Its shape, orientation, and position relative to the leaves are also key features.\n\n3.  **Analyze *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Sporophyte characteristics:** This species is known for having a sporophyte with a very short and notably **straight** seta.\n    *   **Visual result:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is typically **immersed** (hidden within the perichaetial leaves at the tip of the stem) or **emergent** (the top of the capsule just peeks out from the leaves). The capsules in the provided image are consistent with this description, appearing nestled within the leafy gametophyte.\n\n4.  **Analyze *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Sporophyte characteristics:** The species name itself provides the most important clue. *Curviseta* is Latin for \"curved seta\" (*curvus* = curved, *seta* = stalk/bristle). The defining characteristic of its sporophyte is a seta that is distinctly **curved**, often in a swan-neck or arcuate shape.\n    *   **Visual result:** This curved seta causes the capsule to be held out and away from the leaves, often nodding or hanging to one side. This makes the capsule and its unique stalk highly conspicuous.\n\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   *Grimmia montana*: **Straight seta**, leading to an immersed/emergent capsule.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta*: **Curved seta**, leading to a more exserted and nodding capsule.\n    *   The most fundamental and easily observed difference \"at a glance\" is the **shape of the seta**. The straightness versus the curvature of the stalk is a primary character that distinguishes these two species when sporophytes are present.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While the resulting capsule position (immersed vs. exserted/nodding) is also a key difference, it is a direct consequence of the seta's structure. The primary distinguishing feature is the seta itself.\n*   **Use the Name as a Clue:** Botanical names often describe a key feature of the organism. *Curviseta* is a perfect example.\n*   **\"At a glance\" is key:** This points towards a macroscopic feature that doesn't require a microscope or detailed dissection. The curvature of the seta fits this perfectly.\n*   **Presence of Sporophytes:** This distinction can, of course, only be made when the mosses are fertile and have mature sporophytes.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\nThe main difference lies in the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight and short, causing the capsule to be immersed in the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its defining feature: a distinctly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be held out and often nod.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or swan-necked."
