    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the provided image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a portion of an illustration. The most prominent figure is a creature that is clearly a unicorn. It is silvery-white, has a horse-like body, and a single, golden horn on its forehead. The unicorn appears to be in motion, perhaps running or startled. Its form is somewhat ethereal and ghostly, glowing against a dark, indistinct background, which suggests a forest or a nighttime setting. To the right of the unicorn, there is a vertical element that looks like a decorative border or a pillar, rendered in warm tones of gold and red.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the artistic style.**\nThe art style is painterly and detailed, characteristic of fantasy illustrations for young adult novels. The specific style, with its slightly whimsical character design and rich color palette, is highly recognizable to fans of a particular major fantasy series.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the elements to a specific story or series.**\nThe combination of a unicorn in a dark forest is a key scene in the *Harry Potter* series. Specifically, in the first book, Harry Potter has an encounter in the Forbidden Forest where he sees a dead unicorn and the cloaked figure of Lord Voldemort drinking its blood. The ethereal, silvery appearance of the unicorn in the illustration is consistent with its magical nature as described in the books.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific book cover.**\nThe artwork style is that of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original US editions of the *Harry Potter* series. While this specific image of the unicorn is not on the front cover of the first book, it is a prominent part of the full wraparound dust jacket illustration for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (the US title for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*). The image of the unicorn is located on the back cover portion of the dust jacket, depicting the scene from the Forbidden Forest. The golden/red pillar on the right is part of the border framing the illustration on the back cover.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the book title.**\nBased on the specific scene depicted (the unicorn in the Forbidden Forest) and the distinct art style of Mary GrandPré for the US editions, the fragment belongs to the cover art of the first book in the series.\n\nTherefore, the title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
