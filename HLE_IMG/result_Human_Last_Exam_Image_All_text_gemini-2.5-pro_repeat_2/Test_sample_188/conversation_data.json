    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, |V| = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** Let's list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4.\n*   Listing the unique edges, we get:\n    E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G can be computed using the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is any edge in the graph G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G · e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (the two vertices of `e` are merged into a single vertex, and any resulting multiple edges are replaced by a single edge).\n\nWe choose an edge that simplifies the graph upon deletion and contraction. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)**.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e\n\n*   **Graph G - e:** This is the original graph with the edge (3, 4) removed.\n    *   Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    *   Edges: {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n*   **Structure of G - e:** The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 5, 4} now forms a 4-cycle (C4): 2-3-5-4-2. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5, which are non-adjacent vertices in this C4.\n*   **Calculation:** We can compute P(G - e, k) by considering the colorings of the C4 subgraph {2,3,5,4} first, and then coloring vertex 1. Let H be this C4. The number of ways to color H depends on whether c(2) and c(5) are the same or different.\n    1.  **Case c(2) = c(5):** The number of k-colorings of a C4 where two non-adjacent vertices have the same color is k(k-1)². In this case, vertex 1 is connected to only one color, so it has (k-1) coloring choices.\n        *   Contribution: k(k-1)² * (k-1) = k(k-1)³.\n    2.  **Case c(2) ≠ c(5):** The number of k-colorings of a C4 where two non-adjacent vertices have different colors is k(k-1)(k-2)². In this case, vertex 1 is connected to two different colors, so it has (k-2) coloring choices.\n        *   Contribution: k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)³.\n*   **P(G - e, k):** Summing the two cases:\n    P(G - e, k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n    = k(k³ - 3k² + 3k - 1) + k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\n    = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k²-k)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\n    = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 12k³ - 8k² - k⁴ + 6k³ - 12k² + 8k)\n    = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 18k³ - 20k² + 8k)\n    = **k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G · e\n\n*   **Graph G · e:** This is the graph formed by contracting the edge e = (3, 4). We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new vertex, let's call it `v34`.\n    *   Vertices: {1, 2, 5, v34}\n    *   Edges:\n        *   (1,2) and (1,5) remain.\n        *   (2,3) becomes (2, v34).\n        *   (2,4) also becomes (2, v34). This is a multiple edge, so we keep one: (2, v34).\n        *   (3,5) becomes (v34, 5).\n        *   (4,5) also becomes (v34, 5). We keep one: (v34, 5).\n    *   The resulting edges are {(1,2), (1,5), (2, v34), (5, v34)}.\n*   **Structure of G · e:** These edges form a 4-cycle (C4) on the vertices 1-2-v34-5-1.\n*   **Calculation:** The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph C_n is P(C_n, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1). For C4:\n    P(G · e, k) = P(C4, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1)\n    = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k - 1)\n    = **k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6 - 1)k⁴ + (15 + 4)k³ + (-17 - 6)k² + (7 + 3)k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Verification (Careful Points Check)\n*   **Degree:** The degree of the polynomial is 5, which matches the number of vertices.\n*   **Leading Coefficients:** The coefficient of k⁵ is 1. The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which matches the negative of the number of edges.\n*   **Alternating Signs:** The signs of the coefficients alternate (+, -, +, -, +), which is expected for chromatic polynomials.\n*   **P(G,1):** 1 - 7 + 19 - 23 + 10 = 0. A connected graph cannot be 1-colored, so P(G,1) should be 0.\n*   **P(G,2):** 2⁵ - 7(2⁴) + 19(2³) - 23(2²) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0. The graph contains triangles (e.g., 2-3-4), so it is not 2-colorable. P(G,2) should be 0.\nAll checks confirm the result. The polynomial can also be written in factored form as k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\nThe final computed chromatic polynomial is:\nk⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
