    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, specifically friedelan-3β-ol. It is treated with catalytic hydrochloric acid (cat. HCl) at high temperature (110 °C). These are the classic conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol, which often proceeds via an E1 mechanism involving a carbocation intermediate. The complex, strained polycyclic structure of the starting material makes it prone to extensive carbocation rearrangements, known as Wagner-Meerwein shifts or, in this context, a backbone rearrangement. The problem statement confirms this by mentioning \"a number of [1,2] shifts\". The product shown is a rearranged alkene with the molecular formula C30H50, consistent with the loss of one molecule of water (H2O) from the starting material (C30H52O).\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism**\n1.  **Protonation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C3 is protonated by the acid catalyst (HCl) to form a good leaving group, water (-OH2+).\n2.  **Formation of Carbocation:** The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at C3.\n3.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and triggers a cascade of [1,2] shifts (migrations of adjacent hydride (H:-) or methide (CH3:- R:-) groups) to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This series of shifts continues across the molecular backbone, driven by the release of ring strain inherent in the friedelane skeleton. This specific transformation is famously known as the Friedelane-Oleanane rearrangement.\n4.  **Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade terminates when a carbocation is formed from which a stable alkene can be generated. In this case, the final carbocation forms at C13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent C12, forming a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13. This final product is known as Olean-12-ene.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Structure of the Product and its Substituents**\nThe product of the Friedelane-Oleanane rearrangement is the Oleanane skeleton. The specific product shown, with the double bond at the C12-C13 position, is Olean-12-ene. To determine the substituents at the numbered positions, we need to know the standard methyl group pattern of the Oleanane skeleton.\n\nThe Oleanane skeleton has the following key angular methyl groups and other substituents:\n*   **C4:** Two methyl groups.\n*   **C8:** One methyl group.\n*   **C10:** One methyl group.\n*   **C14:** One methyl group.\n*   **C18:** One hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 4: Map the Numbered Positions to the Product Structure**\nNow, we map the numbered positions from the provided image onto the known structure of Olean-12-ene.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This is located on carbon C4 of the A-ring. In the Oleanane skeleton, C4 bears two methyl groups. Thus, the substituent at position 1 is a methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2:** This is located at the junction of rings A and B, which is carbon C10. The Oleanane skeleton has a methyl group at C10.\n    *   **2 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 3:** This is located at the junction of rings B and C, which is carbon C8. The Oleanane skeleton has a methyl group at C8.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4:** This is located at the junction of rings C and D, which is carbon C14. The Oleanane skeleton has a methyl group at C14. The drawing shows this substituent pointing up (β stereochemistry), which is correct for the methyl group at C14.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 5:** This is also shown at the C/D ring junction area, specifically at C14, but pointing down and back (α stereochemistry). However, C14 in the Oleanane skeleton is a quaternary carbon with only one methyl substituent. The drawing is slightly ambiguous here. The most plausible interpretation is that position 5 refers to the substituent on the adjacent carbon C18. The C18 position in the Oleanane skeleton bears a single hydrogen atom, which has the correct α stereochemistry.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n**Summary of Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = CH3\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
