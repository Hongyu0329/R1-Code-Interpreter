    "This question requires identifying the biological sex of six insects, presented in three pairs (A, B, C). We need to use common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps). The prompt provides helpful context: these are pollinators without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs on the legs) and both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\n*   **General Information:** These are kleptoparasitic bees, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Females do not collect pollen, so they lack scopae, which fits the problem's description.\n*   **Left Insect (A-left):** This bee has a very long, sharply pointed abdomen that tapers to a cone. This is the characteristic abdomen shape of a female *Coelioxys*. She uses this pointed ovipositor to pierce the host's nest material to lay her egg.\n*   **Right Insect (A-right):** This bee has a much blunter abdomen. The tip is not a single point but has several small spines or projections. This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is Female (F), and the right insect is Male (M). This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\n*   **General Information:** Wasps are also Hymenoptera and do not have scopae as they typically hunt other insects to feed their young, though adults drink nectar.\n*   **Left Insect (B-left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. They are distinctly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a classic and reliable trait for identifying male wasps in many families, including Vespidae (which includes paper wasps).\n*   **Right Insect (B-right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight and not curled at the tip. This is characteristic of a female wasp. Additionally, the abdomen ends in a point where the stinger is located.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is Male (M), and the right insect is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (Tribe Eucerini, likely *Melissodes*)**\n*   **General Information:** The common name for this group comes from a key sexual dimorphism. While female long-horned bees do have prominent scopae, males do not, fitting the prompt's condition for at least one sex.\n*   **Left Insect (C-left):** This bee exhibits two clear male characteristics. First, its antennae are exceptionally long, extending far back beyond its head. This is the \"long-horned\" trait of the males. Second, it has a prominent yellow or cream-colored patch on its face (the clypeus).\n*   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow patch seen on the male.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is Male (M), and the right insect is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Summary of Indices:**\n*   For pair A, the correct choice is **4** (F, M).\n*   For pair B, the correct choice is **3** (M, F).\n*   For pair C, the correct choice is **3** (M, F).\n\nCombining these indices in the required format gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
