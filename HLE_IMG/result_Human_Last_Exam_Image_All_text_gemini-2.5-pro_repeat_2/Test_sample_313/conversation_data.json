    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual clue.**\nThe image provided shows a bearded man in a suit receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man. The event appears to be a formal awards ceremony. The question specifies that the photo was from an event on June 20, 2019. Researching major awards ceremonies around that date points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer) that night. The man presenting the award is identifiable as NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clue.**\nThe second part of the clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical process, object, or profession that involved mercury compounds and was discontinued because of the health dangers.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the connection based on the textual clue.**\nThe most famous historical profession associated with mercury poisoning is that of a **hatter**. Hat makers, or hatters, used a solution of mercury(II) nitrate in a process called \"carroting\" to separate fur from the hide and mat it together to make felt. Chronic exposure to mercury vapor caused a neurological disorder known as erethism, or \"mad hatter disease,\" characterized by symptoms like tremors, shyness, and irritability. This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" This dangerous practice has long since been discontinued.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the two clues.**\nWe need to find a term \"X Y\" that links the person in the picture (Nikita Kucherov) to the profession of a hatter.\n*   The person pictured is a famous ice hockey player.\n*   In ice hockey, when a player scores three goals in a single game, it is called a \"hat trick.\"\n*   A player known for scoring, particularly one who achieves hat tricks, can be described as a \"hatter\" (i.e., one who makes hats/hat tricks). Nikita Kucherov, as one of the league's top scorers, fits this description.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\nThe term \"X Y\" is **Hatter**.\n*   The first clue is satisfied because a \"hatter\" (in the hockey sense, a player who scores hat tricks like Nikita Kucherov) is pictured at the 2019 NHL awards.\n*   The second clue is satisfied because \"another hatter\" (the historical profession of making felt hats) has ceased to use mercury salts due to their toxicity.\n\nTherefore, \"Hatter\" is the single term that resolves both parts of the riddle.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
