    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nAn erasure or collage poem uses existing text and images, selecting certain parts to create a new work. To determine the full text of the poem, we must consider all the textual elements presented on the page that could plausibly be part of the new artistic creation.\nThe most prominent words are the cut-out pieces of text:\n- \"rules\"\n- \"and\"\n- \"lines,\"\n- \"an intricate spider's web\"\n- \"work\"\n\nHowever, the page itself, which serves as the canvas, also contains text from its original printing:\n- The title at the top: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n- The page number: \"35\"\n\nIn found poetry, it's common to incorporate such elements. Let's try combining all these textual parts into a single phrase or sentence, following a natural reading order from top to bottom. This gives us: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables in the constructed sentence.**\nTo analyze the metric pattern, we need to count the syllables in the full line of the poem.\n- \"The first step\": 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 syllables\n- \"thirty-five\": thir-ty (2) + five (1) = 3 syllables\n- \"rules\": 1 syllable\n- \"and\": 1 syllable\n- \"lines,\": 1 syllable\n- \"an\": 1 syllable\n- \"in-tri-cate\": 3 syllables\n- \"spi-der's\": 2 syllables\n- \"web\": 1 syllable\n- \"work\": 1 syllable\n\nAdding them all up: 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 17 syllables.\nThe poem can be read as a single sentence containing exactly 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the given answer choices based on the syllable count and structure.**\nNow we evaluate each option:\n*   **A. free verse:** This form has no regular meter or syllable count. Since we have found a very specific syllable count (17), this is likely incorrect.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, usually in iambic hexameter. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** This is a stanzaic form where the first three lines have 11 syllables each, with a specific trochaic meter. Our poem is a single line of 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form has lines of roughly 6 syllables (three iambs). Our poem is a single line of 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a poetic form, invented by the poet Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe poem, when all textual elements on the page are included, forms a single sentence of 17 syllables. This perfectly matches the definition of an \"American Sentence\". The inclusion of this specific and less common poetic form as an answer choice strongly suggests that this multi-element reading is the intended one.\n\n<<<F>>>"
