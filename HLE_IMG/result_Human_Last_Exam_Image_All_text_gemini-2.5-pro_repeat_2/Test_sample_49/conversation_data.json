    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\n\nThe circuit shown is a resistive ladder network terminated with a capacitor `C`. The output is taken at node $a_0$, across the capacitor. This configuration forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency (or corner frequency) is the frequency at which the output signal's power is attenuated to half its passband power. For a first-order filter like this one, this corresponds to the frequency $\\omega_c$ where the magnitude of the output voltage drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum (DC) value.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ for a simple RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the network \"seen\" by the capacitor $C$.\n\nOur goal is therefore to calculate this Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$, at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit connected to the capacitor's terminals (node $a_0$ and ground), with all independent sources turned off. The input signal \"IN\" at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so turning it off means replacing it with a short circuit to ground. Therefore, node $c_0$ is grounded for the $R_{th}$ calculation.\n\n$R_{th}$ is the resistance looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground, with $c_0$ also connected to ground. This is equivalent to finding the resistance between nodes $a_0$ and $c_0$ of the resistive ladder network.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Infinite Ladder Network**\n\nThe circuit is a semi-infinite ladder network starting from the first section defined by nodes $(c_0, a_0)$ and $(c_1, d_1)$. The ladder extends infinitely to the right (as indicated by $c_\\infty, d_\\infty$). The structure is self-similar.\n\nTo find the resistance between $a_0$ and $c_0$, we can first find the equivalent resistance of the infinite part of the ladder, looking to the right from the node pair $(c_1, d_1)$. Let's call this resistance $R_{in}$. This will be the resistance measured between nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe resistance $R_{in}$ is composed of the horizontal resistor $r$ between $c_1$ and $d_1$, in parallel with the rest of the ladder to the right. The path through the rest of the ladder consists of the vertical resistor $r$ from $c_1$ to $c_2$, followed by the resistance of the subsequent ladder section (which is also $R_{in}$ by the infinite self-similarity), and then the vertical resistor $r$ from $d_2$ back to $d_1$.\n\nThis gives us a recurrence relation:\n$R_{in} = r \\parallel (r + R_{in} + r)$\n$R_{in} = \\frac{r (2r + R_{in})}{r + (2r + R_{in})} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_{in}}{3r + R_{in}}$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Ladder's Input Resistance ($R_{in}$)**\n\nWe now solve the equation for $R_{in}$:\n$R_{in}(3r + R_{in}) = 2r^2 + r R_{in}$\n$3r R_{in} + R_{in}^2 = 2r^2 + r R_{in}$\n$R_{in}^2 + 2r R_{in} - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_{in}$. Using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2}$\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n$R_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nNow we can calculate $R_{th}$, which is the resistance between $a_0$ and $c_0$. The path from $a_0$ to $c_0$ goes through:\n1. The vertical resistor $r$ from $a_0$ to $d_1$.\n2. The equivalent resistance $R_{in}$ of the infinite ladder section between $d_1$ and $c_1$.\n3. The vertical resistor $r$ from $c_1$ to $c_0$.\n\nThese three resistances are in series. Therefore:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{in} + r = 2r + R_{in}$\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n$R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Cutoff Frequency ($\\omega_c$)**\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff frequency:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rationalize the denominator:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC((\\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC(3-1)}$\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2rC}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff angular frequency at node $a_0$."
