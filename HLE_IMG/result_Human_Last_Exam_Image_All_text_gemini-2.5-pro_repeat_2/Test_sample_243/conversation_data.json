    "*   **Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.**\n    The plant shown in the image has very distinctive leaves. They are dark green, elongated (lanceolate), and feature a prominent, intricate network of lighter green or whitish veins. This pattern is known as reticulate venation. The leaves appear to be arranged in whorls around the stem. A search based on these features, particularly the unique leaf venation, points towards the species *Bencomia caudata*. Comparing images of *Bencomia caudata* confirms the identification; the leaf shape, color, and remarkable vein pattern are a perfect match.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\n    The question asks for the specific island to which this plant was endemic. Research on *Bencomia caudata* reveals that it is a species in the rose family (Rosaceae) and is endemic to the Macaronesian region.\n\n*   **Step 3: Pinpoint the specific island.**\n    *Bencomia caudata* is native to the Canary Islands archipelago. It is found on several of the islands, including Tenerife, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro. However, the question asks for \"the island\" in the singular. This suggests we need to find the island most associated with the plant.\n    The etymology of the plant's name provides a crucial clue. The genus name, *Bencomia*, was established by botanist Philip Barker Webb. He named it in honor of Bencomo, who was the last Guanche *mencey* (king) of the Menceyato of Taoro, one of the nine kingdoms on the island of **Tenerife** before the Spanish conquest. This direct historical and cultural link to a specific person from Tenerife makes it the most logical answer for the singular \"island\" requested.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    Based on the plant's identification as *Bencomia caudata* and the etymological origin of its genus name, the island it is most specifically associated with is Tenerife.\n\n<<<Tenerife>>>"
