    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify and count the total number of unique mRNA splice species detected by the different RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. A splice species is a distinct mRNA molecule produced by a specific pattern of splicing.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **RT-PCR:** This technique amplifies cDNA that has been reverse-transcribed from mRNA. Therefore, the bands on the gel represent different mRNA transcripts present in the samples.\n*   **Splicing:** The presence of multiple bands from a single primer pair indicates alternative splicing.\n*   **Splice-Junction Primers:** Primers like E1F2 and E1F3 are designed to span a specific splice junction, meaning they will only amplify transcripts that have undergone that particular splice.\n*   **Early vs. Late Transcripts:** The genome has an early (AE) and a late (AL) polyadenylation site. Reverse primers located before AL (like E4R, E5R) detect early transcripts, while primers located after AE (like L2R, L1R) detect late transcripts. An mRNA with the same splice pattern but different polyadenylation sites is considered a different species.\n*   **Unique Bands:** Each unique band represents a unique PCR product, which in turn corresponds to a specific mRNA splice species. We must be careful not to double-count species that are detected in multiple experiments.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Panel:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This reaction uses a forward primer in E1 and a reverse primer in E4. It detects early transcripts.\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands are visible (band 1: 190 bp, band 2: 159 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates the presence of **2** different early splice species. The 31 bp difference suggests the inclusion or exclusion of a small exon.\n\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This reaction uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a reverse primer further downstream (E5R). It also detects early transcripts.\n    *   **Observation:** Two bands are visible (band 1: 584 bp, band 2: 553 bp). The size difference is again 31 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** These are the same two splice species identified in Panel B, confirmed with a different primer. No new species are identified. **Total species so far: 2**.\n\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This reaction uses a splice-junction-specific forward primer (E1F2, for the 929^3465 splice).\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band is visible (551 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a new early splice species that specifically contains the 929^3465 splice. **1 new species**. **Total species so far: 2 + 1 = 3**.\n\n4.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This reaction uses a reverse primer in the late region (L2R), so it detects late transcripts.\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band is visible (1,005 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a new late splice species. **1 new species**. **Total species so far: 3 + 1 = 4**.\n\n5.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This reaction uses the splice-junction primer E1F2 and the late reverse primer L2R.\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band is visible (972 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a new late splice species that contains the 929^3465 splice. It is distinct from the one in Panel E (different splice) and Panel D (late vs. early transcript). **1 new species**. **Total species so far: 4 + 1 = 5**.\n\n6.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This reaction uses a different splice-junction primer (E1F3, for the 929^3506 splice) and the late primer L2R.\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands are visible (band 1: 1,003 bp, band 2: 931 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies two new late splice species. Both contain the 929^3506 splice but differ by an internal alternative splicing event (72 bp difference). **2 new species**. **Total species so far: 5 + 2 = 7**.\n\n7.  **Panel H (E1F1/L1R):** This reaction uses a reverse primer even further downstream in the late region (L1R).\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands are visible (band 1: 450 bp, band 2: 419 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** These are two late transcripts. The 31 bp size difference indicates they likely correspond to the same alternative splicing event seen in the early transcripts in Panel B, but these are distinct late species. They are different from other late species (in E, F, G) based on primer usage and product size. **2 new species**. **Total species so far: 7 + 2 = 9**.\n\n8.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is a more sensitive version of the reaction in Panel H.\n    *   **Observation:** Four distinct bands are visible (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Bands 1 and 2 are the same species identified in Panel H. Bands 3 (378 bp) and 4 (187 bp) are new, less abundant late splice species that were not visible at lower cycle numbers. **2 new species**. **Total species so far: 9 + 2 = 11**.\n\n**Final Count:**\nBy systematically analyzing each panel and identifying the unique products, we can sum the number of distinct species found:\n*   From Panel B: 2 species\n*   From Panel D: 1 new species\n*   From Panel E: 1 new species\n*   From Panel F: 1 new species\n*   From Panel G: 2 new species\n*   From Panel H: 2 new species\n*   From Panel I: 2 new species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 distinct splice species identified in this image.\n\n<<<11>>>"
