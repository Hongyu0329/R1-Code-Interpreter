    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens provided in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Overall Approach**\nTo identify the rocks, we will examine their key physical characteristics, primarily texture (grain size, shape, and arrangement) and color (which can indicate mineral composition). These features help classify rocks into the three main types (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic) and their specific sub-types. All specimens appear to be igneous or related to volcanic activity.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Specimen H**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous or bubbly appearance. The holes, known as vesicles, are numerous and relatively large. The underlying rock material is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are too small to be seen with the naked eye.\n*   **Careful Points:** The key features are the vesicular texture and the reddish color. Vesicles form when gas bubbles are trapped in lava as it cools and solidifies quickly. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation (rusting) of iron-rich minerals.\n*   **Identification:** These characteristics are classic for **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder). It is an extrusive igneous rock that forms from lava rich in volcanic gases.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Specimen J**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. The texture appears frothy and lightweight. It is also fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Careful Points:** The combination of a light (felsic) color and extreme vesicularity is distinctive. Felsic lavas are silica-rich and viscous, which allows them to trap a large amount of gas, creating a very porous structure.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. Pumice is an extrusive igneous rock so full of gas bubbles that its density is often low enough to float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of Specimen I**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is composed of various smaller rock fragments (clasts) that are angular in shape. These fragments are of different colors and sizes and are cemented together in a fine-grained, lighter-colored matrix.\n*   **Careful Points:** The defining feature is its clastic texture, made of broken pieces of other rocks. The angularity of the clasts suggests they were not transported far before being lithified (turned into rock). This type of rock is associated with explosive volcanic eruptions.\n*   **Identification:** This is a **Volcanic Breccia**. It is a pyroclastic rock formed from the consolidation of angular volcanic fragments (larger than 2 mm) ejected during an explosive eruption. If the matrix was predominantly ash, it could also be called a tuff-breccia.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of Specimen K**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic. The crystals are of various minerals, including light-colored ones (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker minerals.\n*   **Careful Points:** The large crystal size is the most important clue. This indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, giving crystals a long time to grow. Slow cooling occurs deep beneath the Earth's surface.\n*   **Identification:** The very coarse-grained texture points to this being a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks characterized by their exceptionally large crystals. Based on the light color, it has a granitic composition.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
