    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of propanoyl chloride, facilitating the formation of a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n    *   **Mechanism:** FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br-Br bond, generating an electrophilic bromine species (\"Br⁺\"). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors for further electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position *meta* to the propanoyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction reduces the carbonyl group. For ketones where the carbonyl is adjacent to a benzene ring (benzylic ketones), catalytic hydrogenation often results in complete reduction of the C=O group to a CH₂ group (hydrogenolysis), rather than just stopping at the alcohol stage. The aryl-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone is reduced to an alkane. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the 1 and 3 positions, respectively.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), CCl₄ (solvent).\n    *   **Mechanism:** NBS is a specific reagent for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. The reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. A hydrogen atom is abstracted from the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring) because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized. This radical then reacts with NBS to form the brominated product.\n    *   **Site of reaction:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the first CH₂ group of the propyl chain.\n    *   **Product:** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** A propane chain where C1 is attached to a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n    *   **Name of the Final Product:** The parent alkane is propane. At position 1, there is a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl substituent. Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
