    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image and the question.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Request**\nThe request asks for two main pieces of information about a \"square ancient structure\" shown in a satellite image at specific coordinates (29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W):\n1.  The identity of the structure.\n2.  Whether it is an official historic landmark.\n\n**Step 2: Examination of the Image**\n*   The image provided is a satellite view of an arid, desert-like landscape.\n*   Visible features include sparse vegetation (scrub brush), unpaved dirt tracks, and a larger paved or graded road running diagonally across the lower portion of the image.\n*   The \"square structure\" is visible slightly to the right of the center in the upper half of the image. It is not a perfectly preserved building but rather the faint, square-shaped outline of ruins or foundations on the ground. The outline is defined by a slight change in soil color and/or vegetation growth, with some darker spots inside that could be remnants of walls or larger collapsed features.\n\n**Step 3: Geolocation and Context**\n*   The coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W are plotted using a mapping tool.\n*   This location is in Presidio County, Texas, USA, in the Chihuahuan Desert region.\n*   The area is remote, situated between the towns of Marfa and Presidio.\n*   This region has a rich history, including Native American inhabitation, Spanish colonial presence, and 19th-century American ranching and military activities. This makes the presence of historical ruins plausible.\n\n**Step 4: Research and Identification**\n*   A search for historical or archaeological sites at or near these specific coordinates leads to the identification of the **ruins of El Fortín de la Ciénega** (also known as Fort Cienega).\n*   This structure was a private fort, part of the larger **Milton Faver Ranch Complex**.\n*   **History:** Milton Faver was a prominent cattle rancher who established several ranches in the area in the mid-to-late 19th century. To protect his livestock and operations from raids, he built fortified ranch houses, or *fortins*. El Fortín de la Ciénega was one of these forts, constructed around the 1850s-1870s. It was typically built of adobe and featured a square or rectangular layout, often with defensive bastions at the corners, which aligns with the outline seen in the satellite image. The structure is now in ruins.\n\n**Step 5: Determining Historic Landmark Status**\n*   Further research is conducted to verify if this site has official historical recognition.\n*   The **Milton Faver Ranch Complex**, which includes the ruins of El Fortín de la Ciénega, is listed on the **National Register of Historic Places**. It was added to the register in 1977.\n*   It is also recognized as a **Recorded Texas Historic Landmark**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe square structure visible in the image at the given coordinates are the ruins of a 19th-century private fort called El Fortín de la Ciénega. It was part of the Milton Faver Ranch Complex and, yes, it is an officially recognized historic landmark, listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark.\n\n<<<The structure shown in the image at the given coordinates is the ruins of **El Fortín de la Ciénega** (also known as Fort Cienega), a 19th-century private fort built by rancher Milton Faver. Yes, it is a historic landmark. The Milton Faver Ranch Complex, which includes these ruins, is listed on the **National Register of Historic Places** and is also a **Recorded Texas Historic Landmark**.>>>"
