    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\nThe image displays a circular bas-relief sculpture, known as a tondo or roundel. It is set within a highly decorated frame. The scene depicted is a Christian religious ceremony. A priest, standing on the left by an altar with a lit candle, is administering a sacrament to a kneeling child. Several other figures, including what appear to be monks and other laity, are also kneeling in attitudes of prayer and devotion. The style of the figures—their postures, drapery, and facial features—is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the inscription.**\nAt the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with an inscription. The text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\".\n*   \"Sacramenti\" is Latin for \"of the sacrament\".\n*   \"De l'autel\" is French for \"of the altar\".\nThe inscription translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" a common term for the Eucharist or Holy Communion. This confirms the subject matter of the relief.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the medium and style for attribution.**\nThe artwork is a glazed terracotta relief. This specific medium, combined with the High Renaissance style—characterized by graceful figures, balanced composition, and serene expressions—is a hallmark of the Florentine workshop founded by Luca della Robbia and continued by his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's sons.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific artwork and its context.**\nBy searching for \"Sacrament of the Altar\" reliefs by \"della Robbia,\" we can identify this specific roundel. It is a detail from the predella (the base platform) of a large altarpiece. This particular altarpiece is known as the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments\" or the \"Pala di Cutigliano\". The predella features seven roundels, each depicting one of the seven sacraments, and this is the one representing the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the author.**\nThe \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments\" located in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Cutigliano, Italy, is a well-documented work. Art historians attribute this altarpiece to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435–1525) and his workshop. Andrea was a master of glazed terracotta sculpture and inherited the famous workshop from his uncle, Luca.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinctive style, the medium of glazed terracotta, the inscription, and the identification of the work as a detail from the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments\" in Cutigliano, the author is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
