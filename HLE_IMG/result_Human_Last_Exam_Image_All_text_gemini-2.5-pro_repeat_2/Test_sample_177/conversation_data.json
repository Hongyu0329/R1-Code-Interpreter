    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** The total number of miles traveled by vehicles. The number of occupants in the vehicle does not affect VMT. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are not relevant to this calculation.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a sum of the VMT from different trip distance categories. Each category's contribution is weighted by its share of total trips.\n*   **Car VMT:** This includes VMT from both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total car mode share for each distance bracket.**\nFor both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios, we need to add the mode shares of the two car categories.\n\n**Baseline (Table 1):**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\n**Proposed (Table 2):**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\n**Step 2: Calculate a representative total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.**\nTo do this, we'll calculate a weighted VMT factor by multiplying the share of trips, the car mode share, and the average distance for each bracket, and then summing them up. This factor represents the average VMT per trip.\n\n*   **VMT from 0-3 miles trips:** 0.48 (share of total trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **VMT from 3-5 miles trips:** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **VMT from 5-10 miles trips:** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **VMT from 10+ miles trips:** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT Factor:** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate a representative total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.**\nWe perform the same calculation using the Proposed scenario's car mode shares.\n\n*   **VMT from 0-3 miles trips:** 0.48 (share of total trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **VMT from 3-5 miles trips:** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **VMT from 5-10 miles trips:** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **VMT from 10+ miles trips:** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT Factor:** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage reduction.**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 (Baseline) - 2.2505 (Proposed) = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
