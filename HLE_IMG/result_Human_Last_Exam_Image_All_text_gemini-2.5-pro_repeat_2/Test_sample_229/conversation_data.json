    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Notation and Markings**\n\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, as indicated by the \"C\" symbol (common time) after the treble clef, though it's partially obscured. A 4/4 time signature is written out in the first measure.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is \"MOD. J=128\". \"MOD.\" is an abbreviation for \"Moderato,\" meaning a moderate speed. The metronome marking specifies 128 quarter notes per minute. This is a relaxed, walking pace.\n*   **Key:** There is no key signature, but the piece consistently uses chords rooted in the C major scale (C, D-, E7, F, G7, A-). The first chord is C, and the Coda ends on a C chord, strongly indicating the piece is in the key of C Major.\n*   **Instrumentation and Format:** The music is written on a single treble clef staff with chord symbols written above (e.g., C, E7, F, G7). This is a \"lead sheet\" or \"fake book\" format, common for jazz, pop, and commercial music. It provides the melody and harmonic structure for an ensemble.\n*   **Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes, rests on the downbeats, and notes tied across barlines. This rhythmic feel is characteristic of jazz and related Latin American styles.\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression is typical of jazz standards. It uses common progressions like ii-V-I (D- to G7 to C) and secondary dominants (E7, which is the V7 of A minor, though here it resolves deceptively to F).\n*   **Form:** The sheet includes performance directions like repeat signs (ùÑá), a segno sign (ùÑã), and a \"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA\" instruction. This indicates a standard song form (likely AABA) that is repeated for solos before a final return to the theme and a concluding Coda section.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\n\nThe combination of the following elements points strongly to a specific style:\n1.  **Relaxed, syncopated rhythm:** The specific pattern of syncopation is not aggressive like bebop or complex like Afro-Cuban music; it's smooth and flowing.\n2.  **Jazz-influenced harmony:** The use of seventh chords, secondary dominants, and standard progressions is a fusion of popular song harmony with jazz.\n3.  **Moderate tempo:** The tempo of 128 bpm is very common for this style.\n\nThese characteristics are the hallmarks of **Bossa Nova**, a musical style that emerged in the late 1950s.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title and Country of Origin**\n\n*   **Melody and Chords:** The opening melody and chord progression are extremely famous and recognizable.\n    *   The first full measure has the melody E-G-A-G-E over a C major chord.\n    *   The second measure repeats this rhythmic motif with the pitches E-G-A-G-E over an E7 chord.\n    *   The third measure continues with F-A-B-A-F over an F major chord.\n*   **Identification:** This sequence is the iconic opening of the song **\"Garota de Ipanema\"**, known worldwide in its English version as **\"The Girl from Ipanema\"**.\n*   **Verification:** \"The Girl from Ipanema\" was composed by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim with lyrics by Vinicius de Moraes. The original and most famous recording is in the key of D-flat major, but it is very commonly transposed to C major (as seen here) or F major in fake books and for different performers.\n*   **Country of Origin:** Bossa Nova, and this song specifically, originated in **Brazil**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and structure presented in the lead sheet, the song is unequivocally identified.\n\n*   **Title:** \"The Girl from Ipanema\" (original Portuguese: \"Garota de Ipanema\")\n*   **Musical Style:** Bossa Nova\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: \"The Girl from Ipanema\" (or \"Garota de Ipanema\"), Musical Style: Bossa Nova, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
