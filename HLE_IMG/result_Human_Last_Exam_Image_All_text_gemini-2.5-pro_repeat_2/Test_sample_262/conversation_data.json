    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context and the question.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), would have shorter operational lifetimes. In this context, a shorter lifetime implies lower chemical or electrochemical stability, leading to faster degradation of the emitter during device operation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.**\nAll four compounds are cationic octahedral iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structural motif: [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺, where Ir is the central iridium ion, (C^N) represents a cyclometalating bidentate ligand, and (N^N) represents a neutral bidentate ligand. The positive charge is balanced by a hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻) counter-anion.\n*   The (N^N) ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this part is constant, it is not the differentiating factor for their lifetimes.\n*   The key difference lies in the nature of the two cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The stability of these complexes is highly dependent on the strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of these cyclometalating ligands.\n\n**Step 3: Relate ligand structure to complex stability and lifetime.**\nThe operational stability of these iridium complexes is a critical parameter for device lifetime. A major degradation pathway involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, which is typically the weakest bond in the coordination sphere. Strategies to strengthen this bond lead to more stable complexes and longer device lifetimes.\nOne of the most effective strategies is the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms onto the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand.\n*   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is highly electronegative. Its presence on the phenyl ring makes the ring more electron-deficient. This strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond, making the complex more resistant to both oxidative and reductive degradation.\n*   **Positional Isomerism of Fluorine:** The position of the fluorine atom is crucial. Fluorination at the *ortho* position (the C2 position of the phenyl ring, adjacent to the carbon atom forming the Ir-C bond) has been shown to be particularly effective in enhancing stability. This is due to a combination of strong inductive electron withdrawal and potential steric protection of the Ir-C bond. Fluorination at the *para* position (C4) also strengthens the bond through electron withdrawal, but the effect is significantly less pronounced than that of *ortho*-fluorination. A non-fluorinated ppy ligand results in the least stable Ir-C bond among these options.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze each complex individually.**\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Both ligands have a fluorine atom at the critical *ortho* position (position 2). This provides very strong stabilization to the Ir-C bonds. Therefore, Complex 1 is expected to be very stable and have a **long lifetime**.\n\n*   **Complex 2:** This is a heteroleptic complex with one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand and one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. While one ligand is stabilized by *ortho*-fluorination, the other (ppy) is not fluorinated at all. The non-fluorinated ppy ligand represents a \"weak link\" in the complex, as its Ir-C bond is significantly weaker and more prone to cleavage. Therefore, Complex 2 is expected to be relatively unstable and have a **shorter lifetime**.\n\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Both ligands have a fluorine atom at the *ortho* position. Similar to Complex 1, this provides significant stabilization to the Ir-C bonds. Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to be very stable and have a **long lifetime**.\n\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligands are 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The fluorine atoms are located at the *para* position. While *para*-fluorination does offer some stabilization compared to a non-fluorinated ligand, it lacks the potent stabilizing effect of *ortho*-fluorination. The Ir-C bonds in Complex 4 are expected to be weaker than those in Complexes 1 and 3. Therefore, Complex 4 is expected to be less stable and have a **shorter lifetime** compared to the *ortho*-fluorinated analogues.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and select the answer.**\nBased on the analysis, the complexes with the highest stability and longest expected lifetimes are Complex 1 and Complex 3, due to the presence of stabilizing *ortho*-fluoro substituents on their cyclometalating ligands.\nConversely, the complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes are those lacking this key stabilizing feature.\n*   Complex 2 is unstable because of the non-fluorinated ppy ligand.\n*   Complex 4 is less stable because it only has the less effective *para*-fluorination.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. Looking at the answer choices, the option that includes both [2] and [4] is I.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Complex [1]: Long lifetime (ortho-fluorination)\n*   Complex [2]: Shorter lifetime (has an unstabilized non-fluorinated ligand)\n*   Complex [3]: Long lifetime (ortho-fluorination)\n*   Complex [4]: Shorter lifetime (lacks ortho-fluorination, only para-fluorination)\n\nThe question asks for the complexes with shorter lifetimes. These are [2] and [4].\n\n<<<I>>>"
