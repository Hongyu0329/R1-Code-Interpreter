    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the medallion.**\nThe object in the image is a circular medallion with a suspension loop at the top. It features two busts in relief, shown in profile facing each other. The style is not naturalistic in the way of classical Greek or early Roman art.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key iconography.**\nThe most prominent figure, on the left, has large, distinct ram's horns curling around the ear. This is a powerful symbol with a long history. It is primarily associated with the Egyptian deity Amun (or Ammon), who was later syncretized with the Greek god Zeus and the Roman god Jupiter. This iconography was famously adopted by Alexander the Great to signify his divine status and was subsequently used by other rulers in the Hellenistic and Roman periods to project power and divine favor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the artistic style for dating clues.**\nThe artistic style provides strong evidence for dating the object. The figures are rendered in a manner characteristic of Late Antiquity. Key features include:\n*   **Stylization:** The facial features, hair, and drapery are not realistically portrayed but are instead stylized and somewhat abstract.\n*   **Large Eyes:** The eyes of the figures are large and prominent, a common trait in Late Roman portraiture that emphasizes spiritual or inner presence over physical likeness.\n*   **Deep Carving:** The relief is deeply carved, creating strong contrasts between light and shadow.\nThis style represents a significant shift away from the classical naturalism that dominated earlier Roman art and is typical of the art produced during and after the reign of Constantine the Great.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific artifact and its historical context.**\nThis is a well-known artifact called the **Kerch Medallion**. It was discovered in a tomb in Kerch (the ancient Greek city of Panticapaeum) on the Crimean Peninsula. The medallion is made of gold and is considered a masterpiece of Late Roman craftsmanship.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the precise dating.**\nArt historians and numismatists identify the imperial figure on the right as the Roman Emperor **Constantius II**, who reigned from 337 to 361 A.D. The medallion was likely produced during his reign, probably as an imperial donative (a gift to high-ranking officials or military officers). This places the object's creation squarely in the middle of the 4th century A.D.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the century.**\nSince the medallion was created during the reign of Constantius II (337-361 A.D.), archaeologists and historians ascribe it to the **4th century A.D.**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The ram's horn iconography is the most important clue, pointing to themes of divine power and rulership common in the Roman Empire.\n*   The artistic style is distinctly Late Antique, ruling out earlier Roman periods.\n*   The identification of the emperor as Constantius II provides a specific and narrow date range.\n*   The find location (Kerch) in a tomb context helps confirm its status as a high-value object from that period.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
