The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the significant steric and electronic asymmetry of its münchnone intermediate, which is derived from N-acetylproline. This intermediate has a methyl group at C2 and a hydrogen atom at C4, making the two reactive termini of the dipole highly distinct. This large difference strongly directs the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to occur in a single orientation, leading to one product.

Reactions 1 and 2 serve to illustrate the contrary case. The münchnone formed from N-acetyl-N-methylalanine has identical methyl groups at both C2 and C4. As the labeling experiment in Reaction 2 demonstrates ("no regioselectivity observed"), the steric identity and electronic similarity of the two termini mean that the incoming alkyne cannot distinguish between them. This lack of differentiation results in a loss of regiocontrol. Therefore, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish the principle that significant asymmetry in the münchnone is required for high regioselectivity, a condition met in Reaction 3 but not in Reactions 1 and 2.
