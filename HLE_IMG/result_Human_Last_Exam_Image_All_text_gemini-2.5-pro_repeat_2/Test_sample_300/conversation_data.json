    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks. The artworks are analyzed from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top-Left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a figure painting depicting women from what appears to be the Yi ethnic minority in China. The style combines traditional Chinese ink wash with color (设色, shèsè) and demonstrates a blend of expressive brushwork and realistic detail. This specific style, particularly the subject matter of ethnic minorities and the dynamic composition, is a hallmark of the contemporary artist **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**. This painting is one of his well-known works, often titled \"Returning from the Market\" (赶场归来) or \"Sisters\" (姐妹).\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top-Middle)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a landscape painting rendered in a highly abstract style. The artist uses bold, calligraphic lines and dots of black ink to represent a mountain city. This method of deconstructing and reassembling landscapes into semi-abstract forms is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a master of modern Chinese painting who integrated Western artistic principles with Chinese traditions. The artwork is reminiscent of his famous series on Chinese cities and landscapes.\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top-Right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in cursive script (草书, cǎoshū). The style is characterized by its fluid, continuous strokes and masterful control of ink, ranging from very wet to very dry, creating a misty and rhythmically powerful effect. This distinctive style is immediately recognizable as that of **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**, who is often called the \"Contemporary Sage of Cursive Script\" for his profound skill in this art form.\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle-Left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another piece of cursive script calligraphy. It is energetic and unrestrained, with powerful and robust brushstrokes. The text appears to be from a Tang dynasty poem. This bold and highly individualistic style of cursive script is characteristic of **Gao Ershi (高二适)**, a prominent 20th-century calligrapher known for his passionate and scholarly approach to the art.\n\n**Artwork 5 (Center)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil painting portraying a young woman in a white shirt, holding a sketchbook and pen. The style is academic realism, heavily influenced by the Soviet school. This is one of the most iconic paintings of the post-Cultural Revolution era in China. It is titled \"Youth\" (青春) and was painted by **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary art who became internationally recognized for his realist paintings.\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle-Right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts a stylized woman in traditional attire, surrounded by sparrows and autumn leaves. The composition is typically square, and the style is a fusion of Chinese ink wash and Western modernism. The elongated, graceful figure with a melancholic expression, the use of rich ink and color, and the decorative quality are all signature elements of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom-Left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting shows a vibrant and lively courtyard scene with a luffa trellis, hanging laundry, and a rooster. The artist uses bright, flat planes of color and strong lines, blending folk art aesthetics with a modern sensibility. This style, particularly in his oil and acrylic works depicting Chinese landscapes and rural life, is characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. This work exemplifies his talent for finding abstract beauty in everyday scenes.\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom-Middle)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a monumental landscape painting in ink and color on paper. It depicts boats navigating a river gorge, with imposing, dark cliffs rendered with heavy, textured ink washes. This technique of building up mountains with layers of ink to create a powerful sense of mass and light is the hallmark of **Li Keran (李可染)**. He was a master of modern Chinese landscape painting, and this work is a classic example of his \"Li-style landscape\" (李家山水).\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom-Right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The brushwork is simple, confident, and full of life, capturing the essence of the creature with a minimum of strokes. The transparent quality of the shell and the energetic posture are characteristic features. This subject and style are famously associated with **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated artists in modern Chinese history, renowned for his paintings of shrimp, crabs, insects, and other small creatures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors of the nine works are:\n\n1.  Shi Guoliang\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Lin Sanzhi\n4.  Gao Ershi\n5.  Chen Yifei\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Shi Guoliang, Wu Guanzhong, Lin Sanzhi, Gao Ershi, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
