    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell is a cube with atoms at all 8 corners and at the center of each of its 6 faces. If we set the origin (0,0,0) at one corner and define the cube edges along the x, y, and z axes with a lattice parameter 'a', the basis atoms within one unit cell are at coordinates (0,0,0), (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), and (0, a/2, a/2). All other atoms in the crystal can be generated by translating these basis atoms by integer multiples of the lattice vectors (a,0,0), (0,a,0), and (0,0,a).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe direction [110] corresponds to a vector from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a,a,0). This is a diagonal on the face of the cube lying on the xy-plane. Viewing the crystal \"along the [110] direction\" means we are looking at the projection of all the atoms onto a plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen the 3D FCC lattice is projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D pattern. This pattern is known to be a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n*   The unit cell of this 2D projected pattern is a rectangle.\n*   There are atoms at each of the four corners of this rectangle.\n*   There is an additional atom precisely in the center of the rectangle.\n*   The ratio of the side lengths of this rectangle is âˆš2 : 1.\n*   The crystal structure consists of stacked layers of this pattern. The layers are stacked in an ABAB... sequence, meaning the pattern in the second layer is shifted relative to the first, the third layer aligns with the first, and so on.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each of the Given Images**\nWe need to examine the arrangement of atoms (projected onto the plane of the image) in each of the four options to see which one matches the \"centered rectangular\" pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** The atoms in the projection do not form a simple centered rectangle. If we try to define a rectangle using the outermost atoms, there is no atom at its center. The pattern seems more complex, possibly representing a different crystal structure or orientation.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in the projection appear to be arranged in a pattern with some hexagonal characteristics. This is typical for projections along the [111] direction in cubic crystals (both FCC and BCC), but it is not the centered rectangular pattern expected for the [110] direction.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms in this projection form a simple rectangular (or square) lattice. We can identify rectangles with atoms at the corners, but there are no atoms at the centers of these rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along [100], or the corners of an FCC/BCC [100] view, but it lacks the necessary centering atom.\n\n*   **Image D:** Let's analyze the arrangement of the atoms in the foreground (the lighter gray spheres). There are four atoms forming a rectangle with approximate corner coordinates (1,6), (5,6), (1,12), and (5,12). There is another atom located at (3,9). The center of the rectangle defined by the four corner atoms is at x=(1+5)/2=3 and y=(6+12)/2=9. The fifth atom is exactly at this central position. This perfectly matches the **centered rectangular pattern** characteristic of the FCC [110] projection. The image also shows a second, identical centered rectangular pattern (darker gray spheres) shifted from the first one, which represents the next layer in the ABAB... stacking sequence along the viewing direction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, only Image D shows the centered rectangular arrangement of atoms that is the signature of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
