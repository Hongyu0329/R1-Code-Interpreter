    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the scene.**\nThe image is from an ancient Greek red-figure vase. We can see several figures and elements:\n*   **A chariot:** A two-wheeled chariot is central to the scene, drawn by a horse (partially visible on the left).\n*   **The driver:** A figure wearing elaborate clothing, including a sleeve with a dotted pattern and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap with the top pulled forward, associated with people from the East, like Trojans or Lydians). This figure is holding the reins and driving the chariot.\n*   **The passenger:** A figure with flowing drapery is positioned next to the driver. This figure appears to be in the process of dismounting or being lifted from the chariot. The posture suggests they are a passenger being claimed or assisted by the driver.\n*   **A fallen figure:** Beneath the chariot, a muscular, nude male figure lies on the ground in a contorted pose, suggesting defeat or death.\n*   **A winged figure:** Hovering above the chariot is a winged female figure, identifiable as Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. She is flying towards the driver, likely to crown him with a wreath (partially visible in her hand).\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the narrative based on the iconography.**\nThe combination of these elements points to a specific mythological story.\n*   The chariot race is the central event.\n*   The presence of Nike confirms that the race has just concluded with a victory for the driver.\n*   The fallen figure represents the loser of the race.\n*   The driver is the victor, and the passenger is likely the prize or a person being rescued/abducted as a result of the victory.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific myth.**\nThis composition strongly illustrates the myth of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus for the hand of Princess Hippodamia.\n*   **King Oenomaus:** The king of Pisa, he challenged all suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. He would give the suitor a head start, then pursue and kill him from behind with a spear. The fallen figure represents King Oenomaus, who was defeated and killed.\n*   **Pelops:** A hero from Lydia (an Anatolian kingdom, which explains his \"oriental\" Phrygian cap), he was the suitor who finally defeated Oenomaus. He accomplished this by bribing the king's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the royal chariot. Pelops is the victorious driver of the chariot.\n*   **Hippodamia:** The daughter of Oenomaus. Her hand in marriage was the prize for winning the race. The figure leaving the chariot is therefore Hippodamia, being claimed by the victor, Pelops.\n*   **Nike:** Her presence signifies Pelops' divine-sanctioned victory.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identity of the figure.**\nBased on the mythological context provided by all the figures in the scene, the person leaving the chariot is the prize of the victorious race. In the myth of Pelops and Oenomaus, this prize is the princess.\n\nTherefore, the figure leaving the chariot is Hippodamia.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
