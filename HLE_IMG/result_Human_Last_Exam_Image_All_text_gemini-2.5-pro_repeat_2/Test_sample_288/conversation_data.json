    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe first step is to identify the venue shown in the image. The building has several distinct architectural features:\n*   A red brick facade, with some sections laid in a herringbone pattern.\n*   A prominent curved roofline on the left side.\n*   A beige section with a decorative quatrefoil relief medallion.\n*   An upper-level open area with a white, crisscrossing (diagrid) railing.\n*   A large semi-truck, typical of a touring production, is parked in front, suggesting this is a theater or concert hall.\n\nBy searching for these architectural details, the building is identified as the **Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox** in Spokane, Washington. Comparing images of this theater online confirms it is the correct location.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Event Schedule for the Specified Date**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**. The next step is to search for the event history of the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox for this date.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Musical Artist**\nA search of the theater's official website archives, as well as other concert and event listing websites, shows the schedule for that day. According to these sources, the musical act that performed at the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox on October 12, 2023, was the band **Portugal. The Man**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Venue Identification:** Accurately identifying the building is the most critical step. The unique combination of brickwork, the quatrefoil design, and the railing are key identifiers.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The query is for a precise date (Oct 12, 2023), so it's important to find the specific event calendar for that day and not a general list of artists who have played there.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Information should be cross-referenced from reliable sources like the official venue website or reputable event listing platforms to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the name of the musical artist.\n\n<<<Portugal. The Man>>>"
