    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main carbon chain and number it.**\nFirst, we need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2), so this molecule is a substituted alkanamine. We number the chain to give the carbon attached to the amino group the lowest possible number.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chains starting from the -CH2NH2 group (which will be C1):\n1.  Going straight along the backbone to the left methyl group: HO-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-**CH2NH2**. This chain has 5 carbons. The parent name would be pentan-1-amine.\n2.  Going through the ethyl group: CH3-CH2-CH(CH(OH)CH3)-CH(CH3)-**CH2NH2**. This chain has 6 carbons. The parent name would be hexan-1-amine.\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, we must choose the longest carbon chain. Therefore, the parent chain is hexan-1-amine. Let's number this chain:\n\n        CH(OH)CH3 (substituent group)\n        |\nCH3-CH2-CH - CH(CH3) - CH2NH2\n 6   5   4      2         1\n\nThe IUPAC name is 4-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylhexan-1-amine.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Based on the structure and name, we identify three chiral centers:\n*   **C2**: Bonded to H, -CH3, -CH2NH2 (C1), and the rest of the chain (-CH(CH(OH)CH3)CH2CH3). These four groups are different.\n*   **C4**: Bonded to H, -CH2CH3 (C5+C6), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C2+C1), and the -CH(OH)CH3 substituent. These four groups are different.\n*   **The carbon in the hydroxyethyl group**: Let's call it C4'. It is bonded to H, -OH, -CH3, and the rest of the molecule (the C4 of the main chain). These four groups are different.\n\nLet's map these back to the carbons in the original drawing for clarity, numbering from right to left as C1, C2, C3, C4*:\n*   The chiral carbon with the amine group nearby is **C2**.\n*   The chiral carbon with the ethyl group is **C3** (which is C4 in the IUPAC name).\n*   The chiral carbon with the hydroxyl group is **C4*** (which is C4' in the IUPAC name).\n\nLet's determine the configuration for each.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of C2.**\n*   **Groups:** -CH(CH3)CH2NH2.\n*   The four groups attached to C2 are:\n    1.  The rest of the chain towards C4. Let's call this R1.\n    2.  -CH2NH2 (C1).\n    3.  -CH3.\n    4.  H.\n*   **Stereochemistry from drawing:** The -CH3 group is dashed (pointing into the page). The C1-C2-C3 backbone is in the plane. Thus, the H atom must be wedged (pointing out of the page).\n*   **Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog):**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (The C is attached to N, H, H. Nitrogen's atomic number Z=7 is highest). Priority 1.\n    2.  R1 (The C at C4 is attached to C, C, H). Priority 2.\n    3.  -CH3 (The C is attached to H, H, H). Priority 3.\n    4.  H. Priority 4.\n*   **Assignment:** The path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (CW). Since the lowest priority group (H) is wedged (pointing towards the viewer), we reverse the result.\n*   **Configuration at C2 is S.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of C3 (C4 in IUPAC name).**\n*   **Groups:** -CH(CH2CH3)-\n*   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (the substituent group).\n    2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C2 side of the chain).\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (the C5/C6 side of the chain).\n    4.  H.\n*   **Stereochemistry from drawing:** The ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is wedged. Note: In our correct IUPAC name, the ethyl group is part of the main chain. The wedged group is the -CH(OH)CH3 substituent. Let's re-read the image carefully. The wedge is on the ethyl group. This implies the initial chain selection (pentane) was what the drawer intended, despite it not being the longest chain. Let's proceed with the pentane chain numbering (C1 to C5 from right to left) as this seems to be the intent of the drawing's stereochemical indicators.\n    *   **Re-analysis with pentane chain (3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine)**\n    *   Chiral centers: C2, C3, C4.\n    *   **C3 configuration:**\n        *   Groups: -CH(OH)CH3 (at C4), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (at C2), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), H.\n        *   Stereochemistry: Ethyl group is wedged, so H is dashed.\n        *   Priorities:\n            1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (C4, bonded to O).\n            2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C2, C is bonded to C,C,H and leads to N).\n            3.  -CH2CH3 (Ethyl, C is bonded to C,H,H).\n            4.  H.\n        *   Assignment: The path from 1 (left) to 2 (right) to 3 (up, wedged) is counter-clockwise (CCW). The lowest priority group (H) is dashed.\n        *   **Configuration at C3 is S.**\n\n**Step 5: Determine the configuration of C4.**\n*   **Groups:** -CH(OH)CH3.\n*   The four groups attached to C4 are:\n    1.  -OH.\n    2.  The rest of the molecule (via C3).\n    3.  -CH3.\n    4.  H.\n*   **Stereochemistry from drawing:** The drawing shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group attached to C4 with dashed bonds. This is a stereochemically impossible representation for a tetrahedral sp3 carbon atom if the backbone bonds are in the plane. A carbon atom must have two bonds in the plane, one wedged, and one dashed.\n*   **Resolving the ambiguity:** Since a definitive answer is expected, we must assume a typo in the drawing. A common error is misrepresenting a wedge as a dash. Let's assume the -OH is wedged and the -CH3 is dashed. (This is a necessary assumption to proceed).\n    *   Corrected Stereo: -OH is wedged, -CH3 is dashed. The H atom must be in the plane of the backbone. For analysis, it is easier to rotate the molecule so the H atom is wedged or dashed. Let's rotate around the C3-C4 bond to put H in the back (dashed). If H is dashed, then OH would be in the plane, and CH3 would be wedged.\n    *   Let's try another correction: OH is wedged, CH3 is dashed as originally depicted (but we assume OH was a typo). Then H is in the plane. This is still hard to visualize.\n    *   Let's make the most plausible correction that makes the drawing valid: assume one dash is a wedge. Let's change the **-OH dash to a wedge**, keeping the -CH3 as a dash. Now we have one wedge, one dash, and two bonds in the plane (C3-C4 and C4-H). This is a valid representation.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH.\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the C3 group).\n    3.  -CH3.\n    4.  H.\n*   **Assignment (with corrected stereo: OH wedge, CH3 dash, H in plane):** To assign configuration, we can view the molecule down the C4-H bond (placing H in the back). The order of the remaining groups OH, C3, CH3 would be counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   **Configuration at C4 is S.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, with a necessary correction to the impossible stereochemistry shown at C4:\n*   C2 is S.\n*   C3 is S.\n*   C4 is S.\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<<2S, 3S, 4S>>>"
