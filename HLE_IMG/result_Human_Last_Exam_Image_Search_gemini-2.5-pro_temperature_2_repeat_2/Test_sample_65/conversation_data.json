    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis identification is based on the plant's highly characteristic appearance. The shoots are covered in crowded, overlapping leaves that are finely divided and ciliate (fringed with hairs), giving them a distinctive feathery or braided look. This \"flossy\" appearance, along with the typical yellowish-green to reddish-brown coloration, is a hallmark of the genus *Ptilidium*. The name *Ptilidium* itself comes from the Greek word for \"small feather,\" which refers to this feathery look.\n\nThe plant shown is a type of leafy liverwort. Within the genus *Ptilidium*, there are three species, with *Ptilidium ciliare* (Ciliated Fringewort) being a common and widespread example that closely matches the plant in the photo. This species grows in loose tufts, has pinnate or bipinnate stems, and leaves with numerous long, thin teeth on their margins. While several types of moss are colloquially known as \"worm moss\" due to having plump, cylindrical shoots, such as *Bryoandersonia illecebra*, the feathery, ciliate leaf structure in the image is distinctly characteristic of *Ptilidium*.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
