    "The plant in the image is a *Hebe speciosa*, also known as showy hebe or Titirangi in Māori. This species is endemic to New Zealand.\n\nHistorically, *Hebe speciosa* was found in coastal areas of the North Island and the northern part of the South Island. More recent research suggests that the only natural populations are on the west coast of the North Island, including at the outer South Head of Hokianga Harbour, Maunganui Bluff, and near Muriwai Beach. Other populations in the southern North Island and the Marlborough Sounds are thought to have been established by Māori cultivation.\n\nTherefore, the island to which this plant was endemic is the North Island of New Zealand.\n\n<<<North Island of New Zealand>>>"
