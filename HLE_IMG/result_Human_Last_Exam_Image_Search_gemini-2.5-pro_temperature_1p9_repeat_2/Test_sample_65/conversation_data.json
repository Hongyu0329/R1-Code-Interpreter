    "The leaves in the image are characteristically arranged in a tight spiral around the stem, which gives the shoots a screw-like or twisted appearance. This distinct feature is characteristic of a group of mosses commonly known as \"screw-mosses.\"\n\nThese mosses belong to the family Pottiaceae. Within this family, the most prominent genus known for this trait is ***Tortula***. The name *Tortula* itself is derived from the Latin word 'tortus', which means twisted, referring to the spirally twisted peristome (teeth around the capsule mouth), but the leaves of many species also twist tightly around the stem when dry.\n\nClosely related genera, such as *Syntrichia* (which includes some species formerly in *Tortula*) and *Barbula*, also exhibit similar twisted or contorted leaves when dry. However, *Tortula* is the classic and most well-known genus for this \"screw-moss\" characteristic.\n\n<<<Tortula>>>"
