    "The plant in the image is most likely *Veronica formosa*, also known as the Speedwell Bush. It was formerly classified as *Hebe formosa*.\n\nThis shrub is endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. It is found widely on rocky hillsides from sea level up to about 1200 meters in altitude. Its distinctive features include dark green, glossy leaves with a prominent network of veins, which makes it identifiable even when not in flower. During late spring and early summer, it produces numerous small flowers that range from pale lilac to violet-blue.\n\n<<<Tasmania>>>"
