    "The epiphytic species in the image appears to be a member of the **Dictyonema** genus, which is a type of basidiolichen. This identification is based on the distinct dark, filamentous, net-like (or reticulated) growth pattern on the tree bark, which is characteristic of some species within this genus.\n\nLichens in the *Dictyonema* genus are unique because, unlike most lichens which are a symbiosis between a fungus from the Ascomycota division and a photosynthetic partner, *Dictyonema* involves a fungus from the Basidiomycota division, making them more closely related to mushrooms. They exhibit various growth forms, including filamentous and crust-like, and are predominantly found in tropical regions. The species in the photo displays a morphology similar to what is described as a filamentous crust.\n\nOther dark, hair-like lichens such as those in the *Ephebe* genus also exist, but they are typically described as forming mats that resemble tangled wool. While there are many types of epiphytes (organisms that grow on other plants without harming them), including various lichens, mosses, and algae, the specific net-like pattern is a strong indicator of *Dictyonema*.\n\n<<<Dictyonema>>>"
