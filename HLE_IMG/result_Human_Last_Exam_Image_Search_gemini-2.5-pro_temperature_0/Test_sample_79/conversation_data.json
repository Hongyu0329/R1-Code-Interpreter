    "The square structure visible at the coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W are the ruins of an 18th-century Spanish fort, or *presidio*. Specifically, this is the site of the **Presidio de San Antonio de los Puliques**, which was also referred to as the Presidio de San José de los Puliques.\n\nThis presidio was part of a line of Spanish fortifications and missions established along the Rio Grande. It is located in the area of modern-day Redford, Texas, which was historically known as El Polvo. The fort was associated with the Puliques, one of the Native American groups that lived in the region.\n\n**Historic Landmark Status**\n\nYes, the site is considered a historic landmark. It is a key component of the **La Junta de los Ríos Archeological District**, a region recognized for its immense historical and cultural significance. This district, encompassing the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos, has been inhabited for centuries and was a major cultural crossroads. The area includes numerous prehistoric and historic sites, including villages, missions, and presidios. The La Junta de los Ríos Archeological District is designated as a National Historic Landmark, affording the ruins of the Presidio de San Antonio de los Puliques federal recognition and protection as a significant historical site.\n\nThe Spanish established these presidios and accompanying missions to colonize the area, spread Christianity, and defend against raids from groups like the Apache and Comanche. The presidio at this location was one of several in the immediate vicinity, which was a focal point of Spanish activity from the late 17th century through the early 19th century. Nearby, the Fort Leaton State Historic Site preserves another historic structure built on the ruins of a different Spanish fort, El Fortín de San José.\n\n<<<The square ancient structure is the ruins of the Presidio de San Antonio de los Puliques, an 18th-century Spanish fort. It is a historic landmark as part of the La Junta de los Ríos Archeological District, which is a National Historic Landmark.>>>"
