    "The plant in the image is a cultivar of *Veronica odora* (syn. *Hebe odora*), likely *Veronica odora* 'Anomala'. The species *Veronica odora* is endemic to New Zealand.\n\nSpecifically, it is native to the North Island, South Island, Stewart Island, and the Auckland Islands. It was first discovered on the Auckland Islands in 1840. The plant is commonly found in subalpine to low mountain areas, often in shrublands and grasslands at altitudes between 600 and 1400 meters.\n\nWhile the species is widespread across New Zealand's islands, the genus *Hebe* itself, to which this plant belongs, is almost entirely endemic to New Zealand, with about 100 species found there.\n\n<<<New Zealand>>>"
