    "The transformation shown involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The overall reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n\n1.  **Photochemical 4π Electrocyclization:** The first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer, Dewar hexafluorobenzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction is classified as a 4π electrocyclic reaction. Under photochemical conditions, a 4π electron system undergoes a disrotatory ring closure, which is consistent with the formation of the *cis*-fused bicyclic structure of Dewar benzene.\n\n2.  **Photochemical [2π + 2π] Cycloaddition:** The second step is the reaction between the photochemically generated Dewar hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. One of the double bonds of the strained Dewar hexafluorobenzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This is a [2π + 2π] cycloaddition, which is a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction that forms a four-membered ring. This cycloaddition joins the two reactant molecules to form the final tricyclic product.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, Cycloaddition]>>>"
