    "Here are the identifications of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** - This is a type of volcanic rock. Its reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron. The rock is characterized by its high number of vesicles, which are small cavities formed by gas bubbles escaping from molten lava. Scoria is denser than pumice and will not float in water.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia** - This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This composition indicates that the fragments did not travel far from their source before being deposited. Volcanic breccias form from explosive volcanic eruptions or the collapse of volcanic domes.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** - This is a light-colored, extremely porous volcanic rock. It forms from gas-rich lava that cools rapidly, creating a frothy texture with many vesicles. Due to its high porosity and low density, pumice can often float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** - This is an intrusive igneous rock known for its very large, interlocking crystals, which are typically larger than one centimeter in diameter. Most pegmatites have a composition similar to granite, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. The exceptionally large crystals form during the final, slow-cooling stage of a magma's crystallization.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
