**Formulation of Total Power Delivered to the Grid:**
The total power delivered to the grid ($P_{grid}$) as a function of $P^{0}_{\text{wind}}$, $P_{\text{wave}}$, and $P_{c}$ is:
$P_{grid} = (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} - P_c) - k (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} - P_c)^2$

**Optimal Compensation Power ($P{c}^{\text{opt}}$):**
To meet the grid demand of at least $12 , \text{MW}$ while minimizing cable losses, the optimal compensation power is:
$P{c}^{\text{opt}} \approx 1.056 , \text{MW}$

**Total Power Delivered to the Grid:**
With the optimal compensation power, the total power delivered to the onshore grid, after accounting for cable losses, is:
$P_{grid} = 12.0 , \text{MW}$
