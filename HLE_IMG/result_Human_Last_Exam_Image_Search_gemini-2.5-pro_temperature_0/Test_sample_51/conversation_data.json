    "The Ancient Greek word in the image is **μθᾶλων**.\n\nThis appears to be a scribal misspelling of the common Greek word **μαλθακῶν** (malthakōn), which is the genitive plural form of the adjective μαλθακός (malthakos). The meaning of this word is \"soft,\" \"tender,\" \"gentle,\" or, figuratively, \"weak\" or \"feeble.\"\n\nThe error in the manuscript is likely a metathesis, where the scribe accidentally transposed the letters 'α' and 'θ'. The intended word was probably `μαλθῶν` (a contracted form) or `μαλθακῶν`, and the scribe wrote `μθαλῶν`, with the circumflex accent shifting from the omega to the alpha, a common inconsistency in Byzantine manuscripts.\n\nTherefore, the word written is `μθᾶλων`, and it most likely means \"of the soft\" or \"of the gentle.\"\n\n<<<μθᾶλων>>>"
