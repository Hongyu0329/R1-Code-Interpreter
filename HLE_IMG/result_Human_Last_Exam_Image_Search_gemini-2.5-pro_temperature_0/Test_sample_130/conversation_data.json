    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element Uranium.\n\nThe distinct pattern of bright lines across the color spectrum is a unique fingerprint for each element when it is heated to incandescence. The image provided matches the known emission spectrum for Uranium, which is characterized by a large number of emission lines. Scientific studies and databases confirm this specific spectral pattern as belonging to Uranium and its isotopes.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
