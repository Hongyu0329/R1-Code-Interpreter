    "The image was taken in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe buildings visible in the photograph are part of the modern skyline of Yeouido, Seoul's main financial and investment banking district. Specifically, the prominent skyscrapers are the International Finance Center (IFC) Seoul and the Parc1 Tower complex.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the glass skyscraper is one of the towers of the IFC Seoul, a mixed-use development that includes three office towers, the Conrad Seoul Hotel, and the IFC Mall. The complex was designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica and completed in 2012.\n\nThe building with the distinctive red corner frames, partially visible on the far right, is the Parc1 Tower. This complex, designed by architect Richard Rogers, includes two office towers, a luxury hotel, and The Hyundai Seoul department store. It has become a notable landmark on the Seoul skyline.\n\nYeouido is home to some of South Korea's tallest skyscrapers, including the iconic 63 Building, which is famous for its gold-clad exterior. The concentration of major financial institutions and landmark architecture makes this area a prominent feature of the city.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
