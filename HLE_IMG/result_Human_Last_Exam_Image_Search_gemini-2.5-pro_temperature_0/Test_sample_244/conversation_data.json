    "The epiphytic species seen in the image is a type of sooty mold. The distinctive black, net-like, or vein-like pattern is the fungal mycelium growing on the surface of the tree's bark.\n\nSooty molds are not a single taxonomic group but rather a term for various species of fungi, primarily from the Ascomycota division, that grow on the sugary honeydew excreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids or scale insects. These fungi are epiphytic, meaning they use the tree for support but do not feed on it directly. While the mold itself is generally harmless to the tree, a heavy infestation can block sunlight from reaching the bark.\n\nBased on the fine, reticulated growth pattern, a likely identification is a fungus from the order Capnodiales. A representative and common genus that exhibits this appearance is **Capnodium**. Another related genus is *Scorias*, which can form thicker, spongy masses.\n\n<<<Capnodium>>>"
