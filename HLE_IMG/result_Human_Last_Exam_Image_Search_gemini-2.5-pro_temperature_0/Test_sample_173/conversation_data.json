    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total number of beats in the measure. The time signature is represented by two numbers: the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates the note value that gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Top Staff (Right Hand):**\n*   **Beat 1:** A sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is equivalent to four sixteenth notes, which equals one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 2:** A sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. This also equals one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 3:** A group of four sixteenth notes. This is equal to one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 4:** Another group of four sixteenth notes, which also equals one quarter note.\n\nAdding these up, the top staff contains a total of four quarter notes.\n\n**Analysis of the Bottom Staff (Left Hand):**\n*   **Beats 1 and 2:** A chord held for a half note. A half note has a duration of two quarter notes.\n*   **Beats 3 and 4:** A single note held for a half note. This is also equal to two quarter notes.\n\nThe bottom staff also contains a total duration equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\nSince both staves contain notes and rests that add up to the value of four quarter notes, the measure is in 4/4 time. This time signature, also known as \"common time,\" means there are four beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.\n\n<<<C>>>"
