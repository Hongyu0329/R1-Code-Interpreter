The expression for the entry M32 of the robot inertia matrix is:
$M_{32} = -m_3 (a_2 + d_{c3} \cos(q_3))$
where $m_3$ is the mass of link 3, $a_2$ is the length of link 3 (the DH parameter, i.e., the distance from the axis of joint 3 to the origin of frame 3), $d_{c3}$ is the position of the center of mass of link 3 along the $x_3$ axis, and $q_3$ is the joint variable for joint 3.
