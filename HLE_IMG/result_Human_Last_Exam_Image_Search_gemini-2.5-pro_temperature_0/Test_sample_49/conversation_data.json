    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node a₀, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance (R_th) seen from node a₀ with respect to ground. The cutoff frequency (f_c) of the resulting RC circuit is then given by the formula:\n\nf_c = 1 / (2 * π * R_th * C)\n\n**1. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance (R_th):**\n\nTo find R_th, we remove the capacitor C and set the input voltage source at \"IN\" (node c₀) to zero, which means grounding node c₀. We then calculate the resistance between node a₀ and ground.\n\nThe circuit for calculating R_th is as follows:\n*   The resistance is measured from node a₀.\n*   There is a resistor 'r' connecting node a₀ to node d₁.\n*   The rest of the circuit is an infinite grid of resistors, each with resistance 'r'.\n*   The current flowing into the grid at node d₁ must exit at the grounded node c₀.\n\nTherefore, the Thevenin resistance is the sum of the resistor between a₀ and d₁ and the equivalent resistance of the infinite grid between nodes d₁ and c₀.\n\nR_th = r + R_grid(d₁, c₀)\n\n**2. Calculating the Grid Resistance:**\n\nThe nodes c₀ and d₁ are positioned diagonally across a single square of the infinite resistor grid. The equivalent resistance between two diagonally opposite nodes of an infinite square grid where each segment has resistance 'r' is a well-known result from physics and network theory. This resistance is given by:\n\nR_grid(diagonal) = (2/π) * r\n\nWhile some sources debate the exact value, (2/π) * r is the widely accepted theoretical result.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Thevenin Resistance:**\n\nSubstituting the grid resistance back into the equation for R_th:\n\nR_th = r + (2/π) * r = r * (1 + 2/π)\n\n**4. Calculating the Cutoff Frequency:**\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for R_th into the cutoff frequency formula:\n\nf_c = 1 / (2 * π * R_th * C)\nf_c = 1 / (2 * π * [r * (1 + 2/π)] * C)\nf_c = 1 / (2 * π * rC + 4 * rC)\nf_c = 1 / ((2π + 4) * rC)\n\nThus, the cutoff frequency at node a₀ is expressed in terms of r and C as 1 / ((2π + 4) * rC).\n\n<<<f_c = 1 / ((2π + 4)rC)>>>"
