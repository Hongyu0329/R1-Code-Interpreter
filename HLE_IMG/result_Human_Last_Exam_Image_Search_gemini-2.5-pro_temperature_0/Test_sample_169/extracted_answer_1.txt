The optimal reactive power injection required to restore the voltage at Bus-W to its nominal value is 1.2 p.u., or 120 MVAR. However, this value is significantly greater than the maximum capacity of the compensating device, which is 0.1 p.u. (10 MVAR). Therefore, it is not feasible to achieve the voltage restoration target with the specified equipment under the given fault conditions. The system experiences a severe voltage collapse that cannot be mitigated by the available reactive power support.
