    "To compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can analyze its structure and systematically count the number of valid colorings with *k* colors.\n\n### Graph Structure\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph:\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nThe graph can be seen as being composed of two main parts:\n1.  A subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} which forms a **diamond graph**. This is a complete graph on four vertices (K₄) with one edge, (2, 5), removed.\n2.  Vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Method of Calculation\nWe can calculate the chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), by considering two cases based on the colors assigned to vertices 2 and 5, which are the points of attachment for vertex 1.\n\n**Case 1: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.**\n1.  **Coloring vertices 2 and 5:** There are *k* choices for their common color.\n2.  **Coloring vertex 3:** Vertex 3 is adjacent to both 2 and 5, so it cannot have their color. This leaves *(k-1)* choices.\n3.  **Coloring vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. Since vertices 2 and 5 have the same color, and vertex 3 has a different color, vertex 4 is adjacent to two distinct colors. This leaves *(k-2)* choices.\n4.  **Coloring vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5, which share the same color. This leaves *(k-1)* choices for vertex 1.\n\nThe total number of colorings in this case is the product of the choices:\n`k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)`\n\n**Case 2: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.**\n1.  **Coloring vertices 2 and 5:** There are *k* choices for vertex 2 and *(k-1)* choices for vertex 5.\n2.  **Coloring vertex 3:** Vertex 3 is adjacent to both 2 and 5, which have different colors. This leaves *(k-2)* choices.\n3.  **Coloring vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. The colors of 2 and 5 are different. The color of 3 must also be different from the colors of 2 and 5 because it is adjacent to both. Therefore, the three neighbors of vertex 4 ({2, 3, 5}) all have distinct colors. This leaves *(k-3)* choices for vertex 4.\n4.  **Coloring vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5, which have different colors. This leaves *(k-2)* choices for vertex 1.\n\nThe total number of colorings in this case is:\n`k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`\n\n### The Chromatic Polynomial\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)²(k-2)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)]\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this gives the polynomial in standard form:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n**P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)**\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
