    "The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting algorithm. To determine its worst-case time complexity, we can analyze the recurrence relation that describes its operation.\n\nThe function is `def sort(a, n)`.\n- The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n- For `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    1. `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on the first `n-1` elements.\n    2. `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: A comparison, which takes `O(1)` time.\n    3. `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: A swap, which takes `O(1)` time. This step is conditional.\n    4. `sort(a, n - 1)`: Another recursive call on the first `n-1` elements. This step is also conditional.\n\nTo find the worst-case complexity, we must assume the scenario that leads to the maximum number of operations. This occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, triggering the `swap` and the second recursive call. This happens, for example, when the input array is sorted in reverse order.\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for an input of size `n`. In the worst case, the recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the comparison and swap operations)\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum is a geometric series `c * (2^k - 1)`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\nThe recursion stops at the base case `T(1)`. We can set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThis expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`. This is a known result for this type of recurrence relation.\n\nThe algorithm does terminate because each recursive call reduces the problem size `n` by 1, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the worst-case time complexity is exponential.\n\n<<<E>>>"
