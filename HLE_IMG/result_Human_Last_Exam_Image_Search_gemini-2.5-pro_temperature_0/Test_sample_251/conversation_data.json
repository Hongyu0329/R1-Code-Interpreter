    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we need to analyze the grid and the waveform.\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed**: The top left corner of the ECG indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Grid Calibration**:\n    *   The ECG paper is marked with a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm in width.\n    *   Each large square is 5 mm in width.\n3.  **Time Calculation**:\n    *   The time for one small square (1 mm) is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   The time for one large square (5 mm) is 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.20 seconds.\n4.  **Identifying the Longest R-R Interval**:\n    *   By visually scanning the entire rhythm strip, the most significant pause between two R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes) occurs in the fourth row of the tracing, near the time marker `0:06:08`.\n    *   Let's measure the distance between the peak of the R-wave just before this pause and the peak of the R-wave that ends the pause.\n    *   Counting the number of large squares between these two consecutive R-waves, we can see there are exactly 8 large squares.\n5.  **Calculating the Duration**:\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 8 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square\n    *   Duration = 1.6 seconds\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
