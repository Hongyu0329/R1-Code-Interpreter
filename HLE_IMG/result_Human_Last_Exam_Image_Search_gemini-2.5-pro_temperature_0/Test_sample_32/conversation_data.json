    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight. The capsules are typically erect and emergent from the leaves.\n\nIn contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by an arcuate, or curved, seta. This feature is so distinctive that it is reflected in its species name, *curviseta*.\n\nTherefore, to distinguish these two species when sporophytes are present, one can simply observe the curvature of the stalk holding the capsule.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
