    "The tiling in the image exhibits multiple types of rotational symmetry. When analyzing such a geometric pattern, \"the\" rotational symmetry typically refers to the highest order of rotation present.\n\nBy observing the pattern, we can identify several points around which the tiling can be rotated to appear unchanged:\n*   **6-fold rotational symmetry:** The center of each dark blue hexagon is a point of 6-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the entire pattern by 60 degrees (360°/6) around one of these points leaves the tiling identical to its original state.\n*   **4-fold rotational symmetry:** The center of each light brown square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 90 degrees (360°/4) around these points maps the tiling onto itself.\n*   **2-fold rotational symmetry:** There are also points of 2-fold rotational symmetry (a 180-degree rotation), for instance, at the vertices where two of the blue hexagons and two of the orange rhombuses meet.\n\nThis combination of 6-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold rotation centers is characteristic of the p6m wallpaper group, a specific class of two-dimensional repeating patterns. Since the highest order of rotation found in the pattern is 6, the tiling has a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
