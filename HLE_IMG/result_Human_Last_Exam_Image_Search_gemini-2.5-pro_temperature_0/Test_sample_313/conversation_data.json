    "The term \"X Y\" is a **Hat Trick**.\n\nThis answer is derived from two distinct clues:\n\n1.  **The Sporting Achievement:** The image provided shows an event that took place on or around June 20, 2019. This event was the 2019 NHL Awards, held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. At this ceremony, Tampa Bay Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov, the man pictured on the right, had a \"hat trick\" of wins, taking home the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer). This achievement of winning three major awards at a single event is commonly referred to as a hat trick.\n\n2.  **The Historical/Chemical Connection:** The second clue refers to another \"hat trick\" that has ceased due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This points to the historical process of hat-making. From the 18th to the mid-20th century, mercury nitrate was used to treat fur for making felt hats. Hatmakers who inhaled the toxic fumes often developed mercury poisoning, which caused severe neurological damage, a condition that became known as \"Mad Hatter Disease.\" This practice was banned in the United States in 1941. The term \"hat trick\" itself originated in cricket and has long been associated with the prize of a new hat for a notable achievement.\n\nTherefore, \"Hat Trick\" is the X Y that connects a modern sporting achievement pictured in 2019 with an obsolete, toxic industrial process involving hats and mercury.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
