    "This piece of sheet music is from the opera **Elektra** by Richard Strauss.\n\nThe music in the image corresponds to the beginning of Elektra's first great monologue, \"Allein! Weh, ganz allein\" (\"Alone! Woe, all alone\"). This occurs shortly after the opera begins, following the initial scene with the five maids.\n\nWhile the prompt states that this music opens the second act, Richard Strauss's *Elektra*, Op. 58, is a one-act opera. The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" (1, Curtain) in the provided image is also not present in the standard published scores at this point; the curtain would have already risen at the very beginning of the opera. It is possible this image is from a specific production's score with unique markings. However, the musical notation, instrumentation, and distinctive melodic lines are an exact match for the passage in *Elektra*.\n\n<<<Elektra>>>"
