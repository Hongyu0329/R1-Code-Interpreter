    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and established mineralogical classifications, the minerals can be identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen's olive-green color and granular crystal habit are characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which has the simplest silicate structure consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite)**\n    This dark, stubby, prismatic crystal is typical of pyroxenes, such as augite. Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** (single-chain silicates), where silica tetrahedra link to form single chains. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica**\n    The distinct flaky, sheet-like appearance identifies this mineral as a member of the mica group. Micas are **phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates), where tetrahedra link to form two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure represents a higher degree of polymerization and complexity than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This transparent crystal with a glassy luster and apparent conchoidal fracture is identifiable as quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate** (framework silicate), where every oxygen atom in each tetrahedron is shared with a neighboring tetrahedron, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\nThe order of the specimens from the least complex to the most complex silicate structure is:\n\n**C (Olivine) → A (Pyroxene) → B (Mica) → D (Quartz)**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
