    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n### Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The first step is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening of a substituted cyclobutene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π thermal electrocyclic reaction proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion. This means that the substituents on the two carbons of the breaking sigma bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Starting Material:** The starting cyclobutene has a stereocenter at the carbon bearing the methyl (Me) and methoxy (OMe) groups. The Me group is depicted on a wedge (pointing up/out of the page), and the OMe group is on a dash (pointing down/into the page).\n3.  **Formation of Diene Intermediates:** The conrotatory ring opening can occur in two different ways (e.g., both ends rotating clockwise, or both rotating counter-clockwise). These two pathways are diastereomeric and lead to two different diastereomeric 1,3-diene intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway 1:** One conrotatory motion will cause the \"up\" substituent (Me) to rotate to the \"outward\" position of the newly formed diene, and the \"down\" substituent (OMe) to rotate to the \"inward\" position.\n    *   **Pathway 2:** The opposite conrotatory motion will cause the \"up\" substituent (Me) to rotate \"inward\" and the \"down\" substituent (OMe) to rotate \"outward\".\n4.  **Torquoselectivity:** In such ring openings, there is often a preference for one rotational direction, a phenomenon known as torquoselectivity. Electron-donating groups generally prefer to rotate outwards to achieve better orbital overlap in the transition state. Since the methoxy (OMe) group is a stronger electron-donating group than the methyl (Me) group, it will preferentially rotate outwards. This favors **Pathway 2**, where the Me group rotates \"inward\" and the OMe group rotates \"outward\". Therefore, the major diene intermediate formed will be the one from this pathway.\n\n### Step 2: Endo Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The second step is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene formed in Step 1 and the dienophile, ethyl acrylate. The problem specifies that the reaction proceeds in an **endo** fashion.\n2.  **The Endo Rule:** The endo rule dictates the stereochemical outcome of the cycloaddition. In the endo transition state, the substituent on the dienophile (the -CO₂Et group) is oriented underneath the π system of the diene. This results in the dienophile's substituent being *cis* (on the same face of the newly formed ring) to the \"inward\" substituents of the diene and *trans* (on the opposite face) to the \"outward\" substituents of the diene.\n3.  **Predicting the Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Based on the torquoselectivity in Step 1, the major diene intermediate has the **Me group in the \"inward\" position** and the **OMe group in the \"outward\" position**.\n    *   Applying the endo rule, the **-CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the Me group** and ***trans* to the OMe group** in the final cyclohexene product.\n4.  **Identifying the Products:** We now look for the product structures among the options that satisfy this stereochemical requirement (Me is *cis* to -CO₂Et, and OMe is *trans* to -CO₂Et). The reaction of the chiral diene with the achiral dienophile can occur from two different faces of the diene, leading to a pair of diastereomeric products.\n\n    *   **Product B:** The Me group is on a dash (down), the OMe group is on a wedge (up), and the -CO₂Et group is on a dash (down). Here, the Me and -CO₂Et groups are *cis* to each other, and the OMe and -CO₂Et groups are *trans*. This matches our prediction.\n    *   **Product C:** The Me group is on a wedge (up), the OMe group is on a dash (down), and the -CO₂Et group is on a wedge (up). Here, the Me and -CO₂Et groups are *cis* to each other, and the OMe and -CO₂Et groups are *trans*. This also matches our prediction.\n\nProducts B and C are the two diastereomers resulting from the dienophile attacking the two opposite faces of the major diene intermediate.\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are B and C.\n\n<<<B and C>>>"
