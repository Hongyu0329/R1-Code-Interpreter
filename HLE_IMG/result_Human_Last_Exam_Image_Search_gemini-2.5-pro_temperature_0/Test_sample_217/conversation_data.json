    "The cuneiform sign shown in the image represents the Sumerian word \"É,\" which translates to \"house\" or \"temple.\"\n\nAn analysis of the sign's evolution shows that the image corresponds to its form around 2500 BCE. The sign is a pictograph that represents a house. Over time, this sign evolved and was also used in the names of ziggurats and palaces, such as É.GAL, meaning \"big house\" or \"palace.\"\n\nComparing this information to the provided options:\n*   **A. Tool:** The sign does not represent a tool.\n*   **B. Guard:** The cuneiform sign for \"guard\" (ennuŋ) is derived from the sign for \"lord\" (EN) and looks different.\n*   **C. Bread:** The sign for \"bread\" (NINDA) is also a distinct cuneiform character.\n*   **D. Home:** This aligns with the meaning of \"É\" as \"house\" or \"temple.\"\n*   **E. Deity:** The sign for \"deity\" (dingir) is a star-shaped character.\n*   **F.
