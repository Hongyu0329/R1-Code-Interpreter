    "Based on the visual evidence and the information gathered about Ingvar runestones, the runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 9**.\n\nHere is a summary of the evidence:\n\n*   **Visual Match:** The arrangement of the runes in distinct horizontal bands, the specific rune shapes, and the word separators (x-shapes) in the provided image are a clear match for photographs of the Sö 9 runestone.\n*   **Runic Inscription:** A partial transliteration of the runes visible in the image includes:\n    *   `...barkuiþr x auk x...`\n    *   `...ulf : sun + sin...`\n    *   `...entaþis + miþ : ikuari +...`\n    This matches the known inscription of Sö 9, which translates to: \"Bergviðr/Barkviðr and Helga, they raised this stone in memory of Ulfr, their son. He met his end with Ingvarr. May God help Ulfr's soul.\"\n*   **Classification:** Sö 9 is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones raised in memory of those who died during the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. It is located in Lifsinge, Södermanland, Sweden. The stone was discovered broken into five pieces in 1857 and was reassembled and erected near its original location in 1934.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
