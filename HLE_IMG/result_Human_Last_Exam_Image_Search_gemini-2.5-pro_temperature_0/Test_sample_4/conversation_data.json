    "The knot in the image is identified as the prime knot with 9 crossings, denoted as $9_{42}$. This identification is confirmed by comparing the image to knot diagrams from various knot theory resources.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as $V(t)$, for the $9_{42}$ knot is given by:\n$t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2 - t^3 + t^4$\n\nThis can be rewritten in the requested format of decreasing degree order as:\n$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nInterestingly, the $9_{42}$ knot is one of the first examples of a chiral knot that is not distinguished from its mirror image by the Jones polynomial, meaning both the knot and its reflection have the same Jones polynomial.\n\n<<<t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
