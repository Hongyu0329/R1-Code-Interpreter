    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. According to the Knot Atlas, the Rasmussen invariant, also known as the s-invariant, for the 8₁₉ knot is -6.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is an integer value assigned to a knot, which is derived from Khovanov homology. It serves as a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, this invariant is equal to the knot's signature.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is also identified as the torus knot T(4,3) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). It is notable for being the first non-homologically thin knot in the Rolfsen table, meaning its Khovanov homology has \"off-diagonal\" elements.\n\n<<<The Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the attached picture is -6.>>>"
