    "The synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of dense firing activity, are identified at the following approximate timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: 3 s\n*   Burst 2: 16 s\n*   Burst 3: 27 s\n*   Burst 4: 37 s\n*   Burst 5: 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between the start of successive bursts) are:\n*   Interval 1: 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n*   Interval 2: 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n*   Interval 3: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 4: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is calculated as:\n(13 s + 11 s + 10 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n<<<12>>>"
