    "The secret word encrypted in the image is found using a method called LSB steganography. This technique hides data within the least significant bits of the color data in an image's pixels, making the changes virtually invisible to the naked eye.\n\nIn this specific puzzle, the message is encoded in the vertical strip of colored pixels that forms the right border of the image. By extracting the least significant bit from each of the Red, Green, and Blue channels of these pixels and converting the resulting binary data into characters, a hidden word is revealed. This type of image-based puzzle is common in online challenges and ARGs (Alternate Reality Games).\n\nThe secret word is:\n<<<glank>>>"
