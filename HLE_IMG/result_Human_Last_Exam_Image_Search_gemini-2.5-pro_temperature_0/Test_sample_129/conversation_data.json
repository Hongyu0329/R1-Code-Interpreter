    "This image displays the crystal structure of **human procathepsin L**.\n\nProcathepsin L is the inactive precursor (proenzyme) of cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease belonging to the papain superfamily. Like many proteases, it is synthesized in an inactive form to prevent unwanted protein degradation.\n\nThe structure shown consists of two main parts:\n*   **The mature enzyme domain (dark blue)**, which contains the active site of the protease.\n*   **The prosegment (light blue)**, which is an N-terminal extension that keeps the enzyme inactive. This prosegment contains three alpha-helices and blocks the substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme, thus preventing its activity. The direction of the prosegment in the binding cleft is opposite to that of a normal substrate.\n\nThis particular 3D structure was determined at a resolution of 2.2 Ã… and is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code 1CS8.\n\n<<<human procathepsin L>>>"
