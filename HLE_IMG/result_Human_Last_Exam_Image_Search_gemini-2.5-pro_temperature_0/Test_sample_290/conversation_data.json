    "This image was taken in **University Place, Washington**.\n\nThe photograph features the distinctive shoreline of **Chambers Creek Regional Park**. A key identifying element is the chain-link fence in the foreground, which separates the park's trail system from the active BNSF railroad tracks that run parallel to the beach. Access to the more than two miles of Puget Sound shoreline is provided by a pedestrian overpass known as the \"Bridge to the Beach.\"\n\nThe view in the image, with the dark sand and pebble beach, the calm waters of Puget Sound, and the forested coastline, is characteristic of this park. The presence of a bonfire is also consistent with activities at public beaches in the region, although regulations in University Place and Pierce County require fires to be in designated areas.\n\n<<<University Place>>>"
