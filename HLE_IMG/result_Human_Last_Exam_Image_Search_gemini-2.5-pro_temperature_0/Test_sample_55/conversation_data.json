    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form an F augmented triad in first inversion. The most accurate Roman numeral for this chord is **III+⁶**.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1.  **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor. The tonic chord is D minor (D-F-A).\n2.  **Notes in Measure 8:** The notes played by both hands are F, A, and C♯. The lowest note, A, is in the bass.\n3.  **Chord Identification:** The notes F, A, and C♯ constitute an F augmented triad. An augmented triad is built by stacking two major thirds (F to A is a major third, and A to C♯ is also a major third).\n4.  **Roman Numeral Derivation:**\n    *   In the key of D minor, the note F is the third scale degree, also known as the mediant. Therefore, the root of the chord corresponds to the Roman numeral **III**.\n    *   Because the chord is augmented (containing a raised fifth from the standard major or minor triad), a plus sign (**+**) is added.\n    *   The chord is in first inversion because the third of the chord (A) is the lowest sounding note. First inversion is indicated by the Arabic numeral **6**.\n5.  **Harmonic Function:** This chord occurs in a progression from G minor (iv) in measure 7 to D minor (i) in measure 9. The III+⁶ chord functions as a chromatic chord that creates tension and leads effectively to the tonic. The C♯ acts as a leading tone, resolving upward to the tonic note D in the following measure. This type of chromaticism is a feature that adds color and emotional depth to the music.\n\n<<<III+⁶>>>"
