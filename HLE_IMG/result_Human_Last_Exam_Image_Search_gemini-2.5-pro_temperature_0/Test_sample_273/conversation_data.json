    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center.\n\nFirst, we must identify the principal functional group and the longest carbon chain to correctly number the atoms. The alcohol (-OH) group has higher priority in IUPAC nomenclature than the amine (-NH2) group. The longest carbon chain containing the carbon bonded to the -OH group is a pentanamine chain. Numbering should start at the end that gives the principal functional group (-OH) the lowest possible number. However, nomenclature rules prioritize the carbon of a principal group for the parent chain. In this case, the -CH2NH2 group defines the parent as a pentan-1-amine. Numbering starts from the carbon of the aminomethyl group.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\nThe chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n### **Configuration at C2**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The groups attached to C2 are -CH3 (methyl), -H (hydrogen), -CH(CH2CH3)CH(OH)CH3 (the rest of the chain, C3), and -CH2NH2 (C1).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (C1): The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen (atomic number 7).\n    2.  -C3: The carbon is bonded to two other carbons.\n    3.  -CH3: The carbon is bonded only to hydrogens.\n    4.  -H\n3.  **Determine Configuration:** In the diagram, the -CH3 group is on a dashed bond (pointing away), meaning the implied -H is on a wedged bond (pointing towards the viewer). With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 → -C3 → -CH3). This path is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the configuration.\n    *   **The absolute configuration at C2 is R.**\n\n### **Configuration at C3**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The groups attached to C3 are -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -CH(OH)CH3 (C4), and -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C2).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -C4: The carbon is bonded to an Oxygen (atomic number 8).\n    2.  -C2: The carbon is bonded to two other carbons.\n    3.  -CH2CH3: The carbon is bonded to one other carbon.\n    4.  -H\n3.  **Determine Configuration:** The ethyl group is on a wedged bond (out), so the implied -H is on a dashed bond (in). With the lowest priority group (-H) in the back, we trace the path from 1 to 2 to 3 (-C4 → -C2 → -CH2CH3). This path is clockwise.\n    *   **The absolute configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n### **Configuration at C4**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The groups attached to C4 are -OH, -H, -CH3, and the rest of the molecule (-C3).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, atomic number 8).\n    2.  -C3 (Carbon bonded to other carbons).\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon bonded to hydrogens).\n    4.  -H\n3.  **Determine Configuration:** The -OH group is on a wedged bond (out), and the -CH3 group is on a dashed bond (in). The -H and -C3 groups are in the plane of the drawing. To determine the configuration, we can mentally swap the lowest priority group (-H) with the group on the dashed bond (-CH3). Now, the -H is pointing away. The path from the remaining priorities 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3) is clockwise (R). Since we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite.\n    *   **The absolute configuration at C4 is S.**\n\nCombining the results, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
