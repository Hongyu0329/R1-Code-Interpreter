    "Based on the mythological scene depicted on this Apulian red-figured vase, the figure leaving the chariot is **King Oenomaus**.\n\nThe vase illustrates the climax of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus. In the myth, anyone who wished to marry Oenomaus's daughter, Hippodamia, had to defeat him in a chariot race. The penalty for losing was death.\n\nThe scene captures the moment of Pelops's victory. The figures in the chariot are Pelops, who is driving, and Hippodamia. The prominent wing belongs to Nike, the goddess of Victory, who flies above them, symbolizing Pelops's triumph. The figure on the ground, who appears to be falling from or has been thrown from a chariot, is King Oenomaus, who was killed when his chariot was sabotaged. This specific type of vase, a loutrophoros, is sometimes attributed to the White Sakkos Painter and dates to around 320â€“310 BC.\n\n<<<King Oenomaus>>>"
