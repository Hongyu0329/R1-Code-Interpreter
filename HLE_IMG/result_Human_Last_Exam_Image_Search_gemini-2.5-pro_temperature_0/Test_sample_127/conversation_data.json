    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must consider the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure. Free rotation can occur if there are no bulky groups in close proximity to block the movement.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached at position 4 of phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This is a *para* position relative to the other substituents on rings A and C. The adjacent positions (3 and 5) on rings A and C are occupied by hydrogen atoms, which are small. Therefore, there is minimal steric hindrance, and rings H and J can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. While this is an *ortho* position relative to the coordinating nitrogen atom, it is on the periphery of the complex. The main potential for steric clash would be with the ligand containing rings E and F. However, in solution, there is generally enough flexibility for such a group to rotate.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached at position 6 of the cyclometalated phenyl rings A and C, respectively. Position 6 is *ortho* to the carbon atom that is directly bonded to the central iridium (Ir) atom. The large size of the iridium atom, along with the other bulky ligands coordinated to it, creates significant steric hindrance. This steric clash prevents the free rotation of rings K and L. This phenomenon, where rotation around a single bond is restricted, can lead to atropisomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the phenyl rings that can rotate freely are G, H, and J.\n\n<<<E>>>"
