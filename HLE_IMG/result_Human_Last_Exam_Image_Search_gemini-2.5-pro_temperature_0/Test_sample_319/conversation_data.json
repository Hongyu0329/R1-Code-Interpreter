    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a brief burst of another sound, like white noise. The human brain has a remarkable ability to \"fill in\" the missing portion of the original sound, leading to the perception that the tone continued without interruption behind the noise. The image provided shows a spectrogram and waveform of a tone that is physically interrupted by a noise burst, which is a typical stimulus used to elicit this illusion.\n\nThis perceptual ability is common and usually unconscious, playing a crucial role in our ability to understand speech and follow conversations in noisy environments. The brain essentially restores the missing phonemes or sounds based on the surrounding context.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of bistable or multistable perception, where a single physical stimulus can lead to two or more different perceptual interpretations. In the case of the auditory continuity illusion, the listener can either perceive the tone as stopping and then starting again, or as continuing behind the noise. The brain, however, strongly favors the latter, more continuous interpretation. For the illusion to be successful, the interrupting noise must be loud enough to effectively mask the gap where the tone is absent.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
