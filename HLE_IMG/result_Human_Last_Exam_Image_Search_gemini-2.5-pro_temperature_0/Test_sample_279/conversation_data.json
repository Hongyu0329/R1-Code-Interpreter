    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to a **Class I** caries classification according to the G.V. Black classification system.\n\nThis classification is used for caries that occur in the pits and fissures of the teeth. The image clearly shows a carious lesion, along with what appears to be a dental restoration, on the occlusal (biting) surface of a posterior tooth (molar or premolar), which is a classic example of a Class I location.\n\nG.V. Black's classification, developed in the early 1900s, categorizes carious lesions based on their anatomical location on the tooth. Class I specifically includes cavities on the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars, the facial and lingual surfaces of molars, and the lingual surfaces of maxillary incisors.<<<Class I>>>"
