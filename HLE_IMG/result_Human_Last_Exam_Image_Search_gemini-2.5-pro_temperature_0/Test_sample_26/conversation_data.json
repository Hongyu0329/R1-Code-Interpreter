    "Based on the provided sheet music, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata is **V7**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:** The left hand plays G in octaves. The right hand plays a broken chord consisting of the notes G, B-natural, D, and F.\n*   **Chord Identification:** Together, these notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G-B♮-D-F).\n*   **Roman Numeral Analysis:** In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G. A dominant seventh chord built on G is the dominant seventh of the key. Therefore, the chord is analyzed as V7. The B-natural is the raised leading tone to the tonic, C, which is characteristic of a dominant function chord in a minor key.\n\nThis V7 chord is part of a transitional passage that strongly prepares the modulation to the second theme area. Some analyses note that the section from measures 27 to 34 features broken V chords to establish the key of C minor. The use of broken chords is a characteristic feature of this section.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
