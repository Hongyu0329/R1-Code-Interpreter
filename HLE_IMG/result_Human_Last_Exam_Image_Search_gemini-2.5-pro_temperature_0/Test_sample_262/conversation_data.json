    "To determine which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we must analyze their molecular structures and relate them to known degradation pathways.\n\n### Structural Analysis\n\nAll four complexes share a common [Ir(C^N)₂ (N^N)]⁺ architecture, where Ir is the iridium metal center, C^N is a cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligand, and N^N is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The key difference between the complexes lies in the fluorine substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the C^N ligands:\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The fluorine atoms are on the phenyl ring at positions distant from the Ir-C bond. There is **no fluorine atom in the *ortho* position** (the position adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to iridium).\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The fluorine atoms are also on the phenyl ring at positions distant from the Ir-C bond. There is **no fluorine atom in the *ortho* position**.\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. There is a **fluorine atom in the *ortho* position** of the phenyl ring.\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. There is a **fluorine atom in the *ortho* position**, in addition to others.\n\n### Correlation to Lifetime\n\nThe operational stability and lifetime of these emitters in LECs are closely linked to their chemical stability. A major degradation pathway for such complexes involves the weakening and potential cleavage of the bonds within the complex, particularly the cyclometalating Ir-C bond.\n\n1.  **Effect of Fluorination:** While adding electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms is a common strategy to tune the emission color towards blue, it is often associated with decreased device stability. An increasing number of fluorine atoms can lead to shorter lifetimes.\n\n2.  **Effect of Fluorine Position:** The position of the fluorine substituent is critical. A fluorine atom placed at the *ortho* position (as seen in Complexes 3 and 4) introduces significant steric hindrance. This steric strain can weaken the adjacent Ir-C bond, making the ligand more susceptible to dissociation. This dissociation is a primary degradation mechanism, leading to a loss of luminescence and thus a shorter device lifetime. Scientific studies have shown that *ortho*-fluorination can greatly enhance non-radiative decay rates, which competes with light emission and is linked to instability. Furthermore, steric hindrance from *ortho* substituents has been shown to influence the stability and reactivity of such complexes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComplexes 3 and 4 both possess a fluorine atom in the sterically hindered *ortho* position of the phenylpyridine ligand. This structural feature is known to decrease the stability of the complex, making it more prone to degradation under operating conditions. In contrast, Complexes 1 and 2 lack this *ortho*-fluorine and are therefore expected to be more stable and exhibit longer lifetimes.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are **** and ****.\n\n<<<J>>>"
