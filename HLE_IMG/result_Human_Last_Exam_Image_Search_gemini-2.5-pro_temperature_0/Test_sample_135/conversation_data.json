    "The author of this detailed relief from the altarpiece is the Italian sculptor and painter Giuseppe Cassioli.\n\nThis relief, titled \"Sacrament de l'autel\" (Sacrament of the Altar), is a marble panel from the high altar of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Christchurch, New Zealand. The altar, an elaborate work of marble and bronze, was carved by Cassioli and installed in 1916.\n\nThe commission for the altar was given by Bishop Grimes. Documents and photographs related to this commission, including images of the component parts supplied by Cassioli from his workshop in Florence, are preserved in the Christchurch Diocesan Archives. The altar was later dismantled in 1975 during a re-ordering of the cathedral, and its various elements were distributed to other parts of the building.\n\n<<<Giuseppe Cassioli>>>"
