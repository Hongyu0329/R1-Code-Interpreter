    "This is one of the most famous and dramatic pieces in the piano repertoire: the **Prelude in C-sharp Minor, Op. 3, No. 2**, by Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\nThis piece is well-known for its powerful and solemn opening chords, which have earned it the nickname \"The Bells of Moscow.\" It begins with a distinctive three-note motif that sets a dark and brooding tone. The sheet music clearly shows the key signature of C-sharp minor and the initial slow, chordal section that quickly gives way to a turbulent and technically demanding middle part, all of which are defining characteristics of this prelude.\n\nComposed in 1892, it is the second piece in a set of five fantasy pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This prelude quickly brought the young Rachmaninoff international fame and remains one of his most performed works.\n\n<<<Prelude in C-sharp Minor, Op. 3, No. 2 by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
