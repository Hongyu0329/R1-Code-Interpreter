    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will first calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. The VMT is calculated by multiplying the share of trips for each distance category by the share of car trips within that category, and then by the average distance for that category.\n\n### 1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n\nFirst, we calculate the total share of car trips for each distance category in the Baseline scenario by adding the share of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category by multiplying the share of total trips, the total car trip share, and the average trip distance.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 (share of total trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077** (arbitrary units based on a total trip sample)\n\n### 2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n\nWe repeat the same process for the Proposed scenario. First, the total share of car trips:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNow, we calculate the weighted VMT for the Proposed scenario:\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505** (in the same arbitrary units)\n\n### 3. Calculate Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100 = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
