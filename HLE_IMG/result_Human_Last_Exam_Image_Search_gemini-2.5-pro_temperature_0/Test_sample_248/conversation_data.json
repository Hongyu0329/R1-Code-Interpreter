    "The species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nThe image clearly shows multiple small, dark-shelled snails, which are identifiable as common periwinkles. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It is now abundant in the intertidal zones from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware in the United States.\n\nWhile there have been sporadic reports of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast, these have been isolated occurrences, and the species has not become established there as it has in the Atlantic. Therefore, its presence in a thriving, mixed-species intertidal community, as shown in the photograph, is a strong indicator of an Atlantic location.\n\nOther species visible in the photo include:\n*   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*)**: These barnacles, identifiable by their diamond-shaped openings, are common on both the North American Atlantic and Pacific coasts, making them inconclusive for determining the ocean.\n*   **Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: The larger, whitish snail could be a dog whelk. This species is native to the North Atlantic and is not found on the Pacific coast. However, the common periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is more numerous and clearly identifiable in the image, making it the most definitive indicator.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
