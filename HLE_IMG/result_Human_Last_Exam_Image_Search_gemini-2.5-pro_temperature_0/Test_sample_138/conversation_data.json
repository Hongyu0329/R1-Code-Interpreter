    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\n\nThe insects in pair A are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are kleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bee species, and as such, the females lack pollen-collecting scopae. A key feature for identifying the sexes in this genus is the shape of the abdomen.\n\n*   **A (Left):** This individual displays an abdomen tip with multiple prongs or spines. This is a characteristic feature of male *Coelioxys* bees.\n*   **A (Right):** This individual has a long, tapered, cone-shaped abdomen. This pointed abdomen is used by the female to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg.\n\nTherefore, the pair A insects are Male and Female. This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\n\nThe insects in pair B are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Sexual dimorphism in these wasps can be identified by their antennae and facial markings.\n\n*   **B (Left):** This wasp has relatively straight antennae. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **B (Right):** This wasp exhibits antennae with distinctly curled or hooked tips. Curled antennae are a reliable indicator of a male paper wasp.\n\nTherefore, the pair B insects are Female and Male. This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (*Melissodes*)**\n\nThe insects in pair C are long-horned bees, likely from the tribe Eucerini, such as the genus *Melissodes*. This group is named for the characteristically long antennae of the males.\n\n*   **C (Left):** This bee has very long antennae and a pale yellow patch on its face (clypeus). Both long antennae and yellow facial markings are classic traits of male long-horned bees.\n*   **C (Right):** This bee has noticeably shorter antennae and a dark face. These features identify it as a female of the species.\n\nTherefore, the pair C insects are Male and Female. This corresponds to option **3**.\n\nCombining the results for each pair:\n*   A: Male, Female (3)\n*   B: Female, Male (4)\n*   C: Male, Female (3)\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
