    "Based on the colors and their arrangement, the flag snippet shows horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom.\n\nWhile no current country has this as its official flag, this pattern is identical to the historical flag of the German Empire (1871-1918).\n\nHowever, in the context of flag quizzes, this is often a trick question. The flag shown is the inverted version of the flag of Yemen. The official flag of Yemen consists of three equal horizontal stripes of red, white, and black. The flag of Egypt is similar, with red, white, and black stripes, but it also features the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center of the white band.\n\nGiven the common use of this inversion as a puzzle, the intended answer is Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
