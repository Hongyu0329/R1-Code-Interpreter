    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents **Time (s)**, ranging from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, ranging from 0 to 128.\n*   Each black dot signifies an electrical signal (a \"spike\" or \"firing\") detected by a particular electrode at a specific moment in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period of intense, nearly simultaneous firing across a large number of electrodes. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical columns of black dots on the raster plot. We need to scan the plot from left to right (t=0 to t=50s) to locate these events.\n\nBy observing the plot, we can identify five prominent synchronized bursts. We need to estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Timestamps of the Bursts**\nWe will read the timestamps from the x-axis for the center of each dense vertical band.\n*   **Burst 1:** The first major burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is very distinct and is centered at **t₂ = 15 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst appears centered at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth distinct burst is centered at **t₄ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final major burst is centered at **t₅ = 45 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, so we can calculate four intervals.\n*   **IBI₁ (between Burst 2 and Burst 1):** t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 5 s = 10 s\n*   **IBI₂ (between Burst 3 and Burst 2):** t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 15 s = 9 s\n*   **IBI₃ (between Burst 4 and Burst 3):** t₄ - t₃ = 35 s - 24 s = 11 s\n*   **IBI₄ (between Burst 5 and Burst 4):** t₅ - t₄ = 45 s - 35 s = 10 s\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 10 s + 9 s + 11 s + 10 s = 40 s\n*   **Average IBI:** (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 40 s / 4 = 10 s\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the answer to be given to two significant figures. Our calculated average is 10 s. The number '10' as written has two significant figures (the '1' and the '0'). Therefore, no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe average inter-burst interval is 10 s.\n\n<<<10>>>"
