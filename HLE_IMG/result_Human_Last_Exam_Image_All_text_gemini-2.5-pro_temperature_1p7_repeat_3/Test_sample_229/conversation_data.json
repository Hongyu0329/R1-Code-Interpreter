    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the musical notation to determine the style:**\n    *   **Instrumentation and Format:** The image shows a single staff with a treble clef, along with chord symbols written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, D-). This format is known as a \"lead sheet,\" which is common in jazz and popular music. It provides the melody and the harmonic structure.\n    *   **Time Signature and Key:** The time signature is 4/4. The key signature has no sharps or flats, and the piece frequently uses C major chords as its tonal center, indicating the key is C Major.\n    *   **Rhythm and Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes and ties. There are also chromatic notes (like the G# in the E7 measure and the F# in the D-7 measure) and arpeggiated figures. This combination of syncopation and chromaticism within a swing context is a hallmark of a specific jazz subgenre.\n    *   **Harmony (Chords):** The chord progression is very characteristic of early jazz and swing. A key sequence in the first section is `C | C | E7 | F`. The `E7` chord functions as a secondary dominant (V of A minor, the relative minor), a common device in this style. The progression then continues `F | C | D- G7 | C`, which is a classic turnaround (IV - I - ii - V - I).\n    *   **Conclusion on Style:** The combination of the lead sheet format, syncopated melody, arpeggiated figures, and specific chord progressions strongly points to **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Gypsy Swing).\n\n2.  **Identify the Song Title:**\n    *   By searching for Gypsy Jazz standards in the key of C Major with the chord progression `C | E7 | F`, we can identify the tune.\n    *   This specific progression, along with the melodic contour (starting with a repeated figure on the notes E and G over the C chord), is the signature A-section of the famous composition **\"Djangology\"** by Django Reinhardt. Comparing the provided sheet music to standard lead sheets of \"Djangology\" confirms the match in both melody and harmony.\n\n3.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The style, Gypsy Jazz, was created and popularized in the 1930s.\n    *   The primary pioneers of this style were guitarist Django Reinhardt (a Belgian-born Romani who lived and worked in France) and violinist St√©phane Grappelli.\n    *   Their group, the Quintette du Hot Club de France, was based in Paris.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin for both the song \"Djangology\" and the Gypsy Jazz genre itself is **France**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to look at the combination of melody, harmony, and rhythm, not just one element in isolation.\n*   The chord symbols are a crucial clue to the style and the specific tune.\n*   Recognizing common harmonic patterns (like secondary dominants and ii-V-I progressions) helps narrow down the genre to jazz.\n*   The specific melodic phrasing and syncopation are characteristic of the Gypsy Jazz guitar style pioneered by Django Reinhardt.\n*   Structural markings like \"To Coda\" and the segno symbol (ùÑã) are standard but confirm this is a complete song chart.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **Title:** Djangology\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<Title: Djangology, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: France>>>"
