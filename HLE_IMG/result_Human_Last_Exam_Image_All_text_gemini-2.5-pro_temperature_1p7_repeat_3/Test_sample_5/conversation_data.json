    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observations**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Key Signature:** There are three sharps (F#, C#, G#) in the key signature. This indicates the key of A major or its relative minor, F# minor. The first full measure features a prominent A major chord in the left hand (A-C#-E), strongly suggesting the key is A major.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), meaning there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is quarter note = 80, which is a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Musical Content and Style**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano) with a simple, lyrical melodic fragment in the right hand over arpeggiated chords in the left hand. This opening is gentle and sets a calm mood.\n*   **Measure 3:** There is a dramatic and sudden shift. The dynamic marking changes to *f* (forte). The texture becomes much thicker and more aggressive. The left hand begins a pattern of fast, continuous sixteenth-note broken chords/octaves, creating a powerful, driving rhythm. The right hand plays loud, accented chords. This abrupt change is a very strong stylistic indicator.\n*   **Measures 4-6:** This section continues the style established in measure 3. The left hand maintains its relentless sixteenth-note pattern, while the right hand plays a chordal melody, often featuring sharps and chromatic notes (like D# and G#) which are characteristic of rich, Romantic harmony.\n*   **Measure 7:** The music becomes even more virtuosic. There is complex, fast passagework in the right hand, including rapid arpeggios and grace notes, played over a thick chordal accompaniment. The use of hand-crossing and wide leaps is implied.\n*   **Measures 8-10:** A pattern of powerful, blocky chords in both hands dominates this section, played at a *mf* (mezzo-forte) dynamic. The rhythm is steady and forceful.\n*   **Measure 11:** This measure features a very distinctive virtuosic flair: a rapid ascending flourish, possibly a glissando (often indicated by a wavy line and \"gliss.\"), leading to a high C#.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesizing the Clues and Identifying the Composer**\nThe combination of a lyrical opening, sudden and extreme dynamic shifts, a dense texture with a relentless and powerful left-hand accompaniment, and virtuosic flourishes are all hallmarks of the late Romantic period. The composer Sergei Rachmaninoff is particularly famous for this style of piano writingâ€”combining lush melodies with formidable technical demands and rich harmonies. The powerful, rolling left-hand broken chords are especially characteristic of his piano concertos and major solo works.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpointing the Exact Piece**\nThis specific musical passage, with its A major key, the specific melodic contour, and the characteristic transition from a quiet start to a virtuosic torrent, is highly recognizable. It is from Rachmaninoff's **Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43**. Specifically, this is the **10th Variation**. This variation is well-known for its technical difficulty, its bell-like effects (indicated by accents), and its transformation of Paganini's original theme.\n\n<<<Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43, Variation X by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
