    "Step-by-step analysis to identify all splice species:\n\n1.  **Understand the Methodology:** The experiment uses Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect different mRNA transcripts (splice species). Different pairs of primers are used to amplify specific regions of the transcripts. Multiple bands in a single PCR reaction indicate the presence of multiple transcript variants (splice species) that can be amplified by that primer pair. The goal is to count the total number of unique splice species revealed by all the experiments combined.\n\n2.  **Analyze each PCR experiment panel by panel:**\n\n    *   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R) and Panel C (E1F1/E5R):**\n        *   The primer E1F1 is a general forward primer in the E1 exon.\n        *   Panel B shows two bands (190 bp and 159 bp). This indicates the existence of at least **two different splice species**. The size difference is 31 bp.\n        *   Panel C also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). The size difference is again 31 bp. This strongly suggests that these are the same two splice species detected in Panel B, just amplified with a different reverse primer (E5R) that is further downstream.\n        *   **Conclusion from B & C:** We have identified **Species 1** and **Species 2**.\n\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R) and Panel F (E1F2/L2R):**\n        *   The primer E1F2 is special; it's a \"splice-junction\" primer that only binds if a specific splice from nucleotide 929 to 3465 has occurred. This means any product from this reaction represents a species with this specific splice, making it distinct from those amplified by the general E1F1 primer.\n        *   Panel D shows a single band (551 bp). Panel F, using the same forward primer (E1F2) but a different reverse primer (L2R), also shows a single band (972 bp).\n        *   **Conclusion from D & F:** This identifies **one new splice species** (let's call it **Species 3**) which is characterized by the 929^3465 splice.\n\n    *   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):**\n        *   This uses the general E1F1 forward primer. It shows a single band (1,005 bp). This product is expected to come from the previously identified Species 1 and/or Species 2. The presence of a single band might be due to poor gel resolution for large fragments or one species being much more abundant. It does not provide clear evidence for a new, distinct species. So, no new species counted from this panel.\n\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):**\n        *   The primer E1F3 is another special splice-junction primer, specific for the 929^3506 splice. Transcripts amplified by E1F3 are distinct from those amplified by E1F1 or E1F2.\n        *   Panel G shows two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). This means there are two different splice variants that both contain the 929^3506 splice but differ in a subsequent splicing event before the L2R reverse primer site.\n        *   **Conclusion from G:** This identifies **two new splice species** (**Species 4** and **Species 5**).\n\n    *   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles) and Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):**\n        *   This primer pair amplifies a large region using the general E1F1 forward primer.\n        *   Panel H shows two bands (450 bp and 419 bp), corresponding to the already identified Species 1 and 2.\n        *   Panel I, with more PCR cycles, reveals the same two bands plus two new, smaller bands (378 bp and 187 bp). These smaller products result from the same primer pair (E1F1/L1R), meaning they must be transcripts that have undergone additional, extensive splicing between the primer binding sites compared to Species 1 and 2.\n        *   **Conclusion from H & I:** This confirms Species 1 and 2 and identifies **two more new splice species** (**Species 6** and **Species 7**).\n\n3.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   Species 1 & 2 (from Panels B, C, H, I)\n    *   Species 3 (from Panels D, F)\n    *   Species 4 & 5 (from Panel G)\n    *   Species 6 & 7 (from Panel I)\n\n    Total number of distinct splice species identified = 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
