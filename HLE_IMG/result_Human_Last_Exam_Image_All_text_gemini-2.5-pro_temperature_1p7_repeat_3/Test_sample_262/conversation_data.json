    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Emitter Lifetime in LECs**\nThe \"lifetime\" of an emitter in a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) or an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) refers to its operational stability. A shorter lifetime means the complex degrades more quickly under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. For iridium(III) complexes of the type shown, [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺, the primary modes of degradation often involve the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, specifically the iridium-carbon (Ir-C) bond, which is generally the kinetically weakest bond in the coordination sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structures of the Four Complexes**\nAll four complexes share the same central iridium(III) ion and the same ancillary N^N ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The only difference between them is the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the two cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands (the C^N ligands).\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine, often abbreviated as `dfppy`.\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`), which is unsubstituted on the phenyl ring.\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine, or `2-Fppy`.\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine, or `3,5-dFppy`.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability**\nThe stability of the complex, and thus its operational lifetime, is heavily influenced by the strength of the Ir-C bond and the overall robustness of the ligands.\n\n*   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two main consequences relevant to stability:\n    1.  **Strengthening the Ir-C bond:** By withdrawing electron density from the phenyl ring and the carbon atom bonded to iridium, the Ir-C bond is strengthened, making it more resistant to cleavage.\n    2.  **Replacing C-H bonds:** Fluorination replaces weaker C-H bonds with much stronger and less reactive C-F bonds, reducing the susceptibility of the ligand to certain degradation pathways (e.g., oxidation).\n\n*   **Position of Fluorination:** The position of the fluorine atom(s) is critical.\n    *   **ortho and para positions (like in Complex 1):** Fluorines at these positions exert a strong electron-withdrawing effect through both induction and resonance. This is the most effective way to strengthen the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **meta positions (like in Complex 4):** Fluorines here exert only an inductive effect, which is generally weaker.\n    *   **ortho position (like in Complex 3):** A fluorine at the ortho position (position 2 of the phenyl ring) provides a strong inductive effect and some steric shielding for the Ir-C bond. However, it also introduces a unique and well-documented degradation pathway involving the activation of the C-F bond, which can lead to rapid decomposition.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Complex Individually**\n\n*   **Complex 2 (unsubstituted):** This complex lacks any fluorination on the C^N ligands. The Ir-C bond is not reinforced by any electron-withdrawing groups, making it the weakest among the four complexes. It serves as a baseline for stability. Due to the relatively weak Ir-C bond, it is expected to be prone to degradation and thus have a **shorter lifetime**.\n\n*   **Complex 3 (2-fluoro):** This complex has a single fluorine atom at the ortho position. While this fluorine does strengthen the Ir-C bond to some extent, it also enables a specific degradation mechanism via C-F bond activation. This pathway can be very efficient and has been shown in some studies to make ortho-fluorinated complexes less stable than their non-fluorinated counterparts under operational stress. Therefore, Complex 3 is also expected to have a **shorter lifetime**.\n\n*   **Complex 4 (3,5-difluoro):** This complex has two fluorine atoms at the meta positions. These atoms strengthen the Ir-C bond via the inductive effect. Since there is no ortho-fluorine, the specific C-F activation pathway of Complex 3 is not available. The presence of two fluorine atoms makes it significantly more stable than the unsubstituted Complex 2. It is expected to have a longer lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 1 (2,4-difluoro):** This complex has fluorine atoms at both the ortho and para positions. This combination provides the strongest electron-withdrawing effect, leading to the most stabilized Ir-C bond. The ligand `dfppy` is famously used to create highly stable and efficient blue/green emitters. Despite having an ortho-fluorine, the overall electronic properties imparted by the second fluorine at the para position appear to suppress the C-F activation pathway or make other pathways much less favorable. This complex is expected to be the most stable of the four and have the **longest lifetime**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the complexes with the least stable C^N ligands are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n*   **Complex 2** is unstable due to the lack of any stabilizing fluorine substituents, resulting in a weak Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complex 3** is unstable due to a specific and facile degradation pathway involving its ortho-fluorine atom.\n\nTherefore, Complexes [2] and [3] are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
