    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecule's structure and connectivity.**\n    The molecule in the picture has a carbon backbone with several substituents, including a hydroxyl (-OH) group, an amino (-NH2) group (as part of a -CH2NH2 group), and several alkyl groups (methyl and ethyl). There are three chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n\n2.  **Determine the IUPAC name to number the chiral centers correctly.**\n    *   The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group, as it has higher priority than the amine (-NH2) group according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the molecule is an alcohol (-ol).\n    *   We need to find the longest carbon chain that contains the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (let's call it C-OH).\n    *   Tracing the possible chains, the longest one has 5 carbon atoms. The chain is: `[CH3 attached to C-OH] - [C-OH] - [C with ethyl] - [C with methyl and CH2NH2] - [C of CH2NH2]`. This is not a valid chain because the last atom is part of a substituent.\n    *   Let's re-trace. A valid 5-carbon chain containing C-OH is: `[CH3 attached to C(right)] - [C(right)] - [C with ethyl] - [C-OH] - [CH3 attached to C-OH]`.\n    *   Let's number this chain from the end that gives the -OH group the lowest possible number. This means numbering from the methyl group attached to C-OH.\n        *   C1: The methyl group attached to the C-OH carbon.\n        *   C2: The carbon with the -OH group.\n        *   C3: The carbon with the ethyl group.\n        *   C4: The carbon with a methyl group and an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group.\n        This numbering seems incorrect as C4 would have two substituents that are not H, and thus C4 cannot be part of the main chain.\n\n    *   Let's try again, carefully. The main chain consists of the carbon with OH (let's call it Cα), the one with Et (Cβ), and the one with Me and CH2NH2 (Cγ).\n        The longest chain containing Cα is a pentane chain.\n        The correct chain is: `[CH3 on Cα] - Cα - Cβ - Cγ - [CH3 on Cγ]`. This chain does not include the aminomethyl group.\n        The correct chain MUST be the longest one containing the principal functional group. `5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol`.\n        Let's break this name down to confirm connectivity:\n        - `pentan-2-ol`: A 5-carbon chain with an OH group on C2.\n        - Let's number the carbons in the drawing from left to right for reference: C(left, with OH), C(mid, with Et), C(right, with Me+CH2NH2).\n        - The IUPAC C2 is C(left). Its attached methyl group is C1.\n        - `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group on C3. C3 is C(mid). This matches.\n        - `4-methyl`: A methyl group on C4. C4 is C(right). This matches.\n        - `5-amino`: An amino group on C5. This means the main chain continues from C4 to a C5, and C5 has an NH2. The drawing has a -CH2NH2 group on C4. So the IUPAC name implies the chain is C1(Me)-C2(OH)-C3(Et)-C4(Me)-(C5H2NH2). This matches the connectivity.\n        The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n3.  **Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n    *   **Configuration at C2 (leftmost center):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities:** 1: -OH, 2: -CH(Et)... (rest of chain), 3: -CH3 (C1), 4: -H.\n        *   **Orientation:** The drawing shows -OH on a dash (away) and the implied -H on a wedge (forward).\n        *   **Rule:** When the lowest priority group (4) is on a wedge, the configuration is the opposite of the direction traced from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   **Trace:** 1(-OH, back) -> 2(chain, right) -> 3(-CH3, down-left). This describes a clockwise (CW) path.\n        *   **Result:** Since H is on a wedge, we reverse CW. The configuration is **S**.\n\n    *   **Configuration at C3 (middle center):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities:** We compare the two chain fragments attached. The C2 fragment -CH(OH)CH3 outranks the C4 fragment -CH(Me)CH2NH2 because O > C. So, 1: C2-group, 2: C4-group, 3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl), 4: -H.\n        *   **Orientation:** The drawing shows the ethyl group on a wedge (forward) and the implied -H on a dash (away).\n        *   **Rule:** When the lowest priority group (4) is on a dash, the configuration is the direction traced from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   **Trace:** 1(left) -> 2(right) -> 3(ethyl, forward). This describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) path.\n        *   **Result:** The configuration is **S**.\n\n    *   **Configuration at C4 (rightmost center):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities:** 1: -CH2NH2 (N > C), 2: -CH(Et)... (C3-group), 3: -CH3, 4: -H.\n        *   **Orientation:** The drawing shows -CH2NH2 on a wedge, -CH3 on a dash, and the implied -H in the plane of the paper.\n        *   **Rule:** With the lowest priority group (4) in the plane, we can mentally orient the molecule. Let's look down the C4-H bond from \"below\" the molecule.\n        *   **Visualization:** From this viewpoint, H is pointing towards us. The C3-group (2) is to our left. The -CH2NH2 group (1, wedged originally) is now pointing \"up\" (away from us). The -CH3 group (3, dashed originally) is now pointing \"down\" (towards us).\n        *   **Trace:** 1(up) -> 2(left) -> 3(down). This is a counter-clockwise (CCW) path.\n        *   **Rule application:** Since H is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. The configuration is the opposite of CCW, which is CW.\n        *   **Result:** The configuration is **R**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The full absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R). The question asks for \"the\" absolute configuration, and the expected answer format is a single letter or number. In complex molecules like sugars and amino acids, the overall D/L configuration is determined by the chiral center with the highest locant number. Here, that is C4. The configuration of C4 is R. In sugar nomenclature, an R configuration at the highest-numbered stereocenter corresponds to the D-series. It is a common convention in such problems to ask for this specific configuration as representative of the whole molecule. Therefore, the answer is the configuration of C4.\n\nFinal Answer: The configuration of C4 is R.\n\n<<<R>>>"
