    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the phenomenon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the textual cues:**\n    *   **\"Illusion\"**: The phenomenon is a trick of perception, where what we perceive is different from the physical reality.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: This suggests that our brain is interpreting an ambiguous stimulus. With the Necker Cube, we can see the same 2D drawing as a 3D cube from two different perspectives. This hints that the phenomenon in question involves the brain making an interpretation or \"filling in\" missing information.\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This points to a fundamental process of the brain that happens automatically to make sense of the sensory world.\n\n2.  **Analyze the image:**\n    *   The image contains two graphs, both representing a signal over time (time is the horizontal axis). These are typical representations of an audio signal.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram)**: This graph shows frequency (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis).\n        *   There is a persistent, thin horizontal line, which represents a pure tone at a constant frequency.\n        *   In the middle, this line is broken. The tone physically stops.\n        *   Exactly where the tone stops, a vertical, fuzzy bar appears. This represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, which is characteristic of noise (like a hiss or a burst of static).\n        *   After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n        *   Therefore, the physical stimulus is: **Tone -> Noise -> Tone**.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform)**: This graph shows amplitude (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis).\n        *   It starts as a regular, repeating sine wave, which is the waveform of a pure tone.\n        *   In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the noise.\n        *   After the noise section, the regular sine wave returns.\n        *   This confirms the stimulus is a tone interrupted by noise.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the cues and the image analysis:**\n    *   We have a physical stimulus where a tone is completely replaced by a burst of noise for a short duration.\n    *   The question describes this as an illusion. The illusion occurs when a person listens to this sound. Instead of hearing the tone stop and then start again, the brain often perceives the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* \"behind\" the noise.\n    *   The brain's \"unconscious perceptual ability\" is to fill in the gap, creating a sense of auditory continuity where none physically exists. This prevents the perception of a fragmented auditory scene.\n\n4.  **Identify the name of the phenomenon:**\n    *   This specific auditory illusion, where an interrupted sound is perceived as continuous when the gap is filled by another sound (typically noise), is known as the **Auditory continuity illusion**.\n    *   It is also sometimes referred to as **temporal induction**.\n    *   A specific case of this illusion involving speech sounds (where a missing phoneme in a word is \"heard\" when replaced by a cough or noise) is called the **Phonemic restoration effect**. Since the image depicts a generic tone, the broader term \"Auditory continuity illusion\" is the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion"
