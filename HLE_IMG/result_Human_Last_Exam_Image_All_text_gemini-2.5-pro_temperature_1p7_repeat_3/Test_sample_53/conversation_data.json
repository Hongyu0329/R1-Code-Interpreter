    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image is a depiction on a Greek red-figure pottery vase. We see a complex scene.\n    *   **Central Figure (Driver):** A figure is actively driving a chariot. This person is wearing ornate, non-Greek attire, specifically a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap with the top bent forward), which in Greek art often denoted people from the East (Anatolia, Thrace, or further east like Colchis). This figure holds the reins and a goad or scepter.\n    *   **The Chariot:** The chariot itself has a large wing visible above it, suggesting it is a magical, flying chariot, not an ordinary one.\n    *   **Passenger/Carried Figure:** The driver is holding or carrying another figure who is draped in cloth. This figure appears lifeless or passive.\n    *   **Figure on the Ground:** Below the chariot, a nude male figure lies dead or dying on the ground, having seemingly fallen or been placed there.\n    *   **Overall Scene:** The scene is one of dramatic action, likely a flight or escape following a tragic event. The style is typical of South Italian (Apulian) red-figure vase painting from the 4th century BCE.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mythological Story:** These specific elements strongly point to one particular Greek myth: the story of Medea.\n    *   **Medea:** Medea was a sorceress from Colchis, a kingdom on the Black Sea, which the Greeks considered an Eastern land. Her depiction in a Phrygian cap and foreign clothing is consistent with her origin.\n    *   **The Murders:** The myth, most famously told in Euripides' play *Medea*, recounts how she was abandoned by her husband, Jason, in Corinth. As revenge, she murdered Jason's new bride and father-in-law, and then, in a final act of devastation, killed the two sons she had with Jason.\n    *   **The Escape:** After committing these acts, Medea escapes from Corinth, beyond Jason's reach, in a magical winged chariot (sometimes described as drawn by dragons or serpents) sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n    *   **The Children's Bodies:** In Euripides' play, she takes the bodies of her murdered sons with her in the chariot to deny Jason the chance to bury them.\n\n3.  **Match the Image to the Myth:**\n    *   The driver in foreign dress is **Medea**.\n    *   The magical winged chariot is her means of escape, provided by Helios.\n    *   The figures being carried and lying on the ground are her two murdered sons. The vase painter has shown one on the ground and the other being lifted into the chariot.\n    *   The overall action is Medea's dramatic departure (leaving) from Corinth after her revenge.\n\n4.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This phrasing can be interpreted in two ways: who is driving the chariot away, or who is falling out of it?\n    *   The figure on the ground is one of Medea's sons, who has \"left\" the chariot in the sense that he is dead on the ground.\n    *   However, the central, active character orchestrating the entire event of \"leaving\" the scene (Corinth) is the driver. This is Medea. She is the protagonist of this scene, and her departure is the main subject. Therefore, she is the \"figure leaving\" in the chariot.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Recognize the specific attributes of the driver (Phrygian cap, patterned clothing) as indicators of a foreign, likely Eastern, character in Greek art.\n    *   Note the winged chariot as a supernatural element.\n    *   Observe the presence of dead or dying figures, indicating a tragedy.\n    *   Combine these elements to pinpoint the specific myth of Medea's escape from Corinth.\n    *   Interpret the question \"figure leaving the chariot\" as referring to the main agent of departure, who is Medea.\n\nThe figure driving the chariot, dressed in Eastern attire and escaping in a winged vehicle after a tragedy, is the sorceress Medea.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
