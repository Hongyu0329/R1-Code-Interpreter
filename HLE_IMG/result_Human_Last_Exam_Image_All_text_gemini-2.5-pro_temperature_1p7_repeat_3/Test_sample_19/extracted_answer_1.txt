1. The music modulates to the key of B minor.
2. The original key is C# minor. The relative major, and a common key for modulation in sonata form, is E major (the III chord). B minor is the minor dominant (v) of E major. Therefore, this modulation to B minor functions as a logical preparation for the larger-scale modulation to the relative major (`v/III`).
3. The chord is a G# diminished triad in first inversion. The most functionally complete analysis, building on the justification above, is to view the progression in the context of the approaching key of E major. The arrival chord (B minor) is `v` in E major, and the preceding G# diminished chord functions as the secondary leading-tone chord of A minor (the `iv` of E major). Therefore, the complete Roman numeral is `viiÂ°6/iv`.
