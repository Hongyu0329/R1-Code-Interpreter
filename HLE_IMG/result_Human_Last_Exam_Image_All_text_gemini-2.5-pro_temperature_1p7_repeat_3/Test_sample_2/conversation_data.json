    "An analysis of the algorithm and its time complexity follows.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nThe provided code defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its operation for `n > 1`:\n\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (from index 0 to `n-2`). After this call returns, we can assume the prefix `a[0...n-2]` is sorted.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the last element of the sorted prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with its neighbor to the left. This is similar to one step of a Bubble Sort pass.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The crucial part is this second recursive call. This call is inside the `if` block. It is executed only if the swap happened. A swap means the element that was at `a[n-2]` (the largest in the prefix) is now at `a[n-1]`, and the smaller element from `a[n-1]` is now at `a[n-2]`. This can disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix. For instance, the new element at `a[n-2]` might be smaller than `a[n-3]`. To fix this potential disruption, the algorithm re-sorts the entire `a[0...n-2]` prefix again by calling `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Worst-Case Scenario**\n\nWe are looking for the worst-case time complexity. The amount of work depends on whether the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed. This call happens if and only if `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`. To maximize the work, we need to find an input array `a` where this condition is true for every step of the main recursion (for `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., `2`).\n\nConsider a reverse-sorted array, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]` with `n = 4`.\n*   `sort(a, 4)` is called.\n    *   It first calls `sort(a, 3)`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts `a[0...2]`. If the subarray was `[4, 3, 2]`, it will become `[2, 3, 4]`. So the whole array `a` is now `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n    *   Back in `sort(a, 4)`, it checks `if a[3] < a[2]`, which is `1 < 4`. This is true.\n    *   It swaps them, so `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n    *   Because the condition was true, it makes the second recursive call: `sort(a, 3)`.\n\nThis demonstrates that a reverse-sorted input will consistently trigger the `if` condition at each level of recursion, thus always executing both recursive calls. This is the worst-case scenario.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing or a constant amount of work. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, in the worst case, the function performs:\n    1.  A recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. Time: `T(n - 1)`.\n    2.  A constant number of operations for the comparison and swap. Time: `O(1)`.\n    3.  A second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. Time: `T(n - 1)`.\n\nAdding these up gives the recurrence relation for the worst case:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where c is a constant)\n\nNow we solve this recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n`T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n`T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n...expanding this `n-1` times...\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 1)` is a geometric series which equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n\nTherefore, `T(n)` is of the order of `2^n`.\n`T(n) = O(2^n)`\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is exponential. This matches option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
