    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) strongly indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule (e.g., 1, 3, 5...).\n*   **Initial Formula Hypothesis:** Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass 14 u), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121 u. The ¹H and ¹³C NMR data (see below) suggest an aromatic ring. A phenyl group (C₆H₅) has a mass of 77 u. If we subtract this, 121 - 77 = 44 u remaining for the rest of the structure. 44 u can correspond to a C₃H₈ fragment (3*12 + 8*1 = 44). Combining these pieces gives a molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N (C₆H₅ + C₃H₈ + N), which has a calculated molecular weight of (9*12.01) + (13*1.01) + (14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23 u. This is an excellent match.\n\n**2. Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation**\n*   Using the formula C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 + (N/2) - (H/2) = 9 + 1 + (1/2) - (13/2) = 10 + 0.5 - 6.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (one ring and three double bonds), which supports our hypothesis of a phenyl group being present.\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Absorption for sp² C-H stretching (aromatic C-H).\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Absorption for sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **No strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹:** Confirms the absence of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Weak, broad peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** While not prominent, there are features consistent with N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 unique carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 120-150 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3). This is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring due to symmetry (ipso, ortho, meta, para carbons).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 80 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2), corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   One negative signal: Indicates one CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Five positive signals: Indicate five CH (methine) and/or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n*   **Carbon-Type Assignment:**\n    *   The signal at δ 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum (which only shows carbons with attached protons). It is the quaternary ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring.\n    *   The signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are positive in DEPT-135, corresponding to the CH carbons of the phenyl ring. (3 positive signals from the ring).\n    *   In the aliphatic region, δ 19.2 is characteristic of a CH₃ group (positive signal). δ 49.6 and 43.5 correspond to the remaining CH and CH₂ groups.\n    *   Therefore, the five positive DEPT signals are from the three aromatic CH types, one aliphatic CH, and one aliphatic CH₃. The single negative signal is from the aliphatic CH₂. This assignment is fully consistent with the data.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** A classic signal for the 5 protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, ~2H):** An aliphatic CH₂ group. The multiplicity suggests it's coupled to neighboring protons.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, ~1H):** An aliphatic CH group. The multiplicity suggests coupling to multiple neighboring protons.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** A CH₃ group coupled to a single proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This means the methyl group is adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **Proton Count:** The integrated signals account for 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11 protons. Our formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 protons. The two missing protons are attributed to the -NH₂ group, as exchangeable protons (like N-H) often give broad signals that are not clearly resolved or integrated.\n\n**6. HSQC Analysis**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal with its directly attached carbon:\n*   ¹H signal at δ ~1.2 ppm correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm (CH₃).\n*   ¹H signal at δ ~2.7 ppm correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6 ppm (CH).\n*   ¹H signal at δ ~2.8 ppm correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5 ppm (CH₂).\n*   The aromatic ¹H multiplet (~7.2 ppm) correlates to the aromatic ¹³C signals (~126-129 ppm).\n\n**7. Structure Elucidation**\nLet's assemble the fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n*   From the ¹H NMR, the CH₃ group (δ 1.2, doublet) is next to the CH group. This gives us a -CH(CH₃) fragment.\n*   We need to arrange the main pieces: [C₆H₅-], [-CH₂-], and [-CH(NH₂)-CH₃].\n*   **Structure A: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine**\n    Structure: Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    *   **¹H NMR check:** -CH₃ is a doublet (split by one H). Correct. -CH(NH₂) is a multiplet (split by CH₂ and CH₃). Correct. Ph-CH₂- is a multiplet (split by one H, and protons are diastereotopic). Correct. This fits the proton NMR data.\n    *   **¹³C NMR shift check:** The benzylic carbon is the -CH₂- group. The carbon attached to the amine is the -CH- group.\n        *   Benzylic -CH₂-: Expected shift ~40-45 ppm. Observed (from HSQC): 43.5 ppm. Excellent match.\n        *   -CH(NH₂)-: Expected shift ~50 ppm. Observed (from HSQC): 49.6 ppm. Excellent match.\n*   **Structure B: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine**\n    Structure: Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   **¹³C NMR shift check:** The benzylic carbon is the -CH- group. The carbon attached to the amine is the -CH₂- group.\n        *   Benzylic -CH-: Expected shift ~40-45 ppm. Observed for CH is 49.6 ppm. Poor match.\n        *   -CH₂(NH₂)-: Expected shift ~45-50 ppm. Observed for CH₂ is 43.5 ppm. Poor match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic data are highly consistent with the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**8. IUPAC Name**\nThe parent chain is propane. The principal functional group is the amine, located at position 2. A phenyl substituent is at position 1. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
