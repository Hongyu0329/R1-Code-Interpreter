    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify the type of isomeric relationship between \"the molecules mentioned above\". This implies that there should be molecular structures presented for comparison.\n\n2.  **Examine the provided information:** The image that is supposed to show \"the molecules\" is completely black. There are no chemical structures, formulas, or names of any molecules provided.\n\n3.  **Define the options:**\n    *   **(a) Conformers (or conformational isomers):** These are isomers that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. To identify them, we need to see the 3D structures of the molecules and verify they have the same molecular formula and connectivity.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers (or structural isomers):** These are isomers that have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order). To identify them, we need to see the molecular structures to compare their formulas and bond connections.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** The molecules are exactly the same. They can be superimposed on each other, possibly after rotation of the entire molecule or rotation around single bonds. We need to see the structures to check this.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These are isomers that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers. To identify them, we need the 3D structures.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the situation:** Since no molecules are shown, we have no information to work with. We cannot determine their molecular formulas, their connectivity, or their spatial arrangements. Without this crucial information, it is impossible to perform the comparison required to select any of the options (a), (b), (c), or (d).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because the necessary information (the structures of the molecules) is missing, none of the specific classifications can be applied. Therefore, the only appropriate choice is the one that accounts for this situation. By a process of elimination, since we cannot prove the relationship is (a), (b), (c), or (d), we must conclude that the answer is not among these specific choices.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The primary careful point is to recognize that the image is blank and contains no data.\n*   One must understand the definitions of different types of isomers to realize what information is required to distinguish between them.\n*   The conclusion must be based on the lack of information. It is impossible to analyze a relationship between non-existent entities.\n*   \"None of these\" is the correct choice when the other options are demonstrably false or, as in this case, when there is no basis to select any of them.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe question is unanswerable because the molecules to be analyzed are not provided. Therefore, none of the specific classifications (conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, stereoisomers) can be chosen. The only remaining option is \"None of these\".\n\n<<<e>>>"
