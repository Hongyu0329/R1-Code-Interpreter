    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the element from its spectral lines.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Image:** The image provided is a bright-line emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is produced when atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them). The energized electrons jump to higher energy levels and then fall back, emitting photons of very specific energies. These specific energies correspond to specific wavelengths (and thus colors) of light, which appear as distinct colored lines.\n\n2.  **Recognize the \"Fingerprint\" Nature of Spectra:** Every chemical element has a unique emission spectrum. This uniqueness allows scientists to identify the composition of substances, including distant stars, by analyzing the light they emit. The task is to match the given \"fingerprint\" to a known element.\n\n3.  **Examine the Features of the Spectrum:** Let's observe the key lines and their distribution across the color spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelength).\n    *   **Red Region:** There is a prominent, bright red line, along with a few other slightly less intense red lines.\n    *   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very distinct and bright yellow-orange line.\n    *   **Green-Cyan Region:** There are several lines in this area. A prominent bright green line and a slightly less bright cyan (blue-green) line are visible.\n    *   **Blue-Violet Region:** There are multiple distinct lines in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum.\n    *   **Overall Pattern:** The spectrum is not simple (like hydrogen) but also not overwhelmingly complex (like iron). It has a set of several well-spaced, prominent lines across the entire visible range.\n\n4.  **Compare with Known Elemental Spectra:** Now, let's compare this observed pattern with the characteristic spectra of some common elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of one strong red line (H-alpha), one cyan line (H-beta), and a couple of blue/violet lines. The spectrum in the image is much more complex, with many more lines. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n    *   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its use in signs. Its spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum. The given spectrum has strong lines across all colors, not just red/orange. Therefore, it is not neon.\n    *   **Sodium:** The sodium spectrum is characterized by a very dominant, intense pair of yellow lines (the \"sodium D-lines\"). While the provided spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines in red, green, and blue, which is not characteristic of sodium. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n    *   **Mercury:** Mercury has strong lines in the violet, blue, a very prominent green, and a yellow-orange doublet. While there are some similarities, the number and spacing of the lines in the given image, particularly in the red and blue regions, are different from the classic mercury spectrum.\n    *   **Helium:** The spectrum of helium is known for having a series of strong, distinct lines spread across the visible range. Its prominent lines include a strong red line (~668 nm), a very bright yellow line (~587 nm), a bright green line (~502 nm), a cyan line (~492 nm), and several blue and violet lines (~471 nm, ~447 nm). This pattern—a collection of distinct, bright lines in red, yellow, green, and blue-violet—is an excellent match for the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Emission vs. Absorption:** It is crucial to identify this as an emission spectrum (bright lines) and compare it with other emission spectra, not absorption spectra (dark lines).\n*   **Wavelength Axis:** The horizontal axis represents the wavelength of light, typically increasing from left (violet) to right (red). The specific positions are key to identification.\n*   **Line Intensity:** The relative brightness of the lines is also a characteristic feature. Notice the bright yellow and green lines in the image, which are hallmarks of the element in question.\n*   **Exclusion of Alternatives:** A reliable identification involves not only finding a good match but also confidently ruling out other common possibilities based on clear differences in their spectral patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed comparison, the pattern of spectral lines in the image, with its characteristic strong lines in the red, yellow, green, and blue-violet regions, is a definitive match for the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
