    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Medium and Style:** The image displays a relief sculpture, likely made of terracotta due to its smooth finish and the style of the relief. The work is circular (a tondo or medallion) and set within a larger, ornately decorated rectangular frame. The artistic style, characterized by graceful figures, serene expressions, and classical drapery, is strongly indicative of the Italian Renaissance, particularly from Florence. The specific technique of glazed terracotta relief was famously pioneered and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop.\n\n2.  **Examine the Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest, standing at a small altar on the left, is administering communion (the Eucharist) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground. This confirms the religious context, likely as part of a larger religious commission like an altarpiece.\n\n3.  **Read the Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a cartouche with an inscription. Although partially obscured and weathered, the text can be read as \"SACRAMENT[I] DE L'AVTEL\". This is a mixture of Latin and Old French/Italian, meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is another term for the Eucharist. This inscription directly confirms the subject of the relief.\n\n4.  **Identify the Artist and the Specific Work:** The combination of the glazed terracotta technique, the distinctive artistic style, and the subject matter points strongly to Andrea della Robbia (1435â€“1525), a prominent member of the Della Robbia family of sculptors. By searching for works by Andrea della Robbia depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or the Eucharist, this specific tondo can be identified. It is a detail from the *Altarpiece of the Sacraments* (Altare dei Sacramenti), located in the Cathedral of Sovana in Tuscany, Italy. This altarpiece, created circa 1485-1490, features a series of reliefs depicting the Seven Sacraments, and this tondo represents the Eucharist.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the distinctive style, medium, inscription, and known art historical record, the author of this altarpiece detail is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish between the various members of the Della Robbia family (Luca the Elder, Andrea, and Giovanni). The sweet piety and gentle grace of the figures in this relief are hallmarks of Andrea's mature style.\n*   The inscription \"DE L'AVTEL\" is a significant clue. \"Autel\" is French for altar, and its use in an Italian work reflects the linguistic fluidity and influences of the time.\n*   Recognizing the work as a detail from a larger altarpiece (the Altarpiece of the Sacraments in Sovana) is key to a precise identification and attribution, moving beyond a general stylistic association.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
