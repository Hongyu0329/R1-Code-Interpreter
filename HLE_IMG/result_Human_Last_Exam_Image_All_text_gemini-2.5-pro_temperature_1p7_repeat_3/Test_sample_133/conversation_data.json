    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak and Isotope Pattern**\n\n1.  **Identify the highest mass cluster:** The peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are in the range of 258-266. This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopologues.\n2.  **Examine the isotope pattern:** The relative intensities of the peaks in this cluster can reveal the presence of elements with characteristic isotopes, like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n    *   The major peaks in this cluster are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis of chlorine atoms being present. A single Cl atom gives an M+2 peak with about 33% the intensity of the M peak (ratio ~3:1).\n    *   The observed pattern does not fit 1 or 2 Cl atoms. Let's test for **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   For a compound with 3 Cl atoms, the expected ratio of intensities for the M⁺, M+2, M+4, and M+6 peaks is approximately 100 : 96 : 31 : 3 (derived from the natural abundances of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl). This is often simplified to ~27:27:9:1.\n    *   Let's compare the observed intensities for the cluster starting at m/z 260: I(260):I(262):I(264):I(266) = 34.8 : 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22.\n    *   If we normalize this to the first peak (34.8), the ratio is 100 : 83 : 37 : 9.\n    *   This is a good match for the theoretical pattern for three chlorine atoms. The M⁺ peak (containing only ³⁵Cl) is at m/z 260.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound contains 3 chlorine atoms and has a nominal molecular mass of 260 u.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Calculate the mass of the non-halogen part:** The mass contribution of three ³⁵Cl atoms is 3 * 35 = 105 u.\n2.  The remaining mass is 260 - 105 = 155 u. This mass belongs to the CₓHᵧ... part of the molecule.\n3.  **Determine the formula for the remaining part:** Assuming the remainder is a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ:\n    *   The maximum number of carbon atoms is 155 / 12 ≈ 12.9. So let's try C=12.\n    *   If C=12, the mass is 12 * 12 = 144 u.\n    *   The remaining mass for hydrogen is 155 - 144 = 11 u. So, H=11.\n    *   The hydrocarbon part is C₁₂H₁₁.\n4.  **Propose the molecular formula:** The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern to Confirm the Structure**\n\n1.  **Base Peak (most intense peak):** The base peak is at m/z 225 (I=100%).\n2.  **Relate the base peak to the molecular ion:** The mass difference between the M⁺ peak (260) and the base peak (225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a chlorine radical (•Cl), a very common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds.\n    *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃]⁺• (m/z 260) → [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ (m/z 225) + •Cl\n3.  **Check the isotope pattern of the base peak:** The fragment ion [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ should have two chlorine atoms. The expected isotope pattern for 2 Cl is M:(M+2):(M+4) in a ratio of ~9:6:1 (or 100:66:11).\n    *   The spectrum shows peaks at m/z 225 (I=100), m/z 227 (I=66.7), and m/z 229 (I=22.2).\n    *   The ratio of I(225):I(227) is 100:66.7, a perfect match for the expected ~100:66.\n    *   The peak at m/z 229 is stronger than expected (~11%). This enhancement can be explained by the contribution from the ¹³C isotope of the M+2 peak, which also falls at m/z 229. This confirms the fragment at m/z 225 contains two chlorine atoms.\n4.  **Analyze other major fragments:** Look for further sequential losses of Cl.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 190 (I=48.4%):** Mass difference from the base peak is 225 - 190 = 35 u. This is the loss of a second Cl atom.\n        *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ (m/z 225) → [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺ (m/z 190) + •Cl\n    *   **Peak at m/z 155 (I=16.1%):** Mass difference from the previous fragment is 190 - 155 = 35 u. This is the loss of the third and final Cl atom.\n        *   [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺ (m/z 190) → [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺ (m/z 155) + •Cl\n5.  This sequential loss of all three chlorine atoms is a very clear and strong confirmation of the proposed molecular formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n1.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For a formula CₐHₓXₙ (where X is a halogen), the DBE is calculated as: DBE = a - (x+n)/2 + 1.\n    *   For C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃: DBE = 12 - (11+3)/2 + 1 = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6.\n2.  **Interpret the DBE:** A DBE of 6 suggests the presence of rings and/or double bonds. For example, a benzene ring has a DBE of 4. The remaining 2 DBEs could come from another ring and a double bond.\n3.  **Propose a structural class:** A plausible structure consists of a phenyl group (C₆H₅, DBE=4) attached to a chlorinated cyclohexene ring (C₆H₆Cl₃). A cyclohexene ring provides 1 DBE for the ring and 1 DBE for the double bond, for a total of 2.\n    *   Phenyl group: C₆H₅\n    *   Trichlorocyclohexene remnant: C₆H₆Cl₃\n    *   Total Formula: C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. DBE = 4 (phenyl) + 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) = 6.\n    *   This structural class is consistent with the formula and DBE. The strong [M-Cl]⁺ base peak can be explained by the formation of a stable allylic/benzylic-type carbocation upon loss of a chlorine atom from the cyclohexene ring.\n4.  **Provide a systematic IUPAC name:** Although many isomers are possible, we can provide a systematic name for one such structure. Let's assume the phenyl group is at position 1 and the double bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   A plausible name is **1-phenyl-4,5,6-trichlorocyclohex-1-ene**."
