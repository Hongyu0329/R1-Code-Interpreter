    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the time signature of the musical measure shown in the image. The time signature, usually found at the beginning of a piece, tells us how many beats are in a measure and what type of note gets one beat. Since it's not written, we must deduce it by counting the total duration of the notes within the measure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Top Staff (Right Hand):**\n    *   The measure is divided into four rhythmic groups, which suggests four beats. Let's analyze the duration of each group.\n    *   **First Beat:** The first group consists of a sixteenth rest, a sixteenth note (as a chord), another sixteenth note, and a sixteenth rest. The total duration is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4. This is equal to one quarter note.\n    *   **Second Beat:** The second group consists of a sixteenth note, a sixteenth rest, a sixteenth note, and a sixteenth rest. The total duration is also 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This is another quarter note.\n    *   **Third Beat:** The third group consists of four sixteenth notes beamed together. The total duration is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This is a third quarter note.\n    *   **Fourth Beat:** The fourth group also consists of four sixteenth notes beamed together. The total duration is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. This is a fourth quarter note.\n    *   **Total Duration (Top Staff):** Summing the durations of all four beats gives 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4. This strongly indicates a time signature of 4/4.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Bottom Staff (Left Hand):**\n    *   The music in the bottom staff must have the same total duration as the top staff. Let's verify this.\n    *   **First Note/Chord:** This is a dotted quarter note chord. A quarter note equals two eighth notes, and the dot adds half of its value (one eighth note). So, a dotted quarter note = 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8 duration.\n    *   **Second Note:** This is an eighth note, which has a duration of 1/8.\n    *   **Third Note:** This is a half note. A half note equals two quarter notes, or four eighth notes. So, its duration is 4/8 (or 1/2).\n    *   **Total Duration (Bottom Staff):** Summing the durations of the notes gives 3/8 + 1/8 + 4/8 = 8/8.\n    *   An 8/8 duration is equivalent to 4/4. Both represent a full measure with the value of one whole note.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both staves contain notes and rests that sum up to a total duration of four quarter notes.\n    *   Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 2/4: Incorrect. The measure contains four quarter beats.\n    *   B. 3/4: Incorrect. The measure contains four quarter beats.\n    *   C. 4/4: Correct. The analysis of both staves confirms a total duration of four quarter beats.\n    *   D. 3/8: Incorrect. The measure contains the equivalent of eight eighth notes.\n    *   E. 9/8: Incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nTop Staff: (4 x 1/16) + (4 x 1/16) + (4 x 1/16) + (4 x 1/16) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4.\nBottom Staff: 3/8 (dotted quarter) + 1/8 (eighth) + 1/2 (half) = 3/8 + 1/8 + 4/8 = 8/8 = 4/4.\nThe time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
