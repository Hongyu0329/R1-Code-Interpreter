    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Circuit**\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency of the given circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite ladder of resistors ($r$) and a single capacitor ($C$). The input signal is applied at node $c_0$ relative to ground. The output is the voltage at node $a_0$ relative to ground.\n\nThe presence of resistors and a capacitor indicates that the circuit acts as a filter. Since the output is taken across the capacitor connected to ground, it functions as a low-pass filter.\n\n**2. Definition of Cutoff Frequency**\nFor a first-order low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the output voltage drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. This frequency, denoted as $\\omega_c$ (angular frequency in rad/s) or $f_c$ (frequency in Hz), is determined by the time constant of the RC circuit.\n\nThe time constant $\\tau$ is the product of the capacitance $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance $R_{th}$ seen by the capacitor.\n$\\tau = R_{th} C$\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\n\nTo find the cutoff frequency, we must first determine the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from the terminals of the capacitor, which are node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. Turning off the input voltage source `IN` at $c_0$ means connecting node $c_0$ to ground.\n\n*   The node labeling suggests a repeating pattern. Let's assume node $a_0$ is the same as node $d_0$ in the ladder indexing.\n*   So, we need to find the equivalent resistance between node $d_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also connected to ground.\n\nWe can solve this by setting up the node voltage equations for the resistive ladder. Let's find the resistance by injecting a test current $I_{test}$ into node $d_0$ and calculating the resulting voltage $U_0$ at node $d_0$. Then, $R_{th} = U_0 / I_{test}$.\n\nLet $V_k$ be the voltage at node $c_k$ and $U_k$ be the voltage at node $d_k$.\nThe KCL equations for any node $k \\ge 1$ are:\nAt node $d_k$: $(\\frac{U_k - U_{k-1}}{r}) + (\\frac{U_k - U_{k+1}}{r}) + (\\frac{U_k - V_k}{r}) = 0 \\implies -U_{k-1} + 3U_k - U_{k+1} - V_k = 0$\nAt node $c_k$: $(\\frac{V_k - V_{k-1}}{r}) + (\\frac{V_k - V_{k+1}}{r}) + (\\frac{V_k - U_k}{r}) = 0 \\implies -V_{k-1} + 3V_k - V_{k+1} - U_k = 0$\n\nTo simplify this coupled system, we define sum and difference potentials:\n$S_k = U_k + V_k$\n$D_k = U_k - V_k$\n\nAdding the two KCL equations gives a difference equation for $S_k$:\n$-(S_{k-1}) + 2S_k - S_{k+1} = 0 \\implies S_{k+1} - 2S_k + S_{k-1} = 0$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1 = 0$, which gives $\\mu = 1$ (repeated root). The general solution is $S_k = A \\cdot 1^k + B \\cdot k \\cdot 1^k = A + Bk$.\n\nSubtracting the second KCL equation from the first gives a difference equation for $D_k$:\n$-D_{k-1} + 4D_k - D_{k+1} = 0 \\implies D_{k+1} - 4D_k + D_{k-1} = 0$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\nu^2 - 4\\nu + 1 = 0$. The roots are $\\nu = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe general solution is $D_k = P(2+\\sqrt{3})^k + Q(2-\\sqrt{3})^k$.\n\nNow, we apply boundary conditions:\n1.  As $k \\to \\infty$, the potentials must remain bounded (or go to zero). This implies that coefficients of growing terms must be zero. So, $B=0$ and $P=0$.\n    This leaves us with:\n    $S_k = A$ (a constant)\n    $D_k = Q \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^k$. Let $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. So $D_k = Q \\lambda^k$.\n\n2.  At the input end ($k=0$), we have the following conditions for calculating $R_{th}$:\n    *   Node $c_0$ is grounded: $V_0 = 0$.\n    *   A test current $I_{test}$ is injected at node $d_0$.\n\nLet's express $U_k$ and $V_k$ back in terms of the solutions for $S_k$ and $D_k$:\n$U_k = (S_k + D_k)/2 = (A + Q\\lambda^k)/2$\n$V_k = (S_k - D_k)/2 = (A - Q\\lambda^k)/2$\n\nApplying $V_0 = 0$:\n$V_0 = (A - Q\\lambda^0)/2 = (A-Q)/2 = 0 \\implies A = Q$.\n\nSo, our solutions become:\n$S_k = A$\n$D_k = A \\lambda^k$\n\nThe voltage at node $d_0$ is:\n$U_0 = (S_0 + D_0)/2 = (A + A\\lambda^0)/2 = (A+A)/2 = A$.\n\nThe KCL equation at node $d_0$ is given by the injected current $I_{test}$ and the current flowing into the ladder:\n$I_{test} = \\frac{U_0 - U_1}{r}$\n\nLet's find $U_1$:\n$U_1 = (S_1 + D_1)/2 = (A + A\\lambda^1)/2 = A(1+\\lambda)/2$.\n\nNow, substitute $U_0$ and $U_1$ into the KCL equation:\n$I_{test} = \\frac{A - A(1+\\lambda)/2}{r} = \\frac{A}{r} (1 - \\frac{1+\\lambda}{2}) = \\frac{A}{r} (\\frac{2-1-\\lambda}{2}) = \\frac{A(1-\\lambda)}{2r}$\n\nFinally, we calculate $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{U_0}{I_{test}} = \\frac{A}{A(1-\\lambda)/(2r)} = \\frac{2r}{1-\\lambda}$\n\nSubstitute $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**4. Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency.\n$R_{th} = (1+\\sqrt{3})r$\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$. The angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is standard for such expressions.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = (1+\\sqrt{3})r$.\nThe cutoff frequency is $\\omega_c = 1/(R_{th}C)$.\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\n<<<$1/((1+\\sqrt{3})*r*C)$>>>"
