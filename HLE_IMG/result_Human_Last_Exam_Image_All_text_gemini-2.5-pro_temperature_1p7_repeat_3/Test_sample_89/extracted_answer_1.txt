The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A:** A complex polycyclic structure containing a central 2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide core, resulting from a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by cycloreversion and amidation of the ester group.

 

**Product B:** A bicyclic imide formed from Michael addition followed by cyclization and fragmentation. The structure is a pyrrolidine ring fused to an eight-membered ring containing the imide functionality and a double bond from the Michael adduct.

 

**Product C:** A bicyclic lactam, specifically 8a-acetyl-hexahydropyrrolizin-5-one, formed from the acylation of the intermediate at the C5 position followed by fragmentation.
