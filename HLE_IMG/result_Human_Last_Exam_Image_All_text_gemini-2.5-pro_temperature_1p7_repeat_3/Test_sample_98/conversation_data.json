    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step 1: Object Identification**\nThe image provided is a black and white photograph of a medallion. By performing a search based on its unique visual characteristics, the object can be identified as a decorative element from a larger artifact. Specifically, this is the central medallion from a shallow bowl (a phiale, designated Bowl No. 21) that is part of the famous **Treasure of Nagyszentmikl처s** (also known as the S창nnicolau Mare Treasure).\n\n**Step 2: Iconographic Analysis**\nThe medallion depicts two busts facing each other. The figure on the left is male and is distinguished by a large, curved ram's horn at his temple. This iconography is strongly associated with the Greco-Egyptian god **Zeus-Ammon**. This motif was famously adopted by **Alexander the Great** after his visit to the Oracle of Siwa, and he was often depicted with ram's horns to symbolize his divine parentage and power. The persistence of this classical motif into later periods is significant. The figure on the right appears to be a female consort or deity. The scene likely depicts a powerful ruler, styled after Alexander, with his partner.\n\n**Step 3: Stylistic Analysis**\nThe artistic style of the medallion is not classical Greek or Roman. The figures are rendered in a more abstract and stylized manner, with bold lines and a somewhat flattened perspective. This style is eclectic, showing a blend of influences from:\n*   **Late Antique/Byzantine art:** Seen in the bust format and general composition.\n*   **Sasanian Persian art:** Noticeable in some decorative elements and the portrayal of royalty.\n*   **Central Asian Steppe art:** Evident in the abstraction and powerful, non-naturalistic rendering typical of nomadic cultures.\nThis mix of styles is characteristic of the art produced in the Carpathian Basin during the Early Middle Ages by peoples like the Avars or early Bulgars.\n\n**Step 4: Archaeological Context and Dating**\nThe key to dating the medallion is the archaeological context of the entire Treasure of Nagyszentmikl처s. This hoard of 23 gold vessels is one of the most important finds from Early Medieval Europe. While its exact ethnic origin is still debated among scholars (Avar, Bulgar, and other theories exist), the chronological dating is more established. The majority of archaeologists and historians date the manufacture and burial of the treasure to the **late 8th to early 9th centuries A.D.** This period corresponds to the final phase of the Avar Khaganate and the rise of Bulgar power in the region. The Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where the treasure is housed, often dates it to the late 8th century, while many other scholars place it squarely in the 9th century.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the firm archaeological context of the Treasure of Nagyszentmikl처s and the scholarly consensus on its dating, the medallion is ascribed to the late 8th or, more commonly, the **9th century A.D.**\n\n<<<9th century A.D.>>>"
