    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph, which we will call G.\nThe graph has 5 vertices, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nLet's list the edges by observing the connections for each vertex:\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 5. Edges: (1,2), (1,5).\n*   Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, vertex 3, and vertex 4. Edges: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4).\n*   Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2, vertex 4, and vertex 5. Edges: (3,2), (3,4), (3,5).\n*   Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 2, vertex 3, and vertex 5. Edges: (4,2), (4,3), (4,5).\n*   Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1, vertex 3, and vertex 4. Edges: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nConsolidating this list and removing duplicates, we get the set of edges E:\nE = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\nThe graph G has 5 vertices and |E| = 7 edges.\n\nA key structural feature of this graph is that it is a **Wheel Graph W5 with one spoke removed**. A wheel graph Wn has n vertices, with one central vertex connected to all other n-1 vertices, which form a cycle Cn-1.\nIn our case, the vertices {1, 2, 3, 5} form a cycle C4 (1-2-3-5-1). Vertex 4 is a central vertex connected to {2, 3, 5}.\nA full W5 graph with center 4 and rim {1,2,3,5} would have spokes (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5).\nOur graph G is missing the edge (4,1). So, G = W5 - e, where e = (1,4).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\nThe Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of ways to color the vertices of G with k colors such that no adjacent vertices share the same color. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction Theorem**. The standard form is:\nP(H, k) = P(H-e, k) - P(H/e, k)\nwhere H is a graph, e is an edge in H, H-e is H with edge e deleted, and H/e is H with edge e contracted (its endpoints merged).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula for our case. Let H be the full wheel graph W5 and e be the edge (1,4). Our graph G is H-e.\nSo, P(G, k) = P(H-e, k) = P(H, k) + P(H/e, k).\nWe need to find the chromatic polynomials for W5 and for the contracted graph W5/(1,4).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of W5**\nThe chromatic polynomial of a wheel graph Wn is given by the formula P(Wn, k) = k * P(Cn-1, k-1). For n=5, we need the chromatic polynomial of the cycle graph C4.\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle Cn is P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1).\nFor C4, P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1).\nNow we substitute k with k-1 to find P(C4, k-1):\nP(C4, k-1) = ((k-1)-1)^4 + ((k-1)-1) = (k-2)^4 + (k-2).\nFinally, we find P(W5, k):\nP(W5, k) = k * P(C4, k-1) = k * [(k-2)^4 + (k-2)].\n\nLet's expand this:\nP(W5, k) = k * [ (k^4 - 8k^3 + 24k^2 - 32k + 16) + (k-2) ]\nP(W5, k) = k * (k^4 - 8k^3 + 24k^2 - 31k + 14)\nP(W5, k) = k^5 - 8k^4 + 24k^3 - 31k^2 + 14k.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph W5/(1,4)**\nLet's call the contracted graph F = W5/(1,4). When we contract the edge (1,4) in W5, we merge vertices 1 and 4 into a single new vertex, let's call it v_14.\nThe vertices of F are {v_14, 2, 3, 5}.\nThe edges of F are the edges of W5 that do not have both endpoints as 1 or 4.\n*   Edges in W5 not involving 1 or 4: (2,3), (3,5).\n*   Edges involving 1 or 4 become edges incident to v_14. The neighbors of v_14 are the union of the neighbors of 1 and 4 in W5 (excluding 1 and 4 themselves).\n    *   Neighbors of 1 in W5: {2, 5, 4}.\n    *   Neighbors of 4 in W5: {1, 2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Neighbors of v_14: {2, 5} U {2, 3, 5} = {2, 3, 5}.\n*   So, the edges of F are {(2,3), (3,5), (v_14,2), (v_14,3), (v_14,5)}. This graph F is a Fan Graph (a central vertex v_14 connected to all vertices of a path P3: 2-3-5).\n\nTo find P(F, k), we can use direct counting with casework.\nLet's determine the number of ways to color F with k colors. Coloring order: 3, 2, 5, v_14.\n*   Number of choices for vertex 3: k.\n*   Number of choices for vertex 2 (adjacent to 3): k-1.\n*   Number of choices for vertex 5 (adjacent to 3): k-1.\nNow for vertex v_14, it is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. The number of choices depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.\n*   **Case 1: Color(2) = Color(5)**.\n    *   To make C(2)=C(5), C(5) must take the same color as C(2). Since C(2) had k-1 choices (not equal to C(3)), there are k-1 choices for this shared color.\n    *   Coloring counts: C(3): k. C(2): k-1. C(5): 1 (must be same as C(2)).\n    *   C(v_14) must be different from C(3) and C(2). So there are k-2 choices.\n    *   Total ways for Case 1 = k * (k-1) * 1 * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n*   **Case 2: Color(2) â‰  Color(5)**.\n    *   C(3): k choices. C(2): k-1 choices.\n    *   C(5) must be different from C(3) and C(2). So there are k-2 choices.\n    *   C(v_14) must be different from C(3), C(2), and C(5) (all distinct). So there are k-3 choices.\n    *   Total ways for Case 2 = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3).\n*   P(F, k) is the sum of ways from both cases:\n    P(F, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n    P(F, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [1 + (k-3)]\n    P(F, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\nLet's expand this:\nP(F, k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 4k + 4)\nP(F, k) = k(k^3 - 4k^2 + 4k - k^2 + 4k - 4)\nP(F, k) = k(k^3 - 5k^2 + 8k - 4)\nP(F, k) = k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\nNow we combine the polynomials for W5 and F to find the polynomial for our graph G.\nP(G, k) = P(W5, k) + P(F, k)\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 8k^4 + 24k^3 - 31k^2 + 14k) + (k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k)\n\nCombine like terms:\n*   k^5: 1\n*   k^4: -8 + 1 = -7\n*   k^3: 24 - 5 = 19\n*   k^2: -31 + 8 = -23\n*   k: 14 - 4 = 10\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k.\n\nThis can also be written in factored form: P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
