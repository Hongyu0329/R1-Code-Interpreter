    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is reddish-brown and has a highly porous or \"bubbly\" texture. The holes are called vesicles, and this texture is described as vesicular. The underlying rock is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n    *   **Careful Points:** The key features are the vesicular texture and the dark, reddish color. Vesicles form when gas escapes from cooling lava. The reddish color often indicates the presence of oxidized iron, common in mafic or intermediate lavas.\n    *   **Identification:** A vesicular, extrusive igneous rock that is typically red, brown, or black is called **Scoria**. It is denser than pumice.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous fragments (clasts) of other rocks. These fragments are notably angular, not rounded. The fragments are of various sizes and are held together by a cement-like material (matrix).\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a clastic rock. The defining characteristic for its identification is the shape of the large clasts. Since they are angular, it implies they were not transported far from their source before being cemented together.\n    *   **Identification:** A clastic rock made of large, angular fragments is called a **Breccia**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is very light in color (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is extremely vesicular. It has a frothy, glassy appearance and looks very lightweight.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The combination of a felsic (light) color and an extremely vesicular texture is characteristic of a specific type of volcanic rock. Its low density is a key property.\n    *   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. Pumice is a volcanic glass so full of vesicles that its density is often low enough to float on water.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This texture is called coarse-grained or phaneritic. The minerals are predominantly light-colored (white, pinkish, translucent gray) with some smaller dark minerals.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The coarse-grained texture indicates the rock cooled slowly, deep within the Earth's crust (intrusive). The light color suggests a felsic composition, rich in minerals like quartz and feldspar.\n    *   **Identification:** A coarse-grained, felsic, intrusive igneous rock is called **Granite**. The particularly large crystals might suggest it is a pegmatite, which is a very coarse-grained variety of granite. Granite is the correct general identification.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
