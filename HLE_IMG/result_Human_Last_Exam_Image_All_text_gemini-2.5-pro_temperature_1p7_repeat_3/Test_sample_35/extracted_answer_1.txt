The protein S100B exhibits strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**. It could be used as a **prognostic marker** because the diagram shows its direct involvement in activating signaling pathways (NFκβ, JNK/JUN) that lead to key pathological outcomes like neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B overexpression would likely correlate with the severity and rate of disease progression, allowing for a prediction of the clinical outcome.
