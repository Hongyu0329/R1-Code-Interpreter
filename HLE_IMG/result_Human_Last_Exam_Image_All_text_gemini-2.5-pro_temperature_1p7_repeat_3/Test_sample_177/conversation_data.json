    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Understand VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. This refers to the total miles driven by vehicles, not the people in them. Therefore, a car trip contributes the same mileage to VMT whether it has one occupant or multiple occupants. The `Average Carpool Occupancy` figures are not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Weighted Calculation:** The overall VMT is a weighted sum. The total VMT is calculated by considering the proportion of trips that fall into each distance category (`share of total trips`).\n3.  **Car Mode Share:** For each distance category, the \"car\" mode share is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n4.  **Relative Calculation:** Since we need a percentage reduction, the absolute total number of trips is irrelevant; it will cancel out. We can work with relative VMT values calculated from the given percentages.\n5.  **Structure of Calculation:** The calculation must be done for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios separately before comparing them. For each scenario, we calculate the VMT for each distance category and then sum them to get the total VMT.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\nThe formula to calculate the relative VMT for each scenario is:\nTotal Relative VMT = Σ [(Share of total trips) × (Total car mode share) × (Average trip distance)] for each distance category.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Relative Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (miles) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (miles) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (miles) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (miles) = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Relative VMT (Baseline):**\n    *   `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Relative Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (miles) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (miles) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (miles) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Relative VMT = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (miles) = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Relative VMT (Proposed):**\n    *   `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline) * 100`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   Percentage Reduction = `(2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100`\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ `0.52195 * 100` ≈ `52.2%`\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
