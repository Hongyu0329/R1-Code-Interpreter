    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure matches itself during a full 360-degree rotation around a central point. The number of times it matches is called the \"order\" or \"fold\" of the symmetry. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n2.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a complex tiling pattern composed of several geometric shapes. We can identify the primary tiles:\n    *   Dark blue regular heptagons (7-sided polygons).\n    *   Light orange squares (4-sided polygons).\n    *   Dark orange rhombuses (4-sided polygons that are not squares).\n\n3.  **Identify potential centers of rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we need to locate points in the pattern that can serve as centers of rotation. Let's examine the centers of the different shapes.\n    *   **Center of a square:** Consider the center of a light orange square. The square itself has 4-fold symmetry. The square is surrounded by four dark orange rhombuses. If we rotate the pattern by 90° (360°/4) around the center of the square, the surrounding rhombuses and the rest of the pattern map onto themselves. This means the tiling has points with 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Center of a heptagon:** Now, consider the center of a dark blue heptagon. A regular heptagon has 7-fold symmetry. Let's look at its surroundings. The heptagon is encircled by seven dark orange rhombuses, one attached to each side. This local arrangement has 7-fold symmetry. If we extend our view to the entire pattern and rotate it by 360°/7 (approximately 51.4°) around the center of this heptagon, the entire tiling perfectly aligns with its original position. Every heptagon moves to where another heptagon was, every square to a square, and every rhombus to a rhombus. This confirms that the tiling has points with 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n4.  **Determine the highest order of symmetry:** The tiling exhibits multiple types of rotational symmetry at different points (e.g., 4-fold and 7-fold, as well as 2-fold at other locations). When a question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, it conventionally refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry that exists anywhere in the pattern. In this case, we have found 4-fold and 7-fold symmetry. The higher of these is 7.\n\n5.  **Final conclusion:** The highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 7-fold, centered on the blue heptagons. Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 7-fold.\n\nCareful points to note:\n*   You must check that the *entire* pattern, not just a single tile or its immediate neighbors, maps onto itself after rotation.\n*   This pattern is a type of non-periodic tiling or quasicrystal, as regular periodic tilings (which can be described by a repeating unit cell) are forbidden by the crystallographic restriction theorem from having 7-fold symmetry. The presence of shapes like heptagons often signals non-periodic symmetry.\n*   The question asks for a single characteristic symmetry of the whole pattern, which is typically the highest order found.\n\n<<<7>>>"
