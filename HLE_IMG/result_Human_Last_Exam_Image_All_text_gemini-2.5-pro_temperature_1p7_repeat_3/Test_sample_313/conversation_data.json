    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual clue and the first sentence.**\n*   The first sentence states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in formal suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man (on the right) is receiving a trophy from the other man (on the left).\n*   A search for major award events on or around June 20, 2019, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had a remarkable night, winning three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   Winning three major achievements in sports is commonly called a \"hat trick\". Therefore, what is \"pictured\" is Nikita Kucherov completing a \"hat trick\" of awards. This suggests that \"X Y\" could be \"Hat trick\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second sentence states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical process or object that involved mercury salts and is now obsolete due to its toxicity.\n*   The most famous historical use of mercury salts that fits this description is in the making of felt hats. Hatmakers (or \"hatters\") used mercuric nitrate (a salt of mercury) to treat animal fur, a process called \"carroting\".\n*   This process resulted in workers absorbing mercury, leading to neurological damage and symptoms that inspired the term \"mad as a hatter\". Due to this high toxicity, the use of mercury in hat-making has been discontinued.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   From Step 1, \"X Y\" is likely \"Hat trick\", representing the three awards won by Nikita Kucherov.\n*   From Step 2, we have a connection to hat-making and mercury salts.\n*   The solution is a pun on the term \"Hat trick\".\n    *   The first \"Hat trick\" is the one pictured: the sporting achievement.\n    *   The \"another X Y\" from the second clue refers to another kind of \"hat trick\" â€“ a \"trick\" of the trade for making \"hats\". This hat-making \"trick\" involving mercury salts has \"almost ceased to be used\".\n*   This interpretation elegantly links the man's accomplishment in the picture with the seemingly unrelated clue about mercury toxicity through a play on words.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date in the clue (June 20) is the day after the event (June 19), which is a common way to refer to events that happen in the evening.\n*   \"X Y is pictured\" does not necessarily mean the name of the person is X Y, but rather that the concept or event of X Y is depicted in the image.\n*   The phrase \"Another X Y\" is key, indicating that there are at least two meanings or types of \"X Y\", one of which is shown and the other described.\n*   The toxicity is specifically attributed to \"mercury salts\", not just mercury metal, which strongly points towards the hat-making process (using mercuric nitrate) rather than other mercury uses like in thermometers (elemental mercury).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of both clues, \"X Y\" is identified as \"Hat trick\".\n\n<<<Hat trick>>>"
