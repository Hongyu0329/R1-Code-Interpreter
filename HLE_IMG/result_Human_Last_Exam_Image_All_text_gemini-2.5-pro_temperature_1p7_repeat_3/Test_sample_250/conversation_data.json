    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Music Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or F minor.\n*   **Tonality:** The piece begins with an F minor chord (F-) and ends on an F chord. This strongly suggests the overall key is F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is common time (C), which is 4/4.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the \"A\" Section (First two and last two staves)**\n*   **Melody:** The melody in the first measure begins on the note C, leaps up to F, then moves stepwise to G and A♭. In the key of F minor, these are the scale degrees 5, 1, 2, and ♭3. This melodic shape is the highly recognizable and iconic opening phrase of the jazz standard \"My Funny Valentine\".\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression in the first four bars is `F- | E-7♭5 | E♭6 | D♭maj7 G7`. This is a classic \"minor line cliché\" progression, featuring a descending bass line (F, E, E♭, D♭). This specific progression is a very common way to harmonize the opening of \"My Funny Valentine\".\n*   **Conclusion for A Section:** Both the melody and the harmony of the A sections point unambiguously to the song being \"My Funny Valentine\". The final A section's use of an F major chord instead of F minor is a common arrangement device (a \"Picardy third\") used for this song, further confirming the identification.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the \"B\" Section or Bridge (Third and fourth staves)**\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression of the bridge is `D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |`.\n*   **Identification:** This progression is a famous sequence in jazz. It is the chord progression for the bridge of the jazz standard \"How High the Moon\" (composed by Morgan Lewis) and its famous bebop contrafact, \"Ornithology\" (by Charlie Parker).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis and Conclusion**\n*   The sheet music presents the A section (main theme) of \"My Funny Valentine\" and replaces its original bridge with the bridge from \"How High the Moon\"/\"Ornithology\".\n*   In jazz performance practice, it is common for musicians to substitute the chord changes of one song into another. This is especially true for bridge sections. The fundamental identity of the tune, however, remains that of the original song, as defined by its primary melody or \"head\".\n*   Therefore, despite the substituted bridge, the piece is identified as \"My Funny Valentine\".\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Composer**\n*   The music for the jazz standard \"My Funny Valentine\" was composed by **Richard Rodgers**. The lyrics were written by Lorenz Hart. When asked for the \"composer,\" it typically refers to the writer of the music.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe analysis concludes that the sheet music represents the jazz standard \"My Funny Valentine,\" with a common chord substitution used in the bridge.\n\n<<<Title: My Funny Valentine, Composer: Richard Rodgers>>>"
