    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Kakuro Rules**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black triangles are clues. A clue on the left of a row indicates the sum of the digits in that horizontal run of white squares. A clue above a column indicates the sum of the digits in that vertical run of white squares. A key rule in Kakuro is that within any given run (the set of cells corresponding to a single clue), all digits must be unique.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Top Row**\nThe question asks for the two numbers in the top-most white squares. Let's call the number in the left square 'A' and the number in the right square 'B'.\nThere is a clue `17` in the black space above this row. This clue is for the row containing A and B.\nTherefore, the sum of these two numbers must be 17.\n`A + B = 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Possible Digits**\nAccording to Kakuro rules, A and B must be distinct digits from 1 to 9. We need to find a pair of unique digits that add up to 17.\nLet's list the possibilities:\n*   If we use 9 (the largest possible digit), the other digit must be `17 - 9 = 8`. The digits are 9 and 8. These are both valid digits (between 1 and 9) and are distinct. This is a valid pair.\n*   If we use 8, the other digit is `17 - 8 = 9`. This is the same pair.\n*   If we use 7, the other digit is `17 - 7 = 10`. This is not a valid single digit.\n*   No smaller digits will work, as the other number would be even larger.\nTherefore, the only possible combination of numbers for the two top squares is 8 and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Rest of the Puzzle (Careful Points)**\nTo determine which square is 8 and which is 9, we would normally use the clues for the columns they are in.\n*   Let's analyze the column containing square A. The clue for this column is `17`. So, A and the three cells below it must sum to 17.\n*   Let's analyze the column containing square B. The clue for this column is `29`. So, B and the two cells below it must sum to 29.\n\nHere we encounter a problem. A three-cell run cannot sum to 29. The maximum possible sum for three distinct digits from 1-9 is `9 + 8 + 7 = 24`. This means the clue `29` is impossible under standard Kakuro rules.\n\nFurther inspection of the puzzle reveals several other \"impossible\" clues. For example, the leftmost column has a clue `27` for two cells. The maximum sum for two cells is `9 + 8 = 17`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Answer**\nThe puzzle as presented has clues that are inconsistent with standard Kakuro rules, making a full solution impossible. However, the question asks for the two numbers in the top squares \"when this kakuro puzzle is solved\". This implies we should follow the logic as far as possible.\n\nThe clue `17` for the top two squares is perfectly valid and leads to a unique pair of numbers: 8 and 9. This deduction is self-contained and does not rely on the contradictory parts of the puzzle. The question asks for what the two numbers are, not for their specific positions (i.e., we don't need to know if it's A=8, B=9 or A=9, B=8). We only need to identify the two numbers that must be present.\n\nBased on the unambiguous clue for the top row, the two numbers must be 8 and 9.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9"
