    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type:**\nThe reaction starts with a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It is treated with catalytic acid (HCl) at a high temperature (110 Â°C). The products are an alkene (with the chemical formula C30H50) and water. This indicates an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which typically proceeds through a carbocation intermediate. The question explicitly mentions that the process involves a number of [1,2] shifts, which points to a Wagner-Meerwein type rearrangement. The driving force for this extensive rearrangement is the formation of a thermodynamically very stable tetrasubstituted alkene within the ring system.\n\n**2. Propose the Initial Step:**\nThe reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid catalyst. This turns the -OH into a very good leaving group, -OH2+.\n\n**3. Formation of the Carbocation and Subsequent Rearrangement:**\n*   Loss of water (H2O) from the protonated alcohol generates a secondary carbocation on the carbon that was bonded to the hydroxyl group (C-3 in standard numbering).\n*   Secondary carbocations are unstable and will rearrange if a more stable carbocation can be formed nearby. The statement \"a number of [1,2] shifts\" suggests a cascade of rearrangements, known as a \"backbone rearrangement,\" is about to occur. This cascade moves the positive charge across the molecule to a position where a very stable alkene can be formed upon elimination.\n*   The final product has a double bond between C-12 and C-13. This is a very stable tetrasubstituted double bond. To form this double bond, the rearrangement cascade must terminate with a carbocation at C-13, followed by the elimination of a proton from C-12.\n\n**4. Trace the Shifting Groups (Wagner-Meerwein Cascade):**\nLet's trace the movement of the substituent groups. The positive charge (the \"hole\") moves in one direction, while the migrating groups (H or CH3) move in the opposite direction to fill the hole. We need to identify which group is at which position in the final product. The labeled positions are at key stereocenters along the molecular backbone:\n*   Position 1: at C-4\n*   Position 2: at C-10\n*   Position 3: at C-8\n*   Position 4: at C-14\n*   Position 5: at C-9\n\nLet's follow the standard and most accepted mechanism for the backbone rearrangement leading to the olean-12-ene skeleton. We can think of this as a game of \"musical chairs\" where the substituents swap places with the positive charge.\n\n*   **Initial State of Key Positions:**\n    *   Position 1 (C-4): Has two CH3 groups (gem-dimethyl). We assume this position is not involved in the main cascade, as it's at the periphery. So, it remains **CH3**.\n    *   Position 2 (C-10): Has a **CH3** group.\n    *   Position 3 (C-8): Has a **CH3** group.\n    *   Position 4 (C-14): Has a **CH3** group.\n    *   Position 5 (C-9): Has an **H** atom.\n\n*   **The Cascade of Shifts:** The rearrangement proceeds as a wave of 1,2-shifts.\n    1.  The positive charge, having propagated from C-3, arrives at C-10 (Position 2). This means the original CH3 group at C-10 has migrated away (to C-5).\n    2.  The **H atom** from C-9 (Position 5) performs a [1,2]-shift to the cationic C-10 (Position 2).\n        *   **Result:** Position 2 (C-10) is now occupied by an **H** atom. The positive charge has moved to C-9 (Position 5).\n    3.  The **CH3 group** from C-8 (Position 3) shifts to the now cationic C-9 (Position 5).\n        *   **Result:** Position 5 (C-9) is now occupied by a **CH3** group. The positive charge has moved to C-8 (Position 3).\n    4.  The **CH3 group** from C-14 (Position 4) shifts to the now cationic C-8 (Position 3).\n        *   **Result:** Position 3 (C-8) is now occupied by a **CH3** group. The positive charge has moved to C-14 (Position 4).\n\n*   **Finalization of the Rearrangement:**\n    *   The cascade has ended with the positive charge at C-14 (Position 4). To form the final C12=C13 double bond, the charge must move to C-13. This part of the mechanism is complex, but it is proposed to involve further shifts. A plausible (though not simple) route involves a transannular [1,3]-hydride shift from C-12 to C-14.\n    *   This would place an **H atom** at C-14 (Position 4), leaving a cation at C-12. A subsequent alkyl shift would move the cation to C-13, followed by deprotonation from C-12 to yield the final product. Regardless of the complexity, the key is that C-14 gives up its original methyl group and ultimately gains a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Result:** Position 4 (C-14) is now occupied by an **H** atom.\n\n**5. Final Assignments:**\nBased on tracing the migrating groups through the established backbone rearrangement mechanism:\n*   **Position 1 (C-4):** Not involved in the main cascade. Remains **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (C-10):** Originally had a CH3, which migrates away. It receives an H atom from C-9. Final substituent: **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (C-8):** Originally had a CH3, which migrates to C-9. It receives a CH3 group from C-14. Final substituent: **CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (C-14):** Originally had a CH3, which migrates to C-8. It ultimately receives an H atom during the termination steps. Final substituent: **H**.\n*   **Position 5 (C-9):** Originally had an H, which migrates to C-10. It receives a CH3 group from C-8. Final substituent: **CH3**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = H\n5 = CH3\n\nFinal answer formatted as requested.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
