    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the geometric setup and extract key information.**\nThe image displays a circular sector with center `O` (the bottom vertex). Within this sector, there are two shaded regions, one blue and one red. The geometry is defined by several radial lines from `O` and tangent constructions. Let's analyze the construction for the blue region on the left.\n\nWe see a right-angled triangle formed by the center `O`, a point `Q` on the outermost blue line, and a point `P` on the adjacent blue line. The right angle is at `P`. This indicates that the line segment `PQ` is tangent to the circle at point `P`.\nFrom the image, we are given:\n- The length of the hypotenuse `OQ = 34`.\n- The length of the tangent segment `PQ = 17`.\n- The angle at the center `O` for this right triangle, `∠POQ`, is denoted by `θ`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the angle `θ` and the radius `r` of the circular sector.**\nIn the right-angled triangle `OPQ`:\n- The sides are `OP` (radius `r`), `PQ = 17`, and `OQ = 34`.\n- We can find the angle `θ` using trigonometry:\n  `sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = PQ / OQ = 17 / 34 = 1/2`.\n  This gives `θ = 30°`.\n- We can find the radius `r` using the Pythagorean theorem: `OP² + PQ² = OQ²`.\n  `r² + 17² = 34²`\n  `r² + 289 = 1156`\n  `r² = 1156 - 289 = 867`\n  So, the radius is `r = √867 = √(289 * 3) = 17√3`.\n\nThe entire figure is constructed with four such angles `θ`, so the total central angle of the large sector is `4θ = 4 * 30° = 120°`.\n\n**Step 3: Define and calculate the area of the blue shaded region.**\nThe blue shaded region is a \"curvy triangle\". It can be seen as the area of a larger triangle minus the area of a circular sector.\nLet the radial lines be labeled `l_1, l_2, l_3` from left to right for the blue region.\n- The outer vertex `Q` lies on line `l_1`.\n- The tangency point `P` lies on line `l_2`.\n- The rightmost vertex of the blue region's top edge, let's call it `S`, lies on line `l_3`.\nThe top boundary of the blue region is the line segment `QS`. This segment is part of the line tangent to the circle at point `P`.\nThe blue shaded area is therefore `Area(Triangle OQS) - Area(Sector defined by arc from l_1 to l_3)`.\n\nTo calculate `Area(Triangle OQS)`, we need the lengths of its sides or a base and height. By symmetry of the construction, the triangle `OST` (for the red region) will be a mirror image of `OQS`, and the length `OS` will be equal to `OQ`. So `OS = 34`.\nThe angle `∠QOS` is the angle between lines `l_1` and `l_3`, which is `θ + θ = 2θ = 60°`.\nArea of `Triangle OQS` = `(1/2) * OQ * OS * sin(∠QOS)`\n`Area(Triangle OQS) = (1/2) * 34 * 34 * sin(60°) = (1/2) * 1156 * (√3 / 2) = 289√3`.\n\nThe area of the sector below `Triangle OQS` has a central angle of `2θ = 60°` and a radius `r = 17√3`.\n`Area(Sector blue) = (Angle / 360°) * π * r²`\n`Area(Sector blue) = (60 / 360) * π * (17√3)² = (1/6) * π * 867 = 289π / 2`.\n\nSo, the area of the blue shaded region is:\n`Area(Blue) = Area(Triangle OQS) - Area(Sector blue) = 289√3 - 289π / 2`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the red shaded region.**\nThe red region is constructed symmetrically to the blue region. Let its vertices be `S` and `T`. It is formed by subtracting the area of a sector (between lines `l_3` and `l_5`) from the area of `Triangle OST`.\n`Area(Red) = Area(Triangle OST) - Area(Sector red)`.\nDue to symmetry, `Area(Red) = Area(Blue) = 289√3 - 289π / 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total area of the shaded regions.**\nThe question asks for the total area of the shaded regions. This is the area of the union of the blue and red regions, `Area(Blue U Red)`. The note indicates there is an overlapping area. However, the geometric construction based on the diagram shows that the blue region is defined between lines `l_1` and `l_3`, and the red region between `l_3` and `l_5`. They are adjacent and meet at the boundary along `l_3`, so their intersection has zero area. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the individual areas.\n\n`Total Area = Area(Blue) + Area(Red)`\n`Total Area = (289√3 - 289π / 2) + (289√3 - 289π / 2)`\n`Total Area = 2 * (289√3) - 2 * (289π / 2)`\n`Total Area = 578√3 - 289π`\n\nThis can also be calculated by taking the area of the large quadrilateral `OQST` and subtracting the area of the large sector between `l_1` and `l_5`.\n`Area(Quadrilateral OQST) = Area(ΔOQS) + Area(ΔOST) = 289√3 + 289√3 = 578√3`.\n`Area(Total Sector) =` Area of sector with angle `4θ = 120°`.\n`Area(Total Sector) = (120/360) * π * r² = (1/3) * π * (17√3)² = (1/3) * π * 867 = 289π`.\n`Total Shaded Area = Area(Quadrilateral OQST) - Area(Total Sector) = 578√3 - 289π`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<578*sqrt(3) - 289*pi>>>"
