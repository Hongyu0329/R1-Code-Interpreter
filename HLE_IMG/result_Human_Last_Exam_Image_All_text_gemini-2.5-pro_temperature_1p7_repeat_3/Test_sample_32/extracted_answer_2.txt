The main difference is in the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent among the leaves and held erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked), causing the capsule to be exserted well above the leaves and to be nodding or pendulous.
