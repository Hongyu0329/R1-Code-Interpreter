    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte stage between two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the foot (embedded in the parent plant), the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains the spores).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Species Names for Clues**\nThe scientific names of plants often describe a key feature.\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: \"Montana\" refers to mountains, indicating its habitat. It doesn't give a morphological clue about the sporophyte.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: This name is highly descriptive. \"Curvi-\" is Latin for \"curved,\" and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. The name itself suggests that this species has a **curved seta**.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***\n*   **Seta:** In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is typically \"immersed\" or \"emergent.\" This means it sits low down amongst the leaves of the gametophyte, often barely rising above them.\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** The capsule is held erect (upright).\n*   **Visual Appearance:** This gives the impression of small, cup-like capsules nestled directly on the cushion of moss, as seen in the provided image.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   **Seta:** As its name implies, the key feature of *Grimmia curviseta* is its seta, which is long and strongly curved, often described as cygneous (swan-necked).\n*   **Capsule Position:** The long seta makes the capsule \"exserted,\" meaning it is held well above the leafy part of the moss.\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** Due to the strong curve in the seta, the capsule is not erect. It is typically nodding, cernuous, or even pendulous (hanging downwards).\n*   **Visual Appearance:** This results in a very different look, with capsules clearly elevated on curved stalks above the main moss plant, often pointing downwards or sideways.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Main Difference**\nBased on the analysis, the main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing these two species at a glance is the **seta's length and curvature**, which in turn dictates the position and orientation of the capsule.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Focus on the Sporophyte:** The difference lies in the stalk (seta) and capsule structure, not the leafy green part (gametophyte).\n2.  **\"At a Glance\" Feature:** The seta's morphology is a macroscopic feature, easily visible to the naked eye without the need for a microscope.\n3.  **Cause and Effect:** The short, straight seta of *G. montana* *causes* the capsule to be immersed and erect. The long, curved seta of *G. curviseta* *causes* the capsule to be exserted and nodding. The seta itself is the fundamental differing structure.\n4.  **Image Corroboration:** The provided image shows numerous capsules that are immersed within the leaves on very short, invisible stalks. This is consistent with the sporophyte structure of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its long, strongly curved (cygneous) seta, which holds the capsule well above the leaves (exserted) in a nodding or hanging position.\n\n<<<The main difference is in the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent among the leaves and held erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked), causing the capsule to be exserted well above the leaves and to be nodding or pendulous."
