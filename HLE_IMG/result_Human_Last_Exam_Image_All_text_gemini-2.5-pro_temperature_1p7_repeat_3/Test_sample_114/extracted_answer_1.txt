The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the **conformational rigidity** of the munchone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. The proline's cyclic structure results in a fused, bicyclic munchone where the two ends of the 1,3-dipole are locked in a fixed, asymmetric geometry. This prevents any equilibration or scrambling of the dipole's termini. Consequently, the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate proceeds via a highly favored transition state, yielding a single product.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the crucial context for this conclusion. The 13C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 shows that for the conformationally flexible, acyclic munchone derived from N-acetyl-N-methylalanine, the substituents at the two ends of the dipole are completely scrambled. This demonstrates that in the absence of conformational constraints, a pathway exists that renders the two ends of the dipole effectively equivalent before the cycloaddition occurs. Therefore, the rigidity imposed by the proline ring in Reaction 3 is the key factor that shuts down this scrambling pathway, thus enforcing the high regioselectivity.
