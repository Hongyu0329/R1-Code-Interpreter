    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of propanoyl chloride, making the carbonyl carbon a potent electrophile (an acylium ion, CH₃CH₂CO⁺). The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile. This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:**\n    ```\n      O\n     //\n    C - CH₂CH₃\n   /\n  (Benzene Ring)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (FeBr₃ acts as a Lewis acid to generate the Br⁺ electrophile).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors for further electrophilic substitution.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The bromine atom will be added to the *meta* position (position 3) relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:**\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C - CH₂CH₃\n     /\n    (Benzene Ring with Br at meta position)\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas with a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Transformations:** This set of reagents will cause two key reductions:\n    1.  **Reduction of the Ketone:** A ketone adjacent to a benzene ring (a benzylic ketone) is completely reduced to a CH₂ group (a methylene group) under these conditions. This is a form of hydrogenolysis. The C=O becomes CH₂.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Aryl Halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Both the bromo group and the ketone's oxygen atom are removed and replaced with hydrogens. The resulting molecule is propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:**\n    ```\n    CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n   /\n  (Benzene Ring)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Mechanism:** NBS is a source of bromine for radical reactions. Benzoyl peroxide is a radical initiator. This reaction selectively brominates the position that forms the most stable radical intermediate.\n*   **Selectivity:** In propylbenzene, the possible radicals are primary, secondary, and benzylic. The benzylic radical (where the unpaired electron is on the carbon directly attached to the benzene ring) is the most stable because it is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. Therefore, bromination will occur exclusively at the benzylic position (the C1 of the propyl chain).\n*   **Final Product:** One hydrogen on the benzylic carbon is replaced by a bromine atom. The final product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:**\n    ```\n      Br\n      |\n    CH - CH₂-CH₃\n   /\n  (Benzene Ring)\n    ```\n\n**Summary of the Final Product Identification:**\nThe sequence involves Friedel-Crafts acylation, meta-directed electrophilic bromination, complete reduction of both the ketone and the aryl bromide, and finally, a selective benzylic radical bromination. The final product formed is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
