1. **[4π+2π] cycloaddition**: One molecule acts as a 4π component (diene) and the other as a 2π component (dienophile). This is a thermally allowed Diels-Alder type reaction.
2. **[6π+4π] cycloaddition**: One molecule acts as a 6π component and the other as a 4π component. This is a thermally allowed higher-order cycloaddition and is the accepted pathway to the specific dimer shown.
3. **[8π+2π] cycloaddition**: One molecule acts as an 8π component and the other as a 2π component. This is also a thermally allowed higher-order cycloaddition.
4. **[4π+4π] cycloaddition**: Both molecules react as 4π components. While thermally forbidden in a suprafacial-suprafacial mode, this pathway is possible via an antarafacial component or a stepwise mechanism and is known to occur in related systems.
