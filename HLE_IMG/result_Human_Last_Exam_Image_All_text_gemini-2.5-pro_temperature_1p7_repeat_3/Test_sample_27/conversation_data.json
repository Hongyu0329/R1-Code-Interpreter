    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Locate and Examine the Signature**\nThe first step is to carefully examine the painting for a signature. In the bottom right corner of the artwork, there is a handwritten signature and a date.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the Signature**\nUsing the original image and the close-up crops provided, we can decipher the text. The signature is somewhat stylized, but the most legible parts are the surname \"Picabia\" and the date \"'39\", which indicates the year 1939.

The artist is widely known as Francis Picabia.

The inscription \"manequita\" is sometimes noted in catalogue entries for this work, but the artist who created and signed it is unquestionably Picabia.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\nBased on the signature \"Picabia\" on the painting and historical art records, the artist is identified. The question asks for the full name.\n\nThe full name of the artist is Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia.\n\n<<<Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia>>>"
