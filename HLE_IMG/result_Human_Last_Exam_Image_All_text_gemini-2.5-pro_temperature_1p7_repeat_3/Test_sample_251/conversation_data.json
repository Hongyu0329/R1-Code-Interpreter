    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand ECG Parameters:** The ECG strip has standard parameters printed at the top left: \"25 mm/sec; 1 cm/mV\". The crucial parameter for time measurement is the paper speed, which is 25 mm per second.\n2.  **Understand the ECG Grid:** The ECG paper is a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm in width.\n    *   Each large square consists of 5 small squares, so it is 5 mm in width.\n3.  **Calculate Time per Square:** Using the paper speed of 25 mm/sec, we can calculate the time duration represented by each square.\n    *   Time for 1 small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for 1 large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.20 seconds.\n4.  **Identify R-R Intervals:** The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R waves (the tall, sharp upward spikes in the QRS complex). The question asks for the *longest* R-R interval.\n5.  **Scan the Rhythm Strip:** We need to visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R waves.\n    *   The ECG shows several lines of rhythm. The rhythm is mostly regular, but there is a noticeable long pause on the fourth line of the tracing, occurring just after the time stamp `0:06:08`.\n    *   This pause is visually much longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n6.  **Measure the Longest R-R Interval:** We will measure the duration of this long pause using the grid.\n    *   Locate the peak of the R-wave just before the pause. It aligns perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Locate the peak of the R-wave at the end of the pause. It also aligns perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Count the number of large squares between these two R-wave peaks. There are exactly 6 large squares between them.\n7.  **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:**\n    *   We have determined that the longest interval spans 6 large squares.\n    *   Since each large square represents 0.20 seconds, the total duration is:\n        *   6 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square = 1.2 seconds.\n    *   Alternatively, using small squares:\n        *   6 large squares = 6 × 5 = 30 small squares.\n        *   30 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.2 seconds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe longest R-R interval is the significant pause identified on the rhythm strip. Its duration, measured by counting the grid squares, is 1.2 seconds.\n\n<<<1.2>>>"
