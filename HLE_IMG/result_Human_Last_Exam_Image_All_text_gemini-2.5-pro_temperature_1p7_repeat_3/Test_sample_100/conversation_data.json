    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material**\n\n*   The starting material is a complex organic molecule. Let's determine its molecular formula by breaking it down into its components.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This is a bicyclic system containing one nitrogen atom (N), one carbonyl group (C=O), and one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   There are two substituents:\n    1.  A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to the double bond.\n    2.  A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) attached to the nitrogen atom. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n*   Let's count the atoms for the entire starting material:\n    *   The basic 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one core has the formula C6H5NO. Let's verify: 6 carbons in the ring system, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. Hydrogens: 2 at bridgeheads, 2 on the double bond, 1 on the -CH2- bridge, and 1 on the nitrogen (if unprotected). The provided structure has specific substitutions.\n    *   Let's count directly from the depicted structure of the starting material's core (excluding PMB and replacing it with an H on the nitrogen for counting purposes):\n        *   The part with the C=C and CF3 is -C(CF3)=CH-.\n        *   The bridgeheads are -CH- and -CH-.\n        *   The other bridge is -CH2-.\n        *   The amide part is -NH-C(=O)-.\n        *   Let's reassemble: We have a C7 ring system (if we count the CF3's carbon) plus the N and O. Let's count from the skeleton: C1(H), C4(H) are bridgeheads. C7(H2) is the one-carbon bridge. C5(H)=C6(C-CF3) is the two-carbon bridge. N2(PMB)-C3(O) is the third bridge.\n        *   Carbons in the core: 6 carbons in the bicyclo[2.2.1] skeleton + 1 carbon in the CF3 group = 7 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens in the core (if N was NH): 1(at C1)+1(at C4)+1(at C5)+2(at C7) + 1 (on N) = 6 hydrogens. So the deprotected core is C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Now, let's count the atoms in the PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3):\n        *   Carbons: 1 (in CH2) + 6 (in benzene ring) + 1 (in OCH3) = 8 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 2 (in CH2) + 4 (in benzene ring) + 3 (in OCH3) = 9 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen: 1 (in OCH3).\n        *   PMB formula: C8H9O.\n    *   Total formula of starting material = (C7H5F3NO) [core without N-H] + (C8H9O) [PMB group].\n        *   C: 7 + 8 = 15\n        *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (ether) = 2\n    *   Starting Material Formula: C15H14F3NO2.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 (Formation of Intermediate 1)**\n\n*   Reagents: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   Function: CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of a PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom.\n*   Transformation: The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed from the nitrogen, and it is replaced by a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   Change in formula: Remove C8H9O and add H. The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 1 = Formula of Starting Material - C8H8O.\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO. This corresponds to the unprotected lactam.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 (Formation of Intermediate 2)**\n\n*   Reagents: Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   Function: These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n*   Transformation: The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring of Intermediate 1 is reduced to a C-C single bond. This involves the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n*   Change in formula: Addition of 2 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 2 = Formula of Intermediate 1 + H2.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n*   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO. This is a saturated bicyclic lactam.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 (Formation of the Final Product)**\n\n*   Reagents: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   Function: Hot aqueous acid causes the hydrolysis of amides (and lactams, which are cyclic amides).\n*   Transformation: The amide bond (C-N bond) in the lactam ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the ring. The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) in the acidic solution. The question asks for the molecular formula of the product, which by convention refers to the neutral molecule.\n*   Change in formula: Addition of one water molecule (H2O).\n*   Formula of Final Product = Formula of Intermediate 2 + H2O.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   Formula of the Final Product: C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe final product is a substituted amino-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, specifically 3-(trifluoromethyl)-4-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, whose molecular formula confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
