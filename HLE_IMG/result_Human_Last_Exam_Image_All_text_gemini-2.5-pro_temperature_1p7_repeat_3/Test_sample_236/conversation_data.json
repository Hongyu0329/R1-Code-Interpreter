    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows an insect with distinct coloration perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The main subject is in focus in the center, while the background is blurred. The crops provide closer views of the insect's head, thorax, and antennae.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant:** The yellow flower cluster is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in North America that blooms in late summer and fall. The presence of this specific plant can be a clue to the insect's identity, as many insects are host-specific.\n\n3.  **Examine the insect's morphology:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but typical for this body shape) and wings that are hardened at the base and membranous at the tips (hemelytra), which are characteristic features of the order Hemiptera (true bugs).\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect is vividly colored. The head is black. The pronotum (the section just behind the head) is bright reddish-orange. The main part of the body/wings appears to be a similar reddish-orange, with some black markings towards the rear.\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n    *   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n    *   **Eyes:** The compound eyes are large and appear reddish.\n    *   **Body Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated and oval.\n\n4.  **Compare with known species:** Based on the features (true bug, black and reddish-orange color, found on goldenrod), we can narrow down the possibilities.\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Similar colors, but the pattern is different. Boxelder bugs have red lines on the pronotum and wing veins, which is not the pattern seen here.\n    *   **Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus* or *Lygaeus* spp.):** These bugs also have orange/red and black patterns, but they are typically bolder, often with an \"X\" shape on the back, which is absent in the image.\n    *   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*):** This beetle is commonly found on goldenrod and has similar orange and black coloration. However, it is a beetle (Coleoptera), not a bug. Beetles have hardened forewings (elytra) that meet in a straight line down the back and typically have different antennae. The insect in the image is clearly a true bug (Hemiptera).\n    *   **Goldenrod Plant Bug (*Lopidea media*):** This species is a plant bug (Family: Miridae) known to feed on goldenrod. Its appearance perfectly matches the insect in the picture: black head, reddish-orange pronotum, reddish-orange hemelytra (forewings), and black legs and antennae.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the distinct black-and-orange pattern, the physical characteristics of a true bug, and its presence on a goldenrod flower strongly indicates that the insect is a Goldenrod Plant Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Lopidea media*.\n\n<<<Lopidea media>>>"
