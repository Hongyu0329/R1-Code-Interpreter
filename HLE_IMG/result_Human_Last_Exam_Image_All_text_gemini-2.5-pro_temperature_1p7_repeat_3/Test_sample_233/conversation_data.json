    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question and Image:** The user wants to know the ID of the Ingvar runestone shown in the image fragment. \"Ingvar runestone\" is a key piece of information, as it refers to a specific group of about 30 Viking Age runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The image shows a close-up of a runic inscription on a stone surface.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Visual Features:**\n    *   **Style:** The most striking feature is the inscription's layout. The runes are carved within straight, horizontal bands defined by incised lines, creating a grid-like or \"framework\" appearance. This is a relatively unusual style for runestones, which more commonly feature inscriptions following the serpentine body of a dragon or lindworm, or the edge of the stone.\n    *   **Runes:** The runes are from the Younger Futhark alphabet, typical of the Viking Age.\n    *   **Separators:** The carver used an 'x' symbol as a word separator, which is a common practice seen on many runestones.\n\n3.  **Transliterate a Portion of the Inscription:** To identify the specific stone, we need to read some of the runes. We will transliterate them into Latin letters, going row by row from top to bottom, reading left to right.\n    *   **Top Row:** The visible runes appear to be `...ᚦᚢᚱᚦᚱ : ᚼᛁᚢ...`. This transliterates to `...þurþr : hiu...`. (`þ` = th, `u`, `r`, `þ`, `r`, `:` = word separator, `h`, `i`, `u`). The end of the word is cut off.\n    *   **Second Row:** This row starts with a separator. The sequence is `x ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ x ᚦ...`. This transliterates to `: stain : þ...` (`:` = separator, `s`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `:` = separator, `þ` = th). The word `stain` means \"stone\".\n    *   **Third Row:** This row also starts with a separator. The sequence is `x ᛅᛏ x ᚼᚢᛚᛘ...`. This transliterates to `: at : hulm...` (`:` = separator, `a`, `t`, `:` = separator, `h`, `u`, `l`, `m`). The word `at` means \"in memory of\".\n\n4.  **Combine the Clues and Search:**\n    *   We are looking for an **Ingvar runestone**.\n    *   It has a unique **framework/banded style**.\n    *   The inscription begins (or includes the fragments): `...þurþr : hiu[k] : stain...` and `: at : hulm...`.\n\n5.  **Identify the Runestone:**\n    *   Searching for Ingvar runestones with a framework or banded style leads to one prominent example: **Sö 9**, the Lifsinge stone in Södermanland, Sweden.\n    *   Let's check the inscription of Sö 9 against our transliteration. The full inscription of Sö 9 begins:\n        `... : þurþr : hiuk : stain : þinsi : at : hulmstain : faþur sin ...`\n        (Old Norse: *Þorðr hiogg stæin þennsi at Holmstæin, faður sinn...*)\n        (English: Þorðr cut this stone in memory of Holmsteinn, his father...)\n    *   This is a perfect match for the fragments we transliterated from the image. The words `þurþr`, `hiuk` (cut/carved), `stain` (stone), `at` (in memory of), and `hulmstain` (the name Holmsteinn) are all present in the correct order.\n    *   Finally, the inscription on Sö 9 confirms it is an Ingvar runestone with the phrase: `...han : toþr : miþ : ikuari :` (*...Hann [varð] dauðr með Ingvari.* / He died with Ingvarr).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe visual style (horizontal bands) and the transliterated text fragments (`...þurþr : hiuk : stain...`, `: at : hulm...`) uniquely identify the stone as Sö 9. Sö 9 is a well-known Ingvar runestone.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
