The final product is Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline. Its structure is a planar pentacyclic aromatic system formed by the fusion of an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine moiety with an isoquinoline moiety. The structure is built up from the three starting materials in a domino reaction sequence.
Here is the image of the structure:

The above is not an actual rendering. This is the closest representation that I can point to which matches my reasoning. The specific name is Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline.
Here is a possible correct drawing of the structure:
```
[C]1=C(C2=C(C=CC=C1)N=C[C@@H]3N2C4=C(C=CC=C4)N=C3)
```
As I cannot generate an image, I will provide a final description.
The final compound A is the polycyclic aromatic compound **Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline**.
