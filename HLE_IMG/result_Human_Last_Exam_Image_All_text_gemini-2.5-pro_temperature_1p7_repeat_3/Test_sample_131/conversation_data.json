    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure.**\n    The molecule is a complex, polycyclic organic compound. The presence of nitrogen atoms within the ring systems, and its likely origin from a plant, identifies it as an alkaloid. It contains four fused six-membered rings, making it a tetracyclic system.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify key functional groups.**\n    We can identify the following functional groups:\n    1.  **Tertiary amines:** There are two nitrogen atoms, both of which are tertiary amines (connected to three carbon atoms).\n    2.  **Amide (specifically, a lactam):** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring. This specific six-membered ring lactam is a piperid-2-one moiety.\n    3.  **Multiple stereocenters:** The use of wedge and dash bonds indicates that the molecule is a specific stereoisomer. There are four such chiral centers explicitly shown.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the core skeleton and compare with known alkaloids.**\n    The tetracyclic framework with four fused six-membered rings and two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids, often found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n    *   The parent, non-oxidized structure is called **sparteine**.\n    *   The structure shown is an oxidized derivative of sparteine, containing a carbonyl group. This specific compound, with the carbonyl group at the C-2 position of the quinolizidine system, is known as **lupanine**. It is also referred to as 2-oxosparteine.\n    *   Comparing the given drawing with the known chemical structure of lupanine confirms the identity. The arrangement of the four rings and the position of the lactam group are an exact match. The specific stereochemistry shown corresponds to the naturally occurring (-)-lupanine isomer.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the name.**\n    Based on the structural analysis and comparison with known alkaloids, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
