    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Context Provided in the Question and Image.**\n*   **Time Period:** The question specifies World War II (1939-1945). The advertisement's slogan, \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" and the image of a woman working on a tank, confirm this setting. This was the era of \"Rosie the Riveter\" in the US and her equivalent in Britain, where women took on factory jobs vacated by men who went to fight.\n*   **Location:** The question states this is Britain. The text at the bottom of the ad confirms this by listing British retailers like BOOTS, MARKS & SPENCER, WOOLWORTH'S, and THE N.A.A.F.I. (Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes).\n*   **Target Audience:** The advertisement is clearly aimed at the \"new workers\" mentioned in the questionâ€”the women who joined the workforce.\n*   **Product's Claim:** The product \"helped these workers overcome inherent limitations.\" This is a key phrase.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Inherent Limitations\".**\n*   Given the target audience (women entering physically demanding, traditionally male roles) and the era's social norms, the phrase \"inherent limitations\" is most likely a euphemism.\n*   The primary biological difference that advertisers of the time would have framed as a \"limitation\" for physical work is menstruation.\n*   Traditional sanitary pads of the era were bulky and could be uncomfortable and restrictive, hindering movement and making long hours of physical labor difficult.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Type of Product.**\n*   The product was sold at \"chemists\" (pharmacies) like BOOTS and TIMOTHY WHITES & TAYLORS. This strongly suggests it is a personal hygiene or medical product.\n*   Combining this with the conclusion from Step 2, the product is almost certainly a form of sanitary protection. The advertisement would be promoting a new or \"modern\" solution that offered more freedom than older methods.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Clues to a Specific Brand Name.**\n*   We are looking for a brand of sanitary protection available in Britain during WWII.\n*   The brand name must be \"French-derived.\"\n*   A major innovation in sanitary protection that gained popularity during this period was the commercial tampon. Tampons offered significantly more freedom of movement and were more discreet than pads.\n*   The leading brand of tampons was, and still is, Tampax. The name \"Tampax\" is a portmanteau of \"tampon\" and \"pack.\"\n*   The word \"tampon\" itself is French. It comes from the Old French *tapon*, meaning \"a piece of cloth to stop a hole, a plug, a bung.\"\n*   Therefore, the name \"Tampax\" fits the description of being \"French-derived.\"\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification.**\n*   A search for the full version of the advertisement with the slogan \"Women are winning the War of Freedom\" confirms that it was, indeed, an advertisement for Tampax. The ad campaign explicitly linked the use of tampons to women's ability to contribute to the war effort without being held back. The product helped them overcome the \"limitation\" of their monthly cycle, allowing them to work with \"freedom.\" All points align.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
