    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the molecule of interest**: The user has provided an image showing a chemical reaction. The question asks to find a property \"for the depicted molecule with Crippen logP > 1\". This refers to the product of the reaction. The reactants are shown on the left, and the product is on the right. We must first correctly identify the structure of the product molecule.\n    *   The product consists of two main parts joined by a nitrogen linker (-NH-).\n    *   Part 1 (left): A 5-fluoropyridin-2-yl group. It is a pyridine ring with a fluorine atom at position 5 and the point of attachment at position 2.\n    *   Part 2 (right): A bicyclic system. It is a pyrimidine ring (two nitrogens at positions 1 and 3) fused to a pyrrolidine ring (a saturated 5-membered ring with one nitrogen). This system is a 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine. The attachment is at the C4 position of the pyrimidine ring.\n    *   The complete molecule is N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine. A quick check of its properties confirms that its Crippen logP is greater than 1, satisfying the condition in the question.\n\n2.  **Understand the required calculation**: The question asks for the \"Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices (including hydrogens)\".\n    *   The \"Eccentric Connectivity Index\" (ECI), denoted as `ξ^c`, is a molecular descriptor defined as the sum of products of vertex degree and eccentricity for all vertices in the molecular graph.\n    *   Formula: `ξ^c(G) = Σ [deg(v) * ecc(v)]` for all vertices `v` in the graph `G`.\n    *   `deg(v)`: The degree of a vertex `v` is the number of other vertices it is connected to.\n    *   `ecc(v)`: The eccentricity of a vertex `v` is the length of the longest shortest path from `v` to any other vertex in the graph. `ecc(v) = max(d(v, u))` for all `u`.\n    *   The phrase \"Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices\" is slightly redundant but refers to the calculation of this single `ξ^c` value for the entire molecule.\n    *   \"Including hydrogens\" means we must consider the full molecular graph where hydrogen atoms are represented as explicit vertices.\n\n3.  **Construct the molecular graph**: We need to identify all atoms and their connections. Let's number the heavy atoms first, and then the hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Heavy atoms (17 total)**:\n        *   Pyridine moiety: N1_py, C2_py, C3_py, C4_py, C5_py, C6_py\n        *   Fluorine: F\n        *   Linker Nitrogen: N_link\n        *   Bicyclic moiety: N1_pyrim, C2_pyrim, N3_pyrim, C4_pyrim, C5_pyrim, C6_pyrim, N7_pyrrolo, C8_pyrrolo, C9_pyrrolo\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms (11 total)**:\n        *   On pyridine ring: H on C3_py, H on C4_py, H on C6_py\n        *   On linker nitrogen: H on N_link\n        *   On bicyclic moiety: H on C2_pyrim, H on C6_pyrim, H on N7_pyrrolo, 2 H on C8_pyrrolo, 2 H on C9_pyrrolo\n    *   The total number of vertices in the graph is 17 + 11 = 28.\n\n4.  **Calculate degree (deg(v)) for each atom**: We count the number of bonds for each of the 28 atoms.\n    *   This step requires systematically going through the structure. For example, C4_pyrim is connected to N3_pyrim, C5_pyrim, N7_pyrrolo, and N_link, so its degree is 4. A hydrogen atom is always connected to only one other atom, so its degree is 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate eccentricity (ecc(v)) for each atom**: This is the most complex step. For each of the 28 atoms, we need to find the maximum shortest path to any other atom in the graph. This is typically done by running a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm starting from each atom.\n    *   The eccentricity of a central atom is generally smaller than that of a peripheral atom.\n    *   The maximum eccentricity among all atoms is the diameter of the graph. In this molecule, the diameter is 9. This distance is found between the fluorine atom (F) and several other atoms on the opposite side of the molecule, such as the N1 atom of the pyrimidine ring (N1_pyrim) or the hydrogens attached to the bicyclic system.\n\n6.  **Create a table and compute `deg(v) * ecc(v)`**: We organize the results in a table for all 28 atoms, listing the atom, its degree, its calculated eccentricity, and the product of the two.\n\n| Atom ID (Label)     | Deg | Ecc | deg * ecc |\n|---------------------|-----|-----|-----------|\n| 1 (N_py1)           | 2   | 6   | 12        |\n| 2 (C_py2)           | 3   | 5   | 15        |\n| 3 (C_py3)           | 3   | 6   | 18        |\n| 4 (C_py4)           | 3   | 7   | 21        |\n| 5 (C_py5)           | 3   | 8   | 24        |\n| 6 (C_py6)           | 3   | 7   | 21        |\n| 7 (F)               | 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 8 (N_link)          | 3   | 5   | 15        |\n| 9 (C4_pyrim)        | 4   | 6   | 24        |\n| 10 (N3_pyrim)       | 2   | 7   | 14        |\n| 11 (C2_pyrim)       | 3   | 8   | 24        |\n| 12 (N1_pyrim)       | 2   | 9   | 18        |\n| 13 (C6_pyrim)       | 3   | 8   | 24        |\n| 14 (C5_pyrim)       | 3   | 7   | 21        |\n| 15 (C9_pyrrolo)     | 4   | 8   | 32        |\n| 16 (C8_pyrrolo)     | 4   | 8   | 32        |\n| 17 (N7_pyrrolo)     | 3   | 7   | 21        |\n| 18 (H on C3_py)     | 1   | 7   | 7         |\n| 19 (H on C4_py)     | 1   | 8   | 8         |\n| 20 (H on C6_py)     | 1   | 8   | 8         |\n| 21 (H on N_link)    | 1   | 6   | 6         |\n| 22 (H on C2_pyrim)  | 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 23 (H on C6_pyrim)  | 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 24 (H on N7_pyrrolo)| 1   | 8   | 8         |\n| 25 (H on C8_pyrrolo)| 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 26 (H on C8_pyrrolo)| 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 27 (H on C9_pyrrolo)| 1   | 9   | 9         |\n| 28 (H on C9_pyrrolo)| 1   | 9   | 9         |\n\n7.  **Sum the final column**: The Eccentric Connectivity Index `ξ^c` is the sum of all values in the `deg * ecc` column.\n    *   Sum for heavy atoms (excluding F): 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 + 21 + 15 + 24 + 14 + 24 + 18 + 24 + 21 + 32 + 32 + 21 = 336.\n    *   Sum for degree-1 atoms (F and all H's): 9 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 90.\n    *   Total Sum = 336 + 90 = 426.\n\nFinal Answer is the total sum.\n<<<426>>>"
