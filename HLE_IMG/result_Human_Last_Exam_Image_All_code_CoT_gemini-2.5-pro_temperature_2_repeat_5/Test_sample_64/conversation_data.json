    "Based on the visual evidence in the series of images (L, M, N), the process being depicted is **lateral branching** in a filamentous organism, such as a fungal hypha or an algal filament.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of the process shown:\n\n1.  **Panel L:** This panel shows the initial state of a filament composed of several cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a potential site for a new branch to form.\n2.  **Panel M:** A bulge or small outgrowth begins to form on the side of the filament, near the septum shown in the previous panel. The arrowhead points to this nascent branch. This is the initiation stage of branching.\n3.  **Panel N:** The bulge has elongated and is now clearly a new, developing side branch. The arrowhead indicates the base of this new branch, which is growing out from the parent filament.\n\nThis entire sequence (L → M → N) illustrates how a filamentous organism grows and expands its network by forming new branches from its existing filaments.\n\n<<<Lateral branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
