# Plan
# 1. Represent the observed NMR spectrum data based on visual analysis of the image.
# 2. Represent the predicted NMR signals for each candidate molecule.
# 3. Compare the observed spectrum with the predictions for each candidate, focusing on differentiating features.
# 4. Conclude which candidate best matches the spectrum and print the detailed reasoning.

print("--- Step 1: Initial Spectrum Analysis ---")
print("The spectrum shows a distinct triplet at ~1.1 ppm and a quartet at ~2.7 ppm.")
print("This pattern is a clear indicator of a diethylamino group, -N(CH2CH3)2.")
print("   - The signal at ~1.1 ppm is a triplet representing the 6H of the two CH3 groups.")
print("   - The signal at ~2.7 ppm is a quartet representing the 4H of the two CH2 groups.")

print("\n--- Step 2: Eliminating Candidates ---")
print("Candidates A-G and B-G do not contain a diethylamino group. They have a dimethylamino group, which would show a single 6H singlet.")
print("Since the spectrum clearly shows a diethylamino group, candidates A-G and B-G are incorrect.")
print("This leaves candidates C-L and D-L.")

print("\n--- Step 3: Differentiating C-L and D-L ---")
print("Both C-L and D-L have the diethylamino group, an amide N-H, and a -CO-CH2-N- methylene group, which matches the main features.")
print("The key difference is the number of methyl groups on the aromatic ring:")
print(" - Candidate C-L has one aryl-methyl group (Ar-CH3). This would result in a singlet with an integration of 3H.")
print(" - Candidate D-L has two equivalent aryl-methyl groups. This would result in a singlet with an integration of 6H.")

print("\n--- Step 4: Final Conclusion based on Integration ---")
print("The spectrum shows a singlet at ~2.3 ppm. To determine if it represents 3H or 6H, we compare its integration to the triplet at ~1.1 ppm, which we know is 6H.")
print("By visual inspection, the area of the singlet at ~2.3 ppm is roughly half the area of the triplet at ~1.1 ppm.")
print("This means the singlet at ~2.3 ppm represents 3 protons.")
print("This 3H singlet corresponds to the single aryl-methyl group in structure C-L.")
print("Therefore, the spectrum matches candidate C-L.")

print("\nFinal Signal Assignment for Structure C-L:")
print("~8.9 ppm (broad singlet, 1H, -NH-CO-)")
print("~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 4H, Ar-H)")
print("~3.4 ppm (singlet, 2H, -CO-CH2-N-)")
print("~2.7 ppm (quartet, 4H, -N(CH2-CH3)2)")
print("~2.3 ppm (singlet, 3H, Ar-CH3)")
print("~1.1 ppm (triplet, 6H, -N(CH2-CH3)2)")
