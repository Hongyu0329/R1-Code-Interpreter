    "My plan is to identify the plant shown in the image and then determine the specific island to which it was endemic.\n\n1.  **Plant Identification**: The plant in the image has very distinct dark green leaves with a prominent network of lighter-colored veins (reticulate venation). By searching for plants with these specific leaf characteristics, I have identified it as the Saint Helena Olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). This species was known for its unique and beautiful foliage, which matches the image perfectly.\n\n2.  **Determine Endemic Location**: The common name, Saint Helena Olive, and the scientific literature both confirm that this plant was endemic to a single island. The name of the island is directly in its common name.\n\n3.  **Code Generation**: I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island where the plant in the image was endemic.\n    The plant is Nesiota elliptica, the Saint Helena Olive.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The island where Nesiota elliptica was endemic is Saint Helena.\n    island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
