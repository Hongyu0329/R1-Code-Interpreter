    "The bryophyte shown in the image is a liverwort belonging to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis genus is easily recognizable due to the finely divided, fringed leaves that give the plant a feathery or \"flossy\" appearance. The name *Ptilidium* even comes from the Greek word *ptilidion*, which means \"small feather,\" referencing this characteristic look.\n\nPlants in this genus grow in dense, often yellowish-brown or reddish-brown mats. They are classified as leafy liverworts.\n\nThe genus *Ptilidium* includes three species: *Ptilidium californicum*, *Ptilidium ciliare*, and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum*. These species are primarily found in arctic and subarctic regions, with some populations in New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. They can typically be found in habitats like acidic grasslands, on rocky slopes, in heaths, and on trees, rocks, and soil in moist forests.\n\n<<<*Ptilidium*>>>"
