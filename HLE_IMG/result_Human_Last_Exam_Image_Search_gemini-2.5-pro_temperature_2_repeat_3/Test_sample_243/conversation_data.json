    "The plant pictured is a cultivar of the genus *Helwingia*, which is known for having its flowers and subsequent fruits emerge directly from the midrib of its leaves.\n\nThe wild species from which this plant is derived is endemic to the **Osumi Islands** of Japan. These islands are part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, located south of Kyushu. Specifically, the species *Aspidistra elatior*, which was once thought to be of Chinese origin, is native to the Osumi Islands, particularly Kuroshima, Suwanose, and the Uji Islands. While several *Helwingia* species are found throughout East Asia, the specific lineage of cultivars with such distinct features is often traced back to this region known for its unique endemic flora.\n\n<<<Osumi Islands>>>"
