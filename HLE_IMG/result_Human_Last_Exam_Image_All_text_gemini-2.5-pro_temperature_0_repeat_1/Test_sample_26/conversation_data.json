    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Measure and Determine the Key**\n*   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find measure 28 at the beginning of the second system. Measure 30 is the third measure on that line and is circled in the image.\n*   The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or E♭ major. The \"Pathetique\" Sonata's first movement is famously in **C minor**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   We need to identify all the notes being played simultaneously to determine the chord.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays two G notes, an octave apart. The lowest note determines the bass position of the chord. Here, the bass note is G.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a broken chord (arpeggio). The notes are G, B-natural (indicated by the natural sign ♮, canceling the B♭ in the key signature), D, and F-sharp (indicated by the sharp sign ♯).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Chord and Identify its Quality**\n*   Combining the notes from both hands, we have the pitches: **G, B♮, D, F♯**.\n*   Let's analyze this chord:\n    *   The root is G.\n    *   The interval from G to B♮ is a major third.\n    *   The interval from G to D is a perfect fifth.\n    *   The interval from G to F♯ is a major seventh.\n*   A chord consisting of a root, major third, perfect fifth, and major seventh is a **Major Seventh chord**. Therefore, the chord in measure 30 is a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral based on the Key**\n*   The key of the piece is C minor. We need to find the relationship between the chord's root (G) and the tonic of the key (C).\n*   The C minor scale is C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭. The note G is the **fifth** scale degree. The fifth degree is called the **dominant**.\n*   In a minor key, the dominant chord is typically altered to be a major chord to create a stronger pull to the tonic. This is done by raising the seventh scale degree (B♭ to B♮), which becomes the leading tone. The triad G-B♮-D is a major triad.\n*   A major triad built on the fifth scale degree is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral: **V**.\n*   The chord in measure 30 is a G major triad with an added major seventh (F♯). It functions as the dominant, as it resolves to the C minor tonic chord (i) in the following measure (m. 31).\n*   While a more detailed analysis might label the chord as Vmaj7 or V M7 to account for the F♯, the fundamental Roman numeral that identifies its root, quality (major), and function (dominant) within the key of C minor is simply **V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Key Signature:** Always check the key signature first. Here it's C minor.\n*   **Accidentals:** Pay close attention to accidentals within the measure. The B-natural and F-sharp are crucial for identifying the exact chord. The B-natural is expected for a dominant chord in a minor key, but the F-sharp is a chromatic alteration.\n*   **Function:** The chord's function is determined by where it leads. This G-based chord leads directly to the tonic C minor chord, confirming its dominant function.\n*   **Roman Numeral Conventions:** The uppercase 'V' signifies a major chord built on the fifth scale degree. The lowercase 'v' would signify a minor chord. Since G-B♮-D is a major triad, V is correct.\n\n<<<V>>>"
