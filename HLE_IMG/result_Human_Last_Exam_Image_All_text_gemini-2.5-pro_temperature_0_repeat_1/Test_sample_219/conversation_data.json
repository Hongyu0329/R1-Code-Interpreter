    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a different recording site in a neuronal culture.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential (a \"spike\" or \"firing\") from a neuron at a specific time.\n*   A **synchronized burst** is a period where many neurons fire at nearly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of black dots, indicating high network activity.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nWe need to visually inspect the graph and identify the center time for each major synchronized burst.\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense vertical band is centered at approximately **t = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The next prominent burst is located between 10 s and 20 s, centered at approximately **t = 15 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** Another burst occurs between 20 s and 30 s. Its center appears to be at approximately **t = 26 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A very strong burst is visible between 30 s and 40 s, centered at approximately **t = 36 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final major burst in the observed window is between 40 s and 50 s, centered at approximately **t = 48 s**.\n\nThe identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 15 s, 26 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, which means there are four inter-burst intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 15 s - 2 s = **13 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 26 s - 15 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 36 s - 26 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 13 s + 11 s + 10 s + 12 s = 46 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.5.\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n*   The third digit is '5'. According to standard rounding rules, if the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, we round up the preceding digit.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 rounded to two significant figures is **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
