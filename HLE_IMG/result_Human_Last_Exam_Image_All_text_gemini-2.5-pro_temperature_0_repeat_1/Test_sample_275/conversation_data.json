    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Analysis Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify and count every unique splice variant (species) of mRNA detected by the different RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. A unique splice species is identified by a unique band size for a given primer pair.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Panel:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R):**\n    *   This reaction amplifies early transcripts spanning from the E1 to the E4 region.\n    *   Two distinct bands are visible: band 1 (190 bp) and band 2 (159 bp).\n    *   This indicates the presence of **two** different splice species in the early region.\n    *   **Species count: 2**\n\n2.  **Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R):**\n    *   This reaction also amplifies early transcripts, but the reverse primer is further downstream in the E5 region.\n    *   Two bands are again observed: band 1 (584 bp) and band 2 (553 bp).\n    *   These two bands likely correspond to the same two splice species identified in Panel B. This panel serves as confirmation and does not reveal new species.\n    *   **Species count remains: 2**\n\n3.  **Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R):**\n    *   The forward primer E1F2 is specifically designed to span the 929^3465 splice junction. Therefore, it only amplifies transcripts containing this specific splice.\n    *   A single band of 551 bp is detected.\n    *   This represents a **third** distinct splice species, characterized by the 929^3465 splice.\n    *   **Species count: 2 + 1 = 3**\n\n4.  **Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R):**\n    *   This reaction uses a forward primer in the early region (E1) and a reverse primer in the late region (L2). This detects late transcripts that are polyadenylated at the late site (AL).\n    *   A single band of 1,005 bp is observed.\n    *   This represents a **fourth** distinct splice species, which is a late transcript.\n    *   **Species count: 3 + 1 = 4**\n\n5.  **Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R):**\n    *   This reaction combines the splice-specific primer E1F2 (929^3465) with the late region primer L2R.\n    *   A single band of 972 bp is detected.\n    *   This identifies a late transcript that specifically contains the 929^3465 splice, representing a **fifth** distinct species.\n    *   **Species count: 4 + 1 = 5**\n\n6.  **Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R):**\n    *   This reaction uses another splice-specific primer, E1F3, which spans the 929^3506 junction, paired with the late primer L2R.\n    *   Two distinct bands are detected: band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n    *   This indicates that there are **two** different late splice species that both contain the 929^3506 splice but differ in another splicing event between the primer binding sites. These are the **sixth** and **seventh** species.\n    *   **Species count: 5 + 2 = 7**\n\n7.  **Panel H (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):**\n    *   This reaction detects late transcripts that extend into the L1 region.\n    *   Two distinct bands are visible: band 1 (450 bp) and band 2 (419 bp).\n    *   These represent **two** more unique late splice species, the **eighth** and **ninth** species.\n    *   **Species count: 7 + 2 = 9**\n\n8.  **Panel I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):**\n    *   This is the same reaction as in Panel H but run for more cycles to detect less abundant transcripts.\n    *   Four bands are visible:\n        *   Band 1 (450 bp) and Band 2 (419 bp) are the same species detected in Panel H.\n        *   Band 3 (378 bp) and Band 4 (187 bp) are new, smaller bands, indicating two additional, less abundant splice species. These are the **tenth** and **eleventh** species.\n    *   **Species count: 9 + 2 = 11**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy systematically analyzing each PCR result and counting each unique product band, we can identify all the splice species detected in this experiment.\n\n*   Panel B identified 2 species.\n*   Panel D identified 1 new species.\n*   Panel E identified 1 new species.\n*   Panel F identified 1 new species.\n*   Panel G identified 2 new species.\n*   Panel H identified 2 new species.\n*   Panel I identified 2 additional new species.\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
