    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the total current (I_total) supplied by the voltage source V2 to the entire circuit. We can find this using Ohm's Law (I = V/R) if we first determine the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit.\n\n**2. Analyze the Circuit's Structure**\nThe circuit can be broken down into two main branches connected in parallel across the 1V voltage source.\n*   **Left Branch:** Contains resistors R1, R2, and R3.\n*   **Right Branch:** Contains resistors R7 and R8.\n\n**3. Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Left Branch**\n*   **Careful Point:** Observe the wiring around resistor R2. There is a wire that directly connects the node above R2 (between R1 and R2) to the node below R2 (between R2 and R3). This wire acts as a **short circuit** across R2.\n*   In an ideal circuit, a wire has zero resistance. Current will always follow the path of least resistance. Therefore, all the current flowing from R1 will bypass R2 and travel through the wire to R3.\n*   This means R2 does not contribute to the circuit's resistance and can be ignored.\n*   With R2 shorted out, resistors R1 and R3 are effectively in series.\n*   The equivalent resistance of the left branch (R_left) is the sum of R1 and R3:\n    *   R_left = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω.\n\n**4. Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Right Branch**\n*   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected one after another in a single path. This is a series connection.\n*   The equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right) is the sum of R7 and R8:\n    *   R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance of the Circuit**\n*   The left branch (R_left = 12 Ω) and the right branch (R_right = 200 Ω) are connected in parallel across the voltage source.\n*   The formula for the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of two parallel resistors is:\n    *   1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left + 1 / R_right\n    *   1 / R_eq = 1 / 12 + 1 / 200\n*   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 600.\n    *   1 / R_eq = (50 / 600) + (3 / 600) = 53 / 600\n*   Therefore, the total equivalent resistance is:\n    *   R_eq = 600 / 53 Ω ≈ 11.32 Ω.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Current**\n*   Now we use Ohm's Law to find the total current (I_total) flowing from the voltage source V2.\n*   I_total = V2 / R_eq\n*   I_total = 1 V / (600 / 53 Ω)\n*   I_total = 53 / 600 A\n\n**7. Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    *   I_total = 53 ÷ 600 ≈ 0.088333... A\n*   This can also be expressed in milliamperes (mA): 0.0883 A * 1000 = 88.3 mA.\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is 53/600 Amperes.\n\n<<<53/600 A>>>"
