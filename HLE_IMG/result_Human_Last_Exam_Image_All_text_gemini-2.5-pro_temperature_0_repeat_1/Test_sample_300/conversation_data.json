    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork:\n\n**Row 1**\n\n*   **Artwork 1 (Top-left):** This painting depicts women of the Yi ethnic minority. The style, featuring realistic figures rendered with expressive ink wash and subtle color, is a hallmark of **Zhou Sicong (周思聪)**. This is a classic example of her work from the late 1970s and early 1980s, which often focused on the lives of people in the Liangshan region.\n*   **Artwork 2 (Top-middle):** This is an abstract landscape painting in Chinese ink. The artist uses bold lines and ink washes to deconstruct and represent a village scene. This style, which blends traditional Chinese ink with Western abstract concepts, is the signature of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n*   **Artwork 3 (Top-right):** This is a work of modern Chinese calligraphy in a highly expressive and dynamic \"mad cursive\" script (狂草). This powerful, large-scale, and almost abstract calligraphic style is the signature of the contemporary artist **Wang Dongling (王冬龄)**.\n\n**Row 2**\n\n*   **Artwork 4 (Middle-left):** This is a piece of calligraphy featuring elegant, well-structured characters written in a semi-cursive script. The distinctive style, known for its slender and graceful yet strong brushstrokes, is immediately recognizable as that of **Qi Gong (启功)**. The text is from a famous Tang dynasty poem.\n*   **Artwork 5 (Middle-center):** This is a photorealistic oil painting of a young woman holding a sketchbook. This style, which combines meticulous realism with a romantic and often nostalgic mood, is the trademark of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary art.\n*   **Artwork 6 (Middle-right):** This painting shows a woman in ethnic attire, rendered in a style that fuses Chinese ink techniques with Western modernism. The flattened perspective, the melancholic and elegant figure, and the decorative background are all characteristic features of the master **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**.\n\n**Row 3**\n\n*   **Artwork 7 (Bottom-left):** This painting depicts a vibrant courtyard scene with luffa gourds and laundry. The use of bright, bold colors, strong compositional lines, and a focus on the beauty of everyday rural life are hallmarks of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. This is his second piece in this collection.\n*   **Artwork 8 (Bottom-middle):** This is a monumental landscape painting. The technique of using heavy, layered ink to build up the dark, imposing mountains, contrasted with the misty river and the bright red sails of the boats, is a signature style of **Li Keran (李可染)**. He was a master at creating powerful and majestic landscapes.\n*   **Artwork 9 (Bottom-right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The subject matter, along with the simple, confident, and lively brushwork that captures the essence of the creature, is the most famous specialty of the great modern master **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Zhou Sicong\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Wang Dongling\n4.  Qi Gong\n5.  Chen Yifei\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Zhou Sicong, Wu Guanzhong, Wang Dongling, Qi Gong, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
