    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) structure.**\n    An FCC crystal structure has atoms at the eight corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the viewing direction [110].**\n    The [110] direction corresponds to a vector along a face diagonal of the cube. We are looking at the crystal structure along this line, and the atoms are projected onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the theoretical projection pattern for FCC along [110].**\n    When the 3D FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern of atoms forms a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    The unit cell of this 2D lattice is a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] directions of the original cube.\n    The lengths of the sides of this rectangle are `a` and `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the original cube.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the side lengths of the projected rectangular unit cell is `(a√2) / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    The pattern consists of atoms at the four corners of this rectangle and one atom at the very center of the rectangle.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the given images to find the one that matches the theoretical pattern.**\n    We are looking for a centered rectangle with a side ratio of approximately 1.414.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular pattern, with atoms only at the corners of repeating rectangular units. It does not have a centering atom. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image shows a centered rectangular pattern. Let's check the side ratio. The corner atoms form a rectangle with approximate coordinates (1,3), (7,3), (1,9), (7,9). The width is `7-1=6` units. The height is `9-3=6` units. The ratio is `6/6 = 1`. This is a centered **square**, not a rectangle with a side ratio of √2. A centered square pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [100] direction. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image shows atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern. This is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction, looking down onto the close-packed (111) planes. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This image appears complex because it shows atoms from multiple adjacent unit cells and is drawn with some 3D perspective. However, we can identify the underlying repeating pattern. Let's try to find a centered rectangle with the correct aspect ratio.\n        *   Let's identify a unit cell. Consider the rectangle formed by corner atoms near (1, 7.5) and (9, 18). The width would be `w ≈ 9 - 1 = 8` units. The height would be `h ≈ 18 - 7.5 = 10.5` units.\n        *   The ratio of the sides is `h/w ≈ 10.5 / 8 = 1.31`. This is close to `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n        *   The center of this rectangle would be at `(x, y) ≈ ( (1+9)/2, (7.5+18)/2 ) = (5, 12.75)`. There is an atom in the image at approximately (5, 12), which corresponds to the centering atom.\n        *   The other atoms in the image, such as those at (5, 7), (5, 18), and (9, 12), belong to adjacent unit cells, illustrating how the pattern tessellates.\n        *   Therefore, the pattern in Image C is consistent with a centered rectangle with a side ratio of approximately √2.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n    By elimination and direct analysis, Image C is the only one that represents the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
