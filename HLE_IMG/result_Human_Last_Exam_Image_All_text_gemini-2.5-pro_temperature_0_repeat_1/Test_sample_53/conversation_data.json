    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the scene.**\nThe image is from a Greek red-figure vase. We can observe several key components:\n*   **A chariot:** A two-wheeled vehicle is central to the composition.\n*   **The driver:** A figure wearing a distinctive, ornate headdress (often identified as a Phrygian cap) and a patterned sleeve is driving the chariot. This style of dress was used by ancient Greeks to depict people from the East (often referred to as \"barbarians\"), such as Trojans, Amazons, or, in this case, someone from Colchis.\n*   **A passenger:** Inside the chariot, next to the driver, is another figure, mostly obscured by drapery.\n*   **A winged creature:** A large white wing is visible above the chariot, suggesting the chariot is capable of flight and is pulled by a mythical, winged creature (like a dragon or serpent, which are often not fully depicted).\n*   **The figure leaving the chariot:** A nude male figure is depicted in a dramatic pose, falling or being pushed out of the back of the chariot. His body is arched backward over the wheel, and he appears lifeless or in the throes of death.\n*   **Decorative elements:** The vase includes typical Greek decorative motifs like palmettes and a wave pattern at the bottom.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mythological story.**\nThe combination of these elements points to a specific and famous Greek myth: the story of Medea.\n*   **Medea:** She was a powerful sorceress from Colchis, on the eastern edge of the Greek world. Her depiction in \"foreign\" attire (the Phrygian cap) is a standard iconographic convention.\n*   **The flying chariot:** Medea is famous for possessing a magical chariot, a gift from her grandfather, the sun god Helios. This chariot was often described as being drawn by winged serpents or dragons, which explains the presence of the large wing.\n*   **The tragic events:** The most famous part of her myth, dramatized by Euripides in his play \"Medea,\" is her revenge on her husband Jason. After Jason abandons her for the princess of Corinth, Medea murders the princess and then kills her own two sons to inflict the ultimate pain on Jason. She then escapes from Corinth in her flying chariot, taking the bodies of her children with her to deny Jason the chance to bury them.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the visual elements to the myth.**\n*   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Medea**.\n*   The flying chariot is the one sent by **Helios**.\n*   The figures inside and falling from the chariot are her **children**, whom she has just murdered. The scene captures the horrific climax of the story: Medea's escape after committing filicide.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific figure in question.**\nBased on the narrative, the figure leaving the chariot is one of the two sons of Medea and Jason. The artist has depicted him falling from the chariot to emphasize the tragedy and the unnatural act of a mother killing her child and callously handling the body during her escape. The other son is likely the draped figure still inside the chariot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe figure leaving the chariot is one of the sons of Medea and Jason, murdered by his mother as part of her revenge against Jason.\n\n<<<One of the sons of Medea and Jason."
