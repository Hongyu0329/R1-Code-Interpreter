The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain (variable-type immunoglobulin domain)** of its receptor, RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts).

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here's the explanation:

*   **Adjunct Marker Role:** The protein is not specific to a single neurological disorder; it is over-expressed in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and even cardiovascular disease. This lack of specificity prevents it from being a standalone diagnostic tool, meaning it could only be used as an adjunct marker to support a diagnosis made with other methods.
*   **Prognostic Marker Role:** The protein's value as a prognostic marker is significant. As shown in the diagram, the level of S100B directly correlates with the activation of downstream pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead to critical pathological outcomes: **neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration**. A higher concentration of S100B would imply greater activation of these damaging processes, indicating a more aggressive disease course and a poorer prognosis for the patient. Therefore, measuring S100B levels can help predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder.
