    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\nLet's break down its execution for `n > 1`:\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It compares the last element of the current subarray (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last element (`a[n-2]`). This is similar to a single comparison-and-swap step in Bubble Sort.\n3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the elements are out of order, they are swapped.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: **Crucially**, if a swap occurred, the algorithm makes another recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. This is because the swap might have disrupted the previously sorted order of the first `n-1` elements.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing and returns.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function performs a single check and returns. This takes constant time. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n    *   One recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   A comparison and a potential swap. These take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   A second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` *only if the `if` condition is true*.\n\nTo find the **worst-case** time complexity, we must assume the scenario that leads to the most work. The most work is done when the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed at every step. This happens when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true after the first `sort(a, n - 1)` call.\n\nAn example of a worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array, like `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`. In this case, the smallest element is always at the end of the subarray being considered, which will cause a swap and trigger the second recursive call.\n\nSo, for the worst case, the recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe have the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = d` (another constant). Let's solve it by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ... after `k` expansions ...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`. Substituting `k = n-1`:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series which equals `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Big-O Complexity\n\nFrom the solved recurrence, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`. In Big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored, so `O(2^(n-1))` is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is exponential. Let's check the options:\nA. O(n) - Incorrect.\nB. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\nC. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\nD. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\nE. O(2^n) - Correct.\nF. does not terminate - Incorrect. The size of the problem `n` decreases with each recursive call, ensuring termination.\n\nThe final answer is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
