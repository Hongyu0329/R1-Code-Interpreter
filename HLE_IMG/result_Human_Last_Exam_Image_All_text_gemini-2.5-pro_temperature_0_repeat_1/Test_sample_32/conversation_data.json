    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the primary, most easily observable (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing generation) between two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Moss Sporophyte**\nA typical moss sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n1.  **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte (the leafy green part).\n2.  **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape can be important diagnostic features.\n3.  **Capsule (Sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that contains the spores. Its shape, orientation, and features like the peristome (teeth around the mouth) are also key identifiers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Species Names for Clues**\nThe scientific names themselves can provide hints.\n*   *Grimmia montana*: \"montana\" refers to mountains, indicating its typical habitat.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta*: The specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" is a combination of Latin words: \"*curvus*\" meaning \"curved\" and \"*seta*\" referring to the stalk of the sporophyte. This name strongly suggests that a curved seta is a defining characteristic of this species.\n\n**Step 4: Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***\n*   *Grimmia montana* is characterized by having a **short, straight seta**.\n*   Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect (upright).\n*   The capsule is typically described as emergent, meaning it rises just above the surrounding leaves (perichaetial leaves) but is not held high above the plant on a long stalk. The image provided, showing erect, cup-like capsules nestled among the leaves, is consistent with this description.\n\n**Step 5: Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   As its name implies, the most distinctive feature of *Grimmia curviseta* is its **strongly curved, arcuate, or swan-necked (cygneous) seta**.\n*   This pronounced curve causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or even pendent (hanging downwards), often making it less conspicuous as it is tucked in among the leaves.\n\n**Step 6: Compare and Identify the Main Difference**\nBy comparing the two species, the most striking and easily visible difference in the sporophyte is the **shape and orientation of the seta**.\n\n*   **Grimmia montana:** Has a **straight seta**, resulting in an **erect capsule**.\n*   **Grimmia curviseta:** Has a **curved seta**, resulting in a **nodding or hanging capsule**.\n\nThis difference in the seta's curvature is the key feature that allows for distinguishing the two species \"at a glance\" when they are fertile and bearing sporophytes.\n\n<<<The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved or swan-necked (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging."
