The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved or swan-necked (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging.
