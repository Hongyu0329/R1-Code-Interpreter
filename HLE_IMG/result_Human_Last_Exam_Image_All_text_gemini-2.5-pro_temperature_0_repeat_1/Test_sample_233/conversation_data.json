    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to find the specific catalog ID of an \"Ingvar runestone\" based on a provided image fragment showing its runic inscription. The term \"Ingvar runestone\" refers to a specific group of about 30 runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland (the land of the Saracens). This context is a crucial starting point.\n\n2.  **Examine the Image:** The image displays a close-up of runic carvings on stone. The runes are arranged in three horizontal bands, separated by carved lines. Small 'x' marks are used as word separators. The style of the runes is the Younger Futhark, typical of the Viking Age.\n\n3.  **Transliterate the Runes:** To identify the stone, we need to read the runes. We will transliterate the runes in each row, from left to right. The Latin letter corresponding to each rune is given in parentheses.\n\n    *   **Third Row (Bottom):** This row is the clearest.\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛅ` (a)\n        *   `ᚢ` (u)\n        *   `ᚴ` (k)\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛏ` (t)\n        *   `ᚢ` (u)\n        *   `ᛘ` (m)\n        *   `ᛅ` (a)\n        *   `ᚾ` (n)\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   This reads `x auk x tuman x`, which in Old Norse is **`auk Tuman`**, meaning \"and Tumi/Tuman\". The name `Tuman` is a very distinctive clue.\n\n    *   **Second Row (Middle):**\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛋ` (s)\n        *   `ᚢ` (u)\n        *   `ᚾ` (n)\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᛋ` (s)\n        *   `ᛁ` (i)\n        *   `ᚾ` (n)\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   This reads `x sun x sin x`, which in Old Norse is **`sun sin`**, meaning \"his son\". This is a very common phrase on memorial runestones.\n\n    *   **First Row (Top):** This row is more challenging due to the stylized runes and the fact that it's the end of a word. Let's try reading it from right to left, as it leads into the separator.\n        *   `x` (separator)\n        *   `ᚾ` (n)\n        *   `ᛁ` (i)\n        *   `ᛅ` (a)\n        *   `ᛏ` (t)\n        *   `ᛋ` (s)\n        *   `ᚱ` (r)\n        *   `ᚢ` (u)\n        *   `ᚦ` (th)\n        *   Reading from left to right, this is `...þurstain x`. This corresponds to the Old Norse name **`Þorstæin`** (Thorsteinn).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Inscription Fragment:** Combining the three lines, we have a coherent text fragment:\n    *   `... [at] Þorstæin,` (...in memory of Thorsteinn,)\n    *   `sun sin,` (his son,)\n    *   `auk Tuman...` (and Tuman...)\n\n5.  **Search and Identify:** Now we search for an Ingvar runestone that contains this specific sequence of names and phrases: `Þorstæin`, `sun sin`, and `Tuman`.\n    *   A search of the Ingvar runestones reveals that the runestone cataloged as **Sö 9** (Södermanland Runic Inscription 9) has an inscription that perfectly matches this fragment.\n    *   The full inscription on Sö 9 is: `Þorðr [ok] Griðfastr, þæiR ræistu stæin þannsi at Þorstæin, sun sinn, ok Tuman, sun ÞorðaR. ÞæiR vaRu austr með Ingvari a Særklandi.`\n    *   **English Translation:** \"Þórðr and Gríðfastr, they raised this stone in memory of Þorsteinn, their son, and Tumi, Þórðr's son. They were east with Ingvarr in Serkland.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The fragment shown in the image (`...Þorstæin, sun sin, auk Tuman...`) is a direct match for a portion of the inscription on the Ingvar runestone Sö 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Context is Key:** Knowing the stone belongs to the \"Ingvar\" group dramatically narrows the search from thousands of runestones to about thirty.\n*   **Rune Variation:** Runes can have stylistic variations. The `s` rune (`ᛋ`) is tilted, and the `a` rune (`ᛅ`) is a \"stung\" or short-twig variant. It's important not to be misled by these slight differences.\n*   **Reading Direction:** While text is generally left-to-right, analyzing a difficult or partial word from right-to-left can sometimes help in identification, as was done with `Þorstæin`.\n*   **Distinctive Features:** Common phrases like `sun sin` are helpful but not unique. A proper name like `Tuman` is a much stronger identifier. The combination of all three elements provides definitive proof.\n*   **Catalog System:** Runestones are cataloged based on their province. \"Sö\" stands for Södermanland, a province in Sweden where this stone is located.\n\nThe ID of the runestone is Sö 9.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
