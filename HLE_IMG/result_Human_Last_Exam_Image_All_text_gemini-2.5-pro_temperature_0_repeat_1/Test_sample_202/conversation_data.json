    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n### **Analysis Principles (Careful Points)**\n\n1.  **Observe Texture:** The first step is to look at the overall texture of the rock.\n    *   **Crystalline:** Is it made of interlocking crystals? If so, are they large (phaneritic) or too small to see (aphanitic)? This points towards an igneous or metamorphic rock.\n    *   **Clastic:** Is it made of smaller pieces (clasts) of other rocks or minerals cemented together? This indicates a sedimentary rock.\n    *   **Vesicular:** Does it have holes or pores (vesicles)? This is a strong sign of a volcanic (extrusive igneous) rock, formed as gas escaped from cooling lava.\n    *   **Foliated:** Does it have layers or bands? This indicates a metamorphic rock.\n\n2.  **Determine Composition (Color & Minerals):**\n    *   **Color:** The overall color gives clues about the mineral composition. Light-colored igneous rocks (felsic) are rich in silica (e.g., quartz, feldspar). Dark-colored igneous rocks (mafic) are rich in iron and magnesium (e.g., pyroxene, olivine).\n    *   **Visible Minerals/Clasts:** Try to identify individual minerals (in crystalline rocks) or the types of fragments (in clastic rocks).\n\n3.  **Classify the Rock:** Based on texture and composition, determine the major rock type (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) and then the specific rock name.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Identification**\n\n**Specimen H:**\n*   **Step 1 (Texture):** The rock is full of small, visible holes, making it highly **vesicular**. The underlying rock material appears very fine-grained (**aphanitic**), as individual crystals are not visible.\n*   **Step 2 (Composition):** The color is a reddish-brown. This color in volcanic rocks is often due to the oxidation of iron.\n*   **Step 3 (Classification):** The vesicular and aphanitic texture indicates it is an **extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock**. A reddish, highly vesicular, mafic-to-intermediate volcanic rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n*   **Step 1 (Texture):** The rock is clearly composed of many smaller rock fragments cemented together. This is a **clastic** texture. The fragments (clasts) are of various sizes and colors and are notably **angular** in shape.\n*   **Step 2 (Composition):** The clasts are fragments of different pre-existing rocks. The cementing material (matrix) is fine-grained and light in color.\n*   **Step 3 (Classification):** A clastic rock made of angular, gravel-sized fragments is a **sedimentary rock** called **Breccia**. (It could also be a volcanic breccia, formed from an explosive eruption, which is a type of pyroclastic igneous rock).\n\n**Specimen J:**\n*   **Step 1 (Texture):** Like specimen H, this rock is highly **vesicular** and appears very porous and lightweight. The texture is also **aphanitic** (fine-grained).\n*   **Step 2 (Composition):** The color is very light, ranging from white to light gray. This indicates a **felsic** composition, rich in silica.\n*   **Step 3 (Classification):** The vesicular, aphanitic, and light-colored (felsic) characteristics are hallmarks of an **extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock** called **Pumice**.\n\n**Specimen K:**\n*   **Step 1 (Texture):** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is a **phaneritic (coarse-grained) crystalline** texture. The crystals show no alignment (non-foliated).\n*   **Step 2 (Composition):** There is a mix of minerals. We can see light-colored minerals (white/pinkish, likely feldspar) and glassy gray minerals (likely quartz), along with some darker minerals (black/dark green, likely biotite or hornblende).\n*   **Step 3 (Classification):** The coarse-grained crystalline texture indicates an **intrusive igneous rock** that cooled slowly deep underground. A rock with this texture and a felsic composition (quartz and feldspar) is identified as **Granite**. The very large crystal size could also qualify it as a granite pegmatite.\n\n---\n### **Final Identification Summary**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
