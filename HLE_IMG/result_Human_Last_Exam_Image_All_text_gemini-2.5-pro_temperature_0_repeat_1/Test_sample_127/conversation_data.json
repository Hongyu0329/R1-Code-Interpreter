    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure:**\n    The image displays a cationic Iridium(III) coordination complex. The central Iridium (Ir) atom is in a roughly octahedral coordination environment. It is bonded to three bidentate ligands.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (containing rings E, F, G):** This is a 2,2'-bipyridine ligand, where rings E and F are pyridine rings. Both coordinate to the Iridium center through their nitrogen atoms (N^N chelation). Ring G is a phenyl group attached to the C6 position of pyridine ring F. This ligand is neutral.\n    *   **Ligand 2 (containing rings A, B, H, K):** This is a cyclometalating ligand. Ring B is a pyridine ring coordinating through its nitrogen. Ring A is a phenyl ring that forms a C-Ir bond (a cyclometalated bond, shown as a dotted line from C6 of ring A to Ir). This type of C^N ligand is monoanionic. Rings H and K are phenyl substituents on ring A.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (containing rings C, D, J, L):** This is another cyclometalating C^N ligand, analogous to the second one. Ring D is a pyridine (N-coordinated), and ring C is a phenyl ring (C-coordinated at C6). This ligand is also monoanionic. Rings J and L are phenyl substituents on ring C.\n    *   **Overall Charge:** The complex is Ir(III) with two anionic ligands (-1 each) and one neutral ligand. The total charge is (+3) + 2*(-1) + 0 = +1, which matches the drawing.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Rotations:**\n    The question asks which phenyl rings can rotate freely. The rings in question are the peripheral phenyl groups: G, H, J, K, and L. Free rotation can occur around the single C-C bonds that connect these rings to the main ligand framework, provided there is no significant energy barrier. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Analyze Steric Hindrance for Each Phenyl Ring:**\n    We need to examine the local environment of the C-C bond for each phenyl ring to assess the steric barrier to rotation. The barrier will be high if the rotating ring's ortho-hydrogens (at positions 2 and 6 of that phenyl ring) clash with bulky groups on the adjacent atoms of the ring it's attached to.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to C4 of ring A. The adjacent atoms on ring A are C3 and C5.\n        *   At C3 of ring A, there is a bulky pyridine ring (B).\n        *   At C5 of ring A, there is a bulky phenyl ring (K).\n        Ring H is sandwiched between two very large groups. Rotation would require its ortho-hydrogens to pass by these groups, leading to a very large steric clash. Therefore, the rotation of ring H is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to C4 of ring C. This situation is analogous to ring H. The adjacent atoms on ring C are C3 and C5.\n        *   At C3 of ring C, there is a bulky pyridine ring (D).\n        *   At C5 of ring C, there is a bulky phenyl ring (L).\n        Similar to H, ring J is sterically locked between two bulky groups. Its rotation is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to C5 of ring A. The adjacent atoms on ring A are C4 and C6.\n        *   At C4 of ring A, there is a bulky phenyl ring (H).\n        *   At C6 of ring A, there is a bond to the large Iridium center.\n        Ring K is wedged between a phenyl group and the metal coordination site. This creates severe steric hindrance, preventing free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to C5 of ring C, analogous to ring K. The adjacent atoms on ring C are C4 and C6.\n        *   At C4 of ring C, there is a bulky phenyl ring (J).\n        *   At C6 of ring C, there is a bond to the Iridium center.\n        Like K, ring L's rotation is highly restricted by the adjacent phenyl group and the metal center.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to C6 of pyridine ring F. The adjacent atoms on ring F are C5 and N1.\n        *   At C5 of ring F, there is a hydrogen atom (not explicitly drawn), which is a very small group.\n        *   At N1 of ring F, there is the bond to the Iridium center.\n        The rotation of ring G is hindered on one side by the coordination sphere of the Iridium atom and on the other side by a small hydrogen atom. Compared to rings H, J, K, and L, which are hindered by two bulky groups, the steric barrier for ring G's rotation is significantly lower.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, rings H, J, K, and L are all part of extremely crowded environments that will prevent them from rotating freely. Their rotational barriers will be very high. Ring G is in a much less sterically congested position. While its rotation is not entirely unhindered (due to the proximity of the metal center), it is the only ring among the choices that has a plausible chance to rotate freely, or at least has a much lower rotational barrier than the others. In the context of the question, \"freely\" should be interpreted relatively. Therefore, ring G is the only one that can rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Answer Choice:**\n    The analysis concludes that only ring G can rotate freely. This corresponds to answer choice K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
