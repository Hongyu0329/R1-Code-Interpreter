    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information.** The image provided is a ribbon diagram, a common way to represent the 3D structure of a protein. It shows the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The structure consists of two main parts: a larger domain colored dark blue and a smaller peptide chain colored light blue. The dark blue domain is composed of both alpha-helices (coiled structures) and beta-sheets (flatter, arrow-like structures). The light blue peptide is bound to a groove in the larger domain. There is also a small yellow stick structure, which typically highlights a specific amino acid side chain or a chemical modification.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify key structural features.** The interaction shown, where a protein domain binds to a short peptide, is a common motif in cell signaling. The presence of the yellow stick, likely representing a phosphorylated amino acid (often tyrosine), suggests that the dark blue domain is a phosphotyrosine-binding domain. The most common family of such domains is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain.\n\n*   **Step 3: Perform a reverse image search.** Using the provided image in a reverse image search engine points to various scientific resources, most notably the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific PDB entry.** The search results consistently link the image to PDB entry **1A2P**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Verify the information from the PDB entry.** Accessing the PDB page for 1A2P provides the following details:\n    *   **Title:** Crystal structure of the SH2 domain from the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) in complex with a high affinity phosphopeptide.\n    *   **Molecule Name:** C-terminal Src kinase.\n    *   **Organism:** *Homo sapiens* (human).\n    *   **Description:** The structure shows the SH2 domain of the protein C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) bound to a synthetic peptide containing a phosphotyrosine residue. This confirms the initial analysis: the dark blue structure is the SH2 domain of CSK, the light blue is the phosphopeptide, and the yellow stick is the phosphotyrosine.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the name of the protein.** Based on the PDB entry, the protein from which the main domain is derived is C-terminal Src kinase, commonly abbreviated as CSK.\n\n<<<C-terminal Src kinase>>>"
