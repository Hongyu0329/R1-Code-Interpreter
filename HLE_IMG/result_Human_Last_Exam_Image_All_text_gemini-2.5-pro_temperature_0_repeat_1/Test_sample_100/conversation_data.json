    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\n\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene ring system with a carbonyl group at position 3.\n*   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group. The formula for a PMB group is -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃, which contains 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen (C₈H₉O).\n*   There is a trifluoromethyl (-CF₃) group attached to the double bond at position 6.\n*   Let's count the atoms in the starting material:\n    *   **Bicyclic core (C₆H₅N):** 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen. (C1-H, C4-H, C5-H, C7-H₂)\n    *   **Carbonyl group (CO):** 1 carbon, 1 oxygen.\n    *   **Trifluoromethyl group (CF₃):** 1 carbon, 3 fluorines.\n    *   **PMB group (C₈H₉O):** 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 oxygen.\n*   **Total count for the starting material:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (core) + 1 (CO) + 1 (CF₃) + 8 (PMB) = 16 carbons. Let's recount carefully.\n    *   Let's count carbons from the structure directly: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 are 6 carbons. The CF₃ group has 1 carbon. The PMB group has 1 (CH₂), 6 (ring), 1 (OCH₃) = 8 carbons. Total C = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** C1-H (1), C4-H (1), C5-H (1), C7-H₂ (2) = 5 hydrogens. PMB group has CH₂ (2), C₆H₄ (4), OCH₃ (3) = 9 hydrogens. Total H = 5 + 9 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorine (F):** 3.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 1.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (methoxy on PMB) = 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to form Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The PMB group is cleaved off, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:**\n    *   Remove the PMB group (-C₈H₉O).\n    *   Add one hydrogen atom (+H).\n    *   Net change: -C₈H₈O.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to form Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:**\n    *   One molecule of H₂ is added across the double bond.\n    *   Net change: +H₂.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to form the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (in this case, a cyclic amide or lactam). The lactam ring is opened by the addition of one molecule of water. The C-N bond of the amide is cleaved, forming a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH₂).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:**\n    *   One molecule of water (H₂O) is added to the molecule.\n    *   Net change: +H₂O.\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
