    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the rotational symmetry of the tiling. This means we need to find the highest order of rotation, 'n', such that rotating the entire pattern by 360/n degrees around a specific point (a center of rotation) leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of the Tiling**\nThe tiling is composed of several distinct shapes (tiles) with different colors:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombi (four-sided figures with equal side lengths).\n*   Light yellow irregular pentagons (five-sided figures).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe most likely centers of rotation are the geometric centers of the symmetrical tiles, such as the hexagons and squares. We will test these points.\n\n**Step 4: Test for Rotational Symmetry around the Center of a Hexagon**\n1.  **Initial Observation:** A regular hexagon tile by itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry (can be rotated by 60 degrees). Let's see if the surrounding pattern also supports this.\n2.  **Careful Point - The Orientation of Squares:** Observe the light yellow squares throughout the pattern. A crucial detail is that all squares appear to have the same orientation. Their sides are all parallel to each other (though not necessarily parallel to the image borders).\n3.  **Analysis:** Let's consider a 6-fold rotation (60°) around the center of a blue hexagon. Such a rotation would map each tile in the pattern to a new position and with a new orientation (rotated by 60°). For the pattern to be symmetric, the rotated tiles must perfectly match the original tiles at their new locations.\n4.  **Contradiction:** If we rotate the entire pattern by 60°, every square in the pattern would be rotated by 60°. The resulting pattern would be composed of squares with a new orientation. However, we observed that all squares in the original pattern have a single, common orientation. Since a square rotated by 60° has a different orientation from the original, the rotated pattern cannot be identical to the original.\n5.  **Conclusion for Hexagons:** This means that a 60° rotation is not a symmetry of the tiling. By the same logic, a 120° (3-fold) rotation is also not a symmetry, as it would also change the orientation of the squares. A 180° (2-fold) rotation, however, would map a square onto itself with the same orientation, so this is a possible symmetry. Visual inspection confirms that a 180° rotation around a hexagon's center leaves the pattern unchanged. Thus, the center of a hexagon is a point of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Test for Rotational Symmetry around the Center of a Square**\n1.  **Initial Observation:** A square tile by itself has 4-fold rotational symmetry (can be rotated by 90 degrees). Let's examine the pattern surrounding a square.\n2.  **Local Pattern:** Each light yellow square is surrounded by four orange rhombi, forming a 4-pointed star shape. This local motif is 4-fold symmetric.\n3.  **Wider Pattern:** We must check if the rest of the tiling is consistent with this 4-fold rotation. Let's consider rotating the entire pattern by 90° around the center of a square.\n4.  **Analysis:** A 90° rotation maps the central square to itself. It maps each of the four surrounding rhombi to the position of the next one. It also maps the tiles further out (the hexagons and pentagons) to new positions. For example, the hexagon attached to the \"top\" rhombus is mapped to the position of the hexagon attached to the \"right\" rhombus. Visual inspection shows that the arrangement of all surrounding tiles is consistent with a 90° rotation. The irregular pentagons are also oriented correctly after a 90° rotation.\n5.  **Conclusion for Squares:** The pattern is invariant under a 90° rotation about the center of any square. Therefore, the centers of the squares are points of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nWe have found centers of rotation of different orders in the tiling:\n*   Points of 4-fold symmetry (the centers of the squares).\n*   Points of 2-fold symmetry (the centers of the hexagons, and also the centers of the squares, since any 4-fold center is also a 2-fold center).\n\nThe rotational symmetry of a pattern is defined by the highest order of rotation found. In this case, the highest order is 4.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n*   The tiling does not have 6-fold symmetry because that would require squares of multiple orientations, but all squares in the pattern share the same orientation.\n*   The tiling has 4-fold rotational symmetry centered on the squares.\n*   The highest order of rotational symmetry is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
