(A schematic representation of 1-(1-acetyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, assuming a different tautomer/rearrangement, or more simply, 1-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid from the enamine tautomer)

**Simplified Drawings:**

**Product A:** A pyrrolizidine core with a C5=C6 double bond. C6 is substituted with -C(OH)CH3. C7 is substituted with -COOCH3. The nitrogen at position 4 is substituted with a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group.

**Product B:** A pyrrolidine ring is fused with a 7-membered ring. The 7-membered ring is -N-CH=CH-C(O)O-C(O)-. The nitrogen of the pyrrolidine is also substituted with a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group.

**Product C:** The starting material, 1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, where the enamine tautomer of the pyrroline substituent has been N-acetylated.
