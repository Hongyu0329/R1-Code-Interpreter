    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual and textual information in the image.**\n*   **Image Content:** The advertisement shows a woman in work clothes (overalls, cap) working on what appears to be a tank or armored vehicle in a factory setting. This is a classic \"Rosie the Riveter\" style image, representing women's contribution to the war industry.\n*   **Headline:** \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\". This explicitly places the advertisement in the context of a war, and given the style and subject, it is clearly World War II. It celebrates the role of women in the war effort.\n*   **Retailers:** The text at the bottom lists prominent British retailers of the time: \"BOOTS, TIMOTHY WHITES & TAYLORS, and other chemists, departmental stores, drapers. WOOLWORTH'S, MARKS & SPENCER LTD. and THE N.A.A.F.I.\" This indicates the product was a common, mass-market consumer good available in chemists (pharmacies) and department stores.\n*   **Missing Information:** There is a large, empty white space on the left side of the advertisement. This is where the product's name and descriptive copy would have been.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the question's clues.**\n*   **Time Period:** \"During World War II\". This matches the ad's content.\n*   **Target Audience:** \"Britain massively recruited new workers\". The ad is clearly aimed at these new female workers.\n*   **Product Claim:** \"helped these workers overcome inherent limitations\". This is a key phrase. For women entering physically demanding industrial jobs, \"limitations\" could be interpreted as physical fatigue, stress, or, given the social norms of the era, the challenge of maintaining one's femininity and morale in a harsh environment.\n*   **Product Name:** \"Name this product with a French-derived name\". This is the most specific and crucial clue for identifying the product.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues and research to identify the product.**\n*   We are looking for a mass-market product sold in British chemists and department stores during WWII.\n*   The product has a French name.\n*   The advertising campaign featured women factory workers and claimed to help them overcome the \"limitations\" or strains of their work.\n*   Searching for \"WWII British advertisement women factory French name\" or reverse-searching the image leads to the full, uncropped version of this advertisement.\n*   The missing text on the left reveals the product is **Bourjois** face powder.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identified product against all the requirements.**\n*   **Product:** Bourjois Face Powder.\n*   **French-derived name?** Yes, Bourjois is a well-known French cosmetics company founded in Paris in 1863. The name is distinctly French.\n*   **Helped overcome inherent limitations?** The full ad copy explains this claim. It argues that while war work is tough, good grooming boosts morale. The powder provides a \"lovely, lasting bloom that defies the strain of long, arduous hours,\" helping women to \"face the world and your work with a smile.\" In this context, the \"limitation\" being overcome is the toll that hard labor takes on a woman's appearance and spirits, which the product claims to alleviate. This fits the advertising logic of the period perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the product is Bourjois.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
