    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reaction starts with a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It is treated with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 °C. The products are a rearranged alkene and water (H₂O). This indicates an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. Given the complex, rigid structure of the starting material, this reaction is expected to proceed via a carbocation intermediate, which is prone to rearrangements to form more stable carbocations. This type of rearrangement in steroid and triterpenoid systems is known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves a series of [1,2] shifts of hydride (H⁻) or methyl (CH₃⁻) groups.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n1.  **Protonation and Formation of the Initial Carbocation:** The oxygen atom of the hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 gets protonated by the acid (HCl). This forms a good leaving group, water (H₂O). The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The secondary carbocation at C-3 is relatively unstable. It will undergo a cascade of [1,2] shifts to relieve strain and form more stable tertiary carbocations. This is often called a \"backbone rearrangement\". We will track the movement of methyl groups and hydrogen atoms.\n\n    *   **Initial State:** Carbocation at C-3.\n        *   Let's note the initial substituents at the key carbons involved in the rearrangement:\n            *   C-4: Two CH₃ groups\n            *   C-5: One H atom\n            *   C-8: One CH₃ group\n            *   C-9: One H atom\n            *   C-10: One CH₃ group\n            *   C-13: One H atom\n            *   C-14: One CH₃ group\n\n    *   **Shift 1:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-4 to C-3 occurs. This moves one of the methyl groups from C-4 to C-3 and forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-4. C-4 now has one CH₃. C-3 now has a CH₃.\n\n    *   **Shift 2:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-5 to C-4. The hydrogen atom at C-5 migrates to C-4, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-5.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-5. C-4 now has one CH₃ and one H. C-5 has lost its H.\n\n    *   **Shift 3:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-10 to C-5. The methyl group at C-10 migrates to C-5, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-10.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-10. C-5 now has a CH₃. C-10 has lost its CH₃.\n\n    *   **Shift 4:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-9 to C-10. The hydrogen atom at C-9 migrates to C-10, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-9.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-9. C-10 now has an H. C-9 has lost its H.\n\n    *   **Shift 5:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-8 to C-9. The methyl group at C-8 migrates to C-9, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-8.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-8. C-9 now has a CH₃. C-8 has lost its CH₃.\n\n    *   **Shift 6:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-14 to C-8. The methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-14.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-14. C-8 now has a CH₃. C-14 has lost its CH₃.\n\n    *   **Shift 7:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-13 to C-14. The hydrogen atom at C-13 migrates to C-14, forming a tertiary carbocation at C-13.\n        *   *Status:* Cation at C-13. C-14 now has an H. C-13 has lost its H.\n\n3.  **Deprotonation to Form the Final Product:** The final carbocation is at C-13. A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C-12. This forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13, yielding the final product.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Substituents at the Numbered Positions**\n\nNow we can determine what substituent (H or CH₃) is at each of the numbered positions in the final product based on the rearrangement cascade.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** C-4 started with two CH₃ groups. One migrated to C-3. A hydrogen migrated in from C-5. Thus, C-4 is left with one CH₃ group and one H atom. The label '1' points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):** C-10 started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-5. A hydrogen atom migrated in from C-9. Thus, the substituent at C-10 is now a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C-5):** C-5 started with an H atom, which migrated to C-4. A CH₃ group migrated in from C-10. Thus, the substituent at C-5 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C-9):** C-9 started with an H atom, which migrated to C-10. A CH₃ group migrated in from C-8. Thus, the substituent at C-9 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C-8):** C-8 started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-9. Another CH₃ group migrated in from C-14. Thus, the substituent at C-8 is a methyl group.\n    *   **5 = CH₃**\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining these findings, the substituents at the specified positions are:\n1 = CH₃\n2 = H\n3 = CH₃\n4 = CH₃\n5 = CH₃\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
