    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to determine the two numbers that will be in the top-most horizontal row of two white squares.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues for the Top Row**\nLet's label the two top white squares as Cell A (left) and Cell B (right).\nLooking at the puzzle, there is a clue \"17\" positioned directly above this row of two squares. In a standard Kakuro puzzle, this number indicates the sum of the digits in the white squares in the run below it. Here, the run is the row containing Cell A and Cell B.\nSo, the primary clue for these two squares is:\n`Cell A + Cell B = 17`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Possible Digits**\nThe rules of Kakuro state that each white square must be filled with a digit from 1 to 9, and digits within a single run (a set of squares adding up to a clue) must be unique.\nWe need to find two different digits between 1 and 9 that add up to 17.\nLet's list the possibilities:\n*   The highest possible digit is 9. If one number is 9, the other must be `17 - 9 = 8`.\n*   The next highest digit is 8. If one number is 8, the other must be `17 - 8 = 9`.\n*   If we try a smaller digit, like 7, the other would have to be 10, which is not a single digit.\n\nTherefore, the only possible pair of distinct digits that sum to 17 is {8, 9}. The two top squares must contain the numbers 8 and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Potential Contradictions (Careful Point Analysis)**\nA full analysis of a Kakuro puzzle requires checking for consistency with intersecting clues. Let's examine the column clue for Cell A.\n*   There is a clue \"15\" to the left of the column that contains Cell A. This clue applies to a vertical run of five squares.\n*   The sum of five unique digits being 15 is only possible one way: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`.\n*   This means that the five cells in that column must contain the digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   Cell A is the top cell of this column. According to this clue, Cell A must be one of the digits from 1 to 5.\n\nWe have a contradiction:\n*   From the row clue (17), Cell A must be 8 or 9.\n*   From the column clue (15), Cell A must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nA number cannot satisfy both conditions. This indicates that the puzzle itself is flawed and contains contradictory clues, making it unsolvable in its entirety.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe puzzle as presented is broken. However, the question asks for the two numbers in the top squares, implying a solution exists for that specific part. The clue \"17\" is the most direct and unambiguous piece of information related to those two squares. The contradiction arises from a different clue related to a different run. When faced with a flawed puzzle, the most reasonable approach is to answer based on the most direct local information. The clue for the top row of two squares is 17.\n\nThe two numbers that sum to 17 are 8 and 9.\n\nThe final answer is 8,9.\n<<<8,9>>>"
