    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Shorter lifetime implies lower stability under the operating conditions of an LEC.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four compounds are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]⁺, where Ir is the central metal ion, C^N represents a cyclometalating ligand, and N^N represents a neutral bidentate ligand. The counterion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6⁻).\n*   **Central Metal:** Iridium(III) is common for phosphorescent emitters due to strong spin-orbit coupling.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** In all four complexes, the N^N ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This ligand is identical across all complexes, so it is not the differentiating factor for stability. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily enhance solubility and prevent intermolecular quenching.\n*   **C^N Ligands:** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the nature of the two cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine. The iridium atom forms a bond with a carbon atom of the phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific C^N Ligands in Each Complex**\nLet's examine the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the C^N ligands for each complex:\n*   **Complex 1:** Contains two identical C^N ligands: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Both phenyl rings are substituted with fluorine atoms at the 2-position (*ortho* to the Ir-C bond) and the 4-position (*para* to the Ir-C bond).\n*   **Complex 2:** Contains two different C^N ligands: one is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (with F at 2- and 4-positions) and the other is 2-phenylpyridine (unsubstituted phenyl ring).\n*   **Complex 3:** Contains two different C^N ligands: one is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (with F at 2- and 4-positions) and the other is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (with F only at the 2-position).\n*   **Complex 4:** Contains two identical C^N ligands: 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Both phenyl rings are substituted with a fluorine atom at the 2-position (*ortho* to the Ir-C bond).\n\n**Step 4: Relate Ligand Structure to Emitter Lifetime**\nThe operational lifetime of emitters in LECs is determined by their chemical stability under electrochemical stress. During operation, the complex undergoes both reduction and oxidation cycles. A critical factor for the stability of fluorinated cyclometalated iridium complexes is the position of the fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Role of Fluorination.** Fluorination is often used to tune the electronic properties of the emitter. Electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms can increase the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leading to a larger energy gap and bluer emission. They can also increase the oxidative stability of the complex.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Instability of *ortho*-Fluorine.** A well-documented degradation pathway for these types of complexes involves the fluorine atom at the *ortho* position (the 2-position) of the phenyl ring. When the complex is reduced (gains an electron), the added electron can localize on the C^N ligand. This can trigger the cleavage of the C-F bond at the *ortho* position, which is spatially close to the iridium center. This process, often called reductive defluorination, leads to the irreversible degradation of the emitter molecule and a short device lifetime. Complexes lacking an *ortho*-fluorine substituent are generally much more stable.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Each Complex based on the *ortho*-Fluorine Instability**\nWe need to check which of the complexes contain this specific structural feature known to cause instability.\n*   **Complex 1:** The 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand has a fluorine atom at the 2-position (*ortho*). Since it has two such ligands, it is susceptible to this degradation pathway.\n*   **Complex 2:** This complex has one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand, which has an *ortho*-fluorine. The presence of even one such ligand introduces the degradation pathway.\n*   **Complex 3:** This complex has one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand and one 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. Both of these ligands have an *ortho*-fluorine.\n*   **Complex 4:** The 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand has an *ortho*-fluorine. Since it has two such ligands, it is also susceptible to this degradation.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nAll four complexes (1, 2, 3, and 4) contain at least one cyclometalating ligand with a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position relative to the Ir-C bond. This structural feature is a known major cause of instability and short operational lifetimes in phosphorescent emitters due to a facile reductive degradation pathway. Therefore, all four complexes are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to analogous complexes that do not have this feature (e.g., a complex with only unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine or with fluorine at the meta/para positions).\n\nThe question asks which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes. Since all of them possess this critical instability-inducing feature, the correct answer includes all four complexes.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: The set of complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes is {1, 2, 3, 4}. This corresponds to option O.\n\n<<<O>>>"
