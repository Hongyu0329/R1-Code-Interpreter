    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the current I.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Circuit Diagram and Identify Nodes**\nFirst, we need to interpret the circuit diagram. It consists of a 41 V DC voltage source and five resistors. We can model the circuit by identifying the main nodes (junction points). Let's label the four main vertical lines as nodes, from left to right:\n*   **Node 1:** The leftmost vertical line, connected to the positive terminal of the 41 V battery. Its potential is V₁ = 41 V.\n*   **Node 2:** The first intermediate vertical line.\n*   **Node 3:** The second intermediate vertical line.\n*   **Node 4:** The rightmost vertical line, connected to the negative terminal of the battery and to ground. Its potential is V₄ = 0 V.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Connections between Nodes**\nBased on the diagram, the components are connected as follows:\n*   The 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are connected in parallel between Node 1 and Node 2.\n*   The 14 Ω resistor is connected between Node 2 and Node 3.\n*   The 11 Ω and 29 Ω resistors are connected in parallel between Node 3 and Node 4.\n*   The current 'I' is shown flowing through a wire that directly connects Node 1 to Node 3. A line without a component in a schematic represents an ideal wire with zero resistance.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Potentials of the Intermediate Nodes**\n*   Since there is an ideal wire connecting Node 1 and Node 3, they must be at the same potential. Therefore, the potential at Node 3 is V₃ = V₁ = 41 V.\n*   Now, let's consider the potential at Node 2. Node 2 is connected to Node 1 (41 V) through the 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors, and to Node 3 (41 V) through the 14 Ω resistor. Since Node 2 is connected to points that are both at 41 V, there can be no potential difference across the resistors connected to it. This means the potential at Node 2 must also be 41 V (V₂ = 41 V). Consequently, no current flows through the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) to Find I**\nThe current 'I' is the current flowing through the wire from Node 1 to Node 3. We can find its value by applying KCL at Node 3. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving it.\n\n*   **Currents entering Node 3:**\n    1.  The current I (from the wire connected to Node 1).\n    2.  The current from Node 2 through the 14 Ω resistor (I₁₄).\n*   **Currents leaving Node 3:**\n    1.  The current through the 11 Ω resistor to Node 4 (I₁₁).\n    2.  The current through the 29 Ω resistor to Node 4 (I₂₉).\n\nThe KCL equation for Node 3 is:\nI + I₁₄ = I₁₁ + I₂₉\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Individual Currents**\nUsing Ohm's Law (V = IR, or I = V/R):\n*   **I₁₄:** The potential difference across the 14 Ω resistor is V₂ - V₃ = 41 V - 41 V = 0 V. So, I₁₄ = 0 A.\n*   **I₁₁:** The potential difference across the 11 Ω resistor is V₃ - V₄ = 41 V - 0 V = 41 V. So, I₁₁ = 41 V / 11 Ω.\n*   **I₂₉:** The potential difference across the 29 Ω resistor is V₃ - V₄ = 41 V - 0 V = 41 V. So, I₂₉ = 41 V / 29 Ω.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for I**\nSubstitute the calculated current values back into the KCL equation:\nI + 0 = (41 / 11) + (41 / 29)\nI = 41 * (1/11 + 1/29)\n\nTo add the fractions, find a common denominator (11 * 29 = 319):\nI = 41 * (29/319 + 11/319)\nI = 41 * ( (29 + 11) / 319 )\nI = 41 * (40 / 319)\nI = 1640 / 319\n\nNow, calculate the final value:\nI ≈ 5.14106... A\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the current I is 5.14 A.\n\n<<<5.14>>>"
