The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of the münchnone intermediate derived from proline. This rigidity prevents the intermediate from undergoing a substituent-scrambling isomerization that occurs in the more flexible, acyclic münchnone of Reactions 1 and 2.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial to this rationale. Reaction 1 demonstrates that the [3+2] cycloaddition step itself is inherently highly regioselective, favoring the addition of the electron-withdrawing methoxycarbonyl group to the C4 position of the münchnone. Reaction 2, through isotope labeling, reveals that in a flexible system, a rapid equilibrium exists that scrambles the substituents at the C2 and C4 positions of the münchnone prior to cycloaddition.

In Reaction 3, the fused ring structure of the proline-derived münchnone physically locks the C4 position, making this scrambling process impossible. Consequently, the reaction is governed only by the intrinsic electronic preference of the cycloaddition, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product, Product B.
