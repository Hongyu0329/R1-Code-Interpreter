    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Request and the Provided Data**\nThe request is to identify a country based on a Google Trends graph that shows search interest for three different \"historic events.\" The key information is that all three events are from the same country and that the pattern would be obvious to a historian. The graph shows three lines (red, blue, yellow) representing search interest from December 2019 to late 2023. The most crucial feature of such a graph is the timing and recurrence of the peaks. Annual recurring peaks suggest the \"historic events\" are likely holidays or annual commemorations.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Yellow Line**\nThe yellow line shows very sharp, high peaks that occur at slightly different times each year in the January-February timeframe.\n*   **Spike 1 (2020):** Appears in late January.\n*   **Spike 2 (2021):** Appears in mid-February.\n*   **Spike 3 (2022):** Appears in early February.\n*   **Spike 4 (2023):** Appears in late January.\nThis pattern of a major holiday shifting dates within the Gregorian calendar strongly suggests an event based on a lunisolar calendar. The most prominent international holiday that fits this pattern is the **Lunar New Year (also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival)**.\n*   Chinese New Year 2020: January 25\n*   Chinese New Year 2021: February 12\n*   Chinese New Year 2022: February 1\n*   Chinese New Year 2023: January 22\nThe timing of the yellow peaks matches these dates perfectly. This makes a very strong case that the country is **China**, and the yellow line represents the Spring Festival.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Red Line**\nThe red line shows prominent peaks that occur at the same time every year.\n*   **Spike 1 (2020):** A very large peak in early April.\n*   **Spike 2 (2021):** A significant peak in early April.\n*   **Spike 3 (2022):** A significant peak in early April.\n*   **Spike 4 (2023):** A significant peak in early April.\nThis fixed timing points to an event tied to the Gregorian calendar or a solar term. A major Chinese festival, the **Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day)**, is based on a solar term and consistently falls on April 4th or 5th. This festival is a day to honor ancestors. The consistent early April peaks of the red line align perfectly with the timing of the Qingming Festival.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Blue Line**\nThe blue line shows smaller but clear annual peaks in the May-June timeframe. Like the yellow line, the exact date of the peak appears to shift slightly from year to year.\n*   **Spike 1 (2020):** Late June.\n*   **Spike 2 (2021):** Mid-June.\n*   **Spike 3 (2022):** Early June.\n*   **Spike 4 (2023):** Late June.\nThis pattern again suggests a festival based on the lunar calendar. The **Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Festival)** is another major Chinese holiday that fits this description. Let's check the dates:\n*   Dragon Boat Festival 2020: June 25\n*   Dragon Boat Festival 2021: June 14\n*   Dragon Boat Festival 2022: June 3\n*   Dragon Boat Festival 2023: June 22\nThe blue peaks on the graph correspond precisely with the dates of the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\nThe analysis has identified three major traditional festivals that are central to one country's culture and history:\n1.  **Yellow Line:** Spring Festival (Chinese New Year)\n2.  **Red Line:** Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day)\n3.  **Blue Line:** Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Festival)\n\nAll three are significant, ancient events celebrated in China. The unique combination of two lunar-based holidays with shifting Gregorian dates (Spring Festival and Dragon Boat Festival) and one solar term-based holiday with a fixed date (Qingming Festival) creates a distinctive annual pattern that is characteristic of China's public holidays.\n\n<<<China>>>"
