    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four iridium complexes, used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), will likely have shorter operational lifetimes. The operational lifetime of such a device is primarily determined by the chemical stability of the emitter molecule under electrical stress.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with a general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, where Ir is the central metal ion, C^N is a cyclometalating ligand, and N^N is a neutral bidentate ligand.\n    *   **Metal Center:** All complexes have an Iridium(III) center.\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** All four complexes share the same neutral ligand, 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This part of the molecule is constant and thus not the differentiating factor for stability.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** The key difference lies in the two anionic cyclometalating ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The phenyl rings of these ligands have different fluorine substitution patterns.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligands are unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n        *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligands are difluorinated phenylpyridines. By inspecting the structure, we can see that the fluorine atoms are not adjacent to the carbon atom that forms the bond with the iridium (Ir-C bond). They are located at positions meta and para to the Ir-C bond.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligands are also difluorinated phenylpyridines. A close inspection of the structure reveals that for each ligand, one of the fluorine atoms is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the metalated carbon (i.e., *ortho* to the Ir-C bond).\n        *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligands are tetrafluorinated phenylpyridines. Similar to complex 3, one of the fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring is positioned *ortho* to the Ir-C bond.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability (Lifetime):** The stability of cyclometalated iridium complexes is a well-studied topic in the field of organic electronics (OLEDs and LECs). There are established structure-property relationships:\n    *   **General Fluorination Effect:** Introducing fluorine atoms (which are electron-withdrawing) onto the phenylpyridine ligand generally increases the complex's stability. It strengthens the critical Ir-C bond and makes the complex more resistant to oxidation, which typically leads to *longer* operational lifetimes.\n    *   **The \"Ortho-Fluorine\" Effect:** There is a critical exception to the general rule. Placing a fluorine atom on the phenyl ring at a position *ortho* to the Ir-C bond is known to be highly detrimental to the complex's stability. This specific structural motif creates a pathway for rapid chemical degradation under device operation, leading to significantly *shorter* lifetimes. While the exact mechanism is debated, it is a well-documented empirical rule in the design of stable emitters.\n\n4.  **Apply the Stability Rules to the Complexes:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has no fluorine atoms. Its stability is considered a baseline.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has fluorine atoms but avoids the unstable ortho-F configuration. This complex is expected to be stable, likely more stable than Complex 1.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Contains the destabilizing ortho-fluorine substituent on both C^N ligands. This complex is therefore expected to be unstable and exhibit a short operational lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Also contains the destabilizing ortho-fluorine substituent on both C^N ligands. This complex is also expected to be unstable and have a short operational lifetime.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the ortho-fluorine atom, a known structural feature that drastically reduces the stability and lifetime of iridium emitters, complexes **[3]** and **[4]** are expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to complexes [1] and [2].\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer Choice:** The option that includes both complex 3 and complex 4 is J.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{J}$."
