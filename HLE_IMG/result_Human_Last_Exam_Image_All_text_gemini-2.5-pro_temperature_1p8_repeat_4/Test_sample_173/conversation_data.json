    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the given musical measure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to identify the time signature of the measure. A time signature consists of two numbers:\n*   The top number indicates how many beats are in one measure.\n*   The bottom number indicates what type of note gets one beat (e.g., 4 means a quarter note gets one beat, 8 means an eighth note gets one beat).\nTo find the time signature, we need to count the total duration of all the notes within the measure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Bottom Staff (Bass Clef)**\n*   The bass clef (the lower staff) contains a single note.\n*   This note is a whole note (a hollow note head with no stem).\n*   In common time signatures, a whole note lasts for the entire measure and is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n*   This is the strongest and simplest clue. The presence of a single whole note filling the measure strongly suggests that the measure contains the equivalent of four quarter notes. This points directly to a 4/4 time signature.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Top Staff (Treble Clef) to Confirm**\nLet's add up the rhythmic values in the top staff to verify the finding from the bass clef. The rhythm in the treble clef is divided into four main beats.\n\n*   **Beat 1:** Begins with an eighth rest (worth two sixteenth notes), followed by two sixteenth notes.\n    *   Total duration = (2/16) + (1/16) + (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 2:** Consists of four sixteenth notes beamed together.\n    *   Total duration = 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is a second quarter note.\n*   **Beat 3:** Consists of another group of four sixteenth notes beamed together.\n    *   Total duration = 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is a third quarter note.\n*   **Beat 4:** Consists of a final group of four sixteenth notes beamed together.\n    *   Total duration = 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is a fourth quarter note.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Analyses and Conclude**\n*   The total duration of the notes in the top staff is: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4.\n*   The duration of the whole note in the bottom staff is also equivalent to 4/4.\n*   Both staves are consistent. The measure contains a total of four quarter-note beats.\n*   This corresponds to a time signature of 4/4.\n\n**Step 5: Review the Answer Choices**\n*   A. 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n*   B. 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n*   C. 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure. **Correct.**\n*   D. 3/8: Three eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n*   E. 9/8: Nine eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay close attention to note values (rests, sixteenth notes, whole notes).\n*   Use the beaming of the notes as a guide to identify the beat structure. In simple time like 4/4, sixteenth notes are often beamed together in groups of four to show a single quarter-note beat.\n*   Analyze both the treble and bass staves. Often, one staff provides a clearer clue than the other. In this case, the whole note in the bass clef is the most direct evidence.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
