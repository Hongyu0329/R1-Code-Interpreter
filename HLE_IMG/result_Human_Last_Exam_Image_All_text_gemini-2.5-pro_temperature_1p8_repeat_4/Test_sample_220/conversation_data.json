    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question and the required crystal structure.**\n    The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern that represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the theoretical projection pattern of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.**\n    1.  **FCC Structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face. The atom positions in a conventional unit cell (with lattice constant 'a') can be represented by the basis [(0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1/2,0,1/2), (0,1/2,1/2)] and their translations by integer multiples of the lattice vectors a[1,0,0], a[0,1,0], and a[0,0,1].\n    2.  **Viewing Direction [110]:** This means we are looking down a vector that is the face diagonal of the base of the cubic unit cell. All atoms lying on lines parallel to this vector will be projected onto a single point in the 2D image.\n    3.  **Projection Plane:** The projection plane is perpendicular to the viewing direction [110]. We can choose basis vectors for this plane that are orthogonal to [110] and to each other. Good choices are the [001] vector and the [1-10] vector.\n    4.  **Projected Pattern:** When the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto this plane, they form a specific 2D pattern. This pattern can be analyzed by considering the stacking of atomic planes perpendicular to the viewing direction, which are the (110) planes.\n    5.  The (110) planes in an FCC structure are stacked in an ABAB... sequence.\n    6.  The atoms within each (110) plane form a rectangular array. Let's call the rectangle dimensions Lx and Ly.\n    7.  The rectangle of atoms from a B-plane is shifted relative to the rectangle from an A-plane. The shift is by (Lx/2, Ly/2).\n    8.  When these two sets of rectangular arrays (from A-planes and B-planes) are projected onto a single 2D plane, the result is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the pattern consists of atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and one atom in the very center of that rectangle. This unit cell then repeats to tile the entire plane. The aspect ratio of this rectangle is âˆš2 : 1.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the provided images to find the one matching the theoretical pattern.**\n    We need to visually inspect each of the four options (A, B, C, D) to see which one depicts a centered rectangular lattice. The images use perspective to show a 3D block of the crystal, but the pattern formed by the atoms is the key.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows two distinct planes of atoms. One plane (larger circles) forms a simple rectangle of four atoms. The second plane (smaller circles) also forms a simple rectangle, which is shifted vertically relative to the first. Superimposing these two simple rectangular patterns does not create a centered rectangular pattern. This pattern is actually characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along [110].\n\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms in this image appear to be arranged in a hexagonal fashion. If you were to look from the top down (along the vertical axis), you would see a honeycomb or hexagonal pattern. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC structure viewed along the [111] direction, or an HCP structure viewed along the [0001] direction.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern is more complex and does not clearly resolve into a simple, symmetric 2D lattice like a centered rectangle or a hexagon.\n\n    *   **Image B:** Let's look for the centered rectangular pattern here. We can identify atoms that can serve as the corners of a rectangle and an atom near the center.\n        *   Consider a rectangle defined by corner atoms. For example, atoms at approximate (X, Y) coordinates (1, 2.5), (9, 2.5), (9, 9), and (1, 9).\n        *   Image B has atoms at (or very near) three of these corners: (1, 2.5), (9, 2.5), and (9, 9). The fourth corner at (1, 9) may be outside the depicted cell but implied by periodicity.\n        *   Now, let's find the center of this rectangle, which would be at X = (1+9)/2 = 5 and Y = (2.5+9)/2 = 5.75.\n        *   Image B clearly shows an atom at approximately (X=4, Y=6.5) and another one above it. The position of the lower of these two central atoms is very close to the geometric center (5, 5.75) of the rectangle we defined. (The slight discrepancy is likely due to the perspective drawing). The other atoms in the image also fit into the periodic tiling of this centered rectangular unit cell.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The arrangement of atoms in image B corresponds to a centered rectangular lattice, which is the correct projection of an FCC crystal structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
