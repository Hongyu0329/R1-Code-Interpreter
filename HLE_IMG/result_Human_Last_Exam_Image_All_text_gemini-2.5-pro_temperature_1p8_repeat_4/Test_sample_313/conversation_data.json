    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The man on the right is receiving a trophy from the man on the left.\n*   By searching for major awards ceremonies around June 20, 2019, we find the NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   Identifying the man on the right, who is receiving the award: he is a bearded man who strongly resembles the professional ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n*   In 2019, Nikita Kucherov won several major awards at the NHL Awards ceremony, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), which is consistent with the scene depicted. The man presenting the award is identifiable as NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n*   Therefore, the person pictured is Nikita Kucherov. This means the name \"Kucherov\" is relevant to the puzzle.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a chemical process or substance. A well-known chemical reaction that fits this description is the **Kucherov reaction**.\n*   The Kucherov reaction, discovered by Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov in 1881, is used for the hydration of alkynes. It historically used mercury salts (like mercury(II) sulfate) as a catalyst.\n*   Due to the high toxicity of mercury compounds and environmental concerns, this method has been largely superseded by safer alternatives in modern organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   The first clue points to the person **Nikita Kucherov**.\n*   The second clue points to the **Kucherov reaction**.\n*   The common element linking these two distinct things is the name \"Kucherov\".\n*   The puzzle is structured as a riddle. Let's test \"Kucherov\" as the solution for \"X Y\":\n    *   \"**Kucherov** is pictured at an event...\" (This is true, as a person named Kucherov is pictured).\n    *   \"Another **Kucherov** has almost ceased to be used...\" (This is also true, referring to the Kucherov reaction, which is a different entity also named Kucherov).\n*   This interpretation fits both clues perfectly. The placeholder \"X Y\" is not meant to indicate a two-word answer but simply stands for the unknown entity, which in this case is the name \"Kucherov\".\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe common link between the hockey player in the photo and the obsolete chemical process is the name they share.\n\n<<<Kucherov>>>"
