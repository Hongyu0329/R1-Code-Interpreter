    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to determine the required reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH₂-CO-Br).\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Solvent:** Dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).\n*   **Mechanism:** The bromoacetyl bromide reacts with AlCl₃ to form an acylium ion, [Br-CH₂-C=O]⁺. This electrophile attacks the aromatic ring of butylbenzene. The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an alkyl group, which is an activating ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance from the butyl group, the acylation occurs preferentially at the para position.\n*   **Product:** The product of this step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromo ketone, which is the starting material for the second step.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent. Let's denote it as `Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`.\n*   **Product:** The final product is `tert-butyl (2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate`. Let's break down this structure:\n    *   It is an imidazole, which is a 5-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n    *   At position C2 (the carbon between the two nitrogens), there is an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   At position C5, there is a 4-butylphenyl group.\n    *   At position N1, there is a `tert-butoxycarbonylamino` group, also known as a protected hydrazine group (`-NH-Boc`, where `Boc = -C(=O)O-tBu`).\n*   **Goal:** We need to identify the \"Reactant\" that reacts with the α-bromo ketone to form this specific product.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the structure of the unknown Reactant by \"atom accounting\".**\nThe α-bromo ketone (`Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`) provides the `Ar-C-C` backbone. To form the final imidazole, the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms:\n*   Three backbone atoms: N1, C2, N3.\n*   The substituents on these atoms:\n    *   An `-NH-Boc` group that will be attached to N1.\n    *   An `-NH₂` group that will be attached to C2.\n    *   A hydrogen atom that will be attached to N3 (or be part of the ring system).\n\nPutting these pieces together, the reactant must be a molecule containing the fragment `(Boc-NH)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. This is a derivative of aminoguanidine (`H₂N-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`). Specifically, it's aminoguanidine where one of the nitrogen atoms of the hydrazine part is protected by a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the reactant.**\nThe structure we deduced is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-NH-C(=O)O-tBu`.\n*   This molecule is a derivative of aminoguanidine.\n*   The `tert-butoxycarbonyl` (Boc) group is attached to the aminoguanidine structure.\n*   The common name for this chemical is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**. It can also be found under the name 1-(tert-Butoxycarbonylamino)guanidine, although this name can be ambiguous. The systematic name is `tert-butyl 2-(diaminomethylidene)hydrazine-1-carboxylate`.\n\n**Reaction Mechanism Consideration (Optional but useful for confirmation):**\nWhile there's a noted inconsistency in the regiochemistry of the product as drawn (standard mechanisms would yield the 4-aryl isomer, not the 5-aryl one), the atoms required from the reactant remain the same. The reaction likely proceeds through a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis. A plausible (though simplified) pathway involves the nucleophilic guanidine portion of the reactant condensing with the α-bromo ketone to form the five-membered imidazole ring, eliminating H₂O and HBr in the process. Regardless of the exact mechanism or potential errors in the product's regiochemistry in the drawing, the reactant needed to supply the required atoms and functional groups is uniquely identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reactant needed to transform 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl (2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
