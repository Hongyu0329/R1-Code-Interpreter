    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** The image displays a 3D molecular structure of a protein, rendered in a \"cartoon\" style that highlights its secondary structure (alpha-helices and beta-sheets). The structure consists of two main parts:\n    *   A large protein domain shown in dark blue.\n    *   A smaller protein or peptide shown in light blue, which is bound to the larger domain.\n    *   A small feature is highlighted in yellow, indicating a specific site of interaction or a chemical modification, likely a covalent bond between the two parts.\n    This overall structure is characteristic of an enzyme in complex with a substrate or an inhibitor.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Search Strategy:** To identify a specific protein structure, the most effective method is to use a reverse image search to find its entry in a protein structure database. The primary repository for such structures is the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\n3.  **Execute the Search:** A reverse image search on the provided picture points to several sources, including the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The image is consistently associated with the PDB entry **2O2B**.\n\n4.  **Retrieve Information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB):**\n    *   Accessing the entry for 2O2B on the PDB website (rcsb.org) provides detailed information about the structure.\n    *   The title of the entry is: \"Crystal structure of ubiquitin aldehyde bound to the wild type UCH-L3\".\n    *   This tells us the image shows a complex of two molecules.\n\n5.  **Identify the Components of the Complex:**\n    *   The large, dark blue protein is **Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3** (abbreviated as **UCH-L3**). This is a deubiquitinating enzyme, which means it cleaves ubiquitin from other proteins.\n    *   The small, light blue peptide is a modified form of the protein **Ubiquitin**, specifically **ubiquitin aldehyde**. In this context, it acts as a covalent inhibitor, binding to the active site of the UCH-L3 enzyme.\n    *   The yellow feature represents the covalent bond (a thiohemiacetal adduct) formed between the active site cysteine residue of UCH-L3 and the C-terminal aldehyde group of the ubiquitin inhibitor.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The image shows a complex of two proteins. The most prominent component and the central enzyme is Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3. While the entire complex has a longer name, \"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3\" is the specific name of the main protein shown.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3"
