    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is a bicyclic organic compound with several substituents. Let's count the atoms for each part of the molecule.\n*   **The bicyclic core:** The structure is a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one derivative. This core consists of 6 carbon atoms and 1 nitrogen atom. Let's count the hydrogens on this core:\n    *   Bridgehead C1: 1 H\n    *   Methylene C3: 2 H\n    *   Bridgehead C4: 1 H\n    *   Vinyl C5: 1 H\n    *   C2 is a carbonyl (C=O), so no H.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a CF₃ group, so no H.\n    *   N7 is substituted with a PMB group, so no H.\n    *   Total hydrogens on the core = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 H.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   **CF₃ group:** 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms.\n    *   **PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group:** This group is -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃. Let's count its atoms:\n        *   Carbons: 1 (from CH₂) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from OCH₃) = 8 C.\n        *   Hydrogens: 2 (from CH₂) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from OCH₃) = 9 H.\n        *   Oxygens: 1 (from OCH₃).\n*   **Total atoms in the starting material:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (core) + 1 (from CF₃) + 8 (from PMB) = 15 C.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14 H.\n    *   **Fluorine (F):** 3 (from CF₃).\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 1 (core).\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from PMB) = 2 O.\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protected amines and alcohols. It removes the PMB group from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in atoms:**\n    *   Group removed: PMB (-C₈H₉O).\n    *   Atom added: H (to the nitrogen).\n    *   Net change = - (C₈H₉O) + H = - C₈H₈O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Subtract the net change from the starting material's formula:\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Intermediate 1 has one C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring.\n*   **Change in atoms:** Hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms (H₂) across the double bond.\n    *   Net change = + 2H.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Add the net change to Intermediate 1's formula:\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are strong acidic hydrolysis conditions. Intermediate 2 contains an amide bond (a lactam, as the N-atom is bonded to the carbonyl carbon) which is susceptible to hydrolysis. The reaction with acid and heat will cleave the amide bond.\n*   **Careful point:** Even if interpreted as a bicyclic amino-ketone, harsh acidic conditions could lead to a ring-opening reaction (e.g., retro-Mannich) which also results in the net addition of a water molecule. In either case (lactam hydrolysis or amino-ketone ring opening), one molecule of water (H₂O) is consumed to break a C-N bond in the ring.\n*   **Change in atoms:** The hydrolysis reaction adds one molecule of water.\n    *   Net change = + H₂O.\n*   **Formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Add the net change to Intermediate 2's formula:\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final Product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nThe product is a ring-opened amino acid, specifically a substituted aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid derivative.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Starting Material: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n*   Overall Transformation:\n    1.  Deprotection: -C₈H₈O\n    2.  Reduction: +H₂\n    3.  Hydrolysis: +H₂O\n*   Net change from start to end: ΔC = -8; ΔH = -8 + 2 + 2 = -4; ΔO = -1 + 1 = 0. The net change is -C₈H₄.\n*   Final Formula: C(15-8)H(14-4)F₃N₁O(2-0) = C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂. The calculation is consistent.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
