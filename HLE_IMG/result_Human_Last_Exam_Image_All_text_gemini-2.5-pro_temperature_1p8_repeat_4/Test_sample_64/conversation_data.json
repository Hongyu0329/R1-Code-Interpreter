    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual components of the image.**\n    The image presents three panels, labeled L, M, and N. Each panel contains a micrograph of a filamentous, multi-cellular structure. These structures have distinct cell walls and are divided into compartments by cross-walls (septa), which is characteristic of certain algae or fungi. The cells appear to be observed under a light microscope.\n\n*   **Step 2: Compare the state of the cells in each panel.**\n    *   **Panel L:** This panel shows a relatively straight filament. The cells appear turgid, meaning they are full of water and the plasma membrane is pressed firmly against the cell wall. The cells have a regular, almost rectangular shape. The arrowhead points to a septum between two cells.\n    *   **Panel M:** In this panel, the filament shows some changes. At the location marked by the arrowhead, the cell appears to be constricted. The cell wall seems to be indented, and the cytoplasm within seems to be pulling away from the cell wall, indicating a loss of volume. The overall cell looks less firm than in panel L.\n    *   **Panel N:** This panel displays a more advanced stage of the process seen in panel M. The cell at the arrowhead is severely constricted. The plasma membrane and the cell's contents (protoplast) have visibly shrunk and pulled away from the rigid outer cell wall. The cell has lost its regular shape and appears flaccid and shrunken. The filament is also more bent, likely due to the loss of structural rigidity.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate the observed changes to known biological processes.**\n    The key observation is the progressive shrinking of the cell's internal contents and the detachment of the plasma membrane from the cell wall. This phenomenon occurs when a cell with a cell wall (like a plant, fungal, or algal cell) is placed in a hypertonic solution (a solution with a higher concentration of solutes and thus a lower water potential than the cell's cytoplasm). Due to osmosis, water moves from the area of higher water potential (inside the cell) to the area of lower water potential (outside the cell). This water loss causes the vacuole and cytoplasm to shrink, pulling the flexible plasma membrane inward, away from the rigid cell wall.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific biological term for this process.**\n    The process described in Step 3 is known as **plasmolysis**. Panel L represents a turgid or normal state. Panel M shows incipient (early stage) plasmolysis. Panel N shows advanced or severe plasmolysis, where the protoplast is significantly shrunken.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n    The sequence of images (or the different examples L, M, and N) illustrates the stages of plasmolysis in a filamentous cell. The process involves water loss via osmosis, leading to the shrinking of the protoplast and its detachment from the cell wall.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"
