    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nFirst, we must determine the key of the piece. The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or E♭ major. The \"Pathetique\" Sonata's first movement is famously in C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Measure 30 and its Harmonic Context**\nMeasure 30 is the third full measure on the second system of staves, highlighted by the circle in the image. To understand its function, we must also look at the measure it leads into, which is measure 31.\n*   **Measure 31 (The destination chord):** In measure 31, the chord played is G major (notes G, B-natural, D). In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G. The diatonic chord on G is G minor (G-B♭-D). However, in minor keys, the leading tone (the 7th scale degree) is almost always raised to create a stronger pull to the tonic. Raising B♭ to B-natural makes the dominant chord a major chord. Therefore, the G major chord in measure 31 is the **Dominant (V)** of C minor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Notes in Measure 30**\nNow, let's identify the notes within measure 30 to determine the chord.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** On beats one and two, the left hand plays octave Ds and As.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** On beats one and two, the right hand plays sixteenth-note arpeggios consisting of the notes F♯, A, and D.\n*   **Combined Notes (Beats 1 & 2):** Combining the notes from both hands gives us D, F♯, and A. These notes form a **D major triad**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chord's Function and Roman Numeral**\nWe have a D major chord in measure 30 leading to a G major chord in measure 31.\n*   The key is C minor.\n*   The chord in m. 31 is G major, which is the Dominant (V) of C minor.\n*   The chord in m. 30 is D major. The chord D major is the dominant of G.\n*   When a chord functions as the dominant of a chord other than the tonic, it is called a **secondary dominant**.\n*   In this case, the D major chord is the dominant of the dominant. The Roman numeral for this function is written as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Harmonic Rhythm:** Although there is a different chromatic harmony in the second half of measure 30 (beats 3 and 4), the primary, structurally important harmony of the measure occurs on the strong beats (1 and 2) and defines the measure's function. The entire measure serves to prepare the arrival of the V chord in measure 31.\n*   **Secondary Dominants:** Recognizing secondary dominants is crucial for analyzing tonal music, especially from the Classical and Romantic periods. They create temporary tension that resolves to a diatonic chord, strengthening the harmonic progression. The V/V to V progression is extremely common.\n*   **Leading Tones:** The F♯ in the D major chord acts as a temporary leading tone to G. The B♮ in the G major chord is the primary leading tone to the tonic, C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the chord in measure 30 is a D major triad, which functions as the dominant of the G major chord (the V chord) that follows in measure 31. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V/V.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
