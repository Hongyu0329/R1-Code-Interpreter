    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\n1.  **Count the Crossings:** First, we count the number of crossings in the provided knot diagram. Tracing the knot, we can identify 9 distinct crossings.\n2.  **Check for Alternating Property:** An alternating knot diagram is one where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as you trace along the knot. Let's trace the path of the knot: starting from any point, if you go over at the first crossing, you will go under at the second, over at the third, and so on. Following the path of the blue line in the image, we can confirm that it is indeed an alternating diagram.\n3.  **Identify from Knot Tables:** The knot is an alternating knot with 9 crossings. This means it belongs to the family of knots cataloged as 9_1, 9_2, ..., 9_41 in the standard Rolfsen knot table. By visually comparing the provided diagram with standard representations of 9-crossing knots (for example, on Knot Atlas or KnotInfo database), we can identify this specific knot. The diagram, with its central 'ladder' of three twists and two symmetric outer loops, is a known representation of the knot **9_40**. The knot 9_40 is also known as the pretzel knot P(-3, 3, -3).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant and its Properties**\n\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, is an integer-valued invariant of a knot K that is derived from a structure in knot theory called Khovanov homology. It provides important information about the knot, especially related to its slicing properties.\n2.  **Key Property for Alternating Knots:** A fundamental theorem by Jacob Rasmussen states that for any alternating knot `K`, its Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` is equal to its classical signature, `σ(K)`, or its negative, `-σ(K)`, depending on the sign convention used. (The most common convention today sets `s(K) = -σ(K)`). Crucially for this problem, if the signature is zero, the Rasmussen invariant will also be zero, regardless of the convention.\n3.  **Property under Mirroring:** The signature of a knot's mirror image is the negative of the original knot's signature: `σ(mirror(K)) = -σ(K)`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Signature of the Knot 9_40**\n\n1.  **Amphichirality:** The knot 9_40 is known to be **amphichiral** (or amphicheiral). An amphichiral knot is a knot that is equivalent to its own mirror image. This means the knot `K` can be deformed into `mirror(K)`.\n2.  **Signature of Amphichiral Knots:** Since `K` is equivalent to `mirror(K)`, their invariants must be equal. Therefore, `σ(K) = σ(mirror(K))`.\n3.  **Calculation:** Combining the property from Step 2.3 (`σ(mirror(K)) = -σ(K)`) with the consequence of amphichirality (`σ(K) = σ(mirror(K))`), we get the equation: `σ(K) = -σ(K)`.\n4.  The only number that is equal to its own negative is zero. Therefore, `2σ(K) = 0`, which implies that the signature of the knot 9_40 is **σ(9_40) = 0**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\n1.  We have established that the knot is 9_40, it is alternating, and its signature `σ(9_40)` is 0.\n2.  Using the relationship `s(K) = ±σ(K)` for alternating knots, we can calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n3.  `s(9_40) = ±σ(9_40) = ±0 = 0`.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe knot in the picture is the alternating, amphichiral knot 9_40. Its signature is 0, which implies its Rasmussen s-invariant is also 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
