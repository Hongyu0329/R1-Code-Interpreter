    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy appearance due to numerous visible holes (vesicles). The underlying rock material appears fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas was trapped within the lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. This is characteristic of an extrusive igneous rock. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. A rock with these features (highly vesicular, typically dark-colored but can be reddish, mafic to intermediate composition) is called **Scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of many smaller, angular fragments (clasts) of different colors and types, all cemented together in a light-colored, fine-grained matrix.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This texture is clastic, not crystalline. It is formed from the accumulation and consolidation of volcanic material ejected during an eruption (pyroclasts). Such a rock is known as a pyroclastic rock. Depending on the size of the fragments, it can be called Tuff (if mostly ash), Lapilli Tuff (if pebble-sized), or Volcanic Breccia (if composed of large angular blocks). Given the mix of sand-to-pebble-sized angular fragments, both **Tuff** and **Volcanic Breccia** are appropriate descriptions. Tuff is a common general term.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is very light-colored (white to light gray) and is extremely porous, with many tiny vesicles, giving it a frothy look. It appears to be very low in density.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is a highly vesicular, extrusive igneous rock. However, its very light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. A light-colored, frothy volcanic rock that is so low in density it can often float on water is called **Pumice**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock displays two distinctly different crystal sizes. There are large, well-formed crystals (phenocrysts) that are light in color (likely feldspar or quartz) set within a much finer-grained groundmass of darker and lighter minerals.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This two-stage texture is called porphyritic. It forms when magma begins to cool slowly deep underground, allowing large crystals to grow, and then is erupted to the surface (or moved to a cooler location), where the remaining liquid magma cools quickly to form the fine-grained groundmass. A rock with this distinct texture is called a **Porphyry** or described as having a porphyritic texture (e.g., Porphyritic Andesite or Porphyritic Rhyolite). \"Porphyry\" itself is often used as the rock name.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Vesicular Rocks (H vs. J):** The main distinction between Scoria (H) and Pumice (J) is composition, which is inferred from the color. Scoria is mafic to intermediate and typically darker (black, brown, red). Pumice is felsic and light-colored (white, gray).\n*   **Fragmental vs. Crystalline Rocks (I vs. K):** Specimen I is a clastic rock, made of broken pieces (clasts) cemented together. Specimen K is a crystalline rock, formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma, with crystals that grew in place. The texture in K (porphyritic) results from two different rates of cooling, not from the cementation of fragments.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Porphyry (or Porphyritic Igneous Rock)\n\n<<<\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff / Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Porphyry\n>>>"
