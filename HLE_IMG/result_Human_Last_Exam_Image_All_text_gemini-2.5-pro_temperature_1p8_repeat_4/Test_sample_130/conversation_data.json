    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Nature of the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is generated when atoms of an element are excited (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through a gas) and then release that energy in the form of light. The crucial point is that atoms don't emit light continuously across all colors; instead, they emit light only at specific, discrete wavelengths (or colors). This results in a series of bright lines, and the pattern of these lines is a unique \"fingerprint\" for each chemical element.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum in the Image**\nWe need to carefully observe the pattern of the linesâ€”their color (which corresponds to wavelength) and their relative position. Let's break down the spectrum from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelengths):\n*   **Red Region:** There is a prominent, bright, and relatively isolated line in the red part of the spectrum.\n*   **Yellow/Orange Region:** There is a distinct line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n*   **Green/Cyan Region:** There is a very strong and prominent line in the blue-green (cyan) part of the spectrum. This line appears to be one of the brightest in the entire visible spectrum shown. There are also several other lines in the green area.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet region. A prominent line is visible in the blue-violet area, followed by another in the deep violet. These lines appear to get closer together as they move towards the far violet (left) end of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Pattern with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, we compare this observed pattern with the known emission spectra of common elements.\n\n*   **Sodium (Na):** The spectrum of sodium is overwhelmingly dominated by a very strong pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow region. The provided spectrum has many other prominent lines in the red, cyan, and blue regions, so it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The spectrum of neon is famous for having a large number of bright lines concentrated in the orange and red parts of the spectrum, which is why neon signs have their characteristic reddish-orange glow. The spectrum in the image has strong lines across all colors, especially in the blue and green regions, so it is not neon.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** The spectrum of mercury has characteristic bright lines in the violet, blue, and green regions. However, the specific pattern and relative intensities, particularly the very prominent cyan line seen in the image, do not perfectly match the standard mercury spectrum.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible emission spectrum of hydrogen is known as the **Balmer series**. It has four main, easily recognizable lines:\n    1.  **H-alpha:** A bright red line at approximately 656 nanometers.\n    2.  **H-beta:** A bright cyan (blue-green) line at approximately 486 nanometers.\n    3.  **H-gamma:** A blue-violet line at approximately 434 nanometers.\n    4.  **H-delta:** A violet line at approximately 410 nanometers.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Identification**\nLet's compare the hydrogen spectrum with the image:\n*   The prominent red line in the image corresponds to the **H-alpha** line.\n*   The very bright cyan line in the image corresponds to the **H-beta** line.\n*   The lines in the blue and violet region correspond to the **H-gamma**, **H-delta**, and other higher-energy lines of the Balmer series.\n\nThe pattern shown in the image is a classic and perfect match for the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen. The image is likely a high-resolution depiction which also shows many fainter lines that are present in the full spectrum of hydrogen.\n\n<<<Hydrogen>>>"
