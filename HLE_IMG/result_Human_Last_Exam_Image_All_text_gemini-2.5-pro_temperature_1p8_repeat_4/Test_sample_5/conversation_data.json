    "This is a challenging piece to identify due to its complexity, but by breaking it down, we can find the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Genre:** The score is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music. The piece is highly virtuosic, featuring fast runs (arpeggios), large chords spanning wide ranges of the keyboard, and rapid dynamic changes (from *p* piano to *f* forte). This level of technical demand is characteristic of late Romantic composers (like Liszt or Rachmaninoff) or advanced arrangements of modern music, such as film or video game scores.\n\n2.  **Key and Tempo:** The initial key signature is C major / A minor (no sharps or flats), but the extensive use of accidentals (like Eb, Ab, Db) throughout the piece firmly establishes the tonic key as **C minor**. The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo (Andante or Moderato).\n\n3.  **Distinctive Features (The Clues):**\n    *   **The Opening (Measures 1-2):** The piece begins quietly (*p*) with a simple, memorable melodic phrase in the right hand (G-Eb-D-C) over broken C minor chords in the left hand. This creates a sense of tension and anticipation.\n    *   **The Transition (Measure 3):** There is an abrupt and dramatic shift. The dynamic jumps to loud (*f*), and the right hand plays a very fast, explosive flurry of sixteenth-note arpeggios. This sudden change is the single most recognizable feature of the piece. It functions as a dramatic transition.\n    *   **The Main Theme (Measures 4 onwards):** Following the explosion, the main body of the piece begins. It's marked *mp* (mezzo-piano) and features a driving, rhythmic accompaniment in the left hand against a powerful, chordal melody in the right hand.\n    *   **The \"March\" Section (Measure 8 onwards):** The texture becomes even fuller, marked *mf* (mezzo-forte), with both hands playing thick, rhythmic block chords. This gives the section a powerful, march-like quality.\n\n4.  **Putting the Clues Together:** The structure of \"quiet, suspenseful opening -> sudden loud, chaotic transition -> driving main theme\" is not typical of a classical sonata or prelude. It is, however, extremely common in video games for transitioning from exploration to a battle scene. The opening represents the moment before a random encounter, the explosive arpeggios represent the \"battle swirl\" or screen transition, and what follows is the main battle music.\n\n5.  **The Identification:** This specific melodic opening, the C minor key, and the iconic \"battle swirl\" transition are the unmistakable signatures of the main battle theme from the classic 1997 video game, **Final Fantasy VII**. The official title of the track is \"Fighting\" (or often translated as \"Those Who Fight\"). The composer is the legendary **Nobuo Uematsu**. This sheet music is a skilled piano arrangement of that famous theme.\n\n<<<\"Fighting\" (Battle Theme) from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
