    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, a molecule with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's determine a possible molecular formula. If we have one nitrogen (mass 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. The maximum number of carbons would be 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's try to fit carbons and hydrogens:\n    *   For 9 carbons (C9): 9 × 12 = 108. The remaining mass for hydrogens is 121 - 108 = 13. This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C9H13N**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C9H13N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   A significant fragment ion is seen at m/z = 91, which corresponds to the [C7H7]+ fragment, a very stable tropylium or benzyl cation. This suggests the presence of a benzyl group (C6H5-CH2-).\n\n**2. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR)**\n*   Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n*   Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n*   Two sharp peaks are visible in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region. This is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   Strong absorption bands around 700 cm⁻¹ and 740 cm⁻¹ in the C-H out-of-plane bending region strongly suggest a **monosubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   In summary, the IR spectrum indicates the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group and a primary amine group.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are a total of 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the formula is C9H13N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   The signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 are in the aromatic region (110-160 ppm). A monosubstituted benzene ring has 4 types of carbons (ipso, ortho, meta, para), which matches these 4 signals. The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon (the one attached to the side chain).\n*   The signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   One negative signal indicates one CH2 group.\n    *   Five positive signals indicate a total of five CH and/or CH3 groups.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT data:**\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon (145.1 ppm) will not show up in DEPT.\n    *   The three aromatic CH signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) account for three of the positive DEPT signals.\n    *   This leaves 5 - 3 = 2 positive signals and 1 negative signal for the three aliphatic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the aliphatic side chain must consist of one CH2 group, and two other carbons which are CH or CH3 groups.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, integration ~5H):** This corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, integration ~1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (triplet, integration ~2H):** This is a methylene (-CH2-) group. The triplet splitting implies it's adjacent to another CH2 group. This presents a potential contradiction that will be resolved with HSQC.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ~3H):** This is a methyl (-CH3) group. The doublet splitting means it is adjacent to a single CH proton.\n*   There is also a broad signal, likely overlapping near 1.2 ppm, that can be attributed to the 2 protons of the -NH2 group.\n*   From the ¹H NMR, we have the fragments: C6H5-, -CH-, -CH2-, and -CH3, which matches the carbon types deduced from ¹³C/DEPT.\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation using all data, including HSQC**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton with the carbon atom it is directly bonded to.\n*   Proton at 1.2 ppm (the CH3 doublet) correlates with the Carbon at **19.2 ppm**.\n*   Proton at 2.7 ppm (the CH2 \"triplet\") correlates with the Carbon at **43.5 ppm**. From DEPT, we know this is a CH2 group.\n*   Proton at 2.9 ppm (the CH multiplet) correlates with the Carbon at **49.6 ppm**. From DEPT, this must be a CH group.\n\nLet's test the two most likely isomers based on the fragments (C6H5-, -CH-, -CH2-, -CH3, -NH2):\n*   **Isomer A: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine)**: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3\n    *   Fragments: a benzylic -CH2-, a -CH(NH2)- group, and a -CH3 group.\n    *   Chemical shift predictions: Benzylic -CH2- carbon is ~40-45 ppm. The -CH(NH2)- carbon is ~50-55 ppm. The -CH3 carbon is ~20 ppm.\n    *   HSQC Correlation check:\n        *   C at 43.5 ppm is the benzylic -CH2-. Its protons are at 2.7 ppm. This assignment is excellent.\n        *   C at 49.6 ppm is the -CH(NH2)- group. Its proton is at 2.9 ppm. This is also an excellent fit.\n        *   C at 19.2 ppm is the -CH3 group. Its protons are at 1.2 ppm. This fits perfectly.\n    *   This structure is highly consistent with all data, *except* for the splitting of the CH2 signal at 2.7 ppm. It should be a doublet (coupled to the CH), not a triplet. Given that every other piece of data fits perfectly, it is most likely that this signal is a complex multiplet (from diastereotopic protons) that coincidentally appears as a triplet, or there is a slight error in the presented spectrum.\n\n*   **Isomer B: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2\n    *   Fragments: a benzylic -CH(CH3)- group, and a -CH2(NH2) group.\n    *   Chemical shift predictions: Benzylic -CH- carbon is ~40-45 ppm. The -CH2(NH2) carbon is ~45-50 ppm.\n    *   HSQC Correlation check: If the proton at 2.9 ppm is the benzylic CH, its carbon at 49.6 ppm is too high (should be closer to 40). If the proton at 2.7 ppm is the -CH2(NH2), its carbon at 43.5 ppm is slightly low. This assignment is less plausible than for Isomer A.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming weight of the evidence (MS, IR, ¹³C, DEPT, and HSQC chemical shift correlations) points to the structure being 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**IUPAC Naming**\n*   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). This is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   The amine group (-NH2) is located on carbon 2. Thus, the parent name is propan-2-amine.\n*   A phenyl group (C6H5-) is a substituent on carbon 1.\n*   The full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
