    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the graph:** The provided image is a raster plot. The y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128), and the x-axis represents time in seconds (s). Each black dot represents a neuronal firing event (a spike) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire at nearly the same time. In the raster plot, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating high network activity across many electrodes. We need to identify the time at which these bursts occur, typically by estimating the center of the dense vertical band.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first clear synchronized burst occurs early in the recording. Visually inspecting its densest part, we can estimate its center is at approximately **t1 = 2 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The next major burst is located between 10 s and 20 s. The center of this burst appears to be at approximately **t2 = 17 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** A very prominent burst is centered exactly between 30 s and 40 s, at **t3 = 35 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The final major burst is towards the end of the recording. Although it is a bit more spread out, its center of mass can be estimated to be around **t4 = 48 s**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of consecutive bursts. We have identified four bursts, so we can calculate three inter-burst intervals.\n    *   **IBI 1:** The time between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n        IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 17 s - 2 s = 15 s.\n    *   **IBI 2:** The time between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n        IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 35 s - 17 s = 18 s.\n    *   **IBI 3:** The time between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n        IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 35 s = 13 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 15 s + 18 s + 13 s = 46 s.\n    *   Number of intervals = 3.\n    *   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 46 s / 3 = 15.333... s.\n\n5.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated average is 15.333... s.\n    *   The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n    *   The third digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we keep the second digit as it is).\n    *   Therefore, the average inter-burst interval is **15 s**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary source of potential error is the visual estimation of the burst centers. However, the identified bursts are quite distinct, and small variations in the estimated timestamps (e.g., ±0.5 s) would not significantly change the final rounded answer.\n*   It's important to identify all the major, clearly synchronized bursts across the majority of electrodes and not be distracted by smaller, localized firing events.\n*   The calculation involves finding the time *between* bursts, so for 'n' bursts, there are 'n-1' intervals.\n*   Adherence to the required number of significant figures (two in this case) is crucial for the final answer.\n\n<<<15>>>"
