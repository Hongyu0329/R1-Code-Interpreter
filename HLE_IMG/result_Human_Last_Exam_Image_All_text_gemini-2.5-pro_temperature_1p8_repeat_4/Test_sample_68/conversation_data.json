    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Obverse (Left Image)**\n    *   The image on the left shows the obverse (front) of a coin. It features a bust portrait of a monarch facing left.\n    *   Although the image is blurry, the style of the portrait, specifically the bare head (not wearing a laurel wreath) and the draped bust, is characteristic of coins issued for King Louis XVI of France, who reigned from 1774 to 1792.\n    *   The legend around the rim, though difficult to decipher completely, would correspond to the king's title, likely \"LUDOV. XVI. D. G. FR. ET NAV. REX\" (Louis XVI, by the grace of God, King of France and Navarre).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reverse (Right Image)**\n    *   The image on the right shows the reverse (back) of the coin.\n    *   The legend along the upper edge is partially readable. The crops help to identify the words \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" (French Colonies), confirming its colonial origin.\n    *   The central device consists of three fleurs-de-lis (a symbol of the French monarchy) beneath a royal crown.\n    *   Below this central emblem, there is a key identifying feature. Despite the low resolution, a letter is discernible. `Crop 8` shows this letter, which is consistent with the shape of the letter \"C\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize Information and Identify the Colony**\n    *   We have a French colonial coin from the reign of Louis XVI.\n    *   The reverse has the legend \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" and, most importantly, the letter \"C\" beneath the royal emblem.\n    *   In the system of French colonial coinage of that era, the letter \"C\" on the reverse of coins with the \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" legend was specifically used to designate the coin for circulation in the colony of **Cayenne** (modern-day French Guiana).\n    *   This coin is identifiable as a 2 Sols piece struck for Cayenne, typically between 1780 and 1789.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   Based on the identification of the monarch as Louis XVI and the presence of the letter \"C\" on the reverse, the coin was specifically issued for the French colony of Cayenne.\n\n<<<Cayenne (French Guiana)>>>"
