    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Reactant Analysis:** The first reactant is a substituted cyclobutene. Based on the connections shown, its structure is 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene. It has a chiral center at C4, with the methyl (Me) group shown as a wedge (up) and the methoxy (OMe) group as a dash (down), indicating they are trans to each other.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π thermal electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n3.  **Diene Formation:** The ring opening of a cyclobutene, `C1=C2-C3-C4`, results in a conjugated 1,3-butadiene derivative. The connectivity of the atoms in the resulting diene is `C4-C1=C2-C3` where C4 and C3 become the terminal carbons of the diene system, and C1 and C2 become the internal carbons.\n4.  **Structure of the Diene Intermediate:** Applying this mapping to the starting material, `C1(OMe)=C2(H)-C3(H2)-C4(Me,OMe)`:\n    *   C4 of cyclobutene, which has the Me and OMe groups, becomes a terminal carbon of the diene.\n    *   C1 of cyclobutene, with the OMe group, becomes an internal carbon.\n    *   C2 of cyclobutene, with a H atom, becomes the other internal carbon.\n    *   C3 of cyclobutene, with two H atoms, becomes the other terminal carbon.\n    The resulting diene has the structure `(Me,OMe)C=C(OMe)-CH=CH2`.\n5.  **Stereochemistry of the Diene:** The stereocenter at C4 of the cyclobutene is lost because this carbon becomes sp² hybridized in the diene. However, the conrotatory opening process creates new stereochemistry in the diene (E/Z isomerism). A single enantiomer of the starting material would produce two diastereomeric dienes via the two possible conrotatory pathways. One of these will likely be the more stable (E)-isomer with respect to the most substituted double bond, which is also more reactive in the subsequent Diels-Alder step because it can more easily adopt the necessary s-cis conformation. Let's assume the reaction proceeds through this (E)-diene intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   Diene: `(Me,OMe)C=C(OMe)-CH=CH2`. This is an electron-rich diene due to the three methoxy groups.\n    *   Dienophile: Ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`). This is an electron-poor dienophile due to the electron-withdrawing ester group (`-CO2Et`).\n2.  **Regiochemistry:** This is a normal electron demand Diels-Alder reaction. The regiochemistry is governed by the interaction of the diene's Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the dienophile's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).\n    *   LUMO of ethyl acrylate has a larger orbital coefficient on the β-carbon (the `CH2` group).\n    *   HOMO of the diene is highly polarized. The OMe groups increase the electron density and the HOMO coefficients. The terminal carbon with the geminal Me and OMe groups (`C4'`) is sterically hindered but electronically activated. The other terminal carbon (`C1'`) is `CH2`. The methoxy group at C2' (product numbering) significantly raises the HOMO coefficient at the terminal `C1'`. The most favorable interaction is between the largest HOMO coefficient and the largest LUMO coefficient. This leads to the formation of bonds between:\n        `C1'` of the diene (`CH2`) and the α-carbon of the acrylate (`CH(CO2Et)`).\n        `C4'` of the diene (`C(Me,OMe)`) and the β-carbon of the acrylate (`CH2`).\n    *   This regioselectivity results in a cyclohexene product where the `CO2Et` group is at C5, and the geminal `Me`/`OMe` group is at C1 (using the numbering in the options). This corresponds to the structures C, D, G, and H. We can eliminate A, B, E, and F which show different regiochemistry.\n3.  **Stereochemistry (Endo Rule):** The question specifies that the reaction occurs in an `endo` fashion.\n    *   The `endo` rule states that in the transition state, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (here, `-CO2Et`) tucks under the π-system of the diene.\n    *   This orientation leads to a specific relative stereochemistry in the product. A key feature of the `endo` product is that the electron-withdrawing group (`-CO2Et`) ends up on the same side of the newly formed ring (i.e., `cis`) as the \"inner\" substituents of the diene (the substituents on C2 and C3 of the diene).\n    *   In our diene, the \"inner\" substituent is the hydrogen atom on C2 of the diene, which becomes C3 in the product ring.\n    *   Therefore, in the `endo` product, the `H` at C3 and the `-CO2Et` group at C5 should be `cis` to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the candidate products (C, D, G, H):\n        *   In **C** and **D**, the H at C3 is shown as a wedge, while the `-CO2Et` at C5 is a dash. They are **trans**. These represent the `exo` products.\n        *   In **G** and **H**, the H at C3 is shown as a wedge, and the `-CO2Et` at C5 is also a wedge. They are **cis**. These represent the `endo` products.\n4.  **Formation of Two Products:** The diene intermediate `(Me,OMe)C=C(OMe)-CH=CH2` contains a prochiral sp² carbon, `C(Me,OMe)`. The dienophile can approach this carbon from two different faces (the \"Me face\" or the \"OMe face\"). These two modes of attack are diastereomeric and lead to two different diastereomeric products. These products are epimeric at the newly formed C1 stereocenter. Products G and H are indeed epimers at C1 (Me and OMe groups are swapped) while having the same `endo` stereochemistry at C5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through an electrocyclic ring opening to form a diene, which then undergoes a regioselective and stereoselective Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The `endo` rule predicts the formation of products where the H at C3 and the `CO2Et` at C5 are cis. This condition is met by structures G and H. The formation of two products is explained by the two possible diastereomeric approaches of the dienophile to the prochiral diene, resulting in the epimers at C1.\n\nThus, the two products are G and H.\n\n<<<G and H>>>"
