    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total current flowing through the circuit. This means we need to find the total current supplied by the voltage source V2. This is calculated using Ohm's law, I_total = V_source / R_equivalent, where R_equivalent is the total equivalent resistance of the circuit as seen by the source.\n\n**2. Analyze the Circuit Diagram and Identify Key Nodes**\n*   **V2:** A 1V DC voltage source.\n*   **Top Rail (Node A):** Connected to the positive terminal of V2. Its potential is +1 V.\n*   **Bottom Rail (Ground, Node B):** Connected to the negative terminal of V2. Its potential is 0 V.\n*   **Resistors:** R1=3Ω, R2=7Ω, R3=9Ω, R7=100Ω, R8=100Ω.\n*   **Intermediate Nodes:**\n    *   Node C: The junction between R1 and R2.\n    *   Node D: The junction between R2 and R3.\n    *   Node E: The junction between R7 and R8.\n*   **Key Connections (these are crucial):**\n    *   A wire connects the Top Rail (Node A) to Node D.\n    *   A wire connects Node C to Node E.\n\n**3. Simplify the Circuit by Analyzing the Effect of the Wires**\n\n*   **Effect of the wire from Node A to Node D:**\n    *   This wire is an ideal conductor (0Ω resistance). It connects Node D directly to Node A.\n    *   Therefore, the potential at Node D is the same as Node A: V_D = V_A = +1 V.\n    *   Now consider the resistors R1 and R2. They form a series path between Node A (+1 V) and Node D (+1 V).\n    *   The voltage drop across the series combination of R1 and R2 is V_A - V_D = 1 V - 1 V = 0 V.\n    *   Since there is no voltage difference, no current flows through R1 and R2. (I_R1 = 0, I_R2 = 0). They are effectively short-circuited by this wire.\n\n*   **Effect of the wire from Node C to Node E:**\n    *   We know no current flows through R1. R1 is connected between Node A (+1 V) and Node C. With zero current, there is no voltage drop across R1.\n    *   This means the potential at Node C must be the same as the potential at Node A: V_C = V_A = +1 V.\n    *   The wire connects Node C to Node E, so Node E also must have the same potential: V_E = V_C = +1 V.\n\n*   **Analyze the state of the remaining resistors:**\n    *   **R8:** It is connected between Node A (+1 V) and Node E (+1 V). The voltage across R8 is V_A - V_E = 1 V - 1 V = 0 V. No current flows through R8. It is also short-circuited.\n    *   **R3:** It is connected between Node D (+1 V) and the Bottom Rail (Node B, 0 V). The voltage across R3 is V_D - V_B = 1 V - 0 V = 1 V.\n    *   **R7:** It is connected between Node E (+1 V) and the Bottom Rail (Node B, 0 V). The voltage across R7 is V_E - V_B = 1 V - 0 V = 1 V.\n\n**4. Formulate the Simplified Equivalent Circuit**\nThe complex wiring has simplified the circuit dramatically. Only R3 and R7 draw current. They are both connected directly across the 1V source. This means R3 and R7 are in parallel with each other.\n\n*   The simplified circuit consists of R3 in parallel with R7, connected to the 1V source.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Current**\nThe total current supplied by the source is the sum of the currents flowing through the parallel branches.\n\n*   **Current through R3 (I_R3):**\n    I_R3 = V / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω = 1/9 A\n\n*   **Current through R7 (I_R7):**\n    I_R7 = V / R7 = 1 V / 100 Ω = 1/100 A\n\n*   **Total Current (I_total):**\n    I_total = I_R3 + I_R7\n    I_total = (1/9) A + (1/100) A\n    I_total = (100/900) A + (9/900) A\n    I_total = 109/900 A\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nTo get a decimal value:\nI_total = 109 ÷ 900 A ≈ 0.12111... A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\n<<<0.121>>>"
