The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the fixed, unsymmetrical nature of the bicyclic münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. In this intermediate, the C2 position bears a methyl group and the C4 position is a methine carbon locked within a fused ring. These two positions are electronically and sterically distinct and cannot equilibrate. This inherent asymmetry directs the unsymmetrical alkyne (methyl propiolate) to add in a specific orientation, leading to a single product. In contrast, Reactions 1 and 2 show that the münchnone from acyclic N-acetyl-N-methylalanine undergoes a rapid equilibrium via a ketene intermediate. This equilibrium scrambles the positions of the two methyl groups at C2 and C4, making the dipole functionally symmetric. Therefore, the lack of possible equilibration in the rigid cyclic system of Reaction 3 is the reason for its high regioselectivity.
