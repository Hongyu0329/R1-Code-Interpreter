    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the plant in the image.**\n    The plant shown in the image is a shrub or vine with distinctive leaves. The leaves are a deep green color, elongated and ovate or lanceolate in shape. The most striking feature is the prominent network of pale, whitish, or light green veins that create a reticulated or mosaic-like pattern across the entire leaf surface. The leaves appear to be arranged in an opposite or whorled pattern along the stems. Some small, dark, bud-like structures are also visible near the leaf axils.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the plant.**\n    Based on the unique leaf venation, a search for plants with \"reticulated leaves\" or \"netted vein leaves\" can be performed. While several plants have reticulated veins (like *Fittonia* or some *Calathea*), the combination of this specific pattern on a woody shrub with this leaf shape is less common. A reverse image search or a more specific search for \"shrub with green leaves and white mosaic veins\" points to a few possibilities, including juvenile forms of some New Zealand plants like *Metrosideros perforata* or cultivars like *Parsonsia capsularis 'Marble Leaf'*. However, another very strong match, which is a naturally occurring species, is *Geniostoma petiolosum*.\n\n*   **Step 3: Investigate the candidates based on the question's requirement.**\n    The question specifically asks for the name of the island to which the plant was **endemic**. This implies we are looking for a species with a naturally restricted geographical distribution to a specific island, not a cultivar or a species found across a large mainland area.\n    *   *Metrosideros perforata* (white rata vine) is native to New Zealand, which consists of multiple islands, but it's not typically described as endemic to just one specific, smaller island in the way the term is often used for unique flora.\n    *   *Parsonsia capsularis 'Marble Leaf'* is a cultivar, meaning it was selected and propagated by humans for its appearance. It is not a naturally occurring endemic plant.\n    *   *Geniostoma petiolosum* is a species in the Loganiaceae family. Botanical sources confirm that this species, known for its distinctively veined leaves, is endemic to one specific location.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the endemic location of *Geniostoma petiolosum*.**\n    Researching the distribution of *Geniostoma petiolosum* confirms that it is a shrub found only on Lord Howe Island, a small volcanic island in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, it is endemic to Lord Howe Island.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Answer Formulation.**\n    The plant is identified as *Geniostoma petiolosum*. This plant is endemic to Lord Howe Island. The question asks for the name of the island.\n\n<<<Lord Howe Island>>>"
