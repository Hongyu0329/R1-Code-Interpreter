    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualizations.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum \"infinity-norm\" for the nine images provided. Each image is a visualization of a matrix of values (a Wigner 3-j symbol, or a related quantity).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Visualization and Infinity-Norm**\n*   **Visualization:** The images use a color map where red represents positive values, green represents negative values, and white represents zero. The saturation or intensity of the color corresponds to the magnitude (absolute value) of the number. A more intense (deeper red or green) color means a larger magnitude.\n*   **Infinity-Norm (or Max Norm):** For a matrix, the infinity-norm is the maximum absolute value of any of its elements. In this visual context, the infinity-norm of each of the nine plots corresponds to the most intense color (either red or green) present in that plot.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Plot with the Maximum Infinity-Norm (`N_max`)**\nWe need to scan all nine plots and find the one that contains the most intense, most saturated color.\n*   By visually comparing the nine plots, we can see that several plots contain very deep, saturated reds and greens.\n*   Plots 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9, in particular, appear to have pixels that reach the maximum saturation of the color map. For instance, the red squares in plot 3 and plot 9 are very bright and appear to be \"pure red\".\n*   Let's denote the value corresponding to this maximum intensity as `N_max`. We can set this value to an arbitrary unit of 1 for comparison.\n    *   `N_max = 1`\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Plot with the Minimum Infinity-Norm (`N_min`)**\nNext, we need to find the plot where the brightest color is the dullest compared to all the other plots.\n*   By visually inspecting all nine images, Plot 6 immediately stands out. All of its colors are very pale and \"washed out\".\n*   Compared to every other plot, the maximum color intensity in Plot 6 is clearly the lowest.\n*   Therefore, Plot 6 represents the minimum infinity-norm, `N_min`.\n\n**Step 5: Estimate the Ratio `N_max / N_min`**\nNow we need to estimate the ratio of the intensity of the color in the \"brightest\" plot to the intensity of the color in the \"dullest\" plot (Plot 6). This is a visual estimation task.\n\n*   Let the maximum saturation (in plots like 3 or 9) be an intensity of 1.\n*   Now, let's look at the pale red/green in Plot 6 and estimate its intensity as a fraction of the maximum.\n*   To make the estimation more reliable, we can use an intermediate plot for comparison. Let's look at Plot 2. The colors in Plot 2 are visibly less intense than in Plot 3, but much more intense than in Plot 6. The intensity of the brightest spots in Plot 2 appears to be roughly half that of Plot 3. So, `N(2) ≈ 0.5 * N_max`.\n*   Now, let's compare Plot 6 to Plot 2. The colors in Plot 6 are again noticeably paler. The intensity of the brightest spots in Plot 6 appears to be roughly half the intensity of the brightest spots in Plot 2. So, `N(6) ≈ 0.5 * N(2)`.\n*   Combining these observations: `N_min = N(6) ≈ 0.5 * N(2) ≈ 0.5 * (0.5 * N_max) = 0.25 * N_max`.\n*   With this estimation, we can calculate the ratio:\n    `Ratio = N_max / N_min ≈ N_max / (0.25 * N_max) = 1 / 0.25 = 4`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe infinity-norm is found by looking at the most saturated color in each plot. The maximum norm is found in several plots (e.g., 1, 3, 9). The minimum norm is clearly in Plot 6. By visually estimating the intensity of the colors, the maximum intensity in Plot 6 is approximately 1/4 of the overall maximum intensity found in the other plots. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
