**Product A: N-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)acetamide**
The structure consists of a 1-pyrroline ring (a five-membered ring with one C=N double bond) with an acetamide group (-NHCOCH₃) attached to the C2 carbon (the carbon of the C=N bond).

**Product B: Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one**
This is a bicyclic lactam. The structure consists of two five-membered rings fused together, sharing a nitrogen atom and an adjacent carbon. It has a ketone (C=O) group at position 3 of the bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton.

**Product C: N-acetyl-2-acetylpyrrolidine**
This structure has a five-membered saturated pyrrolidine ring. An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is attached to the nitrogen atom (N-acetyl), and another acetyl group is attached to the carbon at position 2 (2-acetyl).
