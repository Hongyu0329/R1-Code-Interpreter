    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine its author.\n\n**1. Artwork at Top-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts four cartoonish fish with human-like expressions, one of which is about to be hooked. The style is naive, childlike, and whimsical, with simple black outlines filled with watercolor-like washes of pink, red, and green. This highly distinctive style is the hallmark of **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄)**, a renowned Chinese cartoonist celebrated for his satirical and humorous works, especially his later pieces.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Liao Bingxiong.\n\n**2. Artwork at Top-Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (*guohua*) of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The brushwork for the stems and leaves is strong and calligraphic, while the flowers are rendered with fine, crisp lines. The composition, particularly the angular, solid form of the rock and the structured placement of the flowers, is characteristic of **Pan Tianshou (潘天寿)**, a modern master known for his unique compositions that blend strength and delicacy.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Pan Tianshou.\n\n**3. Artwork at Top-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic portrait of an elderly woman from the Yi ethnic group, captured with meticulous detail and a strong sense of character. The medium appears to be oil on canvas. This piece, titled \"Yi Nationality Woman,\" is a famous masterpiece of the Chinese Neoclassical painting movement. Its creator is **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a pivotal figure in modern Chinese oil painting, acclaimed for his classical technique and profound portraits.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Jin Shangyi.\n\n**4. Artwork at Middle-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic cursive script (*cǎoshū*). The characters flow with great energy, featuring long, exaggerated strokes and a distinctive rhythm. This style is famously associated with **Huang Tingjian (黄庭坚)**, one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Song Dynasty. This specific piece is a well-known excerpt from his \"Poem Scroll on a Pine Tree\" (《松风阁诗帖》).\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Huang Tingjian.\n\n**5. Artwork at Middle-Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a modern abstract painting featuring two large circles. The top red circle is textured, while the bottom orange one suggests a sun rising or setting over a stylized black-ink landscape. The artist's ability to abstract landscapes into geometric forms (lines, dots, circles) and blocks of color, blending Eastern ink aesthetics with Western modernism, is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. This is a classic example of his work.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Wu Guanzhong.\n\n**6. Artwork at Middle-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This shows a piece of calligraphy in an elegant, well-structured running-standard script (*xíngkǎishū*). The characters are fluid yet disciplined. Although the text discusses famous Tang steles, the calligraphic style itself—graceful, refined, and referencing classical models—is the unmistakable hand of **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**, the most influential calligrapher of the Yuan Dynasty.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Zhao Mengfu.\n\n**7. Artwork at Bottom-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and unrestrained example of \"wild cursive\" script (*kuángcǎo*). The characters are heavily linked, with strokes that appear almost untamed, yet form a cohesive and rhythmic whole. This masterpiece of cursive script is an excerpt from the \"Autobiography\" (《自叙帖》) by the Tang Dynasty monk **Huaisu (怀素)**, one of the two greatest masters of this style.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Huaisu.\n\n**8. Artwork at Bottom-Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another realistic oil portrait, this time of a young woman with a pensive expression, set against a dark, leafy background. The painting demonstrates exquisite technical skill in capturing light, texture, and emotion, which is typical of the Chinese Neoclassical movement. This famous work, often titled \"Youth,\" was painted by **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, a leading contemporary realist painter.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Yang Feiyun.\n\n**9. Artwork at Bottom-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a modern *gongbi* (fine-line) painting depicting a graceful woman in profile, dressed in ornate attire reminiscent of figures from the Silk Road. The style combines the meticulous line work of traditional *gongbi* with a modern sense of realism and subtle color washes. This aesthetic, focusing on beautiful female figures rendered with elegance and precision, is the signature style of **He Jiaying (何家英)**, a contemporary master of the genre.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is He Jiaying.\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Pan Tianshou, Jin Shangyi, Huang Tingjian, Wu Guanzhong, Zhao Mengfu, Huaisu, Yang Feiyun, He Jiaying>>>"
