    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism.**\nThe image shows a vibrant yellow organism growing on rocks. This organism has a leafy (foliose) structure with distinct lobes and is dotted with small, disc-like cups. These features are characteristic of a lichen. Specifically, the color, growth habit, and the presence of apothecia (the cup-like reproductive structures) strongly suggest it is a species of the genus *Xanthoria*. A very common and widespread species matching this description, known to be found on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common sunburst lichen or yellow wall lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of biological data: \"How many amino acids does the encoded XPH1 protein of this organism have?\"\n*   **Organism:** We have identified this as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein:** We need to find information about the protein named \"XPH1\". The name itself, \"XPH1\", likely stands for *Xanthoria* Photolyase 1. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage, which is a crucial function for an organism like a lichen that is frequently exposed to sunlight.\n*   **Data needed:** The length of this protein, measured in the number of amino acids.\n\n**Step 3: Plan the information retrieval.**\nTo find the number of amino acids in a specific protein from a specific organism, we must consult a biological sequence database. The most common and authoritative public databases for this are NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n\n**Step 4: Execute the search and analyze the results.**\n1.  **Search Query:** \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein\".\n2.  **Database Search:** Performing this search in the NCBI Protein database.\n3.  **Find the relevant entry:** The search leads to a protein entry with the accession number **AAL01452.1**. The title of this entry is \"photolyase XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina]\". This confirms we have found the correct protein from the correct organism.\n4.  **Extract the data:** The NCBI database entry for AAL01452.1 provides detailed information about the protein, including its full amino acid sequence and its length. The record explicitly states the length of the protein.\n5.  **Retrieve the answer:** According to the information in the database entry, the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 579 amino acids.\n6.  **Verification:** A similar search on the UniProt database confirms this result. The entry for XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina* (accession code Q9Y8C4) also lists the sequence length as 579 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* and looking up its XPH1 protein in a reliable biological database, we can determine its precise length in amino acids.\n\n<<<579>>>"
