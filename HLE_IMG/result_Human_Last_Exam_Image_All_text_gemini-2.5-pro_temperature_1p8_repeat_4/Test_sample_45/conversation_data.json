    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the given tiling. This means we need to find the highest order 'n' such that rotating the entire infinite pattern by 360/n degrees around some point leaves the pattern unchanged. Based on the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem for periodic tilings, 'n' can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Tiles and Pattern**\nThe tiling is composed of three distinct shapes with different colors:\n1.  **Blue hexagons:** These appear to be regular hexagons.\n2.  **Tan squares:** These appear to be squares.\n3.  **Orange rhombuses:** These are four-sided shapes with angles that are not 90 degrees.\n\nThe pattern is periodic and covers the entire plane. We need to find points in the pattern that can serve as centers of rotation.\n\n**Step 3: Test Potential Centers of Rotation**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The center of a blue hexagon.**\n    This is the most visually prominent candidate for a center of high symmetry. Let's analyze the arrangement of tiles surrounding a central blue hexagon. Let's refer to the tan squares as 'S' and the orange rhombuses as 'R'.\n    By carefully observing any hexagon in the pattern (for example, one that is oriented with flat top and bottom sides), we can identify the tiles that share a side with it. Starting from the top side and moving clockwise, the sequence of neighboring tiles is:\n    1.  Top: Square (S)\n    2.  Top-right: Rhombus (R)\n    3.  Bottom-right: Square (S)\n    4.  Bottom: Rhombus (R)\n    5.  Bottom-left: Square (S)\n    6.  Top-left: Rhombus (R)\n    The pattern of neighbors is therefore **(S, R, S, R, S, R)**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Rotational Symmetry at the Hexagon's Center**\n    Now, let's test different rotation orders based on the (S, R, S, R, S, R) pattern.\n    *   **6-fold rotation (60°):** A 60° rotation would move the Square (S) at position 1 to position 2. However, position 2 is occupied by a Rhombus (R). Since a square is not a rhombus, the pattern does not match. Therefore, the tiling does **not** have 6-fold rotational symmetry around the hexagon centers.\n    *   **3-fold rotation (120°):** A 120° rotation moves position 1 to position 3, position 2 to position 4, and so on. Let's check:\n        *   S at position 1 moves to S at position 3. (Match)\n        *   R at position 2 moves to R at position 4. (Match)\n        *   S at position 3 moves to S at position 5. (Match)\n        This pattern continues for the full rotation. The pattern is invariant under a 120° rotation. Therefore, the tiling **has** 3-fold rotational symmetry around the hexagon centers.\n    *   **2-fold rotation (180°):** A 180° rotation would move the Square (S) at position 1 to position 4. However, position 4 is occupied by a Rhombus (R). The pattern does not match. Therefore, the hexagon centers are not centers of 2-fold rotation.\n\n*   **Step 5: Test Other Potential Centers**\n    *   **Center of a tan square:** A square itself has 4-fold symmetry. Let's check the tiling. Looking at the corners of a square, two opposite corners connect to blue hexagons, and the other two opposite corners connect to orange rhombuses. A 90° (4-fold) rotation would map a hexagon corner onto a rhombus corner, so this fails. A 180° (2-fold) rotation maps hexagons to hexagons and rhombuses to rhombuses, so this works. The square centers are points of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Center of an orange rhombus:** By its nature, the center of a rhombus is a point of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Highest Order of Rotational Symmetry**\nWe have found points with 3-fold rotational symmetry (the hexagon centers) and points with 2-fold rotational symmetry (the square and rhombus centers). We have shown that there are no points of 6-fold or 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is therefore 3.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   The question is about the symmetry of the entire tiling, not just a single tile.\n*   The tiling is composed of three distinct shapes: hexagons, squares, and rhombuses. They are geometrically different.\n*   The analysis must be based on the provided image. While this pattern is similar to some well-known tilings that have 6-fold symmetry, the specific arrangement and choice of tiles in this image must be what is analyzed.\n*   The key is the alternating pattern of squares and rhombuses around the hexagons, which reduces the potential 6-fold symmetry to 3-fold.\n*   The rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the highest order of rotation found at any point in the pattern.\n\nThe analysis confirms 3-fold symmetry as the highest order.\n\n<<<3-fold>>>"
