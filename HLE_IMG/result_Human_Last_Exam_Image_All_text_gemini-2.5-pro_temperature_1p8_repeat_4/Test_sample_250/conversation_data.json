    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which corresponds to the key of A♭ major or F minor.\n*   The first chord shown is F- (F minor), which strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor. This is confirmed as the piece repeatedly resolves to F minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4 (common time), which is standard for many jazz tunes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression**\nThe overall form appears to be a 32-bar AABA structure. Let's break down the chords for each section.\n\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars):**\n    `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`\n    `| C7 | F- | 1. C7 | F- || 2. C7 |`\n    This opening progression is highly distinctive. The descending chromatic root movement from F down to E and then E♭ in the first three bars is a major clue. The E-7b5 (E half-diminished 7th) chord is a particularly unique choice following F minor.\n\n*   **B Section (Bridge - middle 8 bars):**\n    `| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |`\n    `| Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n    This bridge progression moves through a series of ii-V progressions or dominant 7th chords that are common in jazz standards (often called a \"cycle of fifths\" or \"cycle of dominants\" pattern). It ultimately sets up the return to the final A section.\n\n*   **Final A Section (Last 8 bars):**\n    `| F | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Db |`\n    `| G7 | C7 | F | % |`\n    This section is a restatement of the main A section theme and harmony, leading to the final resolution on F minor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The melody begins on C, the fifth of the F minor chord, and descends.\n*   In measure 2, the melody note is G, which fits within the E-7b5 chord (E-G-B♭-D).\n*   In measure 3, the melody note is C, which is the 6th in the Eb-6 chord (E♭-G-B♭-C).\n*   The melodic shape and rhythm are consistent with a well-known jazz melody. For instance, the pickup notes leading into the B section (D-7b5) and the melodic phrases over the cycling dominants in the bridge are very recognizable.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\nBased on the combination of the F minor key, the unique AABA form, and especially the characteristic descending chromatic chord progression in the A section (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 ...`), the piece can be identified. This progression is the signature harmonic fingerprint of the jazz standard **\"On a Misty Night\"**. The melody also perfectly matches known recordings and transcriptions of this tune.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n\"On a Misty Night\" is a renowned composition by the influential bebop-era pianist, composer, and arranger **Tadd Dameron**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Handwritten charts like this one can have slight variations from published versions (e.g., E♭-6 instead of E♭maj7), but the core harmonic function and melody remain the same.\n*   The G7 chord in the fourth bar of the A section is a tritone substitution for D♭7, creating a smooth chromatic descent (D♭ to C) to the C7 chord in the next bar.\n*   The progression in the bridge is a variation of the classic \"Rhythm Changes\" bridge, adapted for a minor key.\n\nFinal conclusion based on all analytical points:\n*   **Title:** On a Misty Night\n*   **Composer:** Tadd Dameron\n\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
