    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the main subject.**\n    The image features an insect as its central subject. The insect is positioned on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a natural, outdoor setting like a meadow or field.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the physical characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is primarily black and bright orange (or reddish-orange). The head appears to be black. The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is a vibrant orange. The legs and long antennae are black. The part of the winged body visible behind the pronotum is also orange.\n    *   **Body Structure:** The insect has the typical body plan of a \"true bug\" (Order Hemiptera), with a segmented body consisting of a head, thorax, and abdomen, as well as six legs and two antennae. Its mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, though not visible in detail.\n    *   **Size and Shape:** It is a medium-sized bug with a somewhat elongated, shield-like shape on its back.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the plant.**\n    The insect is on a plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This morphology is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in North America that blooms in late summer and fall. This provides context about the insect's habitat.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the observed features to identify the species.**\n    The specific combination of features – a black head, orange pronotum, black legs and antennae, and orange and black coloration on the wings/abdomen – is a hallmark of the Large Milkweed Bug. While primarily associated with milkweed plants, on which they feed and lay eggs, they can also be found on other flowering plants like goldenrod, especially during migration or when seeking nectar. Comparing the insect in the photo with reference images of the Large Milkweed Bug confirms the identification.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus*, and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
