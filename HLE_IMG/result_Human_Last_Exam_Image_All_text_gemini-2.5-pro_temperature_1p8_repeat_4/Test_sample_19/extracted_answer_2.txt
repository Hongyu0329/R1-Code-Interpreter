1. The music modulates to the key of E major.
2. The justification for this modulation is that E major is the relative major of the original key, C# minor. This is a very common modulation as the two keys share the same key signature and diatonic notes, allowing for a smooth transition.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11, analyzed in the new key of E major, is I 6/4.
