    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. We can identify three such centers in the given molecule. Let's number the carbons in the main backbone from left to right as C2, C3, and C4 for easier reference (based on the IUPAC name which would be 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol).\n\n*   **C2**: The carbon bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group and a methyl (-CH3) group.\n*   **C3**: The carbon bonded to the ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   **C4**: The carbon bonded to a methyl (-CH3) group and an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the groups attached to each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\nPriority is assigned based on the atomic number of the atoms directly attached to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\n**Analysis of C2:**\n*   Groups attached: -OH, -H (implied), -CH3 (from the leftmost methyl group), and the rest of the carbon chain (-C3...).\n*   Priority assignment:\n    1.  **-OH** (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n    2.  **-C3H(Et)(...)** (Carbon attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen)\n    3.  **-CH3** (Carbon attached to three hydrogens)\n    4.  **-H** (Hydrogen, atomic number 1)\n*   Stereochemistry determination:\n    *   The drawing shows the -OH group on a wedge (coming towards you) and the -CH3 group on a dash (going away from you). The C2-C3 bond and the implied C2-H bond are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we can orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) points away. Alternatively, a reliable method is to orient the molecule so we are looking down the bond from the chiral center to the lowest priority group.\n    *   Let's use a visualization technique: Look along the H-C2 bond, so that the H atom is closest to you. In this view, the other three groups (1, 2, 3) will form a clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) pattern. Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, the configuration is the *opposite* of the observed direction.\n    *   Viewing along H-C2: -OH (1) is up (from the wedge), -C3 (2) is to the upper right (in the plane), and -CH3 (3) is down (from the dash).\n    *   The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is **clockwise (R)**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **S**.\n\n**Analysis of C3:**\n*   Groups attached: -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H (implied), the C2-side of the chain, and the C4-side of the chain.\n*   Priority assignment:\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH3** (C2-side, carbon bonded to O, C, H)\n    2.  **-CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)** (C4-side, carbon bonded to C, C, H; but the next atoms are C, N vs C,O. C2-side wins as O>N). No, wait. For C4-side vs Ethyl: C4's carbon is bonded to C(CH3) and C(CH2NH2). Ethyl's carbon is bonded to C(CH3) and H. So C4-side > Ethyl. Correct priority: C2-group > C4-group > Ethyl group.\n    3.  **-CH2CH3** (Ethyl group, carbon bonded to C, H, H)\n    4.  **-H**\n*   Stereochemistry determination:\n    *   The drawing shows the ethyl group on a wedge. In this standard representation for a zigzag chain, the implied -H atom is on a dash (pointing away).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away, the configuration is determined directly from the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Position of groups: -C2 group (1) is down-left, -C4 group (2) is down-right, and -Ethyl group (3) is up-right.\n    *   The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 follows a path from down-left -> down-right -> up-right. This is a **counter-clockwise (S)** direction.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **S**.\n\n**Analysis of C4:**\n*   Groups attached: -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H (implied), and the C3-side of the chain.\n*   Priority assignment:\n    1.  **-CH2NH2** (The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen, atomic number 7)\n    2.  **-CH(Et)(...)** (C3-side, the carbon is bonded to other carbons)\n    3.  **-CH3** (The carbon is bonded only to hydrogens)\n    4.  **-H**\n*   Stereochemistry determination:\n    *   The drawing shows the -CH2NH2 group on a wedge and the -CH3 group on a dash. The C4-C3 bond and the implied C4-H bond are in the plane.\n    *   We use the same visualization technique as for C2. Look along the H-C4 bond with H closest to the viewer.\n    *   Viewing along H-C4: -CH2NH2 (1) is up (from the wedge), -C3 group (2) is to the left (in the plane), and -CH3 (3) is down (from the dash).\n    *   The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is **counter-clockwise (S)**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **R**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are:\n*   C2 is S\n*   C3 is S\n*   C4 is R\n\nThe full stereochemical name would start with (2S, 3S, 4R)-...\n\n<<<2S, 3S, 4R>>>"
