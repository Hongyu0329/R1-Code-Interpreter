The main difference is the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an upright position among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctively long and strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or bent over. This difference in seta shape and capsule orientation is the most reliable feature to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are producing sporophytes.
