    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the key terms.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the **sporophyte** that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* \"at a glance\". The sporophyte in mosses is the diploid generation that produces spores, typically consisting of a foot, a **seta** (stalk), and a **capsule** (where spores are made). The key is to find a visually obvious feature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   The image provided shows *Grimmia montana*.\n*   Observing the image and referencing botanical descriptions, we can note the sporophyte's features. The capsules are ovoid to subglobose (egg-shaped to almost spherical).\n*   Crucially, these capsules are either **immersed** (sitting down within the leaves) or **emergent** (peeking just above the leaves).\n*   This position is due to the **seta**, which is very **short and straight**. The capsule is held upright on this short, straight stalk.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   The specific epithet, or species name, *curviseta*, provides a major clue. In Latin, *curvi* means \"curved\" and *seta* refers to the stalk.\n*   Botanical descriptions of *Grimmia curviseta* confirm that its most defining feature is its **strongly curved or hooked (arcuate) seta**.\n*   This curved seta causes the capsule to be bent over, often described as **cernuous (nodding)** or even pendent (hanging down). The capsule is typically found nestled alongside the leafy stem rather than sitting on top of it.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two species to find the main distinguishing feature.**\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an **upright capsule** that is immersed or emergent among the leaves.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Has a **long, strongly curved seta**, resulting in a **nodding or hanging capsule** that is bent to the side of the stem.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion on the \"at a glance\" difference.**\nThe most striking and immediately obvious difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the shape of the seta and the resulting orientation of the capsule. One can instantly distinguish *G. curviseta* by its characteristic hooked seta and nodding capsule, whereas *G. montana* has a short, straight seta with an upright capsule.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an upright position among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctively long and strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or bent over. This difference in seta shape and capsule orientation is the most reliable feature to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are producing sporophytes."
