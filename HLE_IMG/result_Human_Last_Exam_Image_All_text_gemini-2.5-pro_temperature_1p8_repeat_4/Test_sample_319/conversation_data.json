    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots representing a sound.\n    *   **The top plot is a spectrogram.** This visualizes the sound's frequency content over time. We can see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this tone is interrupted. At the point of interruption, there is a vertical band, which represents a short burst of noise containing a wide range of frequencies. After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes. Critically, the spectrogram shows that the tone is *physically absent* during the noise burst.\n    *   **The bottom plot is a waveform.** This shows the amplitude of the sound signal over time. It starts as a simple, regular sine wave (representing the pure tone). Then, the waveform becomes complex and noisy (representing the noise burst). Afterward, it seems to continue. This visualizes the composite sound signal that would be played.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The question provides several key clues:\n    *   It describes an \"illusion.\"\n    *   It draws an analogy to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived in two different stable 3D orientations, and our perception flips between them. This suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain settling on one of two possible interpretations of an ambiguous stimulus.\n    *   It highlights a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's a fundamental process of our brain that happens automatically.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Interpret:**\n    *   When a person listens to the sound depicted in the image, the physical reality is a tone, followed by noise, followed by the tone again.\n    *   However, the perceptual experience—the illusion—is that the tone continues uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain perceives the noise as merely masking the continuous tone.\n    *   This is the ambiguity mentioned: Did the tone stop, or was it just covered up? The brain chooses the latter, more plausible interpretation based on real-world experience (sounds are often masked by other sounds).\n    *   This \"filling in\" of the missing sound is the \"unconscious perceptual ability.\" We are not aware that our brain is actively constructing the perception of a continuous tone. We just hear it that way.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:** This auditory illusion is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.\n    *   The most famous version of this illusion was discovered and named by Richard M. Warren in 1970. In his experiments, he took a recorded sentence and replaced one of the speech sounds (a phoneme) with a non-speech sound, like a cough or a burst of static.\n    *   Listeners reported hearing the speech sound as if it were there, seamlessly integrated into the sentence. They perceived the sentence as whole and the cough as a separate, overlapping event.\n    *   He named this phenomenon the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Although the image uses a simple tone instead of a speech sound, it demonstrates the exact same principle of perceptual completion that defines the Phonemic Restoration Effect. This effect is a primary example of top-down processing in perception, where the brain uses context and expectations to fill in missing sensory information. It is the classic name for this specific type of auditory illusion.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
