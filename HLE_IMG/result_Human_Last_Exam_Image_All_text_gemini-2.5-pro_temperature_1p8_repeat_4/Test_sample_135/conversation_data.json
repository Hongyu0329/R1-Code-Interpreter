    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the image.**\n*   **Subject Matter:** The image shows a religious scene. A priest, standing on the left by an altar with a candle, is administering a wafer (the Host) to a kneeling figure. Other figures are kneeling and praying, receiving or awaiting the sacrament. This depicts the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion or the Sacrament of the Altar.\n*   **Medium and Style:** The artwork is a bas-relief sculpture. The material appears to be terracotta or marble, sculpted in a circular format called a roundel or tondo. The style of the figures—with their flowing drapery, gentle poses, and classical features—is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century.\n*   **Frame:** The roundel is set within an elaborate frame, featuring an egg-and-dart molding on the inner border and decorative floral or fruit motifs (a garland) on the outer part. This type of glazed terracotta relief with decorative garlands is a signature style of a specific workshop.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a small plaque (cartouche) with an inscription. The visible text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be interpreted as an archaic form of Italian/French meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which confirms the subject matter is the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the analysis.**\n*   The combination of the medium (glazed terracotta relief), the subject matter (a religious scene), the decorative garland frame, and the 15th-century Florentine style strongly points to the workshop of the Della Robbia family. Luca della Robbia pioneered this technique, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, continued and expanded the workshop's production.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the hypothesis through research.**\n*   A search for \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar relief\" or \"Della Robbia Eucharist\" is a logical next step.\n*   This search leads to the \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" located in the Church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Castelfranco di Sopra, Italy.\n*   This altarpiece is a well-documented work attributed to **Andrea della Robbia**, created around 1490.\n*   The altarpiece consists of seven roundels depicting the seven sacraments, surrounding a central statue.\n*   Comparing the provided image with the roundel depicting the Eucharist (\"Sacramento dell'Eucaristia\") from this specific altarpiece confirms a perfect match. The composition, the figures, the frame, and the unique inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" are all identical to the detail from Andrea della Robbia's work.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the author.**\n*   The artwork in the image is a detail—the roundel of the Eucharist—from the Altarpiece of the Sacraments.\n*   The creator of this altarpiece is established by art historians as the Florentine sculptor Andrea della Robbia.\n\nTherefore, the author of this detail of the Altarpiece is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
