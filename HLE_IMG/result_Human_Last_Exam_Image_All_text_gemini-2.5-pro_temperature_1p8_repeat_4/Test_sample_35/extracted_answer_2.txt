The protein S100B shows strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. Based on the provided pathway, S100B would be more valuable as a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker. This is because it is an upstream initiator of a cascade that directly leads to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, which are the determinants of disease progression and severity. Consequently, measuring the levels of S100B can predict the future course and outcome of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
