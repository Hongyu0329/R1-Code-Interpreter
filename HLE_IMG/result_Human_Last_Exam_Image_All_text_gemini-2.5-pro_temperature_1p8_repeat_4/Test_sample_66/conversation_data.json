    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the geometric construction and given information.**\nThe image displays a circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex (let's call it O). Several geometric properties and lengths are provided:\n1.  The radius of the circle is given as 34. This is the length of the radial lines from the center O to the arc.\n2.  There is a segment of length 17.\n3.  There are right angle symbols, indicating perpendicular lines. Specifically, a radius is perpendicular to the segment of length 17. Let's call the leftmost point on the arc P_L and the rightmost point P_R. The overall shaded shape is bounded by the arc P_L P_R and two straight line segments meeting at a vertex V. The right angle symbol at P_L indicates that the line segment VP_L is tangent to the circle at P_L. The length of this tangent segment VP_L is given as 17.\n4.  The figure is symmetric. The same construction applies to the right side, so VP_R is a tangent of length 17 at point P_R.\n5.  The total angle of the sector, ∠P_L O P_R, is divided into four equal angles, each denoted by θ.\n6.  There is a right angle symbol at the center O, which suggests the total angle of the sector is 90°.\n\n**Step 2: Resolve the contradiction in the given information.**\nLet's analyze the triangle formed by the center O, the tangent point P_L, and the vertex V. This is a right-angled triangle (ΔOP_L V) with the right angle at P_L.\n- The length of the radius is OP_L = 34.\n- The length of the tangent is VP_L = 17.\n\nWe can find the angle ∠P_L O V using trigonometry:\ntan(∠P_L O V) = Opposite / Adjacent = VP_L / OP_L = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\nFrom the diagram, the angle ∠P_L O V corresponds to two of the θ angles. So, ∠P_L O V = 2θ.\nThis means tan(2θ) = 1/2.\nThe total angle of the sector is ∠P_L O P_R = 4θ.\n\nNow, let's check for consistency. The symbol at O indicates ∠P_L O P_R = 90°, which would mean 4θ = 90°, so 2θ = 45°.\nIf 2θ were 45°, then tan(2θ) = tan(45°) = 1. This would imply VP_L / OP_L = 1, so VP_L = OP_L = 34. This contradicts the given length of 17 for the tangent segment.\n\nTherefore, the diagram contains contradictory information. In such cases, the explicit numerical values and detailed geometric constructions (like the right-angled triangle) are usually intended to be the primary data, while the overall angle symbol might be schematic or erroneous. We will proceed by ignoring the 90° symbol at the center O and use the angle derived from the triangle's dimensions.\nSo, we have tan(2θ) = 1/2.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a plan to calculate the total shaded area.**\nThe total shaded area is the region enclosed by the two tangents VP_L and VP_R and the circular arc P_L P_R. This area can be calculated by decomposing it into simpler shapes. A convenient way is:\nTotal Area = Area of the triangle ΔVP_L P_R + Area of the circular segment between the chord P_L P_R and the arc P_L P_R.\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formula is:\nTotal Area = Area(Kite OP_L V P_R) + Area(Sector OP_L P_R) - 2 * Area(Triangle OP_L P_R).\n\nWe will calculate the necessary components for this formula.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the areas of the component shapes.**\nWe need to find the area of the kite OP_L V P_R and the area of the triangle ΔOP_L P_R.\n\n*   **Area of the kite OP_L V P_R:**\n    The kite consists of two congruent right-angled triangles, ΔOP_L V and ΔOP_R V.\n    Area(ΔOP_L V) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OP_L * VP_L = (1/2) * 34 * 17 = 289.\n    Area(Kite OP_L V P_R) = 2 * Area(ΔOP_L V) = 2 * 289 = 578.\n\n*   **Area of the triangle ΔOP_L P_R:**\n    Area(ΔOP_L P_R) = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C) = (1/2) * OP_L * OP_R * sin(∠P_L O P_R).\n    OP_L = OP_R = 34 (radius).\n    The angle is ∠P_L O P_R = 4θ. We need sin(4θ).\n    We know tan(2θ) = 1/2. We can use the double angle identity for sine: sin(4θ) = 2sin(2θ)cos(2θ).\n    From tan(2θ) = 1/2, we can construct a right triangle with opposite=1, adjacent=2, and hypotenuse=√(1² + 2²) = √5.\n    So, sin(2θ) = 1/√5 and cos(2θ) = 2/√5.\n    sin(4θ) = 2 * (1/√5) * (2/√5) = 4/5.\n    Area(ΔOP_L P_R) = (1/2) * 34 * 34 * (4/5) = (1/2) * 1156 * (4/5) = 578 * (4/5) = 2312/5 = 462.4.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total shaded area.**\nNow we use the decomposition: Shaded Area = Area(Triangle on top of chord) + Area(Circular segment).\nArea(Triangle VP_L P_R) = Area(Kite OP_L V P_R) - Area(Triangle OP_L P_R)\nArea(Triangle VP_L P_R) = 578 - 462.4 = 115.6.\n\nTo find the area of the segment, we first need the area of the sector.\nArea(Sector OP_L P_R) = (1/2) * R² * (angle in radians) = (1/2) * 34² * (4θ).\nWe have 2θ = arctan(1/2), so 4θ = 2 * arctan(1/2).\nArea(Sector OP_L P_R) = (1/2) * 1156 * (2 * arctan(1/2)) = 1156 * arctan(0.5).\nUsing a calculator, arctan(0.5) ≈ 0.4636476.\nArea(Sector) ≈ 1156 * 0.4636476 ≈ 535.976.\n\nArea(Circular Segment) = Area(Sector OP_L P_R) - Area(Triangle OP_L P_R)\nArea(Circular Segment) ≈ 535.976 - 462.4 = 73.576.\n\nTotal Shaded Area = Area(Triangle VP_L P_R) + Area(Circular Segment)\nTotal Shaded Area ≈ 115.6 + 73.576 = 189.176.\n\nLet's re-calculate using the other formula for verification:\nTotal Area = Area(Kite) + Area(Sector) - 2 * Area(Triangle)\nTotal Area ≈ 578 + 535.976 - 2 * 462.4 = 578 + 535.976 - 924.8 = 1113.976 - 924.8 = 189.176.\nThe results from both decomposition methods match.\n\nFinal calculation using exact forms where possible:\nTotal Area = 115.6 + (1156 * arctan(0.5) - 462.4)\n= 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8\nTotal Area = (578/5) + (1156 * arctan(0.5) - 2312/5)\n= 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 1734/5\n\nLet's look closely at the numbers again. It is possible the final answer is simple.\nArea of triangle on top of the chord is 578/5 = 115.6.\nArea of ΔOP_LP_R is 2312/5 = 462.4.\nLet's re-evaluate the premise. Is there any way the \"overlap\" mentioned is important? What if the total area is simply the area of the two main triangles minus the area of the full sector with angle 4*theta? Area = 2 * 289 - Area(sector) = 578 - Area(Sector). That gives ~42, but we found this logic to be flawed.\n\nGiven the standard interpretations of geometry problems, the most likely solution path is the one followed. The non-integer result suggests a possible typo in the problem's numbers but working with the numbers as given leads to a specific result.\n\nLet's look for a simpler object to calculate. Area of the pure blue region plus pure red region?\nThat's (Area(Total)) - (Area(Overlap)). The overlapping region seems to be the area above the arc between angles -θ and θ.\nThis path becomes very complex. The most straightforward approach is to calculate the area of the union of the regions directly.\n\nThe total area is the area of the shape enclosed by the tangents VP_L, VP_R and the arc P_L P_R.\nThe most solid calculation is Total Area = Area(ΔVP_LP_R) + Area(Segment P_LP_R).\nArea = 115.6 + (1156 * arctan(0.5) - 462.4) = 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8 ≈ 189.18.\n\nThere might be a trick. Let's reconsider the numbers.\nPerhaps the area is simply Area(Kite) - Area(ΔOP_LP_R)*2? No.\nMaybe the question implies something very simple that gets cancelled out.\nThe quantity `578 - 462.4 = 115.6` is just the top triangular area. The picture definitely shades below the chord P_LP_R.\nIt is unusual, but the derived answer is the only one consistent with the geometric figure's labels, disregarding the conflicting 90-degree central angle.\nLet's check the case where the problem has a typo and 4θ=60°, so 2θ=30°. tan(30°)=1/√3.\nThen tangent length should be 34/√3, not 17.\nIf tangent=17, R would have to be 17√3. Not 34.\nThe numbers 17 and 34 strongly suggest a 30-60-90 triangle, but not in the tangent interpretation. The interpretation where OCP is a right triangle with hyp=OP=34 and leg=CP=17 implies angle POC=30. If this is the intended setup, then 2θ=30 and the entire sector is 60°. The shaded area would be a complex shape, not clearly defined.\nThe tangent interpretation is the most natural fit for the diagram.\n\nFinal check on the calculation: 1156*arctan(0.5)-346.8 ≈ 189.176. It seems correct based on the most plausible interpretation. Let's re-examine if there's any simple relationship.\nArea = 578 * (2arctan(0.5) - 3/5). Let α = arctan(0.5). So tan(α)=0.5. Total angle is 2α. Area = 578 * (2α - sin(2α) * cos(α)/sin(α)).\nLet's try a different composition. Shaded area is 2*(Area of right half) - Area of overlap. That doesn't seem easier.\n\nI'm confident in the mathematical derivation `Area = 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8`. There is no obvious simplification. This might be a problem that requires a numerical answer.\nLet's calculate the values once more carefully.\nA = 578 + 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 2 * 462.4 = 578 + 535.9766... - 924.8 = 189.1766...\nPerhaps there is an error in my arithmetic.\n2 * 462.4 = 924.8.\n578 - 924.8 = -346.8.\n535.9766 - 346.8 = 189.1766.\nIt seems right. No way around it.\n\nFinal Answer will be the calculated numeric value, rounded. I'll provide it to two decimal places.\n\nTotal Area = 189.18\n\nFinal answer is a numerical value.\nLet me double-check my understanding of the problem. Find the total area of the shaded regions. Total implies the union. The note on overlapping is a hint.\nSo Area(Blue U Red).\nMy whole analysis points to this interpretation and calculation.\n\nFinal verification:\nLet's assume there is a typo in '17' and it should have been 34*tan(22.5) = 34*(sqrt(2)-1) ~ 14.07. Then 4theta=90 is consistent. Area would be A_K + A_Sect - 2*A_delta. A_K= 2*(1/2*34*14.07)=478.38. A_sect = 1/2*34^2*pi/2 = 289pi~907.9. A_delta=1/2*34^2*sin(90)=578. A = 478.38 + 907.9 - 2*578 = 328.28.\nLet's assume there is a typo in R, R=17. Then 2theta=45. R is given as 34.\n\nFinal check. Area is Kite-Sector = V-PL-arc-PR-V ? Let me draw. OPLVPR - OPLarcPR. Yes, this subtraction leaves the area bounded by the tangents and the chord PLPR and the area between chord and arc, but negatively signed. So this is WRONG. The formula must be A_Kite+A_Sector-2*A_triangle.\nI was right to correct myself. The value is ~189.18.\n\nThe total area is 289. Let's see if this could be the case. 1156*arctan(0.5) - 346.8 = 289 -> 1156*arctan(0.5)=635.8 -> arctan(0.5)=0.55. False.\nArea is 578? No.\nMaybe the question is \"What is the area of the kite?\" That would be 578. The shaded area is clearly smaller.\nMaybe the area of the top triangle? 115.6. The area is clearly larger.\n\nI have no choice but to trust the calculation.\n\n<<<189.18>>>"
