    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) specifically for cars when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**2. Define VMT Calculation**\nVMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) is the total mileage driven by vehicles. It is calculated by multiplying the number of vehicle trips by the average distance of those trips. The calculation must be done for each distance category and then summed up to get the total VMT, as the mode share of cars varies by trip distance.\n\n*   The formula for total VMT can be expressed as a weighted sum over the different distance categories:\n    `Total VMT = Σ [ (Total Trips × Share of Trips in Category_i) × (Car Mode Share in Category_i) × (Average Distance in Category_i) ]`\n*   Since we are calculating a percentage reduction, we can assume a total of 100 trips for simplicity. This makes the `Share of Total Trips` percentages equivalent to the number of trips in that category. The total number of trips will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n*   For car VMT, we must sum the mode shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" as both represent a single vehicle trip. The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not relevant for VMT calculation (it would be for Person Miles Traveled, PMT).\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question is about Vehicle Miles (VMT), not Person Miles (PMT). Therefore, both single-occupant car trips and carpool trips count as one vehicle trip each.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** A simple average will not work. We must perform a weighted calculation for each distance category (stratum) because car usage is not uniform across different trip lengths. Longer trips have a larger impact on total VMT.\n*   **Data Aggregation:** For each distance category, the total car mode share is the sum of the mode shares for `car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Total VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe'll calculate a \"VMT Index\" based on 100 total trips.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT = (48% of total trips) × (1 mile/trip) × 53% = 0.48 × 1 × 0.53 = **0.2544**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT = (22% of total trips) × (4 miles/trip) × 81% = 0.22 × 4 × 0.81 = **0.7128**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT = (14% of total trips) × (7.5 miles/trip) × 85% = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.85 = **0.8925**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT = (16% of total trips) × (20 miles/trip) × 89% = 0.16 × 20 × 0.89 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Total VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT = 0.48 × 1 × 0.03 = **0.0144**\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT = 0.22 × 4 × 0.27 = **0.2376**\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.41 = **0.4305**\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT = 0.16 × 20 × 0.49 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed\n    `Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100%\n    `% Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
