    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the painting fragment.**\n*   **Subject:** The central object is a traditional post windmill. Its sails appear partially tattered or skeletal.\n*   **Setting:** It's a landscape scene. To the left, there's a patch of blue sky, but most of the sky is filled with dark, dramatic, stormy clouds. Below the windmill, there is foliage and the suggestion of a path or hill.\n*   **Action/Event:** In the background, to the right, there is a visible fire. Flames and smoke can be seen rising from what appears to be a building or group of buildings.\n*   **Mood and Style:** The overall atmosphere is dramatic, chaotic, and somber. The strong contrast between light (the fire, the patch of blue sky) and dark (the storm clouds, the shadowed landscape) is a technique known as chiaroscuro. This dramatic style is characteristic of the Romanticism art movement.\n\n**Step 2: Use the provided information to narrow down the search.**\n*   **Time Period:** The question specifies the painting is from the **19th century** (1801-1900). This aligns perfectly with the Romantic movement, which flourished in the first half of the 19th century.\n*   **Key Search Terms:** Based on the analysis, key search terms would be \"painting\", \"windmill\", \"fire\", \"stormy sky\", and \"19th century Romanticism\".\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize the artist and painting.**\n*   The dramatic rendering of clouds, fire, and light is a hallmark of the Russian-Armenian painter **Ivan Aivazovsky** (1817-1900), a leading master of 19th-century Romanticism. Although he is most famous for his seascapes, his style is unmistakable in this landscape.\n*   A search for \"Aivazovsky windmill painting\" or combining the key search terms from Step 2 with his name leads directly to the artwork in question.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the identity and title of the painting.**\n*   The painting is indeed by Ivan Aivazovsky.\n*   It was painted in **1837**.\n*   The established title is **\"Windmill on the Sea Coast\"**. Sometimes it is also referred to as \"The Windmill by the Sea\" or similar variations in translation. The image provided is a fragment, but it clearly shows the core elements of this specific work.\n\nBy combining visual analysis with the historical context provided, we can confidently identify the artwork.\n\n<<<Windmill on the Sea Coast>>>"
