    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The provided image is a line drawing of an early cuneiform sign. Its form is pictographic, meaning it visually resembles the object it represents. The sign clearly depicts a building with a base, walls, and a distinct roof structure.\n2.  **Identify the cuneiform sign:** This specific sign is the Sumerian logogram Ã‰.GAL (also written E2.GAL). It is a compound sign.\n3.  **Break down the components:**\n    *   The first part, **Ã‰**, is the basic Sumerian word for \"house,\" \"temple,\" or \"building.\" The rectangular base represents the plan of a house.\n    *   The second part, **GAL**, means \"great\" or \"large.\"\n    *   Together, **Ã‰.GAL** literally translates to \"great house.\"\n4.  **Determine the specific meaning:** In ancient Mesopotamia, a \"great house\" was a palace, the administrative and residential center for a ruler or king. The form shown in the image is characteristic of the Early Dynastic Period of Sumer, which falls within the third millennium BC.\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   **A. Tool:** The sign does not depict a tool. Incorrect.\n    *   **B. Guard:** A guard is a person who would be at a palace, but the sign represents the building itself. Incorrect.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The cuneiform sign for bread (NINDA) looks completely different, typically like a bowl or a round loaf. Incorrect.\n    *   **D. Home:** The sign Ã‰.GAL means \"palace\" or \"great house.\" A palace is a type of grand home or dwelling. The fundamental component Ã‰ means \"house\" or \"home.\" This option is a very good fit.\n    *   **E. Deity:** The cuneiform determinative and logogram for a deity (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­). Incorrect.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for beard (SU) is different. While the concept of \"greatness\" (GAL) might have pictographic origins related to a man with a beard, this complete sign clearly represents a building. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe cuneiform sign is Ã‰.GAL, meaning \"great house\" or \"palace.\" Among the given choices, \"Home\" is the most accurate description of what this sign represents, as a palace is a type of home.\n\n<<<D>>>"
