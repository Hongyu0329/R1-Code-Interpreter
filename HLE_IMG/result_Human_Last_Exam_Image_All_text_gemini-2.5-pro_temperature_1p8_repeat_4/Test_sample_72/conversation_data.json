    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactants and reaction conditions.**\n    *   The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (represented as a four-membered ring with a double bond). Although the drawing of cyclobutene is slightly ambiguous, it is the most logical reactant besides hexafluorobenzene.\n    *   The reaction condition is photochemical, indicated by \"hv\" over the reaction arrow. This means we must consider pericyclic reactions that are allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n    *   The question states that *two* photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. This suggests a multi-step transformation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Consider plausible photochemical pericyclic reactions for the reactants.**\n    *   **Hexafluorobenzene:** Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo several photochemical valence isomerizations. A key one is the conversion to \"Dewar benzene\" (a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This involves the formation of a new sigma bond between two non-adjacent carbons. It can be viewed as a formal [4π] electrocyclic reaction of a buta-1,3-diene fragment within the benzene ring. Under photochemical conditions, a 4π electrocyclization is disrotatory and is an allowed process.\n    *   **Cyclobutene:** This molecule has a 4π electron system (considering the 2π electrons of the double bond and the 2σ electrons of the strained C-C bond opposite to it). Under photochemical conditions, it can undergo a [4π] electrocyclic ring-opening reaction to form 1,3-butadiene. This is a conrotatory process under photochemical conditions and is allowed.\n    *   **Cycloaddition reactions:** The reactants can also directly react with each other in a photocycloaddition. The most common photocycloaddition is the [2π+2π] cycloaddition between two double bonds (alkene units) to form a four-membered ring. This is allowed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner under photochemical conditions. A [4π+2π] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) is typically thermal, and photochemically forbidden (for supra-supra). A [4π+4π] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formulate possible reaction sequences involving two photochemical pericyclic reactions.**\n    There are a few plausible sequences. Let's analyze one of the most likely pathways, which leads to a product whose skeleton resembles the drawing.\n\n    *   **Pathway Proposal:**\n        1.  **Reaction 1: [2π+2π] Photocycloaddition.** The double bond of cyclobutene adds across two adjacent carbons (a C=C bond) of the hexafluorobenzene ring. This is a photochemically allowed [π²s + π²s] cycloaddition. This type of reaction is known to occur between alkenes and benzene derivatives, especially electron-deficient ones like hexafluorobenzene. The product is a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative. This intermediate has a cyclobutane ring fused to a six-membered ring which contains a conjugated diene system (4π electrons).\n\n        2.  **Reaction 2: [4π] Electrocyclic Reaction.** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a conjugated 1,3-diene within a six-membered ring (specifically, a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety). This 4π electron system can undergo a photochemical electrocyclic ring closure. This is a conrotatory reaction (photochemically allowed) that forms a new sigma bond and creates a new four-membered ring. The overall product becomes a tricyclic system (three fused four-membered rings), which corresponds to the general structure depicted in the problem.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the types of pericyclic reactions.**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the plausible pathway, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\n        1.  A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n        2.  A **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Verify the answer.**\n    *   Both proposed reactions are well-known photochemical pericyclic reactions. They are allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical conditions. An alternative pathway starting with the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar isomer ([4π] electrocyclization) followed by a [2π+2π] cycloaddition with cyclobutene is also chemically plausible. Notice that this alternative pathway also involves the same two types of reactions: a [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. Since the question asks for the *kinds* of reactions involved, and both primary plausible pathways utilize these two types, this answer is robust.\n\nTherefore, the transformation involves a [2π+2π] cycloaddition and a [4π] electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2π+2π] cycloaddition and [4π] electrocyclic reaction>>>"
