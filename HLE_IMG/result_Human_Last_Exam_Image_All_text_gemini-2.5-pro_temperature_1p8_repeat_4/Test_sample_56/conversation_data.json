    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Style and Subject Matter of the Painting**\nThe painting depicts an interior room that is paradoxically open to several different and incompatible exterior worlds. This is a classic characteristic of Surrealism or Magic Realism. The style is highly detailed and realistic in its execution, but the subject matter is fantastical and dream-like.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Elements in the Painting**\nSeveral distinct and memorable elements are present:\n*   An interior room with wooden floors, a fireplace, and a bookshelf.\n*   The left wall is missing, revealing a landscape with a large bare tree, a wall of ice, and a hot air balloon.\n*   A doorway on the right opens to an ocean with a steamship, and the water flows into the room.\n*   Another doorway shows a city scene at dusk.\n*   In the foreground, a fire in the fireplace is burning books, with more books scattered on the floor.\n*   Two female figures are present, one standing and one sitting, interacting with the books.\n*   Other details include a framed picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a mirror reflecting a blue sky, and a bust with leaves for hair.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Style and Elements to a Specific Artist**\nThe unique combination of a highly detailed, realistic technique with the concept of a single space containing multiple, contradictory worlds is a signature style. This specific approach of \"four-sided paintings,\" where different views from a central room reveal different realities, is strongly characteristic of the Polish surrealist painter Jacek Yerka. His work is famous for blending everyday objects and spaces with fantastical, meticulously rendered landscapes.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Painting and Artist**\nA search for the painting using descriptive terms like \"surreal painting room ocean fire books\" or performing a reverse image search confirms the artist. The painting is indeed a well-known work by Jacek Yerka. The Polish title is \"Korepetycje,\" which translates to \"Private Lessons\" or \"Tutoring.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Artist's Name**\nBased on the distinctive style, recurring themes, and specific elements, the artist is definitively identified as Jacek Yerka.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
