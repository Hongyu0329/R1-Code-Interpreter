    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$, which forms an RC filter. The cutoff frequency of a first-order RC filter is determined by the time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor. The angular cutoff frequency is $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau = 1/(R_{th}C)$.\n\n**2. Identify the Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\nWe need to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor $C$ connected between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n- **Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):** This is the resistance looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. The input \"IN\" at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so turning it off means connecting node $c_0$ to ground. Thus, we need to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also connected to ground. The node labeled $a_0$ is the same as the node labeled $d_0$ in the ladder structure.\n- **Thevenin Voltage ($V_{th}$):** This is the open-circuit voltage at node $a_0$ (with the capacitor $C$ removed). While important for the overall transfer function, the cutoff frequency of the filter depends only on $R_{th}$ and $C$.\n\n**3. Careful Points in the Analysis of $R_{th}$**\n- The circuit is an infinite ladder network. This suggests using properties of infinite repeating structures.\n- The resistance we need to calculate, $R_{th}$, is the resistance between nodes $d_0$ and ground, given that $c_0$ is also grounded. This is equivalent to finding the resistance between nodes $d_0$ and $c_0$.\n- We can simplify the infinite ladder by finding its characteristic impedance. Let's define $R_{eq}$ as the equivalent resistance of the infinite part of the ladder (from section 1 onwards) as seen between the two rails (between nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation of $R_{th}$**\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Find the characteristic resistance of the infinite ladder, $R_{eq}$.**\n    Let $R_{eq}$ be the resistance looking into the terminals $(c_1, d_1)$ from the left. Due to the infinite nature of the ladder, the resistance looking into terminals $(c_2, d_2)$ is also $R_{eq}$.\n    Looking into $(c_1, d_1)$, we see the horizontal resistor `r` (between $c_1$ and $d_1$) in parallel with the rest of the circuit path. This path consists of the vertical resistor `r` (from $c_1$ to $c_2$), the resistance of the subsequent ladder section $R_{eq}$ (between $c_2$ and $d_2$), and the other vertical resistor `r` (from $d_2$ to $d_1$).\n    So, we can write the equation for $R_{eq}$:\n    $R_{eq} = r \\parallel (r + R_{eq} + r) = r \\parallel (2r + R_{eq})$\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Solve for $R_{eq}$.**\n    Using the formula for parallel resistors, $R_{parallel} = \\frac{R_A R_B}{R_A + R_B}$:\n    $R_{eq} = \\frac{r(2r + R_{eq})}{r + (2r + R_{eq})} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_{eq}}{3r + R_{eq}}$\n    $R_{eq}(3r + R_{eq}) = 2r^2 + r R_{eq}$\n    $3r R_{eq} + R_{eq}^2 = 2r^2 + r R_{eq}$\n    Rearranging into a quadratic equation:\n    $R_{eq}^2 + 2r R_{eq} - 2r^2 = 0$\n    We solve for $R_{eq}$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n    $R_{eq} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n    Since resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n    $R_{eq} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the total Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$.**\n    Now we find the resistance between $d_0$ and $c_0$. The path for a current flowing from $d_0$ to $c_0$ is:\n    1.  Through the vertical resistor `r` from $d_0$ to $d_1$.\n    2.  Through the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder, $R_{eq}$, from $d_1$ to $c_1$.\n    3.  Through the vertical resistor `r` from $c_1$ to $c_0$.\n    These three resistive elements are in series. Therefore, the total Thevenin resistance is their sum:\n    $R_{th} = r + R_{eq} + r = 2r + R_{eq}$\n    Substituting the value of $R_{eq}$:\n    $R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**5. Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ of the RC filter is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$. Usually, in this context, the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is sufficient and intended.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe final expression for the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is derived as above.\n\n<<<$1 / (r * C * (1 + sqrt(3)))>>>"
