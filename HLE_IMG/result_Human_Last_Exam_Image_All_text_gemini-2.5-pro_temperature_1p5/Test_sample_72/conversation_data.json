    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\nThe reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄). Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic compound with a 6π electron system. Cyclobutene contains a 2π electron system (one double bond). The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv`. The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Consider plausible initial photochemical reactions.**\nGiven the reactants and photochemical conditions, we can consider several possible initial pericyclic reactions.\n*   **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** A cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. A [2π+2π] cycloaddition is a 4-electron process. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, it is photochemically allowed via a suprafacial-suprafacial approach.\n*   **Electrocyclic Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene itself can undergo a photochemical valence isomerization. A prominent example is the formation of Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is considered a photochemical electrocyclic reaction of a 6π electron system. This reaction is known to be photochemically allowed.\n*   **[4+2] Cycloaddition:** A Diels-Alder type reaction between hexafluorobenzene (as a 4π diene) and cyclobutene (as a 2π dienophile). This is a 6-electron process. A supra-supra [4+2] cycloaddition is thermally allowed but photochemically forbidden. Therefore, this is unlikely to be one of the two photochemical reactions.\n\nBased on this, the two most plausible pathways involve either a [2+2] cycloaddition or an electrocyclic reaction as the first step. Let's analyze both pathways.\n\n**Pathway A: Initial [2+2] cycloaddition**\n1.  **First Reaction: [2+2] Cycloaddition.** The reaction starts with an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. This is photochemically allowed. This reaction would form a C₄ ring by joining one C=C from each molecule. The most common mode for alkenes adding to benzene is the 1,2-addition (ortho addition), which yields a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative. In this case, the product is a complex tricyclic molecule (a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]deca-3,7-diene).\n2.  **Second Reaction: Electrocyclic Reaction.** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety. This is a 4π electron system. Upon further irradiation, this diene can undergo a photochemical 4π electrocyclic ring closure. This is a disrotatory, photochemically allowed reaction. This intramolecular cyclization leads to the formation of a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexene system fused to the rest of the molecule. The final product is a complex cage-like tetracyclic compound.\n\n**Pathway B: Initial Electrocyclic Reaction**\n1.  **First Reaction: Electrocyclic Reaction.** Hexafluorobenzene undergoes photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a photochemically allowed intramolecular electrocyclic reaction of a 6π system.\n2.  **Second Reaction: [2+2] Cycloaddition.** The hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate has two double bonds. It can then undergo an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition with the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction is also photochemically allowed and would lead to a complex cage-like tetracyclic product.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the types of reactions.**\nBoth plausible pathways, A and B, involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order:\n*   An **electrocyclic reaction** (either intramolecular 6π isomerization of benzene or intramolecular 4π ring closure of a cyclohexadiene).\n*   A **[2+2] cycloaddition** (intermolecular reaction between a benzene-derived species and cyclobutene).\n\nThe provided structure of the final product, although drawn in a simplified 2D manner, is consistent with the outcome of either of these sequences, showing a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane-like core derived from hexafluorobenzene fused to a cyclobutane-like ring derived from cyclobutene.\n\nTherefore, the two kinds of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are a cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The reaction is photochemical (`hv`), so the selection rules for pericyclic reactions are reversed compared to thermal reactions.\n2.  Benzene and its derivatives can undergo several types of photochemical pericyclic reactions, including cycloadditions with other molecules and intramolecular valence isomerizations (electrocyclic reactions).\n3.  A [4+2] cycloaddition (supra/supra) is photochemically forbidden.\n4.  A [2+2] cycloaddition (supra/supra) is photochemically allowed.\n5.  A 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically disrotatory and allowed.\n6.  A 6π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically conrotatory and allowed (leading to valence isomers like Dewar benzene).\n7.  The final product's structure helps identify the sequence of reactions, but the question asks for the general *types* of reactions.\n8.  Both plausible mechanistic pathways consist of one cycloaddition reaction and one electrocyclic reaction.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
