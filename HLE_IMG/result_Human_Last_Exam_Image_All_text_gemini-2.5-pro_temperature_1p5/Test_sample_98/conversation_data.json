    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step 1: Visual Analysis of the Object**\nThe image displays a medallion-like object, likely a large fibula (brooch) or a patera (a shallow ceremonial dish). It is circular with a large rectangular tab at the top, which would have been part of the pin mechanism if it were a fibula. The main decoration consists of two facing busts shown in profile. The style is not classical Greco-Roman; it is more schematic and abstract.\n\n**Step 2: Examination of the Artistic Style**\n*   **Figures:** The figures have disproportionately large heads and prominent eyes that stare forward, even though the heads are in profile. This is a common characteristic of Late Antique and Early Medieval art, which moved away from classical naturalism.\n*   **Hair:** The figure on the left has very elaborate, stylized curly hair, arranged in a dense, wig-like mass. This decorative treatment of hair is typical for high-status individuals in the art of the late Roman Empire and the subsequent Migration Period.\n*   **Composition:** The rigid profile view and the flattened, relief-like quality are also hallmarks of the artistic transition occurring in the later Roman Empire.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Artifact**\nThis specific object is a famous archaeological find. It is known as a large disc fibula from the **Pietroasele Treasure** (also called the Pietroasa Treasure or the Treasure of the Goths), which was discovered in Romania in 1837. The treasure is a hoard of gold objects from the Migration Period. This fibula is one of its most well-known pieces.\n\n**Step 4: Archaeological Dating**\nArchaeologists and art historians have extensively studied the Pietroasele Treasure. Based on the craftsmanship, the style of the objects (which belongs to the polychrome style of the Migration Period), and the historical context of Gothic tribes in the region, the treasure is consistently dated to the **late 4th century A.D.** This period marks the height of Gothic power north of the Danube before the major invasions of the Roman Empire. The style of the figures on the fibula aligns perfectly with the artistic trends of the late 4th century A.D., reflecting the evolving aesthetics of Late Antiquity.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the identification of the object as a part of the Pietroasele Treasure and the consensus of archaeological dating, the medallion is ascribed to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
