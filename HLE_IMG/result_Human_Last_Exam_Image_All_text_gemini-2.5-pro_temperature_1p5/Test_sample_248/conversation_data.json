    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The photograph displays a community of organisms on a wet rock, typical of an intertidal zone. We can identify several types of marine invertebrates:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, sessile (attached) crustaceans with conical, whitish-grey shells covering the rock surface. These appear to be a species of acorn barnacle.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two, possibly three, distinct types of snails visible.\n        *   Two large snails are in the center. One is almost entirely white, and the other, slightly above it, has a greyish-tan shell with faint but distinct brown spiral stripes.\n        *   There are also several smaller, darker snails with ribbed shells.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the geographic distribution of the visible species:** The question asks for a species that is found on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast. We need to identify one of the organisms and determine its specific range.\n\n3.  **Identify the key indicator species:** Let's focus on the most identifiable snail, the one with the brown spiral stripes.\n    *   **Morphology:** This snail is relatively large for its type, with a robust, conical shell and a pointed apex. Its defining feature in this image is the pattern of thin, brown spiral lines on a lighter background.\n    *   **Identification:** This appearance is highly characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**, whose scientific name is ***Littorina littorea***.\n\n4.  **Confirm the geographic range of *Littorina littorea*:**\n    *   **Native Range:** The Common Periwinkle is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (i.e., Europe).\n    *   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and has since become extremely common, ranging from Labrador, Canada, to Maryland, USA.\n    *   **Pacific Coast Status:** Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not** found on the Pacific coast of North America. While other periwinkle species (*e.g., Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana*) are native to the Pacific, the Common Periwinkle is not established there.\n\n5.  **Evaluate other species in the photo:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** The barnacles could be the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*), a common Atlantic species. However, visually distinguishing them from common Pacific species like the Acorn Barnacle (*Balanus glandula*) from this photograph alone is difficult for a non-expert. Therefore, they are not as \"definitive\" an indicator as the snail.\n    *   **White Snail:** The whiter snail could be an Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*), which is also an exclusively Atlantic species. However, its shell color is highly variable, making a positive identification without other features less certain than for the Common Periwinkle.\n    *   **Small Dark Snails:** These could be Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*), which are also common in the North Atlantic.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the snail with the striped pattern, identified as the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*), is the most definitive evidence in the photograph that the location is on a coast of the Atlantic Ocean and not the Pacific Ocean, due to its well-documented and distinct geographical distribution.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question requires the **scientific name**, not the common name.\n*   The identification must be based on a species that is **definitively** Atlantic, meaning it is absent from the Pacific coast.\n*   The visual evidence in the photo must be strong enough to make a reasonably certain identification of that specific species. The striped pattern on the periwinkle is a strong visual clue.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition: The most clearly identifiable species with a distribution limited to the Atlantic (and not the Pacific) is the Common Periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
