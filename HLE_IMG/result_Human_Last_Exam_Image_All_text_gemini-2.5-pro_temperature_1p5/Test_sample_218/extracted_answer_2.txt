The final product, Compound A, is the hydrocarbon formed by replacing the hydroxyl group (-OH) of geraniol with a hydrogen atom (-H). This deoxygenation reaction converts the primary alcohol into a methyl group. The structure of Compound A is:

(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₃

Here is its skeletal structure:
