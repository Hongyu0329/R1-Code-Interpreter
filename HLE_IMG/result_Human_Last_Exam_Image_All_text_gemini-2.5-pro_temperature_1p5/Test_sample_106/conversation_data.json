    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, which leads to a rearranged alkene product. The question asks to identify the substituents (either H or CH3) at five specific positions in the final product. The key to solving this problem is to understand the mechanism of the reaction, which is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, involving a cascade of [1,2] shifts.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** The reaction conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 Â°C) and the transformation (alcohol to an alkene with water loss and skeletal rearrangement) indicate an acid-catalyzed E1 elimination with carbocation rearrangements. The starting material is a saturated pentacyclic alcohol, and the product is an unsaturated pentacyclic hydrocarbon (an alkene). The product's double bond is in a thermodynamically stable, tetrasubstituted position, characteristic of the olean-12-ene skeleton, a common endpoint for such rearrangements.\n\n2.  **Proposing the Mechanism (The Backbone Rearrangement):**\n    a. **Carbocation Formation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C3 by the acid catalyst. This turns it into a good leaving group (-OH2+), which then departs as a water molecule, leaving a secondary carbocation at C3.\n    b. **Initiation of the Cascade:** A secondary carbocation is relatively unstable. It will rearrange to form a more stable tertiary carbocation. This is achieved by a [1,2]-shift of a group from an adjacent carbon. The adjacent C4 is a quaternary carbon with two methyl groups. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C4 to C3 moves the positive charge to C4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n    c. **The Cascade of [1,2] Shifts:** This initial rearrangement triggers a cascade of subsequent [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts along the fused ring system (the \"backbone\"). The driving force for this cascade is the stepwise formation of more stable (usually tertiary) carbocations, ultimately moving the positive charge to a position where a highly stable alkene can be formed. The final alkene is the olean-12-ene, which means the cascade must terminate with the carbocation at C13.\n\n3.  **Tracing the Migrating Groups:** We need to track the movement of specific methyl groups and hydrogen atoms to determine the final structure. Let's assume the standard stereochemistry for this type of skeleton which allows for a concerted or sequential series of anti-periplanar shifts.\n\n    *   **Start:** Carbocation at C3.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH3) from C4 migrates to C3. The carbocation is now at C4.\n    *   **Shift 2:** The hydrogen atom (H) from C5 migrates to C4. The carbocation is now at C5.\n    *   **Shift 3:** The methyl group (CH3) from C10 migrates to C5. The carbocation is now at C10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** The hydrogen atom (H) from C9 migrates to C10. The carbocation is now at C9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** The methyl group (CH3) from C8 migrates to C9. The carbocation is now at C8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** The methyl group (CH3) from C14 migrates to C8. The carbocation is now at C14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** A hydrogen atom (H) from C13 migrates to C14. The carbocation is now at C13.\n    *   **Final Step (Elimination):** A proton is removed from the adjacent C12 by a base (like H2O or Cl-). This forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13.\n\n4.  **Determining the Substituents at the Final Positions:** Now we can determine what substituent (H or CH3) ends up at each of the numbered positions in the product. The numbering in the product corresponds to carbons in the rearranged oleanane skeleton. Based on the geometry in the diagram:\n    *   Position 1 is on C4.\n    *   Position 2 is on C10.\n    *   Position 3 is on C9.\n    *   Position 4 is on C8.\n    *   Position 5 is on C14.\n\n    Let's find the final substituent at each of these carbons:\n\n    *   **Position 1 (C4):** The starting material has a gem-dimethyl group at C4. In Shift 1, one CH3 moved to C3. In Shift 2, an H moved from C5 to C4. Thus, C4 in the final product has one CH3 group and one H atom. The diagram at position 1 shows a methyl group (the one that remained at C4). Therefore, **1 = CH3**. (Note: The diagram is slightly misleading as it shows a gem-dimethyl group at C4 in the product, which is inconsistent with the mechanism. However, the substituent at position 1 is indeed the remaining methyl group).\n    *   **Position 2 (C10):** The original CH3 at C10 moved to C5 (Shift 3). The H from C9 moved to C10 (Shift 4). Therefore, the substituent at C10 is a hydrogen atom. **2 = H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (C9):** The original H at C9 moved to C10 (Shift 4). The CH3 from C8 moved to C9 (Shift 5). Therefore, the substituent at C9 is a methyl group. **3 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 4 (C8):** The original CH3 at C8 moved to C9 (Shift 5). The CH3 from C14 moved to C8 (Shift 6). Therefore, the substituent at C8 is a methyl group. **4 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5 (C14):** The original CH3 at C14 moved to C8 (Shift 6). An H from C13 moved to C14 (Shift 7). Therefore, the substituent at C14 is a hydrogen atom. **5 = H**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
