    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek red-figure vase. The scene depicted involves a chariot crash. We can identify several key figures and elements:\n    *   A chariot drawn by at least one white horse (the rear of the horse is visible on the left).\n    *   A figure driving the chariot, holding reins. This figure wears an ornate, spotted garment and a decorated cap (often identified as a Phrygian cap). A large wing is visible above and behind this figure, suggesting they are a divine or mythological being. This figure is often interpreted as a Fury (Erinys) or the personification of Madness (Lyssa).\n    *   A figure in the process of falling or being thrown from the chariot. This figure is partially draped in a white garment (himation) and appears limp, suggesting they are a victim. This is the figure \"leaving the chariot.\"\n    *   A nude male figure lying on the ground, seemingly dead or dying. His body is contorted, and he is positioned beneath where the falling figure is.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological story.**\n    The scene of a young hero being killed in a chariot accident by the sea (indicated by the wave pattern at the bottom) is a classic depiction of the myth of Hippolytus. According to the myth, Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, angered the goddess Aphrodite. In revenge, she caused his stepmother Phaedra to fall in love with him. After he rejected her, she falsely accused him of assault and killed herself. The enraged Theseus used a curse given to him by his father, the sea god Poseidon, to punish Hippolytus. As Hippolytus drove his chariot along the seashore, Poseidon sent a bull from the sea. The monster terrified Hippolytus's horses, who bolted, crashed the chariot, and dragged the entangled Hippolytus to his death.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the figures to the myth.**\n    *   The chaotic scene with the out-of-control chariot fits the climax of Hippolytus's story.\n    *   The figure falling from the chariot is the protagonist of this tragedy, Hippolytus.\n    *   The nude figure on the ground is also Hippolytus, shown after being dragged and killed. It was common in Greek vase painting to depict multiple moments of a narrative within a single composition. Both the falling figure and the figure on the ground represent the same person at different stages of his death.\n    *   The winged charioteer represents the divine force (like Lyssa, or Madness) that enacts the curse and causes the horses to go wild.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identity of the figure.**\n    Based on the iconographic evidence and the well-known myth it illustrates, the figure who is leaving (i.e., falling from) the chariot is the hero Hippolytus.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
