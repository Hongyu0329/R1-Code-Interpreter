    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺•) Cluster:**\n    The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion and its isotopologues. This cluster is observed in the m/z 258-266 range. The peaks have the following intensities: m/z 258 (17.4%), 260 (34.8%), 262 (29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%). The presence of multiple peaks separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of chlorine-containing compounds. The nominal molecular weight is even (e.g., 260 or 262), which, according to the nitrogen rule, suggests the compound has zero or an even number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the Base Peak and Key Fragmentation:**\n    The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at m/z = 225 (I = 100%). A common fragmentation pathway for organohalogen compounds is the loss of a halogen radical. Let's test if the base peak is formed by the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion. The mass difference between a potential molecular ion peak (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This mass corresponds precisely to a chlorine-35 (³⁵Cl) atom. This indicates that the base peak is likely the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms in the Base Peak Fragment:**\n    We analyze the isotopic pattern of the base peak cluster: m/z 225 (I=100%), m/z 227 (I=66.7%), m/z 229 (I=22.2%).\n    *   A fragment with one Cl atom would show an M':M'+2 ratio of approximately 100:33.\n    *   A fragment with two Cl atoms would show an M':M'+2:M'+4 ratio of approximately 100:65:11.\n    *   A fragment with three Cl atoms would show an M':M'+2:M'+4 ratio of approximately 100:96:31.\n    The observed ratio of the first two peaks (100:66.7) is an excellent match to the theoretical ratio for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms in the Parent Molecule:**\n    Since the base peak [M-Cl]⁺ contains two chlorine atoms and was formed by losing one chlorine atom from the parent molecule, the original molecule must contain a total of **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The parent molecule has the general formula R-Cl₃, where R is the non-halogen part of the molecule. The base peak fragment is R-Cl₂⁺.\n    *   The peak at m/z 225 represents the isotopologue of the fragment containing two ³⁵Cl atoms: [R + 2(³⁵Cl)]⁺.\n    *   We can calculate the mass of the core R: Mass(R) = 225 - (2 × 35) = 155 u.\n    *   With the mass of R known, we can find the m/z of the parent molecular ion containing only ³⁵Cl isotopes: M = Mass(R) + (3 × 35) = 155 + 105 = 260 u. This matches the prominent peak at m/z 260 in the M⁺• cluster.\n    *   Now, we must determine the chemical formula for the R group with mass 155. Since the molecular weight (260) is even, R must have an even number of nitrogen atoms (0, 2, ...). A plausible composition for a C, H, O-based radical with mass 155 is C₁₁H₇O (11×12 + 7×1 + 16×1 = 132 + 7 + 16 = 155).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₁H₇OCl₃**.\n\n6.  **Propose and Verify a Plausible Structure:**\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₁H₇OCl₃ has a degree of unsaturation of 7. This value is consistent with a substituted naphthalene ring system (naphthalene, C₁₀H₈, has DBE=7).\n    *   A plausible structure is a **trichloromethoxy-naphthalene**. The formula C₁₀H₄(OCH₃)Cl₃ expands to C₁₁H₇OCl₃.\n    *   A key fragmentation for a methoxy-aromatic compound is the loss of the methoxy group (•OCH₃, mass 31 u). The resulting fragment ion [M - OCH₃]⁺ would have an m/z of 260 - 31 = 229.\n    *   The spectrum shows a significant peak at m/z 229 with an intensity of 22.2%. This observation strongly supports the proposed structure.\n    *   Furthermore, this explains the anomaly in the isotopic pattern of the base peak. The peak at m/z 229 is an overlap of two species: the M'+4 isotope of the base peak ([C₁₁H₇O³⁵Cl³⁷Cl]⁺, with a theoretical intensity of ~11%) and the [M-OCH₃]⁺ fragment ion ([C₁₀H₄Cl₃]⁺, contributing the remaining ~11% intensity).\n\n7.  **Provide the IUPAC Name:**\n    The mass spectrum alone cannot distinguish between isomers (e.g., 2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene vs. 1,6,8-trichloro-2-methoxynaphthalene). However, a valid systematic IUPAC name for any member of this class of compounds will satisfy the question. A simple and valid example is 2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the molecular ion, the base peak, the isotopic patterns, and key fragmentation pathways (loss of Cl and loss of OCH₃), the compound is identified as a trichloromethoxy-naphthalene.\n\n<<<2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene>>>"
