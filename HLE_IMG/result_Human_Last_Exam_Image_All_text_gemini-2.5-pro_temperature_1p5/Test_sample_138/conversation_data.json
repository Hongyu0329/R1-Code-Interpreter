    "*   **Analysis of the Task:** The goal is to determine the biological sex (Male or Female) for each of the two insects in the three pairs labeled A, B, and C. The final answer should be a sequence of three numbers corresponding to the correct option for each pair. We are given a clue that the insects are pollinators from taxa where females lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs on the legs) and both sexes feed on nectar. This clue helps identify the groups of insects.\n\n*   **General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n    *   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some wasp species, male antennae are distinctly curled at the tip.\n    *   **Abdomen:** Females possess an ovipositor, which is modified into a stinger in bees and wasps. The abdomen tip is often pointed or specialized for this function. Males have external genitalia (claspers) and the abdomen tip may appear more blunt or have multiple points/spines. Males also tend to have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n    *   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) that females lack.\n    *   **Legs:** Females of non-parasitic bees have scopae (dense pollen-collecting hairs) on their hind legs or underside of the abdomen. Males and parasitic female bees lack these structures.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (Genus *Coelioxys*)**\n        *   **Identification:** These bees have a distinctive look with a pointed abdomen and clear white hair bands. They are cleptoparasitic, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. The females do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae, fitting the clue in the question.\n        *   **Left Insect:** This individual has a relatively slender body. While the tip of the abdomen is not perfectly clear, it lacks the extreme conical point seen in its partner. In male *Coelioxys*, the abdomen ends in a series of spines.\n        *   **Right Insect:** This insect displays the defining characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*: a long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This specialized shape is used to pierce the cell walls of its host's nest to lay an egg.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n    *   **Pair B: Paper Wasps (Genus *Polistes*)**\n        *   **Identification:** These are clearly wasps, which as a group lack scopae. They are common nectar feeders.\n        *   **Left Insect:** This wasp has straight antennae. The abdomen tip is pointed, housing the stinger.\n        *   **Right Insect:** The key feature here is the antennae. The tips are distinctly hooked or curled. This is a classic and reliable characteristic of male paper wasps (*Polistes*). Additionally, the face of the male often has more yellow than the female's.\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female (F), Right is Male (M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n    *   **Pair C: Long-horned Bees (Tribe Eucerini, e.g., Genus *Melissodes*)**\n        *   **Identification:** These are robust, hairy bees. The name \"long-horned bee\" is a major clue. The hint about \"no scopae\" is potentially misleading for this specific pair (as female long-horned bees are avid pollen collectors with large scopae), but it may apply to the overall collection of insects shown. We must rely on clear morphological traits.\n        *   **Left Insect:** The antennae are extremely long, extending well past the head and thorax. This is the defining feature of male long-horned bees. Also, its face has a prominent yellow patch (the clypeus), another common sign of a male bee.\n        *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are much shorter, which is typical for a female of this group. The body is broad and it is actively foraging, consistent with a female collecting provisions for her nest.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n*   **Final Compilation:**\n    *   Pair A: M, F => 3\n    *   Pair B: F, M => 4\n    *   Pair C: M, F => 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
