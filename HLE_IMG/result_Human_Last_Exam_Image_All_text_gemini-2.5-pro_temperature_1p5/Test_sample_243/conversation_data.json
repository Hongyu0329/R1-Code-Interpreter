    "*   **Step 1: Plant Identification**\n    *   The image displays a plant with distinctive leaves. The key features are:\n        *   The leaves are simple, elliptical to lance-shaped.\n        *   They are arranged in a whorl-like pattern at the end of the stems.\n        *   The most striking characteristic is the prominent, pale-colored, net-like pattern of veins (reticulated venation) against a dark green leaf surface.\n        *   The plant appears to be a woody shrub.\n    *   These features are characteristic of the plant species *Pittosporum kirkii*, also known as Kirk's Pittosporum or Thick-leaved Pittosporum.\n\n*   **Step 2: Researching the Plant's Origin**\n    *   The question asks for the island to which this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the plant is found exclusively in that specific geographic location and nowhere else in the world.\n    *   Researching the habitat and distribution of *Pittosporum kirkii* confirms that it is an endemic species.\n\n*   **Step 3: Pinpointing the Specific Island**\n    *   Botanical sources, such as the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network, state that *Pittosporum kirkii* is endemic to New Zealand.\n    *   More specifically, its natural range is confined to the North Island of New Zealand, from the northernmost tip (Te Paki) south to areas like Taranaki and the Ruahine Ranges. It is not found naturally on the South Island.\n    *   Therefore, the island to which this plant is endemic is the North Island.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
