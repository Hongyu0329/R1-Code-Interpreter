    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry means that if you rotate an object around a central point by a certain angle, it will look exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry (or \"n-fold\" symmetry) is the number of times the object matches its original orientation during a full 360-degree turn. An n-fold rotational symmetry corresponds to a rotation angle of 360/n degrees. For periodic tilings like this one, the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold (180째), 3-fold (120째), 4-fold (90째), and 6-fold (60째).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to look for points in the pattern around which we can rotate it. Good candidates for these centers are the centers of the prominent shapes in the tiling.\nThe tiling is composed of:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons\n*   Light yellow squares\n*   Tan non-regular hexagons\n*   Orange rhombuses\n\nLet's test the centers of the most regular shapes: the blue hexagons and the yellow squares.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Center of a Blue Hexagon**\n1.  Select a blue hexagon as a potential center of rotation.\n2.  A regular hexagon by itself has 6-fold symmetry. Let's see if the surrounding pattern also has 6-fold symmetry around this point.\n3.  Look at the shapes immediately surrounding the blue hexagon. There is a ring of other tiles. Alternating around the central blue hexagon, we find light yellow squares and orange rhombuses, separated by tan hexagons.\n4.  If we perform a 60-degree rotation (which is required for 6-fold symmetry), a position occupied by a square would move to a position occupied by a rhombus. Since a square is not a rhombus, the pattern does not look the same after a 60-degree rotation. Therefore, there is **no 6-fold symmetry**.\n5.  Now let's test for 3-fold symmetry (120-degree rotation). A 120-degree rotation will map each square to another square's position, and each rhombus to another rhombus's position. This appears to work. Tracing the pattern further out confirms that the entire tiling maps onto itself with a 120-degree rotation around the center of a blue hexagon. So, there is **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Test the Center of a Yellow Square**\n1.  Select a light yellow square as a potential center of rotation.\n2.  A square by itself has 4-fold symmetry. Let's test the surrounding pattern for 4-fold symmetry around this point.\n3.  The square is surrounded by four identical tan non-regular hexagons on its sides and four identical orange rhombuses at its corners.\n4.  If we perform a 90-degree rotation (required for 4-fold symmetry), the square maps onto itself. Each of the four surrounding tan hexagons is mapped onto the next one. Each of the four surrounding orange rhombuses is mapped onto the next.\n5.  Following the pattern further out, we can see that the entire tiling remains unchanged after a 90-degree rotation around the center of any square. Thus, the tiling has **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nWe have found that the tiling has points with 3-fold rotational symmetry (the centers of blue hexagons) and points with 4-fold rotational symmetry (the centers of yellow squares). It also has points with 2-fold symmetry (for example, the meeting point of two blue hexagons and two orange rhombuses).\n\nWhen asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry found within it. In this case, the highest order of rotation is 4-fold.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling has centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold rotation. The highest order of rotational symmetry is 4-fold.\n\n<<<4-fold>>>"
