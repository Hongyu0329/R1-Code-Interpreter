    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Measure:** The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find measure 28 at the beginning of the second system. Counting forward two measures brings us to measure 30, which is also circled in the image for clarity.\n\n2.  **Determine the Key:** The key signature has three flats (Bb, Eb, Ab). This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, Eb major. Given this is the \"Pathetique\" sonata, the home key of the first movement is C minor.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes played are F#, A, C, and Eb. Note the F# is an accidental.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are F# octaves.\n    *   **Combined:** The collection of notes present in this measure is F#, A, C, and Eb.\n\n4.  **Identify the Chord and its Quality:** To identify the chord, we stack the notes into thirds. Starting from F#:\n    *   F# to A is a minor third.\n    *   F# to C is a diminished fifth.\n    *   F# to Eb (which is enharmonically the same as D#) is a diminished seventh.\n    *   A chord with a root, minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh is a **fully diminished seventh chord**. Therefore, the chord in measure 30 is an F# diminished seventh chord (F#°7).\n\n5.  **Determine the Chord's Function:** A diminished seventh chord that is not built on the leading tone of the home key (which would be B°7 in C minor) is almost always a secondary or applied chord. To find its function, we look at the chord it resolves to in the next measure.\n    *   **Measure 31:** The notes in the right hand are G, B (natural), and D. The left hand plays G octaves. Together, these notes form a **G major chord**.\n    *   In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree, making the G major chord the **dominant (V)** chord.\n    *   The chord in measure 30 (F#°7) leads to the V chord (G major) in measure 31.\n    *   F# is the leading tone of G. Therefore, the F#°7 chord is functioning as the **leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant**.\n\n6.  **Write the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   A leading-tone diminished seventh chord is represented by `vii°7`.\n    *   Since this chord is applied to the dominant (V) chord, we use the notation for secondary chords, which is a slash.\n    *   The final Roman numeral is the leading-tone diminished seventh of the dominant, written as **vii°7/V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Key Signature vs. Actual Key:** Always establish the tonic (C minor in this case) to provide the correct context for the analysis.\n*   **Accidentals:** The F# is crucial. Without it, the chord would be different. It is the leading tone to G.\n*   **Enharmonic Equivalents:** Recognizing that Eb is the same pitch as D# helps in correctly identifying the diminished seventh interval from the root F#.\n*   **Chord Function:** Don't analyze chords in isolation. The function of a chromatic chord like F#°7 becomes clear when you see the chord it resolves to (the V chord). This is the core principle of analyzing secondary/applied chords.\n*   **Roman Numeral Notation:** Be precise with the notation. `vii` indicates the leading tone, `°` indicates diminished quality, `7` indicates it's a seventh chord, and `/V` shows it's applied to the dominant.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
