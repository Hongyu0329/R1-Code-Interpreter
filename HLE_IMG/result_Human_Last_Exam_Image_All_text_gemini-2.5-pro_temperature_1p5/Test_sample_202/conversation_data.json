    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy texture with many visible holes (vesicles).\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas was trapped in molten rock (magma/lava) as it cooled and solidified. This points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. A highly vesicular, cindery volcanic rock like this is known as scoria.\n*   **Identification:** Scoria\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments (clasts) that are angular in shape and cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix. The fragments themselves vary in color and type.\n*   **Interpretation:** This clastic texture, composed of angular volcanic fragments, is characteristic of a rock formed from an explosive volcanic eruption. The ejected material (ash, lapilli, blocks) settles and becomes lithified (turned into rock). This type of rock is known as a volcanic breccia.\n*   **Identification:** Volcanic Breccia\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** The specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. Its texture appears frothy and it looks very lightweight.\n*   **Interpretation:** The light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica), and the extreme number of vesicles indicates it formed from a gas-rich, frothy lava that cooled very rapidly. These are the defining characteristics of pumice, which is often low-density enough to float on water.\n*   **Identification:** Pumice\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. There are light-colored crystals (white, off-white, slightly pinkish) and some darker, greenish-black minerals.\n*   **Interpretation:** The large crystal size (coarse-grained or phaneritic texture) indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. This is an intrusive igneous rock. The mineral composition—light-colored minerals like quartz and feldspar plus darker minerals like biotite or hornblende—is typical of granite. However, the crystals are exceptionally large, which is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite.\n*   **Identification:** Pegmatite\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
