The result should be interpreted as negative or invalid. Although the fluorescence crosses the threshold before the 40-cycle cut-off (Ct = 30.8), the amplification curve does not have the characteristic sigmoidal shape of a true positive reaction. Instead, it shows a linear drift, which indicates the signal is likely due to background noise or non-specific artifacts rather than target amplification.
