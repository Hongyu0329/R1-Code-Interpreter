The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):**
The structure is the Michael addition product formed from the enamine intermediate (I, derived from the decarboxylation of product C) and methyl propiolate. It has an N-acetylpyrrolidine core linked at C2 to a modified side chain. The structure is methyl (E)-3-(1-acetyl-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-5-yl)acrylate. (*Note: The attack happens from the enamine's β-carbon, which corresponds to C5 of the original pyrrolidine ring.*)

[A schematic drawing shows a five-membered ring (pyrrolidine) with an acetyl group on the nitrogen. At position 2, there is a (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) substituent. At position 5, there is a -CH=CH-COOCH₃ substituent.]

**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):**
The structure is a fused heterocyclic compound resulting from the [3+2] cycloaddition of a dipole derived from the imine ring of the starting material with methyl propiolate, followed by the elimination of methanol. The resulting structure contains a pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyridine core.

  O=C(O)[C@@]1(C2=CC=C(C(=O)OC)CN2)CCCN1  (SMILES representation of a possible core structure)
```
[A schematic drawing shows a fused bicyclic system (pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyridine-like) formed from the original pyrroline ring and the alkyne. This fused system is attached as a spiro substituent to the C2 of the pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid ring.]

**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):**
The structure is the N-acetylated derivative of the starting material.
```
  O=C(O)C1(C(N2CCCC2)=N)CCCN1C(=O)C (SMILES representation of a possible isomer)
```
[A schematic drawing shows the starting material with an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring.]
