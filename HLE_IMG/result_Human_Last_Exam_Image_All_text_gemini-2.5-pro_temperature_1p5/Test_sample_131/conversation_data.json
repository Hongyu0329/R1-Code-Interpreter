    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the alkaloid compound shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic structural features.**\n*   **Alkaloid Nature:** The molecule contains nitrogen atoms within a heterocyclic ring system, which is characteristic of alkaloids. There are two nitrogen atoms present.\n*   **Ring System:** The compound is polycyclic, meaning it is made of multiple fused rings. By counting, we can identify four rings fused together, making it a tetracyclic system.\n*   **Functional Groups:** A key functional group is the carbonyl group (C=O) within a ring, adjacent to a nitrogen atom. This is a lactam (a cyclic amide) group. Specifically, it's part of a six-membered ring, so it's a piperidin-2-one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core skeleton and classify the alkaloid.**\n*   The overall structure with its tetracyclic C15N2 framework is characteristic of the **lupin alkaloids**. These alkaloids are typically isolated from plants of the *Lupinus* (lupin) genus.\n*   Let's compare this structure to some common lupin alkaloids:\n    *   **Sparteine:** Sparteine has the same tetracyclic nitrogen-containing skeleton but lacks the carbonyl group (the C=O is a CH₂ group in sparteine). Therefore, the given compound is an oxidized derivative of sparteine.\n    *   **Cytisine and Anagyrine:** These alkaloids contain a pyridone ring, which is a six-membered aromatic ring containing a nitrogen atom and a ketone. The given structure has fully saturated rings (except for the C=O double bond), so it is not cytisine or anagyrine.\n    *   **Matrine:** Matrine is another tetracyclic alkaloid with a lactam group. However, its ring fusion pattern is different from the one shown. Matrine is a constitutional isomer of the compound in the image.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific compound.**\n*   The structure shown, a tetracyclic lupin alkaloid with a lactam group at position 2 (of the A ring), is known as **Lupanine**.\n*   The chemical formula for Lupanine is C₁₅H₂₄N₂O.\n*   The drawing also specifies the stereochemistry of the molecule using wedges and dashes at the chiral centers (carbons where multiple rings join). The specific arrangement of these stereocenters shown in the diagram corresponds to the naturally occurring enantiomer of lupanine.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nBased on the analysis of the ring system, functional groups, and comparison with known alkaloid structures, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
