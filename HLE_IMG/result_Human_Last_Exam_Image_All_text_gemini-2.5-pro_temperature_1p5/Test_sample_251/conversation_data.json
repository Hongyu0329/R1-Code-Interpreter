    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ECG Calibration**\nFirst, we must determine the time scale from the information given on the ECG.\n*   The paper speed is listed at the top left as **25 mm/sec**.\n*   The ECG grid is composed of small squares and large squares.\n*   One small square is 1 mm in width.\n*   One large square is 5 mm in width (and is made up of 5 small squares).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Time per Square**\nUsing the paper speed, we can calculate the time represented by each square:\n*   **Time per small square:** 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.04 seconds**.\n*   **Time per large square:** 5 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.2 seconds**.\n\n**Step 3: Visually Scan for the Longest R-R Interval**\nNext, we visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the sharp, tall spikes).\n*   The heart rhythm is mostly regular for large portions of the strip.\n*   However, there is a very obvious pause on the fourth line of the tracing (which begins around the timestamp 0:06:08). This interval is significantly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n**Step 4: Measure the Longest Interval**\nNow we will measure the duration of this long pause using the grid lines.\n*   Locate the R-wave just before the pause and the R-wave immediately after it.\n*   The peak of the R-wave just before the pause aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical line (major grid line).\n*   The peak of the R-wave at the end of the pause also aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical line.\n*   By counting the number of large squares between these two R-wave peaks, we can determine the interval's duration.\n*   Counting horizontally from the first R-wave peak to the second, we can count exactly **8 large squares**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer in Seconds**\nFinally, we convert the measurement in large squares to a time value in seconds.\n*   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n*   Duration = 8 × 0.2 seconds\n*   Duration = **1.6 seconds**\n\nThe longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is therefore 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
