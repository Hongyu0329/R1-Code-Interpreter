    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers and Connectivity**\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the stereocenters (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A chiral carbon is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. By examining the structure, we can identify three chiral carbons. Let's label them from left to right for initial analysis:\n*   **C_left**: The leftmost carbon, bonded to -OH, -CH3, an implicit -H, and the rest of the chain (C_middle).\n*   **C_middle**: The middle carbon, bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), an implicit -H, C_left, and C_right.\n*   **C_right**: The rightmost chiral carbon, bonded to a -CH3 group, a -CH2NH2 group, an implicit -H, and C_middle.\n\nThe connectivity is as follows: a carbon with a hydroxyl and a methyl group (C_left) is connected to a carbon with an ethyl group (C_middle), which is in turn connected to a carbon with a methyl and an aminomethyl group (C_right).\n\n**2. Determine the Absolute Configuration of Each Chiral Center**\n\nWe will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to assign the configuration (R or S) to each center.\n\n**Analysis of C_right (the carbon with the -CH2NH2 group)**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H (implicit), and the rest of the molecule (let's call it R_chain, which is -C_middle(...)).\n*   **Drawing Convention:** The bond to the R_chain is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (coming out). The -CH3 group is on a dash (going back). Therefore, the implicit -H must lie in the plane.\n*   **CIP Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen (N).\n    2.  **-R_chain (-C_middle(...))**: This carbon is bonded to other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: This carbon is bonded to hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**\n    To distinguish between group 1 and 2, we compare what their carbons are attached to. The C in -CH2NH2 is attached to (N, H, H). The C in R_chain is attached to (C, C, H). Since N (atomic number 7) has a higher atomic number than C (6), -CH2NH2 has the highest priority. Comparing R_chain and -CH3, R_chain has priority as its carbon is bonded to other carbons, not just hydrogens.\n    So, the priorities are: 1: -CH2NH2 > 2: -R_chain > 3: -CH3 > 4: -H.\n*   **Assigning Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. This makes direct assignment difficult. We can use a trick: look down the C-CH3 bond (priority 3, dashed). From this viewpoint, the remaining groups (1, 2, 4) appear in a counter-clockwise (CCW) order (1 is wedged, 2 is in-plane, 4 is in-plane). The rule for looking down an odd-priority group (like 3) in the back is: CCW = R, CW = S.\n    Thus, the configuration of C_right is **(R)**.\n\n**Analysis of C_middle (the carbon with the ethyl group)**\n\n*   **Substituents:** Ethyl (-CH2CH3), -H (implicit), C_left, C_right.\n*   **Drawing Convention:** Bonds to C_left and C_right are in the plane. The ethyl group is on a wedge. This means the implicit -H must be on a dash.\n*   **CIP Priorities:**\n    1.  **-C_left (-C(OH, CH3, ...))**: This carbon is bonded to an Oxygen.\n    2.  **-C_right (-C(CH2NH2, CH3, ...))**: This carbon is bonded to a carbon which is bonded to a Nitrogen.\n    3.  **-CH2CH3 (Ethyl)**: This carbon is bonded to another carbon.\n    4.  **-H**\n    Comparing 1 and 2: C_left is bonded to (O, C, H). C_right is bonded to (C, C, N). O has higher priority than N or C. So, C_left > C_right.\n    The priorities are: 1: -C_left > 2: -C_right > 3: -Ethyl > 4: -H.\n*   **Assigning Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is dashed (in the back). We trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. This path (up-left -> down-right -> up-right) is clockwise (CW).\n    Since the lowest priority group is in the back, CW = R.\n    Thus, the configuration of C_middle is **(R)**.\n\n**Analysis of C_left (the carbon with the -OH group)**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -OH, -CH3, -H (implicit), and C_middle.\n*   **Drawing Convention:** This center is drawn unconventionally with two dashed bonds (-OH and -CH3) and one bond in the plane (-C_middle). For the carbon to be tetrahedral, the fourth bond (to the implicit -H) must be on a wedge.\n*   **CIP Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has the highest atomic number.\n    2.  **-C_middle(...):** This carbon is attached to other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: This carbon is attached to hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**\n*   **Assigning Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (coming forward). We determine the configuration for the remaining groups (1 -> 2 -> 3) and then reverse the result.\n    Looking down the C-H bond (from the front), the groups 1, 2, and 3 form a circle. Let's place group 2 (-C_middle) at the 3 o'clock position. Groups 1 (-OH) and 3 (-CH3) are both dashed, so they are behind the plane containing the C-H and C-C_middle bonds. They would occupy the roughly 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions.\n    Let's assume -OH (1) is at 11 o'clock and -CH3 (3) is at 7 o'clock. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is 11 -> 3 -> 7, which is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    Since the lowest priority group (-H) is in the front, we reverse the result. CCW becomes R.\n    (Note: Even if we swapped the positions of the dashed groups, with -OH(1) at 7 and -CH3(3) at 11, the path 1->2->3 would be 7->3->11, which is clockwise (CW). Reversing this gives S. The drawing is ambiguous. However, a procedural swap method consistently yields R. We swap H(4, wedge) with OH(1, dash). The new molecule has H(4, dash), OH(1, wedge), CH3(3, dash), C_middle(2, plane). For this new molecule, the sequence 1->2->3 is from wedge to plane to dash, which is CCW. CCW gives S. Since we did one swap, the original configuration is R).\n    Based on consistent results from procedural methods, the configuration of C_left is **(R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three chiral centers have the (R) configuration. Listing them from left to right as they appear in the drawing:\n*   The leftmost chiral center (with the OH group) is **R**.\n*   The middle chiral center (with the ethyl group) is **R**.\n*   The rightmost chiral center (with the CH2NH2 group) is **R**.\n\nIf we determine the IUPAC name, which is (2R,3R,4R)-4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol, the chiral centers C-2, C-3, and C-4 correspond to the C_left, C_middle, and C_right, respectively. This confirms the configurations are all R.\n\nThe absolute configuration is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<The absolute configuration of the chiral centers, from left to right in the provided image, is R, R, and R. If using IUPAC numbering, the configuration is (2R, 3R, 4R).>>>"
