    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the question's text.**\nThe question provides several key clues:\n*   It refers to an **illusion**. This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   It compares the illusion to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a 2D drawing that can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. This suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain choosing between two or more possible interpretations of a sensory input.\n*   It describes the phenomenon as a **\"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"** This implies it's a fundamental process our brain uses to make sense of the world, often without our awareness.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the image.**\nThe image consists of two plots, representing an auditory stimulus and its perception.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We see a steady horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is completely interrupted for a short period. During the interruption, there is a vertical bar, representing a burst of sound containing many frequencies (i.e., noise). Physically, the stimulus is: TONE -> NOISE -> TONE. The tone does not exist during the noise burst.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of a sound wave over time. It depicts a continuous, regular oscillation (a sine wave) that persists from left to right. Even in the region corresponding to the noise burst in the top plot, the underlying wave pattern seems to continue, albeit with some added complexity. This represents the *perception* of a continuous tone.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the information from the text and the image.**\nThe image illustrates an auditory illusion where a sound that is physically interrupted by a louder sound (the noise burst) is perceived by the listener as being continuous. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, assuming that the tone continued \"behind\" the noise.\n\nThis fits all the clues from the question:\n*   **Illusion:** The physical reality (interrupted tone) differs from the perception (continuous tone).\n*   **Ambiguity:** The brain could interpret the sounds as \"tone stops, noise starts, noise stops, tone starts again.\" Instead, it prefers the more plausible real-world interpretation that \"a continuous tone was briefly obscured by a burst of noise.\" This choice between interpretations is analogous to the Necker Cube.\n*   **Unconscious Ability:** This \"filling-in\" process, known as perceptual completion or restoration, is an automatic function of the auditory system to create a coherent understanding of the acoustic environment.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nThis specific auditory illusion is a classic example used in psychoacoustics. The general term for it is the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. However, the most famous and widely studied version of this phenomenon involves speech. When a speech sound (a phoneme) within a word is replaced by a noise like a cough, listeners not only perceive the word as complete but often cannot even identify which phoneme was missing. This specific, powerful example was named the **phonemic restoration effect** by its discoverer, Richard M. Warren. Due to its fame and significance in understanding speech perception, this name is often associated with the general principle as well.\n\nGiven the description of a \"surprisingly common\" ability, the phonemic restoration effect is an excellent fit, as it demonstrates how robust this perceptual mechanism is in our primary mode of communication.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
