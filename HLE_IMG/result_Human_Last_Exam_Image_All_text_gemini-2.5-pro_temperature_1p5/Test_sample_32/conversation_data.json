    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the primary, easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte generation of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the foot (embedded in the gametophyte), the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains the spores).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scientific Names:** The specific epithets (the second part of the scientific name) often provide descriptive clues.\n    *   *montana* means \"of the mountains,\" referring to its habitat.\n    *   *curviseta* is a combination of Latin words: *curvus* meaning \"curved\" and *seta* referring to the stalk of the sporophyte. This name strongly suggests that a key feature of this species is a curved seta.\n\n3.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***:\n    *   Botanical descriptions note that *Grimmia montana* has a sporophyte with a very short and **straight** seta.\n    *   Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held upright (erect) and is typically immersed among the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem where the sporophyte grows).\n    *   The image provided, showing erect, sessile-looking capsules nestled among the leaves, is a good representation of the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n4.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***:\n    *   As its name implies, the defining characteristic of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte is its seta. The seta is distinctly **curved**, often in a swan-neck or arc shape.\n    *   This curved seta causes the capsule to be exserted (pushed out beyond the leaves) but to hang downwards or to the side in a nodding (cernuous) or drooping orientation.\n\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   **Seta:** The most fundamental difference is in the seta. *G. montana* has a short, **straight seta**. *G. curviseta* has a longer, **curved seta**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** This difference in the seta directly leads to a difference in capsule orientation, which is what is seen \"at a glance.\" The straight seta of *G. montana* results in an **erect, immersed capsule**. The curved seta of *G. curviseta* results in a **nodding or drooping capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While capsule orientation is the visible result, the underlying structural difference is the shape and length of the seta.\n*   **\"At a glance\" feature:** The straight, upright capsule versus a curved, drooping capsule is a very clear macroscopic feature that requires no microscope to observe.\n*   **Significance:** This feature is a key diagnostic character used in botanical keys to separate these and other related species in the genus *Grimmia*.\n*   **Image context:** The provided image shows erect capsules on what must be very short, straight setae, which is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*, not *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the **seta (stalk)**. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect and immersed capsule. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctly curved seta, which causes its capsule to be exserted and to nod or droop.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed within the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved, causing the capsule to nod or droop.>>>"
