    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image shows a close-up of an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus of the photograph. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting more of the same type of vegetation.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect's Features**\nTo identify the insect, we need to look at its specific characteristics:\n*   **Order:** The insect has features consistent with a true bug (Order: Hemiptera). These features include long antennae, a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and what appears to be hemelytra (wings that are tough and leathery at the base and membranous at the tips), although the wing tips are not perfectly clear.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern of black and reddish-orange. This type of bright coloration in insects is often aposematic, meaning it serves as a warning to predators.\n*   **Body Pattern:**\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with prominent reddish eyes.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section immediately behind the head (the pronotum) is mostly black, with a distinct, broad reddish-orange band across its posterior (rear) edge.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings are mostly black but are marked with a reddish-orange 'X' shape. The upper arms of the 'X' are clearly visible in the image.\n*   **Appendages:** The insect has black legs and long, black, segmented antennae.\n\n**Step 3: Examination of the Environment**\nThe insect is on a flower head of what appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* species). Many insects are found on goldenrod in late summer and fall, feeding on nectar or pollen. Knowing the plant can sometimes help with insect identification.\n\n**Step 4: Identification by Comparison**\nThe combination of the specific black and reddish-orange 'X' pattern is a key diagnostic feature. Let's compare this to common insects with similar coloration:\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** This bug is black with red/orange *lines* on the edges of its wings and down the center of its thorax. The pattern is different from the broad bands and 'X' seen in the image.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug is larger and has a different pattern. It is orange with a distinct black band across the middle of its wings and black triangular markings on the thorax. This does not match the image.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug perfectly matches the features observed. It is known for its black coloration with a red/orange transverse band on the pronotum and a prominent red/orange 'X' mark on its back (formed by the markings on the hemelytra). They are often found on milkweed but will also feed on the nectar of other plants like goldenrod, especially as adults.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the distinct markings—specifically the reddish-orange band on the pronotum and the 'X' pattern on the wings—the insect depicted in the image is unequivocally identified as the Small Milkweed Bug. The scientific name for this species is composed of its genus (*Lygaeus*) and species (*kalmii*).\n\nTherefore, the scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
