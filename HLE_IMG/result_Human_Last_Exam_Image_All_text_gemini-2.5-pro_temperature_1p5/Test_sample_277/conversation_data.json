    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The task is to determine the relationship between the molecules shown in the image and choose the correct option from the list. The options are different types of isomers or relationships between molecules (conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, stereoisomers, or none of these).\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Image:** The image provided is a solid black rectangle. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or any molecules depicted in the image.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". The phrase \"mentioned above\" refers to the image.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:** Since the image is empty and contains no molecules, there is nothing to compare or analyze. We cannot determine their molecular formulas, the connectivity of their atoms, or their spatial arrangements.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** To determine if molecules are conformers, we need to see at least two structures of the same molecule that can be interconverted by bond rotation. This information is not available.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** To determine if molecules are constitutional isomers, we need to see their structures to compare their molecular formulas and connectivity. This information is not available.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if molecules are identical, we need to see their structures. This information is not available.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** To determine if molecules are stereoisomers, we need to see their structures to confirm they have the same formula and connectivity but differ in the 3D arrangement of atoms. This information is not available.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** Since it is impossible to classify the relationship between the non-existent molecules based on the provided information, none of the specific classifications (a, b, c, d) can be chosen. The question is unanswerable as posed because the prerequisite data (the molecules) are missing. Therefore, \"None of these\" is the only logical conclusion.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The primary and most crucial point is recognizing that the image is blank.\n*   The question is fundamentally flawed because it refers to objects (\"the molecules\") that are not present.\n*   One must not guess or assume what molecules might have been intended. The analysis must be based strictly on what is provided.\n*   Because no specific relationship can be established due to the lack of data, the \"None of these\" option becomes correct by default. It correctly reflects the fact that the relationship cannot be described by any of the other options.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the image does not provide any molecules to compare. Consequently, we cannot determine any isomeric relationship between them. This renders options (a), (b), (c), and (d) inapplicable. The only valid choice is (e).\n\n<<<E>>>"
