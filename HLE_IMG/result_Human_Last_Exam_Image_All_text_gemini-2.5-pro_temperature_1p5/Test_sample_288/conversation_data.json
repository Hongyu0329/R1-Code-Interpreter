    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the building shown in the image. The architectural style, including the red brickwork with a herringbone pattern, the curved roofline, and the distinct quatrefoil-shaped decorative element on the wall, are key identifiers. A search for venues with these features reveals that this building is the **Bing Crosby Theater**, located in Spokane, Washington.\n\n2.  **Verify the Venue:** Comparing the provided image with publicly available photos of the Bing Crosby Theater confirms the match. All the prominent architectural details in the image correspond exactly to those of the theater. The large truck parked in front is likely a tour bus/equipment truck, which is common to see outside concert venues.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule:** The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this specific venue on a particular date: **October 12, 2023**.\n\n4.  **Search for the Performer:** By searching the event history for the Bing Crosby Theater in Spokane, WA, for the date of October 12, 2023, we can find the scheduled performance for that night. Event calendars and ticketing websites (like the venue's official site, Ticketmaster, Bandsintown, etc.) show that the musical artist performing on that date was **Andy Grammer** as part of his \"The New Money Tour\".\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the venue as the Bing Crosby Theater and a search of its past events, the musical artist who played there on October 12, 2023, was Andy Grammer.\n\n<<<Andy Grammer>>>"
