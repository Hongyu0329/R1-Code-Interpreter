    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The question presents four coordination complexes of Iridium(III), which are used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). The task is to determine which of these complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes:** All four complexes share a common structural motif. They are cationic octahedral Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III).\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** This is a diimine ligand, specifically 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). This ligand is identical in all four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily improve solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions (aggregation quenching).\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** These are cyclometalating ligands, where the ligand coordinates to the iridium center through both a carbon atom of a phenyl ring (C-Ir bond) and a nitrogen atom of a pyridine ring (N-Ir bond). The C^N ligand is derived from 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of these two C^N ligands.\n    *   **Counterion:** Hexafluorophosphate (PF6-), a common non-coordinating anion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Differences in C^N Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Each of the two C^N ligands has two fluorine atoms, one at the 2'-position (ortho to the C-Ir bond) and one at the 4'-position (para to the C-Ir bond).\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has one fluorine atom at the 4'-position (para). The 2'-position has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has one fluorine atom at the 2'-position (ortho).\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has no fluorine substituents.\n\n4.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an emitter in an LEC is largely dependent on its chemical and photochemical stability. A major degradation pathway for cyclometalated iridium complexes involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, which is generally the kinetically weakest bond in the coordination sphere. The stability of the complex, and thus its lifetime, can be enhanced by strengthening this bond and preventing side reactions.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorination:**\n    *   **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative element. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) lowers the energy levels of the molecular orbitals of the ligand. This has two key consequences:\n        a.  It increases the oxidation potential of the complex, making it more resistant to oxidative degradation, which is a common failure mode in electroluminescent devices.\n        b.  It strengthens the C-Ir sigma bond, making the ligand less likely to dissociate from the metal center.\n    *   **Bond Strength Effect:** Replacing a C-H bond with a C-F bond significantly increases the bond energy (C-F bond is stronger than C-H bond). This is particularly important for positions on the ligand that might be involved in degradation reactions.\n\n6.  **Compare the Complexes based on Fluorination:**\n    *   **Overall Fluorination:** Based on the general principle that fluorination enhances stability, we can predict a rough order of stability. Complex 1 has the most fluorine atoms (4 total), Complexes 2 and 3 are intermediate (2 total), and Complex 4 has none. This suggests a stability/lifetime order of: 1 > (2, 3) > 4.\n\n7.  **Consider the Position of Fluorination:** The position of the substituent is critical. The C-H bond at the 2'-position (ortho to the cyclometalated carbon) is known to be a particularly vulnerable site for degradation. This can occur through various mechanisms, including oxidative addition or reductive elimination pathways involving the metal center.\n    *   **Complexes 1 and 3:** Both have a fluorine atom at the 2'-position. This C-F bond is much stronger and less reactive than a C-H bond. Therefore, this substitution effectively blocks a key degradation pathway, leading to significantly enhanced stability. These complexes are expected to have **longer lifetimes**.\n    *   **Complexes 2 and 4:** Both lack a fluorine atom at the 2'-position, meaning they retain the more vulnerable C-H bond at this critical site. While Complex 2 has some electronic stabilization from the para-fluoro group, both are susceptible to degradation pathways involving the ortho C-H bond. Therefore, they are expected to be less stable than complexes 1 and 3. These complexes are expected to have **shorter lifetimes**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The presence or absence of a fluorine atom at the 2'-position of the phenylpyridine ligand is the most critical structural feature determining the relative stability and lifetime of these emitters. Complexes [2] and [4] lack this key stabilizing feature and are therefore expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to complexes [1] and [3].\n\nFinal check:\n*   Long lifetime group: [1] (2'-F and 4'-F), [3] (2'-F).\n*   Short lifetime group: [2] (4'-F only, 2'-H), [4] (no F, 2'-H).\nThe question asks for the complexes with shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to the group {2, 4}.\n\n<<<I>>>"
