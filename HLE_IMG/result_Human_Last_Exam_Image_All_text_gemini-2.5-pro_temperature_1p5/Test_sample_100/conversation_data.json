    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is a bicyclic lactam. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system.\n    *   The core bicyclic lactam structure is C6H5NO.\n    *   It has a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to the double bond, replacing one hydrogen. So we add C1F3 and subtract H1. The formula becomes C7H4F3NO.\n    *   The nitrogen atom is protected by a p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB). The PMB group is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3, which has the formula C8H9O.\n    *   Adding the PMB group to the nitrogen (and removing the H that was on the nitrogen of the parent lactam) gives a net addition of C8H8O.\n    *   Let's sum it all up:\n        *   Let's count the atoms directly from the structure to be certain.\n        *   Bicyclic framework (without substituents): 6 Carbons, 1 Nitrogen, 1 Oxygen (from carbonyl). Hydrogens: 2 at bridgeheads (C1, C4), 2 at the CH2 bridge (C7), 1 at the double bond (C6). Total: 5H. So the core is C6H5NO.\n        *   Substituents: -CF3 group (1C, 3F), PMB group (C8H9O). The CF3 group replaces an H on the double bond. The PMB group replaces the H on the nitrogen.\n        *   Total Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n        *   Total Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) - 1 (replaced by CF3) + 9 (from PMB) = 13. Let me recount.\n        *   Let's count again: Core C1(CH), C4(CH), C7(CH2), C6(CH), C5(C-CF3), N2(N-PMB), C3(C=O). Total C: 6. Total H: 1+1+2+1=5. This is the C,H count of the core skeleton. So far C6H5. Add N, O: C6H5NO. Add CF3: C7H5F3NO. Add PMB: remove H from N, add C8H9O. Formula: C7H4F3NO + C8H9O = C15H13F3NO2. Let's re-verify the PMB hydrogen count. -CH2(2H) + -C6H4-(4H) + -OCH3(3H) = 9H. Yes. Let's re-verify the core hydrogen count. C1(CH), C4(CH), C7(CH2), C6(CH), C5=C(CF3). Total H on core = 1+1+2+1=5. H on parent N = 1. Total H before substituents = 6. Remove one H for CF3 and one H for PMB. Total H = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4. Then add the 9H from PMB. Total H = 4+9 = 13. My previous calculation was wrong.\n        *   Let's try one more time, carefully. C=15. N=1. F=3. O=2. H count: PMB has 9H. Core: C1(CH), C4(CH), C7(CH2), C6(CH), C5(no H). So H on core = 1+1+2+1=5. Total H = 5+9 = 14. This matches my first calculation. Okay, let's proceed with **C15H14F3NO2**.\n*   **Reaction 1:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O. This reagent is a classic choice for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   PMB group formula: C8H9O.\n    *   Change in formula: Remove C8H9O, add H. Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The formula of **Intermediate 1 is C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in MeOH. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n    *   This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) and the trifluoromethyl group are stable under these conditions.\n    *   Change in formula: +H2.\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:**\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   The formula of **Intermediate 2 is C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction to find the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N HCl at 70Â°C. These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). Amides are hydrolyzed by strong acid and heat.\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond (the N-C=O bond) by adding a molecule of water (H2O) across it.\n    *   The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This opens the ring.\n    *   The overall transformation is the addition of one water molecule to Intermediate 2.\n    *   Change in formula: +H2O.\n*   **Final Product Formula:**\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
