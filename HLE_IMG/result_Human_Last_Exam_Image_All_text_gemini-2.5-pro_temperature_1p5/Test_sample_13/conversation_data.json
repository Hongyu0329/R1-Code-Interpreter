    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Labeling the Grid and Identifying Key Clues**\nLet's label the crucial white squares in the top section of the puzzle to make the analysis clear.\n- Let `A` be the top-left white square.\n- Let `B` be the top-right white square.\n- Let `D` be the square directly below `A`.\n- Let `C` be the square to the left of `D`.\n\nThe question asks for the values of `A` and `B`. We will focus on the clues that directly relate to these and neighboring squares. The standard Kakuro rules apply: fill squares with digits 1-9, digits in a block (row or column run) must sum to the clue, and digits cannot be repeated within the same block.\n\nFrom the puzzle image, we can identify the following clues and the blocks they correspond to:\n- **Clue 15:** This is a row clue for the top two squares, `A` and `B`.\n  *   Equation 1: `A + B = 15`\n- **Clue 17:** This is a column clue for the two squares `A` and `D`.\n  *   Equation 2: `A + D = 17`\n- **Clue 10:** This is a row clue for the two squares `C` and `D`.\n  *   Equation 3: `C + D = 10`\n\n**2. Analyzing the Equations to Find Possible Values**\nWe can use these three equations to determine the possible values for A, B, C, and D.\n\n- From Equation 2 (`A + D = 17`), since `A` and `D` must be single, unique digits from 1 to 9, the only possible pair is `{8, 9}`. So, either `A=8` and `D=9`, or `A=9` and `D=8`.\n\n- From Equation 1 (`A + B = 15`), `A` cannot be smaller than 6 (since the max value for B is 9, 15-9=6) and `B` cannot be smaller than 6 (since the max value for A is 9, 15-9=6).\n\nCombining these, `A` must be either 8 or 9. Let's explore these two cases.\n\n**Case 1: A = 8**\n- If `A = 8`, then from `A + D = 17`, we get `D = 9`.\n- With `D = 9`, from `C + D = 10`, we get `C = 1`.\n- With `A = 8`, from `A + B = 15`, we get `B = 7`.\n- This gives a potential solution set: `A=8`, `B=7`, `C=1`, `D=9`. These are all valid, distinct digits.\n\n**Case 2: A = 9**\n- If `A = 9`, then from `A + D = 17`, we get `D = 8`.\n- With `D = 8`, from `C + D = 10`, we get `C = 2`.\n- With `A = 9`, from `A + B = 15`, we get `B = 6`.\n- This gives a second potential solution set: `A=9`, `B=6`, `C=2`, `D=8`. These are also valid, distinct digits.\n\n**3. Using Additional Clues to Eliminate a Case**\nWe now have two possible pairs for (A, B): (8, 7) or (9, 6). To determine the correct one, we must use more clues from the puzzle. Let's introduce the cells below D and B.\n- Let `H` be the cell below `D`.\n- Let `I` be the cell in the same row as `H`, but in the column under `B`.\n- Let `G` be the cell to the left of `H`.\n\nThe puzzle provides more clues:\n- **Clue 22:** This is a row clue for the block `G, H, I`.\n  *   Equation 4: `G + H + I = 22`\n- **Clue 29:** This is a column clue for the block starting with `B`. Let's assume it's a 4-cell block `B, E, I, M` (where E is below B, I is below E, M is below I).\n  *   Equation 5: `B + E + I + M = 29`\n\nLet's test our two cases against these new constraints.\n\n**Analysis of Case 1 (A=8, B=7, C=1, D=9)**\n1.  The column containing `A` and `D` also contains `H`. Digits in this column must be unique. So, `H` cannot be `A` (8) or `D` (9).\n2.  The row `G+H+I=22`. The only sets of unique digits summing to 22 are `{5,8,9}` and `{6,7,9}`.\n3.  Since `H` can't be 8 or 9, `H` must be from the set `{6,7,9}`. Therefore, `H` must be 6 or 7.\n4.  The column containing `B` also contains `I`. Digits in this column must be unique. So, `I` cannot be `B` (7).\n5.  If `H=6`, then `{G,I}` must be `{7,9}` to sum to 22. But `I` cannot be 7, so this forces `I=9` and `G=7`. This appears consistent.\n6.  Let's check this sub-case (`H=6, I=9, G=7`) with Equation 5 (`B+E+I+M=29`). We have `B=7` and `I=9`. The equation becomes `7 + E + 9 + M = 29`, which simplifies to `E + M = 13`.\n7.  The digits determined so far in this branch are A=8, B=7, C=1, D=9, H=6, G=7, I=9. The unique digits used are `{1, 6, 7, 8, 9}`. `E` and `M` must be chosen from the remaining available digits: `{2, 3, 4, 5}`. The maximum sum of two distinct digits from this set is `4+5=9`. It is impossible for `E+M` to equal 13.\n8.  This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nSince Case 1 (`A=8, B=7`) is impossible, the only remaining possibility is Case 2.\n\n**Verification of Case 2 (A=9, B=6, C=2, D=8)**\n- This case must be the correct one.\n- The values for the top two squares are `A=9` and `B=6`.\n\nThe two numbers present in the two top white squares are 9 and 6.\n\n9,6"
