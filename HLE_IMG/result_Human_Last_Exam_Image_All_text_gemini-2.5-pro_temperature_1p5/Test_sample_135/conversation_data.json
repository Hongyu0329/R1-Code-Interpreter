    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the artwork detail.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Content:** The image shows a three-dimensional relief sculpture, not a painting. The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the Eucharist (Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including children and adults. The composition is contained within a decorative circular frame, known as a *tondo*. The overall aesthetic is one of reverence and piety.\n\n2.  **Examine the Style:** The style of the figures is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school. The figures have gentle, sweet expressions, idealized features, and gracefully flowing drapery. The relief is expertly modeled to create a sense of depth and naturalism. The decorative border around the tondo is also typical of this period.\n\n3.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   **The Medium:** The work appears to be a terracotta (fired clay) relief, possibly glazed, which was a medium famously perfected and popularized by a specific Florentine workshop.\n    *   **The Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, on a scroll-like banner (*cartouche*), the words \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" are visible. This is an archaic Italian/French spelling for \"Sacramenti de l'Autel,\" which translates to \"Sacraments of the Altar.\" This confirms the subject is the Sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n4.  **Connect Style and Medium to a Specific Workshop:** The combination of glazed terracotta relief, the specific sweet and graceful style, and the religious subject matter are all hallmarks of the Della Robbia family workshop, founded by Luca della Robbia in 15th-century Florence. His nephew, Andrea della Robbia, continued and expanded the workshop, often creating more complex and narrative scenes with a similar, though sometimes more elaborate, style.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Artwork and Artist:** By searching for \"Della Robbia,\" \"Sacramenti de l'Autel,\" or \"terracotta tondo Eucharist,\" we can identify the specific altarpiece this detail comes from. This tondo is a well-known detail from the *Altare dei Sacramenti* (Altarpiece of the Sacraments). This monumental terracotta altarpiece is located in the Basilica of San Bernardino in L'Aquila, Italy. Art historians and documentation consistently attribute the creation of this specific altarpiece to **Andrea della Robbia**, who completed it around 1482.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Medium Identification:** Recognizing the artwork as a relief sculpture (specifically terracotta) rather than a painting is the first critical step.\n*   **Stylistic Nuance:** It is important to distinguish between the works of Luca della Robbia and his nephew Andrea. While both worked in a similar style, Andrea's work is often characterized by a greater number of figures, more detailed compositions, and a slightly sweeter sentimentality, all of which are present in this scene.\n*   **Inscription as Confirmation:** The text \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a vital clue that directly confirms the subject matter and aids in searching for the specific piece.\n*   **Artwork Location:** Associating this specific detail with the larger Altarpiece in L'Aquila provides definitive proof of its authorship, as that work is firmly documented as being by Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the stylistic analysis, the medium of glazed terracotta relief, the inscription, and its identification as a detail from the *Altarpiece of the Sacraments* in L'Aquila, the author of this work is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
