*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** Formed via [3+2] cycloaddition of the ylide intermediate (D) with methyl propiolate to give adduct P, followed by reduction of the double bond and transesterification of the methyl ester to an ethyl ester (from TEA).
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** Formed via [3+2] cycloaddition of the ylide (D) with methyl propiolate to give adduct P, followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid.
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** Formed by the trapping of the ylide intermediate (D) with acetic acid (which is formed as a byproduct).
