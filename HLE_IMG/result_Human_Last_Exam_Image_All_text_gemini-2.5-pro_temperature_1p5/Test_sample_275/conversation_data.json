    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Provided Information**\nThe goal is to determine the total number of unique mRNA splice species detected by the RT-PCR experiments shown in the image.\n*   **The system:** A 7,857 bp genome with several Open Reading Frames (ORFs/exons) like E1, E2, E4, E5, L1, L2, etc. Splicing removes introns between these exons.\n*   **The technique:** RT-PCR amplifies specific segments of mRNA after it has been converted to cDNA. Different bands in a single PCR reaction lane indicate different splice variants.\n*   **Key components:**\n    *   **Primers:** Forward primers (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3) and reverse primers (E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R) target specific exons.\n    *   **Splice-junction primers:** E1F2 and E1F3 are special primers that only bind to a specific, newly formed junction created by splicing (E1F2 binds to 929^3465 junction; E1F3 binds to 929^3506 junction). This allows for the specific detection of certain splice events.\n    *   **Polyadenylation Sites:** AE (early) and AL (late) indicate that transcripts can end at different locations, creating distinct classes of mRNA. Transcripts ending at AE would contain early region genes (like E1, E4, E5), while those ending at AL would also contain late region genes (L2, L1).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each PCR Panel to Identify Splice Variants**\n\nWe will systematically go through each panel (B through I) and identify the splice species indicated by the PCR products. A \"splice species\" is a unique mRNA molecule.\n\n1.  **Panel C (Primers E1F1/E5R): Transcripts terminating at the early poly(A) site (AE)**\n    *   This PCR amplifies a region from exon E1 to exon E5. Products from this reaction likely represent mRNAs that terminate at the early polyadenylation site (AE), located just after E5.\n    *   **Result:** Two bands are observed: band 1 (584 bp) and band 2 (553 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates two distinct splice species that include exons E1 through E5.\n        *   **Species 1:** A longer variant (corresponding to the 584 bp product).\n        *   **Species 2:** A shorter variant, 31 bp smaller (corresponding to the 553 bp product). This 31 bp difference points to an alternative splice site being used.\n\n2.  **Panel F (Primers E1F2/L2R): A specific late transcript containing L2**\n    *   Primer E1F2 is specific for the 929^3465 splice junction. The reverse primer is in L2, a late gene.\n    *   **Result:** A single band of 972 bp is observed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a single, specific splice species that contains the 929^3465 splice junction and extends into the L2 gene. This is a new species, different from the first two which terminated earlier.\n        *   **Species 3:** The transcript detected by E1F2/L2R.\n\n3.  **Panel G (Primers E1F3/L2R): More late transcripts containing L2**\n    *   Primer E1F3 is specific for a different splice junction (929^3506). The reverse primer is also in L2.\n    *   **Result:** Two distinct bands are observed: band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies two additional, distinct splice species.\n        *   **Species 4:** One that contains the 929^3506 junction and extends to L2 (1,003 bp product).\n        *   **Species 5:** Another variant that also contains the 929^3506 junction but is 72 bp smaller (931 bp product), indicating an additional downstream splice event removing 72 bp somewhere between the E1F3 primer binding site and the L2R primer binding site.\n\n4.  **Panel I (Primers E1F1/L1R): Late transcripts containing L1**\n    *   This PCR uses a general forward primer in E1 and a reverse primer in the late gene L1. It detects transcripts that extend all the way to the late polyadenylation site (AL). The high cycle count (30) allows detection of less common species.\n    *   **Result:** Four distinct bands are observed: 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Each band represents a unique way of splicing the long region between exon E1 and exon L1. This reveals four more distinct splice species.\n        *   **Species 6:** Corresponds to the 450 bp product.\n        *   **Species 7:** Corresponds to the 419 bp product. (The 31 bp difference between Species 6 and 7 likely corresponds to the same alternative splice site usage seen in Panel C).\n        *   **Species 8:** Corresponds to the 378 bp product, indicating a different splicing pattern.\n        *   **Species 9:** Corresponds to the 187 bp product, representing a highly spliced variant.\n\n### **Step 3: Consolidate the Findings and Count the Species**\n\nLet's summarize the unique splice species identified from the analysis of the key panels:\n\n*   From **Panel C**, we identified **2 species** that terminate at the early polyadenylation site (AE).\n*   From **Panel F**, we identified **1 species** that contains L2.\n*   From **Panel G**, we identified **2 more species** that contain L2.\n*   From **Panel I**, we identified **4 species** that contain L1.\n\nOther panels (B, D, E, H) serve to confirm the structures of these species but do not reveal new ones that haven't been accounted for. For instance, the two bands in Panel B are fragments of the same species identified in Panels C and I.\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 (from C) + 1 (from F) + 2 (from G) + 4 (from I) = **9**.\n\nEach of these 9 products represents a uniquely processed mRNA molecule, and therefore a distinct splice species.\n\n<<<9>>>"
