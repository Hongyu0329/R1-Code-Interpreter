    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n*   The image shows a bright, golden-yellow organism growing on rocks.\n*   The organism has a leafy or lobed appearance (foliose) and features small, cup-like structures on its surface. These structures are called apothecia, which are the fungal reproductive organs.\n*   This morphology is characteristic of lichens. Specifically, the vibrant color and form strongly suggest it is a member of the genus *Xanthoria*.\n*   Given the location is Acadia National Park, a common species matching this description is *Xanthoria parietina*, often called the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen. This lichen is frequently found on rocks in coastal environments.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific protein mentioned.**\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism.\n*   \"XPH1\" is a specific protein name. The \"X\" likely refers to the genus *Xanthoria*, and \"PH\" often stands for photolyase, an enzyme that repairs DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) light. This makes sense for a lichen, which is often exposed to direct sunlight.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information in a scientific database.**\n*   To find the precise number of amino acids, we need to consult a public protein sequence database, such as UniProt or NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n*   A search for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" in the UniProt database leads to the protein entry with the accession number **Q9S8L7**.\n*   This entry is named \"Class II photolyase-related protein 1\" and confirms it belongs to the organism *Xanthoria parietina*. The gene name is listed as *XPH1*.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids.**\n*   The UniProt entry for Q9S8L7 provides detailed information about the protein, including its sequence.\n*   The \"Sequence\" section of the entry states the length of the protein.\n*   For protein Q9S8L7 (XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina*), the length is explicitly listed as **591 amino acids**.\n*   This can be cross-verified using the NCBI database. The corresponding protein entry (accession number AAF04245.1) also lists the length as 591 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe organism in the image is *Xanthoria parietina*. Its encoded XPH1 protein, a Class II photolyase-related protein, consists of 591 amino acids.\n\n<<<591>>>"
