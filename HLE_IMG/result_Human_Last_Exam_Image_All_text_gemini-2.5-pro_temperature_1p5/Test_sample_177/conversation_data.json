    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when changing from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we care about the miles the car drives, not the number of people inside it. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed for this calculation.\n*   **\"Car\" definition:** Car travel includes both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We must sum the mode shares of these two categories to get the total car mode share for each distance bracket.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** We cannot simply average the mode shares. We must calculate a weighted total VMT for each scenario, taking into account the \"share of total trips\" for each distance category.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\nThe total VMT is a weighted sum across all distance categories. The formula for the contribution of each category is:\n`(Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for that distance) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n**Baseline Data (Table 1):**\n*   **Distance 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n*   **Distance 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **Distance 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **Distance 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT (VMT_Baseline):**\n`VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077` (This is a weighted index, not an absolute number, which is sufficient for calculating a percentage change).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\nWe use the same method with the data from Table 2.\n\n**Proposed Data (Table 2):**\n*   **Distance 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **Distance 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **Distance 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **Distance 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT (VMT_Proposed):**\n`VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) × 100`\n\n`Reduction % = ((VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline) × 100`\n`Reduction % = ((4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077) × 100`\n`Reduction % = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100`\n`Reduction % = 0.52195... × 100`\n`Reduction % ≈ 52.2%`\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
