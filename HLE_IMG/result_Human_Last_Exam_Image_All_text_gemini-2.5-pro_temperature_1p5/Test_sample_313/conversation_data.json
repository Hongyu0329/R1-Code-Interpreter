    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information.**\n*   The image provided is a black and white photograph of two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   One man (on the right) is younger with a beard and is smiling while shaking hands with an older man.\n*   The older man (on the left) is handing a trophy to the younger man.\n*   The question specifies the date of the event as June 20, 2019. A search for major award ceremonies on or around this date points to the NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   By searching for images from the 2019 NHL Awards, we can identify the man on the right as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. On that night, he won several awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP). The man presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. The trophy shown in the image matches the Hart Memorial Trophy.\n*   So, the image shows Nikita Kucherov receiving the Hart Memorial Trophy on June 19/20, 2019.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clue.**\n*   The clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical use of mercury. One of the most famous historical examples of mercury poisoning is in the felt-hat making industry.\n*   Mercuric nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur for making felt hats. Hatmakers, or \"hatters,\" who were exposed to the mercury vapors often developed neurological damage, a condition known as erethism mercurialis.\n*   This condition gave rise to the popular English phrase \"mad as a hatter,\" and the character of the **Mad Hatter** in Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*.\n*   Therefore, the textual clue strongly suggests that \"X Y\" is \"Mad Hatter\".\n\n**Step 3: Connect the visual information with the textual clue.**\n*   We need to establish how \"Mad Hatter\" (our proposed \"X Y\") is \"pictured\" in the image of Nikita Kucherov receiving his award. This connection is based on wordplay and metaphor, which is common in riddles.\n*   **Hatter:** The award Kucherov is receiving is the **Hart** Memorial Trophy. The word \"Hart\" is a homophone (sounds the same as) \"Hat\". Furthermore, as a hockey player, Kucherov is in a profession known for the \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals in a game), strengthening the \"hat\" association. Someone who deals with hats is a \"hatter\".\n*   **Mad:** Kucherov won the MVP award for his extraordinary 2018-2019 season, where he scored 128 points. His performance could be described using the slang term \"mad,\" meaning \"insanely good\" or \"crazy talented.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** By combining these points, Nikita Kucherov, who had a \"mad\" season and is pictured receiving the \"Hart\" (Hat) trophy, can be cryptically described as a **\"Mad Hatter\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Final verification.**\n*   **Clue 1:** A \"Mad Hatter\" (a symbolic representation of one) is pictured at the event on June 20, 2019. (Check)\n*   **Clue 2:** Another \"Mad Hatter\" (the original mercury-poisoned hat makers) has almost ceased to exist because the practice was stopped due to toxicity. (Check)\n*   The two-word phrase \"Mad Hatter\" fits the \"X Y\" format of the question.\n\nThe analysis of all clues points to a single consistent answer.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
