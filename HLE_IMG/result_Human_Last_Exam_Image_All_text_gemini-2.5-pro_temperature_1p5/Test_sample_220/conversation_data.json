    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure:**\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n    *   If the lattice constant (the edge length of the cube) is 'a', the atomic positions in the conventional unit cell can be described by coordinates (x,y,z) where the coordinates are either all integers (for corners, considering a lattice of cells) or two are half-integers and one is an integer (for face centers). For example, inside one cell [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1], the corner is at (0,0,0) and face centers are at (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2), plus their permutations and translations.\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    *   The direction [110] corresponds to a vector pointing along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell.\n    *   Viewing along this direction means we are looking at the projection of the 3D atomic positions onto a plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector. This plane is crystallographically denoted as the (110) plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Projected Atomic Pattern:**\n    *   We need to determine what the arrangement of atoms looks like when projected onto the (110) plane.\n    *   We can set up a new 2D coordinate system on this plane. A convenient choice for the axes would be vectors that are orthogonal to [110] and to each other. The crystallographic directions [1 -1 0] and [0 0 1] are suitable choices.\n    *   The projection of the 3D FCC lattice onto this plane results in a 2D lattice. Through a formal crystallographic projection analysis (projecting the primitive FCC lattice vectors), it can be shown that the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   A centered rectangular lattice consists of points at the corners of a rectangle and one point in the exact center of the rectangle. This pattern repeats to fill the plane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Aspect Ratio of the Projected Rectangle:**\n    *   The dimensions of the rectangular unit cell in the projection are determined by the spacing of atoms in the FCC lattice.\n    *   The side of the rectangle corresponding to the [0 0 1] direction has a length of 'a' (the lattice constant).\n    *   The side of the rectangle corresponding to the [1 -1 0] direction has a length of `a√2`.\n    *   Therefore, the aspect ratio of the rectangle is (a√2) / a = **√2 ≈ 1.414** (or its inverse, 1/√2 ≈ 0.707, depending on the orientation).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Images:**\n    *   We now look for the image that displays a **centered rectangular pattern** with an aspect ratio close to **1.414** or **0.707**.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a rectangular arrangement of atoms, but it's not centered. There are atoms at the corners of a rectangle, but the atoms in the middle are on a vertical line, not at the geometric center. This is a base-centered rectangular pattern, which is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image shows a **centered square** pattern. A rectangle is formed by atoms at approx. (3,3), (7,3), (3,7), (7,7) with a center atom at (5,5). A square is a special case of a rectangle, but its aspect ratio is 1. This does not match the required √2. (A centered square is typical for an FCC [100] projection).\n\n    *   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms is complex. It appears to be two simple rectangular lattices interleaved. It does not form a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular pattern**. For example, consider the rectangle with corners at approximately (x=1, y=6), (x=5, y=6), (x=1, y=12), and (x=5, y=12). There is an atom located at the center of this rectangle, at (x=3, y=9). This pattern repeats. Let's check the aspect ratio from the coordinates on the axes.\n        *   Width of the rectangle (W) = 5 - 1 = 4 units.\n        *   Height of the rectangle (H) = 12 - 6 = 6 units.\n        *   The aspect ratio can be calculated as H/W or W/H.\n            *   H/W = 6/4 = 1.5.\n            *   W/H = 4/6 ≈ 0.667.\n        *   Comparing these values to the theoretical ratios:\n            *   1.5 is very close to √2 ≈ 1.414.\n            *   0.667 is very close to 1/√2 ≈ 0.707.\n        *   The small discrepancy (~6%) is acceptable for a schematic diagram.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Image D is the only option that shows the correct centered rectangular pattern with an aspect ratio that closely matches the theoretical value for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
