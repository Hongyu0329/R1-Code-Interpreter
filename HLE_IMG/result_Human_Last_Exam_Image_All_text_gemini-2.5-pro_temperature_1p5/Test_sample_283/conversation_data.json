    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph.**\n    The image displays a Google Trends graph, which shows the relative search interest for three different search terms over time. The x-axis represents time, from December 2019 to after May 2023. The y-axis represents search interest on a scale of 0 to 100. There are three distinct lines: red, blue, and yellow, each representing a different search term.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the pattern in the data.**\n    The most prominent feature of all three lines is a series of sharp, regular peaks. These peaks occur at the same time each year, indicating that the search terms are related to annual events. The question states these are \"historic events,\" so the peaks likely correspond to the anniversaries or commemorations of these events.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the timing of the annual peaks for each line.**\n    *   **Red Line:** This line consistently peaks around late December or, more prominently, in January of each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line shows smaller but consistent peaks in late May or early June of each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line consistently peaks in November of each year (2020, 2021, 2022).\n\n*   **Step 4: Formulate a hypothesis by connecting the annual peaks to national holidays or commemorations of a specific country.**\n    We are looking for a single country that has three major annual historical commemorations in January, late May/early June, and November. Let's consider the United States.\n    *   **January (Red Line):** The United States celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the third Monday of January. This is a major federal holiday commemorating the life and legacy of the civil rights leader, a significant historical figure. This fits the timing of the red peaks.\n    *   **Late May (Blue Line):** The United States celebrates Memorial Day on the last Monday of May. This holiday honors military personnel who died in the service of their country, rooting it deeply in US military history. This fits the timing of the blue peaks.\n    *   **November (Yellow Line):** The United States celebrates Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. This holiday commemorates the 1621 harvest feast shared by the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people, a foundational event in American national mythology. This fits the timing of the yellow peaks.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis.**\n    The combination of these three specific timings is highly characteristic of the United States and its unique set of federal holidays and national commemorations. No other single country has a similar calendar of major historical events celebrated on these specific dates. For instance, Canada's Thanksgiving is in October, and the UK does not have major national holidays in January or May that fit this pattern. A historian would easily recognize this distinct annual rhythm of national remembrance as belonging to the United States.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n    The three historic events whose search interest is tracked are almost certainly Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, and Thanksgiving. All three of these events are commemorated annually in the United States. Therefore, the country is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
