    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all potential textual elements of the poem.**\nAn erasure poem is created by selecting words from a source text. In this collage, the source is an old book page. The elements available for the poem are not just the cut-out words but can also include prominent text from the original page, such as the title and page numbers.\n\nThe visible text elements are:\n*   **Title:** \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n*   **Page Number:** \"35\"\n*   **Plate Number:** \"Pl. 4\"\n*   **Cut-out words:** \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\"\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the poem and analyze its basic structure.**\nIf we only consider the cut-out words, arranged by their visual flow, the poem could be read as:\n\"rules\nand lines,\nan intricate spider's web\nwork\"\n\nAnalyzing this as a four-line poem:\n*   Line 1: 1 syllable\n*   Line 2: 2 syllables\n*   Line 3: 7 syllables\n*   Line 4: 1 syllable\nThis structure has no regular meter or consistent line length, which is characteristic of **free verse (A)**. This is a possible answer.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the other answer choices.**\nThe other answer choices refer to specific, structured poetic forms. Let's check if the poem fits any of them.\n*   **B. Iambic pentameter:** 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed pattern. This doesn't match.\n*   **C. Alexandrine:** 12 syllables per line, usually iambic. This doesn't match.\n*   **D. Sapphic:** A complex stanza of three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable line. This doesn't match.\n*   **E. Loose iambic trimeter:** Around 6 syllables per line in a loose iambic pattern. This doesn't match.\n*   **F. American Sentence:** A single sentence of exactly 17 syllables, a form invented by poet Allen Ginsberg.\n\n**Step 4: Test the \"American Sentence\" hypothesis.**\nThe presence of \"American Sentence\" as an option suggests we should investigate if a 17-syllable sentence can be constructed from the available text. This would involve a more complex reading, incorporating the text from the source page. Let's count the syllables of all available elements.\n*   \"THE FIRST STEP\": The (1) + first (1) + step (1) = **3 syllables**\n*   \"35\" (read as \"thirty-five\"): thir-ty-five (3) = **3 syllables**\n*   \"Pl. 4\" (read as \"Plate four\"): plate (1) + four (1) = **2 syllables**\n*   \"rules\": **1 syllable**\n*   \"and\": **1 syllable**\n*   \"lines,\": **1 syllable**\n*   \"an intricate spider's web\": an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) = **7 syllables**\n*   \"work\": **1 syllable**\n\nThe total number of available syllables is 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 = **19 syllables**.\n\nTo form a 17-syllable American Sentence, the poet would need to select elements totaling 17 syllables, meaning 2 syllables must be omitted from the total available.\n\n**Step 5: Construct the 17-syllable sentence.**\nLet's see if omitting 2 syllables can create a coherent sentence. The two shortest and most grammatically flexible words are \"and\" (1 syllable) and \"work\" (1 syllable). Let's omit them.\nThe remaining elements are: \"THE FIRST STEP\", \"thirty-five\", \"plate four\", \"rules\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\".\nLet's form a sentence:\n\"The first step, thirty-five, plate four, rules, lines, an intricate spider's web.\"\n\nNow, let's count the syllables in this constructed sentence:\n3 (The first step) + 3 (thirty-five) + 2 (plate four) + 1 (rules) + 1 (lines) + 7 (an intricate spider's web) = **17 syllables**.\n\nThis construction results in a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. It makes poetic sense as a list of observations or elements, which is a common style in this type of poetry.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion.**\nWhile the poem could be interpreted as simple free verse if only the cut-out words are considered, the presence of the \"American Sentence\" option points to a more intricate solution. By including the title and page/plate numbers from the source page—a common practice in erasure poetry—and selectively omitting minor words, a sentence of exactly 17 syllables can be formed. This precisely fits the definition of an American Sentence.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   The interpretation uses the prominent text on the page.\n*   It accounts for the specific syllable requirements of a named poetic form.\n*   The resulting sentence is grammatically and poetically plausible within the context of found poetry.\n\nTherefore, the poem follows the metric pattern of an American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
