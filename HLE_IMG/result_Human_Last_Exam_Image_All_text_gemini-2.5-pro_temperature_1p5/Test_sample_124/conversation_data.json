    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing through it.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total current flowing through the circuit. This is the current supplied by the voltage source, V2. According to Ohm's Law, the total current (I_total) is equal to the total voltage (V_total) divided by the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit: I_total = V_total / R_eq.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Circuit's Structure**\nThe circuit consists of a 1 V voltage source (V2) connected to two main branches in parallel. Let's call the top wire (connected to the positive terminal of V2) Node A (at +1 V) and the bottom wire (connected to the negative terminal and ground) Node B (at 0 V). We need to find the equivalent resistance of each branch.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Left Branch (with R1, R2, R3)**\n*   The resistors R1, R2, and R3 are shown in a series configuration. R1 is connected between Node A and a point we'll call C. R2 is between C and D. R3 is between D and Node B.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Notice the additional wires. There is a wire connecting Node C (the point between R1 and R2) directly to Node A. A wire represents a path of zero resistance. When a resistor is in parallel with a wire, the wire short-circuits the resistor. Since both ends of R1 are connected to Node A (one directly, one through the wire), no current will flow through R1. It is short-circuited.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** There is another wire connecting Node D (the point between R2 and R3) directly to Node A.\n*   Now let's consider R2. Its top is at Node C, which is effectively Node A due to the first short circuit. Its bottom is at Node D, which is also connected to Node A by the second wire. Thus, both ends of R2 are connected to Node A. R2 is also short-circuited.\n*   **Conclusion for the Left Branch:** With R1 and R2 short-circuited, the only active component in this branch is R3. The top of R3 is connected to Node D (which is at the potential of Node A, +1 V), and its bottom is connected to Node B (0 V). Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the entire left branch is simply the resistance of R3.\n    *   R_left_eq = R3 = 9 Ω.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Right Branch (with R7, R8)**\n*   Let's trace the connections for R7 and R8.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A wire comes from Node A and splits, connecting to the top of R7 and the top of R8. This means the top terminals of both resistors are connected to Node A (+1 V).\n*   The bottom of R7 is connected to Node B (0 V). So, R7 is connected directly across the 1V source.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The bottom of R8 is connected to the wire that forms the top of R7. Since the top of R7 is connected to Node A, this means the bottom of R8 is also connected to Node A.\n*   **Conclusion for the Right Branch:** Both the top and bottom terminals of R8 are connected to Node A. Therefore, R8 is short-circuited, and no current will flow through it. The only active component in this branch is R7.\n    *   R_right_eq = R7 = 100 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq)**\nThe circuit has been simplified to two resistors, R3 and R7, connected in parallel across the voltage source. The total equivalent resistance for parallel resistors is calculated as:\n1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left_eq + 1 / R_right_eq\n1 / R_eq = 1 / 9Ω + 1 / 100Ω\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 900.\n1 / R_eq = (100 / 900) + (9 / 900)\n1 / R_eq = 109 / 900 Ω⁻¹\nNow, we invert this to find R_eq:\nR_eq = 900 / 109 Ω ≈ 8.257 Ω\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Current (I_total)**\nNow we use Ohm's Law with the total voltage and total equivalent resistance.\nI_total = V2 / R_eq\nI_total = 1 V / (900 / 109 Ω)\nI_total = 109 / 900 A\n\nFinally, we convert the fraction to a decimal value.\nI_total ≈ 0.12111... A\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\n<<<0.121>>>"
