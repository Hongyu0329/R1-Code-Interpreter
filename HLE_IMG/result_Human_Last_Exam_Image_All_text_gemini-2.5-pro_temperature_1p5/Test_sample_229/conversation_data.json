    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Melody Identification:**\n    *   The first step is to examine the melody line, particularly the opening phrase.\n    *   The notes in the first full measure are: C, C, B, Bb, A, G#.\n    *   This sequence of notes forms an extremely famous and recognizable melodic hook. This is the main theme of the song **\"Sweet Georgia Brown\"**.\n\n2.  **Musical Style Analysis:**\n    *   **Harmony:** The music includes chord symbols written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, D-, A-). The chord progression uses constructs common in jazz, such as secondary dominants (E7, the dominant of A minor) and ii-V-I progressions (D- to G7 to C). This level of harmonic complexity points towards a jazz arrangement.\n    *   **Rhythm:** The melody is written with a lot of syncopation (notes falling on off-beats) and strings of eighth and sixteenth notes. This rhythmic feel, especially when played at a moderate to fast tempo (the marking seems to be \"Mod. J=128\"), is characteristic of swing jazz.\n    *   **Phrasing and Articulation:** The melody consists of many arpeggiated lines that directly outline the underlying chords, and chromatic passing tones are used frequently. This approach, where the solo melody is built very closely around the chord changes, is a defining feature of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Sinti Swing). This style was famously pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt. The arrangement on the sheet music is very typical of his versions of jazz standards.\n\n3.  **Country of Origin Determination:**\n    *   The question asks for the country of origin of \"this song\". This can be interpreted in two ways: the origin of the composition or the origin of the musical style it is presented in.\n    *   **Origin of the Composition:** The song \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" was composed in 1925. The music was written by Ben Bernie and Maceo Pinkard, and the lyrics were by Kenneth Casey. All were Americans. Therefore, the country of origin of the song itself is the **United States**.\n    *   **Origin of the Style:** As determined above, the style of this specific arrangement is Gypsy Jazz. This musical genre originated in **France** in the 1930s with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, featuring Django Reinhardt and St√©phane Grappelli.\n    *   The most direct answer to the question \"country of origin of this song\" refers to the original composition.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The sheet music is a handwritten lead sheet, not a formal publication, common among working musicians.\n*   The key is C major, though \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" is also commonly played in other keys like Ab or F.\n*   It's crucial to distinguish between the origin of the song and the origin of the specific stylistic arrangement shown. The visual evidence strongly points to the Gypsy Jazz style, which might lead one to incorrectly say the origin is France. The question, however, asks about the song.\n*   The melody in the first bar is the single most important clue to identifying the title.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining the analysis of the melody, harmony, and rhythm, we can confidently identify all the requested elements.\n\n*   **Title:** Sweet Georgia Brown (identified from the iconic opening melody).\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (identified from the chord choices, syncopation, and arpeggiated phrasing characteristic of Django Reinhardt's style).\n*   **Country of Origin:** United States (the country where the song was composed).\n\n<<<Title: Sweet Georgia Brown, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz, Country of Origin: United States>>>"
