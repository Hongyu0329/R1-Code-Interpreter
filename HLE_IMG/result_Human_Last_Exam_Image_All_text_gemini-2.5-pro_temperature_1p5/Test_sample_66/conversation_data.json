    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric figure and determine its parameters.**\nThe figure shows a circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex, let's call it O. There are four radial lines shown, creating three adjacent sectors of equal angle θ.\nA length of 34 is indicated on the leftmost radial line, which represents the radius of the circular sector. So, R = 34.\nA line segment of length 17 is drawn from the point on the leftmost arc (let's call it A) to a point on the second radial line (let's call it E). This segment AE is perpendicular to the second radial line OE.\nThis forms a right-angled triangle OAE, with hypotenuse OA = R = 34, and the side opposite to angle θ, AE = 17.\nUsing trigonometry in ΔOAE:\nsin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = AE/OA = 17/34 = 1/2.\nThis gives θ = 30° or π/6 radians.\nThe three equal angles are all 30°. The total angle of the sector shown (from the leftmost to the rightmost radius) is 3θ = 90°.\n\n**Step 2: Define the shaded regions and the goal.**\nLet the radial lines be R1, R2, R3, R4 from left to right. Let the points on the arc be A, B, C, D respectively.\nThe blue shaded region is bounded by the arc AB and two line segments. One segment starts at A and is perpendicular to the next radius, R2 (OB). The other segment starts at B and is perpendicular to the radius R3 (OC). Let P be the intersection of these two lines. The blue region is the area bounded by arc AB, segment BP, and segment AP.\nThe red shaded region is constructed similarly. It's bounded by arc BC, a segment from B perpendicular to R3 (OC), and a segment from C perpendicular to R4 (OD). Let Q be the intersection of the line from B perpendicular to OC and the line from C perpendicular to OD. The red region is the area bounded by arc BC, segment CQ, and segment BQ.\nThe problem asks for the total area of the shaded regions, which is the area of the union of the blue and red regions: Area(Blue ∪ Red) = Area(Blue) + Area(Red) - Area(Overlap).\n\n**Step 3: Set up a coordinate system and find a key geometric property.**\nLet's place the center O at the origin (0,0). For simplicity, let the radial line R3 (OC) lie along the positive x-axis.\nThe angles of the rays from the positive x-axis are:\n- R3 (OC): 0°\n- R2 (OB): 30°\n- R1 (OA): 60°\n- R4 (OD): -30°\nThe coordinates of the points on the arc (radius R=34) are:\n- C = (34, 0)\n- B = (34cos(30°), 34sin(30°)) = (17√3, 17)\n- A = (34cos(60°), 34sin(60°)) = (17, 17√3)\nLet's check the relationship between the line segment AC and the radial line OB.\n- Slope of AC = (y_A - y_C) / (x_A - x_C) = (17√3 - 0) / (17 - 34) = 17√3 / (-17) = -√3.\n- Slope of OB = tan(30°) = 1/√3.\nThe product of their slopes is (-√3) * (1/√3) = -1.\nThis means the line segment AC is perpendicular to the radial line OB.\n\n**Step 4: Use the geometric property to simplify the problem.**\nThe line defining one side of the blue region is the perpendicular from A to OB. We just found this line is the line AC itself.\nLet L_A be the line from A perpendicular to OB (i.e., line AC).\nLet L_B be the line from B perpendicular to OC.\nLet L_C be the line from C perpendicular to OD.\n- The blue region is bounded by arc AB, and segments AP and BP, where P is the intersection of L_A and L_B. Since L_A is the line AC, P is a point on AC.\n- The red region is bounded by arc BC, and segments BQ and CQ, where Q is the intersection of L_B and L_C.\n- The total shaded area is the union of these two regions. The boundary of this union is formed by the arc AC, the segment CQ, the segment QP, and the segment PA.\n- Since P lies on the line segment AC, the path from C to A via Q and P is a polygonal chain C-Q-P-A. The total area is the area of the polygon CQPA plus the area of the circular segment below the chord AC.\n- Furthermore, since P lies on AC, the area of the polygon CQPA is the sum of the areas of the triangles ΔCQP and ΔCPA. But since C, P, A are collinear, Area(ΔCPA) = 0.\n- Therefore, the area of the polygon CQPA is simply the area of the triangle ΔCQA.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the simplified shapes.**\nThe total area is Area(ΔCQA) + Area(circular segment AC).\n\n**Part 5a: Calculate Area(circular segment AC).**\nArea(segment AC) = Area(sector OAC) - Area(ΔOAC).\nThe angle ∠AOC is 2θ = 60°.\n- Area(sector OAC) = (60°/360°) * π * R² = (1/6) * π * 34² = 1156π / 6 = 578π / 3.\n- Area(ΔOAC) = 1/2 * base * height. Using OAC with C on the x-axis: C=(34,0), A=(17, 17√3).\n  Or, using the formula 1/2 * R² * sin(∠AOC) = 1/2 * 34² * sin(60°) = 1/2 * 1156 * (√3/2) = 289√3.\n- So, Area(segment AC) = 578π/3 - 289√3.\n\n**Part 5b: Calculate Area(ΔCQA).**\nWe need the coordinates of Q. Q is the intersection of L_B and L_C.\n- L_B: From B(17√3, 17), perpendicular to OC (the x-axis). This is a vertical line: x = 17√3.\n- L_C: From C(34, 0), perpendicular to OD. The ray OD has an angle of -30°, so its slope is tan(-30°) = -1/√3. The perpendicular slope is √3.\n  The equation of L_C is y - 0 = √3(x - 34), so y = √3x - 34√3.\n- To find Q, we set x = 17√3 in the equation for L_C:\n  y_Q = √3(17√3) - 34√3 = 17*3 - 34√3 = 51 - 34√3.\n  So, Q = (17√3, 51 - 34√3).\nNow we find the area of ΔCQA with vertices:\nC = (34, 0)\nQ = (17√3, 51 - 34√3)\nA = (17, 17√3)\nArea(ΔCQA) can be calculated using the Shoelace formula or by base and height. Let's use the latter.\nLet's find a side whose length is easy to compute. No obvious horizontal or vertical side.\nUsing the shoelace (determinant) formula:\nArea = 1/2 | (x_C(y_Q - y_A) + x_Q(y_A - y_C) + x_A(y_C - y_Q)) |\nArea = 1/2 | 34( (51 - 34√3) - 17√3 ) + 17√3( 17√3 - 0 ) + 17( 0 - (51 - 34√3) ) |\nArea = 1/2 | 34( 51 - 51√3 ) + 17√3( 17√3 ) + 17( -51 + 34√3 ) |\nArea = 1/2 | (1734 - 1734√3) + (17*17*3) + (-867 + 578√3) |\nArea = 1/2 | 1734 - 1734√3 + 867 - 867 + 578√3 |\nArea = 1/2 | 1734 - 867 - 1734√3 + 578√3 |\nArea = 1/2 | 867 - 1156√3 |. Since 1156√3 > 867, the area is 1/2 (1156√3 - 867) = 578√3 - 433.5.\nThere appears to be a calculation mistake. Let's re-calculate using a different coordinate system where AC has an easy base/height.\nLet's use the system with OA on the y-axis, O=(0,0).\nA = (0, 34). C = (17√3, 17). Q was found as Q=(17√3, 34√3-51) in the *first* coordinate system (OC on x-axis). Let's re-calculate Q in the current system (OA on y-axis).\nR1(OA) is at 90°, R2(OB) at 60°, R3(OC) at 30°, R4(OD) at 0°.\nB=(17, 17√3), C=(17√3, 17), D=(34,0).\nL_B: from B(17, 17√3) perp to OC (slope=tan(30°)=1/√3). Perp slope=-√3. y - 17√3 = -√3(x-17) => y = -√3x + 34√3.\nL_C: from C(17√3, 17) perp to OD (x-axis). Vertical line: x = 17√3.\nQ is the intersection: x_Q = 17√3. y_Q = -√3(17√3) + 34√3 = -51 + 34√3. So Q = (17√3, 34√3 - 51).\nThe vertices of ΔCQA are A=(0,34), C=(17√3, 17), Q=(17√3, 34√3-51).\nNotice that C and Q have the same x-coordinate. So the segment CQ is vertical.\nBase of ΔCQA is the length of CQ: |y_C - y_Q| = |17 - (34√3 - 51)| = |68 - 34√3|. Since √3 < 2, this is positive. Length = 68 - 34√3.\nThe height of the triangle with respect to this base is the horizontal distance from A to the line x=17√3, which is 17√3 - 0 = 17√3.\nArea(ΔCQA) = 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * (68 - 34√3) * (17√3) = 1/2 * 34(2 - √3) * 17√3 = 17 * 17√3 * (2 - √3) = 289(2√3 - 3).\nArea(ΔCQA) = 578√3 - 867.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results to get the total area.**\nTotal Area = Area(ΔCQA) + Area(segment AC)\nTotal Area = (578√3 - 867) + (578π/3 - 289√3)\nTotal Area = (578√3 - 289√3) - 867 + 578π/3\nTotal Area = 289√3 - 867 + 578π/3\n\nThis can be factored as:\nTotal Area = 289(√3) - 289(3) + 2*289(π/3) = 289(√3 - 3 + 2π/3).\n\nFinal answer is the expression 289√3 - 867 + 578π/3."
