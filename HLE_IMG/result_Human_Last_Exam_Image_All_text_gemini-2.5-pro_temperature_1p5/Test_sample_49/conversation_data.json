    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. This is a characteristic of the low-pass filter formed by the capacitor $C$ and the equivalent resistance of the network as seen from the capacitor's terminals. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\n**2. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to determine the equivalent resistance of the circuit looking into the terminals $(a_0, b_0)$. The node $b_0$ is connected to ground. According to standard procedure for finding Thevenin resistance, we must deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` is applied at node $c_0$. Assuming this is a voltage source connected between $c_0$ and ground, deactivating it means shorting $c_0$ to ground.\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is thus the given resistive ladder network with node $c_0$ connected to ground. We need to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Simplifying the Infinite Ladder**\nThe network is an infinite ladder extending upwards (or to the right, depending on orientation). A key technique for analyzing such circuits is to note that the impedance looking into an infinite ladder is the same regardless of which section you look into. This is called the characteristic resistance, let's denote it by $R_c$.\n\nLet's find the characteristic resistance $R_c$ of the ladder as seen between the two vertical rails. Consider looking into the ladder from the terminals $(c_n, d_n)$ for any $n \\geq 1$. The resistance seen, $R_c$, is composed of:\n*   The horizontal resistor $r$ connected between $c_n$ and $d_n$.\n*   In parallel with this, the path through the rest of the ladder. This path consists of the vertical resistor $r$ from $c_n$ to $c_{n+1}$, followed by the characteristic resistance $R_c$ of the remaining infinite ladder (seen from $(c_{n+1}, d_{n+1})$), and then the vertical resistor $r$ from $d_{n+1}$ back to $d_n$.\n\nThis gives us a recursive relationship for $R_c$:\n$R_c = r \\parallel (r + R_c + r)$\n$R_c = r \\parallel (2r + R_c)$\n\nNow, we solve for $R_c$ using the formula for parallel resistors:\n$R_c = \\frac{r(2r + R_c)}{r + (2r + R_c)} = \\frac{2r^2 + rR_c}{3r + R_c}$\n\nThis leads to a quadratic equation:\n$R_c(3r + R_c) = 2r^2 + rR_c$\n$3rR_c + R_c^2 = 2r^2 + rR_c$\n$R_c^2 + 2rR_c - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nWe solve this using the quadratic formula, $R_c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$R_c = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2}$\n$R_c = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$R_c = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**4. Calculating $R_{th}$ using the Simplified Circuit**\nNow we can simplify the circuit to calculate $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$. The entire infinite ladder starting from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ and extending upwards can be replaced by its characteristic resistance $R_c$ connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe simplified circuit for finding the resistance between $a_0$ and ground ($c_0$) is now a finite network:\n*   A resistor $r$ connects $a_0$ to $d_1$.\n*   The resistor $R_c = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$ connects $d_1$ to $c_1$.\n*   A resistor $r$ connects $c_1$ to $c_0$ (ground).\n\nTo find the total resistance from $a_0$ to ground, we can see that these three resistive elements form a single series path:\n$R_{th} = R_{a_0 \\to d_1} + R_{d_1 \\to c_1} + R_{c_1 \\to c_0}$\n$R_{th} = r + R_c + r = 2r + R_c$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_c$:\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 2r + r\\sqrt{3} - r = r + r\\sqrt{3}$\n$R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**5. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ using the formula from Step 1:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nIf the question were asking for the cutoff frequency in Hertz ($f_c$), the expression would be:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\nTypically, \"cutoff frequency\" in such theoretical problems refers to the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is given by the expression derived above.\n\n<<<$1/(rC(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
