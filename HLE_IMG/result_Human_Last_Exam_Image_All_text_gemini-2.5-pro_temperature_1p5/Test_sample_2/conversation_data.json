    "An explicit step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Structure**\nLet's analyze the provided pseudocode for the `sort(a, n)` function. The function is recursive.\n\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  # Base case for the recursion\n  if n > 1:\n    # First recursive call on a smaller problem\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # A comparison and a potential operation\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      # Second recursive call (based on visual indentation in the image)\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n*   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array with 0 or 1 element is considered sorted, so the function does nothing and returns. This ensures the algorithm will terminate.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For an array of size `n` (where `n > 1`), the algorithm performs the following actions:\n    1.  It calls itself to sort the first `n-1` elements: `sort(a, n-1)`. After this call, the subarray `a[0...n-2]` is sorted.\n    2.  It compares the last element `a[n-1]` with the element at `a[n-2]`. Since `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that prefix.\n    3.  If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, it means the new element needs to be moved into the sorted prefix. It swaps them.\n    4.  The `swap` may have disrupted the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix. To fix this, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n-1)` again to re-sort the prefix. Based on the visual indentation in the image, this second call is inside the `if` block.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Worst-Case Scenario**\nThe time complexity of a recursive algorithm is described by a recurrence relation. To find the worst-case time complexity, we need to identify the input that makes the algorithm perform the maximum amount of work.\n\nThe work done in each call `sort(a, n)` depends on the `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` condition.\n*   **Best Case:** If the condition is always false, the second `sort(a, n-1)` call is never made. This would happen for an already sorted array.\n*   **Worst Case:** If the condition is always true for every recursive step down to the base case, the algorithm does the maximum work. This involves two recursive calls to `sort(a, n-1)` at each level of `n`. An example of a worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`). For such an array, after `sort(a, n-1)` sorts the prefix `a[0...n-2]`, the array will look something like `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`. Then the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` (i.e., `1 < n`) will be true, triggering the swap and the second recursive call.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for the Worst Case**\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for sorting `n` elements in the worst case.\n*   The work for the base case `T(1)` is constant: `T(1) = c_1`.\n*   For `n > 1`, the total time `T(n)` is the sum of the time for its components in the worst case:\n    *   Time for the first `sort(a, n - 1)` call: `T(n-1)`\n    *   Time for the comparison `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: `O(1)`, a constant `c_2`\n    *   Time for the `swap`: `O(1)`, a constant `c_3`\n    *   Time for the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call: `T(n-1)`\n\nSumming these up gives the recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + (c_2 + c_3)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`, where `c` is a constant.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation**\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = c_1`. We can solve this by expansion:\n\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n`     = 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n`     = 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 2c + c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n`     = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is a geometric series which equals `(2^k - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^k - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\nTo reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`. Substituting `k = n-1`:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c_1 + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c_1 + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nIn Big-O notation, we ignore the constant factors and lower-order terms. The dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is proportional to `2^n`.\nTherefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given sorting algorithm is `O(2^n)`. This matches answer choice E.\n\n***Careful Point Note***: Even if the second `sort(a, n-1)` call were outside the `if` statement (a different interpretation of the indentation), the recurrence relation would be `T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + c` for *all* cases, not just the worst case. The result for the worst-case complexity would remain the same.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."
