The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid cyclic structure of the N-acetylproline starting material. This cyclic constraint prevents an acyl-scrambling mechanism that occurs in the flexible, acyclic substrate of Reaction 2. The results of Reactions 1 and 2 establish that while the cycloaddition step itself is regioselective, the scrambling in acyclic cases leads to a mixture of münchnone intermediates. In Reaction 3, the inability to scramble means only a single münchnone intermediate is formed, which then reacts with high regioselectivity in the cycloaddition step to give a single product, B.
