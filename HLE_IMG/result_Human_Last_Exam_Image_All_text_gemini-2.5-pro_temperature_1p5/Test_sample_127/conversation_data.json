    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in the given cation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular structure and the rings in question.**\nThe image displays a complex cation with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. This Ir atom is coordinated by three bidentate ligands. The question asks about the rotational freedom of the peripheral phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. Phenyl rings are aromatic rings with the formula C₆H₅ (as a substituent). Rings labeled B, D, E, and F contain a nitrogen atom and are pyridyl rings. Rings A and C are the central phenyl rings of the cyclometalating ligands and are part of the rigid ligand backbone due to chelation with the Iridium; thus, they cannot rotate freely. We only need to consider the pendant phenyl rings G, H, J, K, and L, which are attached to the main ligand framework by single C-C bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the principle of free rotation.**\nIn chemistry, \"free rotation\" can occur around a single bond. However, this rotation can be restricted or completely hindered if there are bulky groups near the bond. This phenomenon is called steric hindrance. If the energy barrier to rotation is high, the rotation will be slow or non-existent at room temperature. We need to analyze the steric environment around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the steric environment of each peripheral phenyl ring.**\n\n*   **Ring H:** It is attached to carbon 4 (C4) of ring A. The adjacent carbons on ring A, C3 and C5, are substituted with ring B (a pyridyl ring) and ring K (a phenyl ring), respectively. Therefore, ring H is \"sandwiched\" between two bulky aromatic rings (B and K). For ring H to rotate, it would have to pass by these bulky groups, leading to a severe steric clash. This is a classic example of a system that would lead to atropisomerism (isomers that are stable due to restricted rotation). Thus, the rotation of ring H is expected to be highly hindered.\n\n*   **Ring J:** It is attached to C4 of ring C. This situation is analogous to ring H. The adjacent carbons on ring C, C3 and C5, are substituted with ring D (a pyridyl ring) and ring L (a phenyl ring). So, ring J is sandwiched between rings D and L. Similar to ring H, the rotation of ring J is expected to be highly hindered.\n\n*   **Ring K:** It is attached to C5 of ring A. The adjacent positions on ring A are C4 and C6. C4 is substituted with the bulky phenyl ring H. C6 is the site of cyclometalation, meaning it is directly bonded to the very crowded Iridium center. Therefore, ring K is sterically hindered by ring H on one side and the entire coordination sphere around the Iridium atom on the other side. Its rotation is also expected to be highly restricted.\n\n*   **Ring L:** It is attached to C5 of ring C. This is analogous to ring K. It is adjacent to ring J (at C4) and the metalated carbon C6. Its rotation will be hindered by ring J on one side and the crowded Iridium center on the other. Thus, ring L is also not expected to rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring G:** It is attached to C6 of the pyridyl ring D. The adjacent positions on ring D are the nitrogen atom (N, at position 1) and C5. The nitrogen atom is coordinated to the Iridium center, so one side of ring G is near the crowded metal center. The other adjacent position, C5, is substituted with a hydrogen atom, which is very small. Compared to rings H, J, K, and L, which are all flanked by at least one (and in the case of H and J, two) other bulky aromatic rings, ring G has the least amount of local steric hindrance. Its main hindrance comes from the proximity to the metal's coordination sphere, but it has a small hydrogen atom as its other neighbor on the parent ring.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the rotational freedom and determine the final answer.**\n\nLet's rank the rings from most hindered to least hindered based on their local steric environment:\n1.  **H and J:** Most hindered, as they are sandwiched between two bulky aromatic groups.\n2.  **K and L:** Highly hindered, being adjacent to another bulky phenyl group and the crowded metalation site.\n3.  **G:** Least hindered, being adjacent to the metalation site and a small hydrogen atom.\n\nBased on this analysis, rings H, J, K, and L have extremely restricted rotation. Ring G is the only phenyl ring with a plausible chance of rotating freely, as its steric environment is significantly less crowded than the others. While its rotation might still be somewhat slowed by the nearby Iridium complex, it is by far the most likely candidate for \"free rotation\" among the given options. Therefore, the answer should be the ring(s) that are most likely to rotate. Given the options, and the clear difference in steric hindrance, it is most probable that only ring G can rotate freely.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n*   Rings H, J, K, L are all severely sterically hindered.\n*   Ring G is the least sterically hindered.\n*   Therefore, only ring G is likely to rotate freely.\n*   This corresponds to option K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
