    "An analysis of the provided sheet music to determine the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Examination:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab major or its relative minor, F minor.\n    *   **Tonic Chord:** The first chord is explicitly written as `F-` (F minor), and the piece resolves to an F chord at the very end. This strongly establishes F as the tonic center.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time (common time).\n    *   **Form:** The structure appears to be a 32-bar AABA form. There is an 8-bar A section that repeats (indicated by the 1st and 2nd endings), followed by an 8-bar B section (bridge), and a final 8-bar A section.\n\n2.  **Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression):**\n    *   **A Section (First 8 bars):** The chord progression is `| F- | Eø7 | Eb6 | Dbmaj7 | G7 | C7 | F- | C7 ||`. This is a highly distinctive progression featuring a chromatically descending bass line (F, E, Eb, Db). This exact progression is the signature harmonic sequence from two very famous jazz standards:\n        1.  **\"Yesterdays\"** (composed by Jerome Kern, 1933)\n        2.  **\"Nica's Dream\"** (composed by Horace Silver, 1956)\n    *   **B Section (Bridge - bars 9-16 of the first chorus after the repeat):** The progression is `| Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 ||`. This is a classic bridge progression built on a cycle of descending fifths (or ascending fourths). It is most famously known as the bridge from George Gershwin's \"I Got Rhythm\" and is used in countless other standards (contrafacts) known as \"Rhythm Changes\" tunes.\n    *   **Final A Section (Last 8 bars):** The progression here is `| F | Eø7 | Eb6 | Db | G7 | C7 | F | % ||`. This is a recap of the A section's harmony, but it begins on an F major chord instead of F minor. This \"minor to major\" shift is a common compositional device.\n\n3.  **Melodic Analysis:**\n    *   The written melody begins with the notes: C, G (over F-), Eb (over Eø7), C (over Eb6), Db (over Dbmaj7).\n    *   This melody does not match the standard published melody of **\"Yesterdays\"** (which, in F minor, would start C, Ab, C, Bb...).\n    *   It also does not match the standard melody of **\"Nica's Dream\"** (which, in F minor, would have a much more rhythmically complex line starting with pickups to an Eb).\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion:\n\n1.  **Contradictory Elements:** The sheet music presents a puzzle. The A section harmony is from \"Yesterdays\" / \"Nica's Dream,\" the B section harmony is from \"I Got Rhythm,\" and the melody doesn't match any of them.\n2.  **Identifying the Core Tune:** In situations like this (common in jazz where tunes are re-worked), the identity of the standard is often tied to its most unique and defining feature. The B-section (\"Rhythm\" bridge) is generic and used in hundreds of tunes. The melody here is unfamiliar. The A-section's descending chromatic harmony, however, is the unmistakable signature of a specific composition.\n3.  **Choosing Between \"Yesterdays\" and \"Nica's Dream\":** Both standards use this A section harmony. However, the overall context of the sheet music—an AABA form with a substituted \"Rhythm Changes\" bridge and a likely improvised or contrafact melody—is a practice far more common to the bebop and hard bop eras than to the showtunes of the 1930s. This stylistic context points more strongly towards Horace Silver's hard bop classic, \"Nica's Dream.\" The piece on the page is structured like a typical hard bop blowing vehicle.\n4.  **Final Determination:** The most prominent and defining feature of this piece of music is the A-section harmony, which is taken directly from Horace Silver's composition. Therefore, despite the different melody and bridge, the standard being referenced is \"Nica's Dream.\"\n\n**Title:** Nica's Dream\n**Composer:** Horace Silver\n\n<<<Nica's Dream by Horace Silver>>>"
