    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image provided is a small, cropped section of a larger illustration. Key elements visible are:\n    *   A mythical creature, clearly identifiable as a unicorn, due to its equine form and the single horn on its forehead.\n    *   The unicorn is depicted in a ghostly, white or light-blue color and appears to be in motion, suggesting it's running or fleeing.\n    *   The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting a forest or a nighttime scene.\n    *   The art style is painterly and illustrative, common for fantasy book covers.\n    *   On the right edge of the fragment, there is a portion of a golden-brown, pillar-like structure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Art Style and Artist:** The specific artistic style—the soft, slightly hazy rendering of figures, the rich colors, and the overall fantastical feel—is highly characteristic of the artwork by Mary GrandPré, who illustrated the original American editions of the *Harry Potter* series.\n\n3.  **Connect to the Specific Book:** Knowing the likely series is *Harry Potter*, the next step is to identify which book features a unicorn on its cover.\n    *   The unicorn plays a significant role in the first book of the series. In a pivotal chapter, Harry serves detention in the Forbidden Forest and encounters a hooded figure (Voldemort) drinking the blood of a slain unicorn.\n    *   Reviewing the cover art for the American edition of the first book, titled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, reveals this exact scene. The full wrap-around cover art by Mary GrandPré features Harry on his broom on the front, and this scene of the unicorn in the Forbidden Forest on the back. The golden-brown structure on the right of the fragment is the edge of the artwork that adorns the book's spine.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Title:** The book featuring this artwork is the first installment of the *Harry Potter* series. In the United States, where this cover art was published, the title is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. (In the United Kingdom and other regions, it is known as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*). Given that the fragment is from the American edition's cover, the most precise title is the American one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fragment shows the unicorn from the back cover of the original American edition of the first Harry Potter book, illustrated by Mary GrandPré.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
