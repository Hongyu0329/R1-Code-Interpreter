    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reagents:** Benzene (C₆H₆), propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl), and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form an acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanoyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone), bromine (Br₂), and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃) as a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the aromatic ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. FeBr₃ activates Br₂ to form the electrophile \"Br⁺\".\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one), hydrogen gas (H₂), and a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Mechanism:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a powerful reduction method. It can reduce multiple functional groups present in Intermediate-2:\n    1.  **Reduction of the benzylic ketone:** The carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to the benzene ring is completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a hydrogenolysis reaction.\n    2.  **Reduction of the aryl halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is also cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond (dehalogenation).\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** Both the ketone and the bromo group are reduced, resulting in propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH₂CH₂CH₃.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene), N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) as the solvent.\n*   **Mechanism:** NBS is a reagent used for selective bromination at allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. The reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. The most stable radical is formed at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring) because it is stabilized by resonance.\n*   **Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of propylbenzene is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The resulting molecule has a three-carbon chain (propane) with a phenyl group and a bromo group on the first carbon. Its IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\nFinal Product Structure: C₆H₅-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
