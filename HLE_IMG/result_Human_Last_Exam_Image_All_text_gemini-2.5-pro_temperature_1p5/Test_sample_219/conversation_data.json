    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph and the task.**\nThe image is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of multiple neurons (or electrodes) over time.\n- The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s).\n- The **y-axis** represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128).\n- Each **black dot** represents a neuronal spike (an action potential).\nThe task is to identify \"synchronized bursts\" and calculate the average time interval between them (the average inter-burst interval or IBI).\n\n**Careful Point:** A synchronized burst is a period where many electrodes show high-frequency firing at nearly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts.**\nWe need to scan the graph from left to right and identify the central time point of each major vertical band of activity.\n- **Burst 1:** There is a clear, dense burst of activity centered at approximately **t₁ = 5 s**.\n- **Burst 2:** The next major synchronized burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 18 s**.\n- **Burst 3:** A third very prominent burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 36 s**.\n- **Burst 4:** The final clear burst within the 50-second window is centered at approximately **t₄ = 47 s**.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must estimate the center of the burst's mass of activity. Small variations in this estimation (e.g., ±0.5 s) are acceptable, but the central tendency should be clear. The identified times (5, 18, 36, 47 s) are robust estimates for the centers of these events. There are other, less synchronized firing events, but the question specifies \"synchronized bursts,\" implying the most significant events.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the individual inter-burst intervals (IBIs).**\nThe IBI is the time difference between the centers of consecutive bursts. Using the timestamps identified in Step 2, we can calculate three IBIs.\n- **IBI₁ (between burst 1 and 2):**  t₂ - t₁ = 18 s - 5 s = 13 s\n- **IBI₂ (between burst 2 and 3):**  t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 18 s = 18 s\n- **IBI₃ (between burst 3 and 4):**  t₄ - t₃ = 47 s - 36 s = 11 s\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.**\nThe average IBI is the mean of the individual IBIs.\n- Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n- Average IBI = (13 s + 18 s + 11 s) / 3\n- Average IBI = 42 s / 3\n- Average IBI = 14 s\n\n**Step 5: Format the answer to two significant figures.**\nThe question requires the final answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n- The calculated average is 14 s.\n- The number 14 has two digits (1 and 4), which are both significant. Thus, the value 14 is already in the correct format.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- **Burst Timestamps:** 5 s, 18 s, 36 s, 47 s.\n- **Average Inter-Burst Interval:** 14 s.\n\n<<<14>>>"
