The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. S100B can be used as a prognostic marker. This is because its overexpression directly initiates downstream signaling pathways (via RAGE, JNK/JUN, and NFÎºB) that lead to key pathological outcomes such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. As the level of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these disease-driving processes, it can be used to predict the future course and severity of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
