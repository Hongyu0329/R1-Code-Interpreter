    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the *percentage reduction* in Car VMT, not the absolute VMT.\n2.  **VMT Definition:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. This refers to the distance traveled by vehicles, not the people inside them. Therefore, data on occupancy (like \"Average Carpool Occupancy\") is not directly used in the VMT calculation itself.\n3.  **Car Modes:** \"Car VMT\" includes both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The mode shares for these two categories must be added together to find the total car share for each distance bracket.\n4.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a weighted sum. The calculation for each distance category needs to be weighted by both its `share of total trips` and its `Average trip distance`.\n5.  **Proportionality:** Since we are calculating a percentage change, the absolute total number of trips is not needed. We can work with the proportional figures given, calculating a \"weighted VMT\" that is proportional to the true VMT. This common factor will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe overall formula is:\n*Percentage Reduction = [ (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT ] * 100%*\n\nTo use this, we first need to calculate the total weighted VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. The formula for each segment of the calculation is:\n*Weighted VMT = (Share of Total Trips) × (Average Trip Distance) × (Total Car Mode Share)*\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Weighted VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 1 (avg distance) × 0.53 (car share) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 × 4 × 0.81 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.85 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 × 20 × 0.89 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Weighted VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 × 1 × 0.03 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 × 4 × 0.27 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.41 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 × 20 × 0.49 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.2%\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
