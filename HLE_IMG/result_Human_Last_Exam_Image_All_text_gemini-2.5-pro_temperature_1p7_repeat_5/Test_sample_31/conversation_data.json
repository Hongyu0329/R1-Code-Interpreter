    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. We can analyze its properties from the image.\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By careful inspection, we can count that the diagram has 8 crossings.\n2.  **Check if it's alternating:** An alternating knot diagram is one where the crossings alternate between over and under as you travel along the knot. Let's trace a path along the knot:\n    *   Start at the bottom-most arc and travel counter-clockwise.\n    *   The first crossing on the left is an **under**-crossing.\n    *   The next crossing as we go up the left side is an **over**-crossing.\n    *   Continuing up and towards the center, the next crossing is an **under**-crossing.\n    *   The strand then enters the clasp-like structure at the top. The first crossing in this structure is an **over**-crossing.\n    *   It loops around and the next crossing in the clasp is an **under**-crossing.\n    *   The strand exits the clasp and goes down towards the right. The next crossing it encounters is another **under**-crossing.\n    *   Since we have two consecutive **under**-crossings, the diagram is **non-alternating**.\n\n3.  **Identify from knot tables:** The knot is an 8-crossing, non-alternating knot. The list of such knots is short: 8_19, 8_20, and 8_21. By comparing the given diagram with standard tables of knots (like those in Rolfsen's \"Knots and Links\" or on the Knot Atlas website), we can identify this specific diagram. The provided diagram is a well-known representation of the knot **8_20**. The particular structure, with one part of the knot passing through a clasped loop of another part, is a characteristic way to draw the 8_20 knot.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as *s(K)* for a knot *K*, is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology. It has several important properties, but the most relevant one for this problem is its behavior under knot concordance.\n\n*   **Concordance Invariance:** The Rasmussen invariant is a knot concordance invariant. This means that if two knots are concordant, they have the same Rasmussen invariant.\n*   **Slice Knots:** A special case of this is for slice knots. A knot is called \"slice\" if it is the boundary of a smooth, properly embedded disk in the 4-dimensional ball. All slice knots are concordant to the unknot. The Rasmussen invariant of the unknot is 0. Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of any slice knot must be 0.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Properties of the Identified Knot (8_20)**\n\nThe knot 8_20 is a famous example in knot theory. It is known to be a **slice knot**. This is a non-trivial fact, but a standard result documented in knot theory literature and databases. For instance, it's one of the first non-trivial slice knots discovered whose Alexander polynomial is not 1.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Information to Find the Answer**\n\n1.  We have identified the knot in the picture as 8_20.\n2.  We know that the knot 8_20 is a slice knot.\n3.  We know that the Rasmussen invariant *s(K)* is 0 for any slice knot *K*.\n\nCombining these facts, we can conclude that the Rasmussen invariant of the knot 8_20 is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
