    "An analysis of the question, step by step, to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\nThe graph G has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\nThe edges E can be listed by inspecting the figure:\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n*   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n*   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n*   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\nThe total number of vertices is |V| = 5. The total number of edges is |E| = (2+3+3+3+3)/2 = 7.\nThe graph contains several triangles (cliques of size 3), for example, the subgraph induced by {2, 3, 4} is a triangle (K3). This means the chromatic number is at least 3.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Compute the Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of ways to properly color the vertices of G using a set of k colors. We can compute it using several methods. The most systematic method for this graph is the **Deletion-Contraction Principle**.\nThe principle states that for any graph G and any edge `e` in G:\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)`\nwhere:\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G.e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and all connections are maintained).\n\nA good strategy is to choose an edge `e` such that `G - e` and `G.e` are simpler to analyze. Let's choose the edge `e = (1, 5)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contraction Graph G.e**\nLet `e = (1, 5)`.\nIn the graph `G.e`, vertices 1 and 5 are merged into a single new vertex, which we can call `v_15`. The set of vertices in `G.e` is `{v_15, 2, 3, 4}`.\nThe neighbors of the new vertex `v_15` are the combined neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 5 (excluding 1 and 5 themselves).\n*   Neighbors of 1 in G were {2, 5}.\n*   Neighbors of 5 in G were {1, 3, 4}.\nSo, the neighbors of `v_15` are {2} U {3, 4} = {2, 3, 4}.\nThe existing edges between the other vertices {2, 3, 4} are preserved. In the original graph, we have edges (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4). So, the vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (K3).\nSince `v_15` is connected to all vertices of this K3, the graph `G.e` is a complete graph on 4 vertices, K4.\nThe chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K_n is `P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1)`.\nTherefore, `P(G.e, k) = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Deletion Graph G - e**\nLet `e = (1, 5)`.\nThe graph `G - e` is the original graph with the edge (1, 5) removed. We can compute its chromatic polynomial `P(G - e, k)` by direct counting, using a clever ordering of vertices.\nLet's choose the coloring order: `3, 4, 2, 1, 5`.\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different. There are `k-1` choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, which have different colors. There are `k-2` choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 1:** It is adjacent only to vertex 2 (in `G-e`). So its color must be different from the color of vertex 2. There are `k-1` choices.\n5.  **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Its color must be different from the colors of 3 and 4. There are `k-2` choices.\n\nThe number of choices for each vertex only depends on the colors of previously colored vertices in our chosen order. The choices for vertex 1 and vertex 5 are independent of each other given the colors of {2,3,4}. Thus, we can multiply the number of choices.\n`P(G - e, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-1) * (k-2) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2`.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G**\nNow, we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n`P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)`\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]`\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`[ (k^2 - 2k - k + 2) - (k-3) ]`\n`= [ k^2 - 3k + 2 - k + 3 ]`\n`= k^2 - 4k + 5`\n\nSo, the final chromatic polynomial is:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n**Step 6: Verification (Optional)**\nLet's expand the polynomial to check its properties.\n`P(G,k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`= k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k`\n`= k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n*   The degree is 5, which is |V|. Correct.\n*   The coefficient of k^4 is -7, which is -|E|. Correct.\n*   The signs alternate. Correct.\n*   P(G, 1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0.\n*   P(G, 2) = 32-112+152-92+20 = 0.\n*   P(G, 3) = 243-567+513-207+30 = 12.\nSince P(G,3)>0, the chromatic number is 3, which is consistent with the graph having triangles.\n\nThe calculation is consistent and verified.\n\nThe final answer is the chromatic polynomial.\nk(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)>>>"
