    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Context**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in LECs, will have shorter lifetimes. In the context of emissive devices like LECs or OLEDs, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the **operational lifetime** of the device, which is directly related to the **chemical stability** of the emitter molecule under operating conditions. A shorter lifetime implies that the complex degrades more quickly.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structures of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes share the same general structure: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+[PF6]−.\n*   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III) is the central metal for all four.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** This is a neutral bidentate ligand. In all four complexes, it is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This part of the molecule is constant across all four complexes.\n*   **C^N Ligands:** These are cyclometalating, anionic ligands. This is where the four complexes differ. They are all based on 2-phenylpyridine, but with different fluorine substitutions on the phenyl ring.\n*   **Counter-ion:** The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6−) for all complexes.\n\nThe key difference that will affect their stability lies in the substitution pattern of the C^N ligands.\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the C2 (**ortho**) and C4 (**para**) positions of the phenyl ring relative to the Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom only at the C4 (**para**) position.\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom only at the C2 (**ortho**) position.\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the C2 (**ortho**), C3 (**meta**), and C4 (**para**) positions.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Structural Differences to Chemical Stability and Lifetime**\nThe operational stability of these iridium complexes in LECs is largely determined by their resistance to degradation under electrochemical stress (i.e., repeated reduction and oxidation cycles). A major degradation pathway for fluorinated phenylpyridine-type ligands is **reductive C-F bond cleavage**.\n\n*   **The \"Ortho-Fluorine\" Effect:** It is a well-established principle in the field of organic electronics that fluorine atoms located at the **ortho** position (C2) of the cyclometalating phenyl ring are particularly labile. This C-F bond is weak and prone to cleavage upon reduction of the complex. This degradation is thought to be facilitated by the proximity of the ortho-fluorine to the metal center.\n*   **Stability of Meta and Para Fluorines:** Fluorine atoms at the meta (C3, C5) and para (C4) positions are much more stable and do not significantly compromise the operational lifetime of the complex. The C-F bonds at these positions are stronger and less susceptible to reductive cleavage.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Stability Principle to Each Complex**\nWe can now evaluate each complex based on the presence or absence of an ortho-fluorine substituent.\n*   **Complex 1:** Has an ortho-fluorine (at C2). This bond is a weak point, making the complex susceptible to degradation. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n*   **Complex 2:** Does not have an ortho-fluorine. The only fluorine is at the stable para-position. **Expected longer lifetime.**\n*   **Complex 3:** Has an ortho-fluorine (at C2). This will lead to poor operational stability. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n*   **Complex 4:** Has an ortho-fluorine (at C2). Despite having other fluorine atoms, the presence of the labile ortho-fluorine is the dominant factor for instability. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Answer**\nBased on the analysis, complexes [1], [3], and [4] all contain the unstable ortho-fluorine motif, which is known to lead to rapid degradation and, consequently, shorter operational lifetimes in LECs. Complex [2] lacks this feature and is expected to be significantly more stable.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [1], [3], and [4]. This corresponds to answer choice M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
