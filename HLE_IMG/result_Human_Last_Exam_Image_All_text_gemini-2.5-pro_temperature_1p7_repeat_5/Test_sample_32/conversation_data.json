    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most significant and easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference between the sporophytes of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte is the spore-producing part of the moss, which typically consists of a stalk (seta) and a capsule.\n\n2.  **Examine the Species Names:** The specific epithet often provides a clue to a key characteristic. The name *Grimmia curviseta* is very informative. It is derived from Latin: \"curvus\" meaning curved, and \"seta\" meaning the stalk of the sporophyte. This strongly suggests that a curved seta is a defining feature of this species.\n\n3.  **Describe the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** In *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte capsule is typically emergent (sitting amongst the tips of the leaves) or slightly exserted (raised just above the leaves). A critical feature is its seta, which is very short and **straight**. This causes the capsule to be held in an erect, upright position within the tuft of leaves. The capsules in the provided image are erect, consistent with the appearance of *G. montana*.\n\n4.  **Describe the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** As its name implies, the most distinctive feature of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte is its seta. While also short, the seta is strongly **curved**, arcuate, or even swan-necked (cygneous). This sharp curve causes the capsule to be bent over, appearing nodding (cernuous) or hanging to the side of the plant.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Main Difference:** By comparing the two, the primary and most obvious distinguishing feature is the morphology of the seta and the resulting orientation of the capsule.\n    *   ***Grimmia montana*:** has a **straight seta**, resulting in an **erect capsule**.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta*:** has a **curved seta**, resulting in a **nodding or pendulous capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Sporophyte Presence:** This characteristic is only useful when the mosses have produced sporophytes. Without them, distinguishing these species requires microscopic examination of the leaves.\n*   **Seta Length:** Both species have relatively short setae, so the length is not the primary distinguishing factor. The key is the *curvature*.\n*   **Habitat:** While not a sporophyte feature, knowing their typical habitats can provide clues, but the question specifically asks about the sporophyte. Both can be found on dry, exposed rocks.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** The difference in capsule orientation (erect vs. nodding) is a macroscopic feature that is easily visible with the naked eye or a hand lens, fitting the \"at a glance\" criteria.\n\n**Conclusion:** The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the curvature of the seta.\n\n<<<The main difference lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its short but distinctly curved (arcuate or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hang to the side.>>>"
