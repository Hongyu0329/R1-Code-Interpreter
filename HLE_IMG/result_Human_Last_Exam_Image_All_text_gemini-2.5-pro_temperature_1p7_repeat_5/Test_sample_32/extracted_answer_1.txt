The main difference lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its short but distinctly curved (arcuate or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hang to the side.
