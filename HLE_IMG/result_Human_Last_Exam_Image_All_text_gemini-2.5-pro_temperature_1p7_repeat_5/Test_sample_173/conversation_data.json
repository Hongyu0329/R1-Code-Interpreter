    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the given musical measure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Time Signatures**\nA time signature is a musical notation that indicates the number of beats per measure and the type of note that receives one beat. The top number represents the number of beats, and the bottom number represents the note value for one beat (e.g., 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, 2 = half note).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Rhythm in the Top Stave (Right Hand)**\nWe need to count the total duration of all the notes in the measure. Let's break it down by visual groupings, as beams often group notes into beats.\n\n*   **Beat 1:** The measure begins with a chord (D#6, B5, G#5) written as an eighth note, followed by two sixteenth notes (C#6 and B5). The total duration of this group is:\n    *   1 eighth note = 2 sixteenth notes\n    *   Total = 2 sixteenth notes + 1 sixteenth note + 1 sixteenth note = 4 sixteenth notes.\n    *   Four sixteenth notes are equal in duration to one quarter note. So, this is Beat 1.\n\n*   **Beat 2:** The next group consists of four sixteenth notes (D#6, C#6, B5, A#5), clearly beamed together.\n    *   Total = 4 sixteenth notes.\n    *   This is equal to one quarter note. This is Beat 2.\n\n*   **Beat 3:** The third group also consists of four sixteenth notes (C#6, B5, D#6, C#6), beamed together.\n    *   Total = 4 sixteenth notes.\n    *   This is equal to one quarter note. This is Beat 3.\n\n*   **Beat 4:** The final group consists of four double-stops (two notes played together), all written as sixteenth notes and beamed together.\n    *   Total = 4 sixteenth notes.\n    *   This is equal to one quarter note. This is Beat 4.\n\n*   **Total for Top Stave:** Adding up the beats, we have 4 groups, each equivalent to a quarter note. Total duration = 4 quarter notes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rhythm in the Bottom Stave (Left Hand)**\nTo confirm our findings, let's analyze the rhythm in the left hand.\n\n*   **Beats 1 and 2:** The measure begins with a chord (B#3, D#4) written as a half note. A half note's duration is equivalent to two quarter notes. This covers Beats 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Beat 3:** This is followed by a single G#3 written as a quarter note. This is Beat 3.\n\n*   **Beat 4:** The measure ends with a single C#4 written as a quarter note. This is Beat 4.\n\n*   **Total for Bottom Stave:** Adding up the durations, we have:\n    *   1 half note (2 quarter notes) + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Time Signature**\nBoth the top and bottom staves contain a total rhythmic duration equivalent to four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature must have a top number of 4 (four beats) and a bottom number of 4 (quarter note gets the beat).\n\nThe time signature is 4/4.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**\n*   A. 2/4: Incorrect (two quarter beats per measure).\n*   B. 3/4: Incorrect (three quarter beats per measure).\n*   C. 4/4: Correct (four quarter beats per measure).\n*   D. 3/8: Incorrect (three eighth beats per measure).\n*   E. 9/8: Incorrect (nine eighth beats per measure).\n\nThe analysis consistently points to 4/4 time.\n\n<<<C>>>"
