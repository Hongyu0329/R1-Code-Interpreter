    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The algorithm is defined by a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the recursion stops for that branch. An array with 0 or 1 elements is considered sorted.\n    *   **Recursive Step (when `n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are supposedly sorted, it compares the last element (`a[n-1]`) with the element that should now be the largest in the sorted prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n        3.  `swap(...)`: If the elements are in the wrong order (`a[n-1]` is smaller), it swaps them.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: If and only if a swap occurred, it makes a *second* recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`. This is because the swap may have disrupted the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The worst-case complexity occurs when the algorithm performs the maximum amount of work. In this case, the most work is done when the second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is executed at every possible step. This happens whenever the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` evaluates to true.\n\n    Consider an array that is sorted in reverse order, for example, `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n    *   When `sort(a, 5)` is called on `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`:\n        *   It first calls `sort(a, 4)`. This will eventually sort `[5, 4, 3, 2]` into `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.\n        *   It then checks `if a[4] < a[3]`, which is `if 1 < 5`. This is true.\n        *   It swaps them, making the array `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`.\n        *   Because a swap occurred, it calls `sort(a, 4)` again on the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 1]`. This subarray is also in a \"bad\" order, which will again lead to a maximum number of operations for that subproblem.\n\n    This pattern, where the `if` condition is consistently met, defines the worst-case behavior.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Time Complexity Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` represent the time taken by the algorithm in the worst case for an input of size `n`.\n    *   The operations inside the function (the `if` check and `swap`) take a constant amount of time, which we can denote as `c` or `O(1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the function performs:\n        1.  One recursive call `sort(a, n-1)`. Cost: `T(n-1)`.\n        2.  Constant time work. Cost: `c`.\n        3.  A second recursive call `sort(a, n-1)`. Cost: `T(n-1)`.\n    *   This gives us the recurrence relation:\n        `T(n) = T(n - 1) + c + T(n - 1)`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   The base case is `T(1)`, which is a constant amount of time since `n>1` is false. Let `T(1) = d`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` by repeated substitution:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   After `k` substitutions, this becomes: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^{k-1} + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n    *   The geometric series sum is `(2^k - 1)`. So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n    *   To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * d + c * 2^{n-1} - c`\n    *   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^{n-1} - c`\n\n5.  **Determine the Big O Complexity:**\n    The dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d + c) * 2^{n-1}`. When using Big O notation, we ignore constant factors and lower-order terms.\n    *   `O((d + c) * 2^{n-1} - c)` becomes `O(2^{n-1})`.\n    *   Since `2^{n-1} = (1/2) * 2^n`, and we ignore the constant factor `1/2`, the complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThis is an exponential time complexity, which is very inefficient. The algorithm's structure is similar to that of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which also has a `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
