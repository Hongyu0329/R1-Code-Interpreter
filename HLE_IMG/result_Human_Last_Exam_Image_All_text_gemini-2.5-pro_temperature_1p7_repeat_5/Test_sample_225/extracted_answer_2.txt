The final answer is the structure of tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion. It is a central carbon atom with a positive charge, bonded to three phenyl rings. Each phenyl ring is substituted with hydroxyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions.

Final Answer representation:
A central carbon atom, `C`, with a `+` sign indicating the positive charge. From this carbon, there are three single bonds, each connecting to a phenyl ring. Each phenyl ring has a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at the position ortho to the point of attachment (position 2) and another hydroxyl group at the position meta to the point of attachment (position 3).
For example: `[C(C6H3(OH)2)3]+`.
