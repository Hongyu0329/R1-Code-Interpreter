    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the species that indicates an Atlantic Coast location.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the visible organisms in the image.**\nThe photograph displays a typical rocky intertidal community. Several types of organisms can be identified:\n*   **Barnacles:** The rock surface is heavily encrusted with acorn barnacles of various sizes. These are the cone-shaped, sessile crustaceans.\n*   **Small, dark snails:** There are several small, dark-colored snails, likely a species of periwinkle.\n*   **Large, striped snail:** A prominent, relatively large snail with a conical, globose shell featuring distinct, thin brown spiral stripes on a lighter background.\n*   **Large, light-colored snail:** Another large snail shell, possibly of the same species as the striped one but heavily worn, or a different species like a whelk. It is eroded and lacks clear markings.\n*   **Tiny white/grey dots:** These could be very young barnacle recruits (spat) or another type of small invertebrate like a spirorbid worm.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which species has a limited geographic range.**\nThe question requires identifying a species found on the Atlantic Coast of North America but not the Pacific Coast. We need to analyze the distribution of the identifiable species.\n\n*   **Barnacles:** The dominant barnacle species on the North Atlantic coast is the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. On the Pacific Coast, a common equivalent is the Acorn Barnacle, *Balanus glandula*. While these are different species, visually distinguishing them from a photograph without seeing specific anatomical details (like the membranous base of *S. balanoides* vs. the calcareous base of *B. glandula*) can be difficult and unreliable.\n*   **Snails:** Gastropods (snails) often have more distinct shell features that aid in identification.\n    *   The small dark snails could be *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle), which is found on **both** the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, so it is not a useful indicator.\n    *   The large, striped snail is the most clearly identifiable gastropod in the image. Its size, shape, and striped pattern are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**, scientific name *Littorina littorea*.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the geographic distribution of the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*).**\n*   **Native Range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean (Europe).\n*   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It has since become extremely widespread and abundant, ranging from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland, USA.\n*   **Pacific Coast Status:** Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not** established on the Pacific Coast of North America. While occasional individuals may have been transported, it has not formed self-sustaining populations there.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which species is the definitive indicator.**\nBecause the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is a common and established species on the Atlantic Coast but absent from the Pacific Coast, its presence in this thriving intertidal community is definitive proof that the photograph was taken on the Atlantic Coast. The other organisms are either harder to identify with certainty from the photo or have ranges that span both coasts.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe most identifiable species that is exclusive to the Atlantic coast (in a North American context) is the striped snail, the Common Periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
