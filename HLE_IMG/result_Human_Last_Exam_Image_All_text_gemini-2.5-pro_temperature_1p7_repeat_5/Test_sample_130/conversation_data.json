    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is produced when a chemical element is energized (for example, by heating it or passing an electric current through it). The energized atoms emit light, but only at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or a diffraction grating, it is separated into its component colors, appearing as a series of bright lines against a dark background.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Principle:** Every chemical element has a unique emission spectrum, like a fingerprint. The number, color (wavelength), and position of the lines are characteristic of that specific element. Our task is to identify the element by comparing the pattern of lines in the image to the known spectra of different elements.\n\n2.  **Observe the Key Features of the Spectrum:**\n    *   The spectrum spans the entire visible range, from deep red on the right to blue/violet on the left.\n    *   **Red Region:** There is at least one prominent bright red line.\n    *   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very strong, distinct yellow-orange line. This is often a key identifier.\n    *   **Green/Cyan Region:** There are several distinct lines in the green and blue-green (cyan) parts of the spectrum.\n    *   **Blue/Violet Region:** There is a cluster of multiple lines in the blue and violet regions.\n    *   **Overall Complexity:** The spectrum is neither very simple (like hydrogen) nor extremely dense with lines (like iron). It has a moderate number of clearly separated lines.\n\n3.  **Compare with Known Elemental Spectra:**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) consists of four main lines: a red line (656 nm), a blue-green line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is much more complex, with many more lines. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n    *   **Sodium:** Sodium is famous for its very strong and dominant doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow part of the spectrum (~589 nm). While the given spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions, which a pure sodium spectrum lacks. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n    *   **Neon:** Neon is known for its large number of bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum, which is why neon signs are typically reddish-orange. The spectrum in the image shows a good distribution of colors across the entire visible range, not just a concentration in the red-orange part. Therefore, it is not neon.\n    *   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of helium is known to have several prominent lines across the visible spectrum. Its characteristic lines include:\n        *   A strong red line (~668 nm)\n        *   A very bright yellow line (~588 nm)\n        *   Several green and cyan lines (~502 nm, ~492 nm, ~471 nm)\n        *   Multiple blue and violet lines (~447 nm and others)\n        The pattern observed in the image—a strong red line, a very bright yellow line, and multiple lines in the green and blue regions—is a perfect match for the known emission spectrum of helium.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the distinct pattern of colored lines, particularly the prominent bright yellow line in combination with strong red, green, and blue lines, the spectrum shown in the image is a classic representation of the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
