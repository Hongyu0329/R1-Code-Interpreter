    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the FCC Crystal Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and in the center of each of its six faces. This structure is also known as cubic close-packed.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction refers to looking along a face diagonal of the conventional cubic unit cell. When we view a 3D crystal structure from a specific direction, the atoms are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction. We need to determine the resulting 2D pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along [110].\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern**\nTo find the pattern, we can analyze how the atomic planes are stacked along the [110] direction.\n*   The planes perpendicular to the [110] direction are the (110) planes.\n*   In an FCC structure, the (110) planes stack in a two-layer repeating sequence, which can be denoted as ABAB...\n*   When these two layers are projected onto a single 2D plane, they superimpose.\n*   Layer A itself forms a rectangular grid of atoms.\n*   Layer B also forms an identical rectangular grid, but it is shifted such that its atoms lie exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of Layer A.\n*   The resulting superimposed pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This pattern is characterized by having atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the center of that rectangle. This is the key signature of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Options**\nNow, we need to examine each image to see which one matches the centered rectangular pattern. The images are presented with perspective, so we should focus on the topological arrangement of the atoms rather than precise geometric measurements like angles or side ratios.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but not in the centers. This pattern is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction or a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction. It is not a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image displays a clear hexagonal pattern. Atoms are arranged with six-fold symmetry (or three-fold, depending on how you see it). This hexagonal pattern is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the body diagonal).\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern shows rows of atoms that are shifted relative to each other. If we analyze the horizontal positions of the rows, we can identify at least three distinct repeating positions (an ABC... type stacking). This complex stacking is characteristic of a BCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction. It does not match the two-layer (ABAB...) nature of the FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image B:** This pattern, although drawn in perspective, shows a two-layer staggered structure. We can identify rows of atoms that are shifted relative to the rows above and below them. This \"bricklayer\" pattern is topologically equivalent to a centered rectangular lattice. You can visualize a rectangle formed by four atoms from one \"sub-lattice,\" and an atom from the other \"sub-lattice\" will be located near the center of this rectangle. The two-layer (ABAB...) nature is evident. This pattern perfectly matches our theoretical prediction for the FCC [110] view.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the characteristic projection patterns of different crystal structures and directions, we can conclude:\n*   A is a simple rectangular lattice (e.g., BCC [110]).\n*   C is a complex three-layer stacked lattice (e.g., BCC [111]).\n*   D is a hexagonal lattice (FCC [111]).\n*   B is a centered rectangular lattice (FCC [110]).\n\nTherefore, pattern B represents a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
