    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the Request**\n    *   The question asks for the name of a specific perceptual phenomenon.\n    *   Clues are provided in the text and the accompanying image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clues**\n    *   **\"...an illusion...\"**: What we perceive is different from the physical reality.\n    *   **\"...similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. The brain constructs a perception (3D cube) that goes beyond the raw sensory input (2D lines). This suggests the phenomenon in question also involves the brain \"filling in\" information or choosing an interpretation.\n    *   **\"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"**: This means it's a fundamental part of how we perceive the world, something that happens automatically without us noticing.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Visual Clues (The Image)**\n    *   The image consists of two graphs representing a sound over time.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram)**: This graph shows the frequencies present in the sound over time. We see a strong, narrow horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted. At the point of interruption, there is a vertical smear, representing a burst of sound containing many frequencies, such as a burst of noise or a cough. The key observation is that the horizontal line for the pure tone has a clear *gap* during the noise burst.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform)**: This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a clean, regular sine wave (the pure tone). This is interrupted by a short period of a complex, chaotic waveform (the noise burst). After the noise, the clean sine wave resumes.\n    *   **Conclusion from Image**: The physical reality presented in the graphs is: Pure Tone -> Stop -> Noise Burst -> Start -> Pure Tone.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize Text and Visuals to Identify the Phenomenon**\n    *   The phenomenon is an *auditory* illusion, as shown by the sound-related graphs.\n    *   The illusion lies in how this sound is perceived. Despite the physical gap in the pure tone, a human listener will typically not perceive the gap. Instead, they will hear the pure tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* or \"behind\" the burst of noise.\n    *   The brain assumes that it's more likely for a continuous sound to be temporarily masked by another sound than for one sound to stop precisely when another begins and then restart precisely when the second one ends. It therefore \"fills in\" the missing auditory information.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" is the \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" mentioned in the question. It helps us perceive continuous speech or music in noisy environments.\n    *   The name for this specific auditory phenomenon is the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. A specific instance of this involving speech sounds is called the Phonemic Restoration Effect. Given the image shows a generic tone, the broader term is the most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
