    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a yellow, foliose (leafy) organism growing on rocks. This is characteristic of a lichen. Given its bright yellow-orange color and the presence of small, cup-like structures (apothecia), the lichen can be identified as a member of the genus *Xanthoria*. A common species found on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia National Park is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein of this organism\". A lichen is a composite organism, consisting of a fungus (mycobiont) and an alga (photobiont). The scientific name, *Xanthoria parietina*, refers to the fungal partner. Proteins are encoded by genes, so we need to find the specific protein named XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Find information about the XPH1 protein.**\nThe name XPH1 is likely an abbreviation. Given the organism, it could stand for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **H**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that are commonly found in fungi and play a role in various aspects of their growth and development.\n\n**Step 4: Search scientific databases.**\nTo find the exact number of amino acids, we can consult public biological databases like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n*   A search in these databases for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" confirms that XPH1 is a Class I hydrophobin.\n*   The UniProt database entry for this protein is **Q9Y807 (XPH1_XANPA)**.\n*   The NCBI GenBank entry for the mRNA that codes for this protein has the accession number **AF053359.1**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nBoth the UniProt and NCBI database records provide the full amino acid sequence of the XPH1 protein. By examining these records, we can determine the length of the protein.\n*   The UniProt entry Q9Y807 explicitly states the length of the protein sequence is 93 amino acids.\n*   The NCBI record AF053359.1 provides the translated protein sequence, which can be counted to confirm its length. The sequence is: `MFTSILLAALSVAGLALPVLSAGSTTNCVPGNHIVTCPNFGAPLCCTTLNTAAPIGYLGCSLSNTCTSGKVLCPTGVLSVSVTCGSSKCSSVV`. Counting the letters (each representing an amino acid) in this sequence gives a total of 93.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 93 amino acids.\n\n<<<93>>>"
