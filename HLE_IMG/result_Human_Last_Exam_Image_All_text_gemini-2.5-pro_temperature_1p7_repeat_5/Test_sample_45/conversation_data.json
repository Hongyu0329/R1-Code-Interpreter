    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the given tiling pattern. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern can be rotated around a central point by less than 360 degrees and still look identical. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times this happens. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential centers of rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry of the entire pattern, we need to find points around which we can rotate the whole tiling and have it map onto itself. Good candidates for these centers are usually the centers of the repeating shapes or the vertices where multiple shapes meet. In this pattern, the most prominent features are the dark blue hexagons and the star-like shapes formed by the lighter-colored tiles.\n\n**Step 3: Test for the highest possible symmetry**\nFor any repeating (periodic) tiling of a flat plane, the crystallographic restriction theorem states that the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. We should test for the highest possible symmetry first, which is 6-fold.\n\n*   **Select a center:** Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as our potential center of rotation.\n*   **Perform a mental rotation:** Imagine placing a pin in the center of a blue hexagon and rotating the entire image. A 6-fold rotation corresponds to a rotation by 360° / 6 = 60°.\n*   **Analyze the result:**\n    *   When rotated by 60°, the central blue hexagon itself will align perfectly with its original position.\n    *   Now, observe the shapes surrounding the hexagon. The pattern of light brown (\"squarish\") and orange (\"rhombus\") shapes around the hexagon is also symmetrical. A 60° rotation will move each of these surrounding shapes into the position previously occupied by an identical shape of the same color and orientation.\n    *   Extending this observation to the entire pattern, we can see that every hexagon maps onto another hexagon, every light brown shape maps onto another light brown shape, and every orange shape maps onto another orange shape. The entire tiling looks identical after a 60° rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the symmetry**\nSince a 60° rotation leaves the pattern unchanged, it will also be unchanged by rotations of 120° (2x60°), 180° (3x60°), 240° (4x60°), and 300° (5x60°). This means the pattern can be rotated into an identical position 6 times in a full 360° turn. Therefore, the pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We can also test another prominent point, such as the center of the star-like feature formed by six of the light brown shapes. Rotating the pattern by 60° around this point also leaves the entire tiling unchanged. The existence of these 6-fold rotation centers confirms our conclusion.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer**\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry found in the tiling is 6-fold. When a pattern has multiple types of rotational symmetry (e.g., 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold centers can coexist in the same pattern), \"the\" rotational symmetry of the pattern is typically defined by the highest order present.\n\nThe rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
