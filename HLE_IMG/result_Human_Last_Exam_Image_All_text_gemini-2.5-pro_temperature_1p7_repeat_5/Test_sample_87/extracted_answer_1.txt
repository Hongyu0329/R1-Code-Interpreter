The structures of the three products are:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A is the result of a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by an acetylation. The main skeleton is a hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole system formed from the non-acetylated ylide and methyl propiolate. The pyrroline substituent on this skeleton undergoes tautomerization to an enamine, and the enamine nitrogen is acetylated.

The structure is `1-[(1-acetyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)]-2-methoxycarbonyl-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole`. The image of the structure is as follows:
 

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
B is the result of cycloaddition followed by a two-step oxidation. The initial cycloadduct undergoes dehydrogenation to form an aromatic pyrrole ring (creating a dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole system). The pyrroline substituent is then oxidized to a lactam (a pyrrolidinone ring).

The structure is `2-methoxycarbonyl-1-(5-oxopyrrolidin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole`. The image of the structure is as follows:
 

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
C is a simple acetylation product of the starting material where the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring is acetylated.

The structure is `1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid`. The image of the structure is as follows:
