    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume the presence of one nitrogen atom.\n*   Subtracting the mass of one nitrogen atom (14 g/mol) from the total mass gives 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   Dividing the remaining mass by the mass of carbon (12 g/mol) helps to estimate the number of carbons: 121 / 12 ≈ 10. A possible formula is C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹**: There appear to be two weak-to-medium sharp peaks, which are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks are visible just above 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating sp² C-H stretches from an aromatic ring.\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks are visible just below 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating sp³ C-H stretches from saturated (aliphatic) carbons.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹**: These are characteristic C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~750 cm⁻¹ and ~700 cm⁻¹**: Strong peaks in this region often indicate a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The absence of a strong peak in the 1650-1800 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   The IR data strongly supports the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups. This is consistent with the formula C₉H₁₃N and a DBE of 4.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR Shifts**: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   There are a total of 7 carbon signals for a molecule with 9 carbons (from C₉H₁₃N), which implies molecular symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (100-160 ppm)**: Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has 6 carbons but only 4 unique environments (1 ipso-C, 2 ortho-C, 2 meta-C, 1 para-C). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon (attached to the side chain).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (0-70 ppm)**: Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm, corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data**: \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   DEPT-135 shows CH and CH₃ groups as positive signals, CH₂ groups as negative signals, and quaternary carbons as no signal.\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon at 145.1 ppm will not appear in the DEPT spectrum.\n    *   The remaining 6 carbons with attached protons give rise to the 6 DEPT signals.\n    *   **One negative signal**: This must be a CH₂ group. It corresponds to either the 49.6 or 43.5 ppm signal.\n    *   **Five positive signals**: These must be CH or CH₃ groups. Three of these are the aromatic CH carbons (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm). The remaining two positive signals must come from the aliphatic carbons. The signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group. Therefore, the last aliphatic signal must be a CH group.\n*   **Summary of Carbon types**:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 C (quaternary), 3 CH (representing 5 C-H carbons in total)\n    *   Aliphatic: 1 CH₂, 1 CH, 1 CH₃\n    *   This makes up the C₉ skeleton and fits the DEPT data perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, integral ~5H)**: This is the typical region and pattern for the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, integral ~2H)**: An aliphatic signal corresponding to 2 protons.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, integral ~1H)**: An aliphatic signal corresponding to 1 proton.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integral ~3H)**: The 3H integration indicates a methyl (CH₃) group. The doublet splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-CH₃).\n*   The sum of integrated protons is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11. The formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 protons. The missing 2 protons are from the -NH₂ group, which often appears as a broad, non-integrated signal (visible as a small broad peak around 1.6 ppm).\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation using all data, including HSQC**\n*   From the previous steps, we have the following fragments: a phenyl group (Ph-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and an aliphatic side chain composed of a CH₂, a CH, and a CH₃ group.\n*   The side chain fragments can only connect in one way to form a propyl chain: -CH₂-CH(CH₃)- (an isobutyl skeleton fragment).\n*   There are two ways to attach the Phenyl group and the Amine group to the ends of this chain:\n    1.  **Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**: IUPAC name **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n    2.  **Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**: IUPAC name **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n*   The **HSQC spectrum** is crucial for distinguishing between these two isomers, as it correlates each proton with the carbon it is directly attached to.\n    *   The cross-peak at (¹H ~1.2 ppm, ¹³C ~19.2 ppm) confirms the assignment of the CH₃ group.\n    *   The cross-peak at (¹H ~2.7 ppm, ¹³C ~49.6 ppm) shows that the **CH** group's carbon resonates at **49.6 ppm**.\n    *   The cross-peak at (¹H ~2.8 ppm, ¹³C ~43.5 ppm) shows that the **CH₂** group's carbon resonates at **43.5 ppm**.\n*   Let's analyze the expected ¹³C shifts for the two isomers:\n    *   **Isomer 1 (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)**: The CH group is attached to the -NH₂ group. The CH₂ group is benzylic (attached to the phenyl ring).\n        *   C(CH-NH₂): Expected shift ~50-55 ppm. Experimental: 49.6 ppm.\n        *   C(CH₂-Ph): Expected shift ~40 ppm. Experimental: 43.5 ppm.\n        *   This shows an excellent match with the experimental data.\n    *   **Isomer 2 (2-phenyl-1-propanamine)**: The CH group is benzylic. The CH₂ group is attached to the -NH₂ group.\n        *   C(CH-Ph): Expected shift ~40-45 ppm. Experimental: 49.6 ppm.\n        *   C(CH₂-NH₂): Expected shift ~40-45 ppm. Experimental: 43.5 ppm.\n        *   This assignment does not fit as well. The expected shifts are very similar, contrary to the 6 ppm difference observed. Also, the chemical shift for the benzylic CH is significantly higher than expected.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence, particularly the chemical shifts clarified by the HSQC experiment, overwhelmingly supports the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\nThe IUPAC naming follows these rules:\n*   Parent chain: Propane (3 carbons).\n*   Principal functional group: Amine (-NH₂).\n*   Numbering: Number the propane chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. Ph-¹CH₂-²CH(NH₂)-³CH₃. The amine is at position 2 (propan-2-amine).\n*   Substituent: A phenyl group is at position 1.\n*   Final Name: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
