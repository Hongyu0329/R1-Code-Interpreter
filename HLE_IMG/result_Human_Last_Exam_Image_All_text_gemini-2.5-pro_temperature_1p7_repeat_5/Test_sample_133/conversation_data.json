    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Ion (M+) Region**\n*   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) belong to the molecular ion cluster. In the given spectrum, this cluster appears at m/z values of 258, 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n*   The presence of multiple peaks in this cluster separated by 2 mass units (e.g., 260, 262, 264) is characteristic of a compound containing chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atoms due to their natural isotopic abundances (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl and ⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br).\n*   Let's assume the peak corresponding to the molecule with the lightest isotopes (e.g., all ³⁵Cl) is at m/z 260 (I=34.8%). The subsequent peaks are M+2 at m/z 262 (I=29.0%), M+4 at m/z 264 (I=12.9%), and M+6 at m/z 266 (I=3.22%).\n\n**2. Determining the Number of Halogen Atoms**\n*   The relative intensities of the isotope peaks allow us to determine the number of chlorine or bromine atoms.\n    *   One Cl atom gives a ratio of M:(M+2) ≈ 3:1.\n    *   Two Cl atoms give a ratio of M:(M+2):(M+4) ≈ 9:6:1 (or 100:65:11).\n    *   Three Cl atoms give a ratio of M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ≈ 27:27:9:1 (or 100:98:32:4).\n    *   One Br atom gives a ratio of M:(M+2) ≈ 1:1.\n*   The most intense peak in the spectrum (the base peak) is at m/z = 225. This peak is part of an isotopic cluster with peaks at m/z 225 (I=100%), m/z 227 (I=66.7%), and m/z 229 (I=22.2%).\n*   Let's analyze the ratio of the peaks in this base peak cluster: I(225)/I(227) = 100 / 66.7 ≈ 1.5. This ratio is very close to the theoretical ratio of 9:6 = 1.5 for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n*   The difference in mass between the molecular ion (e.g., m/z 260) and the base peak fragment (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 amu. This corresponds to the mass of a ³⁵Cl atom.\n*   This suggests the primary fragmentation pathway is the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion: M⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺.\n*   Since the fragment [M-Cl]⁺ contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule (M) must contain **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Formula**\n*   Based on the finding of three chlorine atoms, the lowest mass molecular ion (containing three ³⁵Cl isotopes) is at m/z = 260. The chemical formula is CₓHᵧCl₃.\n*   The mass of the non-chlorine part (CₓHᵧ) is 260 - (3 × 35) = 260 - 105 = 155 amu.\n*   Using the Rule of 13 to find a plausible formula for CₓHᵧ = 155:\n    *   Divide by 13 (mass of CH): 155 / 13 = 11 with a remainder of 12.\n    *   This suggests a base formula of C₁₁H₁₁₊₁₂ = C₁₁H₂₃. This is saturated and seems unlikely for a molecule with this fragmentation pattern.\n    *   Alternatively, using a different combination: 155 = 12 × 12 + 11. This suggests the formula C₁₂H₁₁. The degree of unsaturation for C₁₂H₁₁ is 12 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 7 (for a radical).\n*   However, let's re-examine the evidence for a specific structural feature. The presence of a -CCl₃ group is often indicated by specific fragments.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis of a R-CCl₃ structure. The molecule's formula would be C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃, which is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n    *   This structure would readily lose a chlorine atom to form [C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₂]⁺. The mass of this ion would be M(C₁₁H₁₁) + M(C) + M(Cl₂) = 143 + 12 + 70 = 225. This matches the base peak perfectly.\n    *   Furthermore, we observe a strong peak for the CCl⁺ fragment at m/z 47 (I=18.4%) and 49 (I=6.24%). The ratio is 18.4 / 6.24 = 2.95, which is an excellent match for the theoretical 3:1 ratio of a fragment with one chlorine atom.\n    *   We also see a prominent peak at m/z 143 (I=27.8%), which corresponds to the [C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ fragment, formed by the cleavage of the C-C bond between the C₁₁H₁₁ group and the CCl₃ group.\n*   All this evidence strongly supports a structure of the type **C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃**.\n\n**4. Determining the Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. The degree of unsaturation is 12 + 1 - (11+3)/2 = 13 - 7 = 6.\n*   The C₁₁H₁₁ group (R) has a degree of unsaturation of 6. A small peak at m/z 77 (phenyl cation, C₆H₅⁺) suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DBE=4).\n*   The rest of the R group is C₅H₆, which must account for the remaining 2 degrees of unsaturation. A cyclopentadiene ring structure is a very plausible candidate (1 ring + 2 double bonds = DBE 3, this doesn't fit). A cyclopentene ring (1 ring + 1 double bond = DBE 2) is a better fit.\n*   So, a plausible structure for the C₁₁H₁₁ group is a **phenylcyclopentenyl** group.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a phenyl(trichloromethyl)cyclopentene isomer. There are several possible positions for the groups on the ring. Without more data (like NMR), we cannot pinpoint the exact isomer. However, we can provide a systematic IUPAC name for one of the plausible structures.\n\nA plausible isomer is **1-phenyl-2-(trichloromethyl)cyclopent-1-ene**. Let's provide a slightly different one as an example of a systematic name derived from the evidence.\n\n**Final Answer Construction**\n*   **Compound Identification:** The evidence points strongly to a molecule with the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and containing a CCl₃ group attached to a C₁₁H₁₁ moiety.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** Based on the structural deduction of a trichloromethyl group attached to a phenylcyclopentenyl moiety, a valid systematic IUPAC name for one such isomer is **1-phenyl-3-(trichloromethyl)cyclopent-1-ene**.\n\n(Note: Another very similar isomer would be 1-(trichloromethyl)-2-phenylcyclopent-1-ene. The analysis cannot distinguish between these isomers, but both fit the evidence.)\n\nFinal Answer: The IUPAC systematic name for a compound that matches the spectral data.\n\n<<<1-phenyl-3-(trichloromethyl)cyclopent-1-ene>>>"
