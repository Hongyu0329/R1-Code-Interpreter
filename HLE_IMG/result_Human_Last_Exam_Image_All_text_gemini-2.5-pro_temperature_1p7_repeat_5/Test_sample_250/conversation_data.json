    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Initial Chord Progression:**\n    *   The key signature shows one flat (Bb), which typically indicates F major or D minor.\n    *   However, the first chord is an F minor chord (indicated by \"F-\"). Jazz lead sheets often use a simpler key signature and write in accidentals as needed. The piece starting and returning to F minor strongly suggests the key is F minor.\n    *   The most striking feature is the chord progression in the first few measures: `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`.\n    *   This chromatic descent of minor-quality chords (F minor, to E half-diminished, to Eb minor 6) is highly distinctive and a significant clue.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The melody in the first measure starts on the note C, which is the 5th of the F minor chord.\n    *   The melodic contour descends through the A section, mirroring the descending chord progression. For instance, over the E-7b5 chord, a key melodic note is B natural. Over the Eb-6 chord, a key melodic note is Ab.\n    *   This combination of a melody starting on the 5th of the tonic minor chord and then moving down chromatically in conjunction with the chords is characteristic of a specific famous tune.\n\n3.  **Identify the Tune Based on the Chord Progression and Melody:**\n    *   The opening chord progression `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-7 (or a similar quality like Eb-6) | ...` is the unmistakable signature of the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\".\n    *   No other well-known jazz standard features this specific opening harmonic sequence.\n    *   The melody, with its starting note on the 5th and subsequent descending pattern, also matches the melody of \"Nica's Dream\".\n\n4.  **Identify the Composer:**\n    *   Having identified the tune as \"Nica's Dream,\" we can identify its composer. \"Nica's Dream\" was composed by the influential jazz pianist and composer Horace Silver. It first appeared on the 1956 Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers album titled \"The Jazz Messengers\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the unique chord progression and melodic characteristics of the \"A\" section, the piece is definitively identified. While some lead sheets may contain variations or errors (the B section in this particular chart seems non-standard), the A section is iconic enough for a positive identification.\n\nThe title of the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\" and its composer is Horace Silver.\n\n<<<\"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver>>>"
