    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core structure of the molecule.**\n    The image displays a complex organic molecule. It features a polycyclic system, meaning it has multiple fused rings. Specifically, it consists of four fused six-membered rings.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the heteroatoms and functional groups.**\n    The molecule contains two nitrogen (N) atoms, which are characteristic of alkaloids. Both nitrogen atoms are tertiary amines, integrated into the ring system.\n    There is also an oxygen (O) atom present as part of a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to one of the nitrogen atoms, forming a cyclic amide, which is known as a lactam.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recognize the parent alkaloid class.**\n    The tetracyclic framework composed of four fused six-membered rings containing two nitrogen atoms is the characteristic skeleton of sparteine-type alkaloids, which belong to the larger class of quinolizidine alkaloids (lupin alkaloids). The parent compound without the carbonyl group is called sparteine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific compound.**\n    The compound shown is an oxidized derivative of sparteine, containing a lactam functional group. This specific structure, 2-oxosparteine, is known by the common name **Lupanine**. Lupanine is a major alkaloid found in the seeds of plants from the *Lupinus* (lupin) genus.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consider the stereochemistry.**\n    The drawing includes stereochemical indicators (wedged and dashed bonds). These define a specific stereoisomer. The configuration shown is the one for the most common, naturally occurring form of lupanine, often referred to as (+)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 6: Differentiate from other similar alkaloids.**\n    *   It is not **sparteine** because it has a carbonyl group.\n    *   It is not **matrine**, another tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid, because matrine has a different ring fusion pattern.\n    *   It is not **cytisine** or **anagyrine**, as those contain an aromatic (or dihydropyridone) ring, whereas the structure shown is fully saturated (except for the C=O double bond).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the tetracyclic lactam structure derived from the sparteine skeleton, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
