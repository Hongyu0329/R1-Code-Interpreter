    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR data.\n\n**Goal:** To identify and count the total number of distinct mRNA splice species detected in the experiment. A splice species is a unique mRNA molecule resulting from the splicing of a pre-mRNA. In this RT-PCR experiment, each unique band size produced by a given primer pair represents at least one unique splice species.\n\n**Analysis of each PCR panel:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R, 20 cycles) and the supplementary E1F1/E4R panel:**\n    *   This primer pair amplifies a region covering parts of the E1 and E4 ORFs.\n    *   Panel B clearly shows two major bands, labeled 1 (190 bp) and 2 (159 bp). This indicates the presence of at least two major splice species.\n    *   The supplementary panel, also labeled E1F1/E4R, shows three additional, smaller bands labeled 3, 4, and 5. These are fainter, representing less abundant species.\n    *   Combining the results from these two panels for the E1F1/E4R primer pair, we find a total of 5 distinct PCR products. Each of these must come from a unique splice species.\n    *   **Count so far: 5 species.**\n\n2.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R, 30 cycles):**\n    *   This panel uses the E1F3 primer, which is a splice-junction primer specific for the splice from nucleotide 929 to 3506 (929^3506). Only transcripts containing this exact splice will be amplified.\n    *   Two distinct bands are observed: band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n    *   This indicates there are two different splice species that share the 929^3506 splice junction but differ in their splicing pattern downstream, between the junction and the L2R primer.\n    *   Since these species are defined by a specific splice junction (929^3506) that is different from the one characterized for one of the major species (929^3465, detected by primer E1F2), these two species are new and distinct from those previously identified.\n    *   **New species found: 2.**\n    *   **Running total: 5 + 2 = 7 species.**\n\n3.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):**\n    *   This panel uses primers that span a large portion of the genome, from the E1 region to the L1 region. It's a sensitive assay due to the higher cycle number (30 cycles), allowing detection of low-abundance transcripts.\n    *   Four distinct bands are observed: 1 (450 bp), 2 (419 bp), 3 (378 bp), and 4 (187 bp).\n    *   Bands 1 and 2 are the most abundant. Their size difference (450 - 419 = 31 bp) matches the size difference of the major bands in panel B (190 - 159 = 31 bp). It's reasonable to conclude that these are the long-range PCR products of the two major species already identified in step 1. Thus, they are not new species.\n    *   Bands 3 (378 bp) and 4 (187 bp) are new products not seen with the other primer sets. They represent two additional splice species that are present at lower levels and contain both the E1F1 and L1R primer binding sites. While it's possible they correspond to species identified in other panels (e.g., those from panel G or the minor species from the E1F1/E4R panel), we cannot confirm this overlap from the given data. They might be unique species that splice out the regions containing the other reverse primers (E4R, E5R, L2R). Without evidence of overlap, the most direct interpretation is that these are two distinct, newly identified species.\n    *   **New species found: 2.**\n    *   **Final count: 7 + 2 = 9 species.**\n\n**Summary of all identified splice species:**\n*   **5 species** identified by the E1F1/E4R primer pair (2 major, 3 minor).\n*   **2 species** identified by the E1F3/L2R primer pair, which are characterized by the 929^3506 splice junction.\n*   **2 additional species** identified by the E1F1/L1R primer pair, which were not detected by the other primer combinations.\n\nTotal number of splice species = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nBased on the analysis of all the provided gel panels, we can identify a total of 9 distinct splice species.\n\n<<<9>>>"
