1. The music modulates to the key of **E major**. The process begins with the dominant of E (a B major chord) in measure 10 and resolves to the tonic of E major in measure 12.
2. The original key is C-sharp minor. E major is the **relative major** of C-sharp minor, as they both share the same four-sharp key signature. In a minor-key sonata form movement, modulating from the tonic (i) to the relative major (III) is a standard and structurally important convention.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is an E major chord in second inversion. In the home key of C# minor, E is the mediant (the third scale degree). Therefore, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking is **III⁶/₄**.
