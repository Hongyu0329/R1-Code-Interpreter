    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. Specifically, it is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   **Component breakdown for atom counting:**\n    *   **Bicyclic lactam core (without substituents):** 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This consists of 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group C=O). (C6H5NO)\n    *   **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3):** Attached at position 5. Adds 1 carbon and 3 fluorines. (CF3)\n    *   **p-Methoxybenzyl group (PMB):** Attached to the nitrogen atom. Its formula is C8H9O (C6H4 ring + CH2 + OCH3).\n*   **Calculating the molecular formula of the starting material:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 (CF3) = 3\n    *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 (core) = 1\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2\n*   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative removal of the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from amines and alcohols. The PMB group on the nitrogen atom is cleaved and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We remove the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Net change: - C8H(9-1)O1 = - C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The lactam (amide) and trifluoromethyl groups are unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** One molecule of H2 is added across the double bond.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the formation of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (C-N) is cleaved. This is equivalent to the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the C-N bond, forming a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from the carbonyl carbon and an amino group (-NH2) from the nitrogen. The bicyclic ring opens to form a substituted cyclopentane derivative.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Molecular Formulas:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Final Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final answer is the molecular formula of the product.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
