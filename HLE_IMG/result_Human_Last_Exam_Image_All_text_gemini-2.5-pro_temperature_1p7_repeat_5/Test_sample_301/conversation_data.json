    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the style, subject matter, and distinctive features of each artwork, here are the authors identified for each of the nine works, ordered from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** The piece features cartoonish fish with human-like expressions. This whimsical, illustrative, and satirical style is a hallmark of the famous Chinese cartoonist **Ding Cong (丁聪)**.\n*   **Artwork 2 (Top Center):** This is a traditional Chinese ink painting of chrysanthemums. The powerful, calligraphic brushwork, especially for the stems and leaves, reflects a style known as \"jinshiwei\" (epigraphic flavor), which is characteristic of **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**, a leading master of the Shanghai School.\n*   **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a realistic oil portrait of an ethnic minority woman. This specific work is a famous painting titled \"Kazakh Shepherdess\" (哈萨克牧羊女) by **Dong Xiwen (董希文)**, a pioneer of Chinese oil painting who skillfully blended Western realism with Chinese themes.\n*   **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a powerful and dynamic cursive script (草书). The dramatic, expressive, and energetic style is characteristic of the late Ming dynasty master **Wang Duo (王铎)**.\n*   **Artwork 5 (Middle Center):** An abstract work featuring two circles (red and orange) over a landscape rendered in ink wash. This fusion of Western abstract forms with traditional Chinese ink painting aesthetics is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a giant of modern Chinese art.\n*   **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** A piece of calligraphy in a formal script commenting on ancient stone steles. The style is strong, angular, and has an archaic feel, typical of the \"Stele School\" (碑学) of calligraphy. This is the work of **Zhao Zhiqian (赵之谦)**, a prominent master of this school from the Qing dynasty.\n*   **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This is a fragment of calligraphy in a distinctive running-cursive script. The slanted posture of the characters and the fluid, rhythmic brushwork are the unmistakable style of the Song dynasty master **Mi Fu (米芾)**.\n*   **Artwork 8 (Bottom Center):** This is a famous realist oil portrait of a young woman against a dark, leafy background. The painting, titled \"Youth\" (青春), is an iconic work of Chinese Neoclassical Realism by the artist **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n*   **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** A painting of a graceful woman in elaborate, exotic attire. The style, which uses elegant lines inspired by the Dunhuang murals combined with rich color, is a celebrated feature of the works of the modern master **Zhang Daqian (张大千)**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on this analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom, are:\n1.  Ding Cong\n2.  Wu Changshuo\n3.  Dong Xiwen\n4.  Wang Duo\n5.  Wu Guanzhong\n6.  Zhao Zhiqian\n7.  Mi Fu\n8.  Jin Shangyi\n9.  Zhang Daqian\n\n<<<Ding Cong, Wu Changshuo, Dong Xiwen, Wang Duo, Wu Guanzhong, Zhao Zhiqian, Mi Fu, Jin Shangyi, Zhang Daqian>>>"
