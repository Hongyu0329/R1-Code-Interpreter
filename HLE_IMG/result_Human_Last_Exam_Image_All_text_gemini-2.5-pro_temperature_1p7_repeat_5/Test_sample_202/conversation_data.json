    "Here is a step-by-step analysis and identification of each rock specimen.\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\nTo identify the rocks, we will examine their key characteristics: texture (crystal size, shape, and arrangement), color, and composition based on visual clues.\n\n**Specimen H**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** The rock is highly porous with many visible holes (vesicles). This texture is called vesicular. The underlying rock material appears fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye. This indicates rapid cooling.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Color.** The rock has a reddish-brown, \"cinder-like\" color. This often results from the oxidation of iron in the lava as it cools.\n*   **Step 3: Synthesis.** A highly vesicular, reddish, extrusive (fast-cooling) igneous rock is known as **scoria** or volcanic cinder. It forms from gas-rich mafic or intermediate lava.\n\n**Specimen J**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** Similar to specimen H, this rock is also highly vesicular and appears very lightweight and porous. The texture looks almost frothy. The rock is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Step 2: Observe Color.** The rock is very light-colored, ranging from white to light gray.\n*   **Step 3: Synthesis.** A lightweight, light-colored, frothy, vesicular extrusive igneous rock is identified as **pumice**. Its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. Its extreme porosity is due to a large volume of trapped gas in high-viscosity lava during a violent eruption, and it is often low-density enough to float on water.\n\n**Specimen I**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** This rock is composed of numerous distinct fragments, or clasts, of various sizes and colors that are cemented together. The fragments appear angular. The material binding the fragments is a finer-grained matrix. This is a clastic or fragmental texture.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Origin.** The angular nature of the fragments and the overall appearance suggest a volcanic origin, specifically from an explosive eruption that shatters pre-existing rock and ejects a mixture of rock fragments and ash.\n*   **Step 3: Synthesis.** A rock made of angular volcanic fragments (like lapilli and blocks) cemented within a matrix of finer volcanic ash is called a **volcanic breccia**. If it were composed primarily of consolidated ash, it would be called tuff. Given the prominent, larger angular clasts, volcanic breccia is a fitting identification.\n\n**Specimen K**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture.** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic.\n*   **Step 2: Observe Mineral Composition.** The visible crystals are large and varied in color. There are prominent light-colored, blocky crystals (likely feldspar), possibly some grayish, glassy crystals (quartz), and darker minerals. The very large size of the crystals (several millimeters to centimeters) is particularly noteworthy.\n*   **Step 3: Synthesis.** A phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture indicates the rock cooled slowly, deep underground (intrusive). The light-colored mineralogy suggests a felsic composition, similar to granite. However, the exceptionally large crystal size is characteristic of a **pegmatite**, which is a very coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock.\n\n**Final Identification Summary:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
