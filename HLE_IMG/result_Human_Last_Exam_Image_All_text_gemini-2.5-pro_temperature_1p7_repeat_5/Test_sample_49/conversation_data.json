    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This node is connected to a capacitor $C$ to ground. This forms an RC filter. The cutoff frequency of such a filter is determined by the capacitance $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the circuit driving the capacitor. Our goal is to find this $R_{th}$.\n\n**2. Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find the Thevenin resistance at node $a_0$, we follow these standard steps:\n*   Remove the load component, which is the capacitor $C$.\n*   Deactivate all independent sources. The input source `IN` is a voltage source connected to node $c_0$. Deactivating it means we set its voltage to zero, which is equivalent to grounding node $c_0$.\n*   Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\nAfter grounding $c_0$ and removing $C$, we are left with an infinite resistive ladder network. To find the resistance at $a_0$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of this network looking from $a_0$ to ground.\n\n*   **Characteristic Impedance of the Ladder:** The key to solving infinite ladder problems is to find its characteristic impedance. Let's denote the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder looking into the terminals $(c_k, d_k)$ as $R_\\infty$. Due to the repetitive structure of the ladder, this resistance is the same for any stage $k$ (i.e., $R_k = R_{k+1} = \\dots = R_\\infty$).\n\n*   **Deriving the Equation for $R_\\infty$:** Let's look at the impedance $R_k$ at terminals $(c_k, d_k)$. The circuit consists of:\n    1.  The \"rung\" resistor $r$ connected directly between $c_k$ and $d_k$.\n    2.  The rest of the ladder, which starts with the two \"side-rail\" resistors (one from $c_k$ to $c_{k+1}$ and one from $d_k$ to $d_{k+1}$), connected in series with the remainder of the ladder seen from $(c_{k+1}, d_{k+1})$. The impedance of the remainder is $R_{k+1}$.\n    \n    So, the impedance seen from $(c_k, d_k)$ is the rung resistor $r$ in parallel with the impedance of the path going upwards. The upward path impedance is the sum of the two rail resistors ($r+r=2r$) and the impedance of the next stage ($R_{k+1}$).\n    This gives us the recurrence relation:\n    $R_k = r \\parallel (2r + R_{k+1})$\n    \n    Since for an infinite ladder $R_k = R_{k+1} = R_\\infty$, we can write:\n    $R_\\infty = \\frac{r \\cdot (2r + R_\\infty)}{r + (2r + R_\\infty)} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_\\infty}{3r + R_\\infty}$\n\n*   **Solving for $R_\\infty$:** We now solve this equation for $R_\\infty$.\n    $R_\\infty (3r + R_\\infty) = 2r^2 + r R_\\infty$\n    $3rR_\\infty + R_\\infty^2 = 2r^2 + rR_\\infty$\n    $R_\\infty^2 + 2rR_\\infty - 2r^2 = 0$\n    \n    This is a quadratic equation for $R_\\infty$. Using the quadratic formula:\n    $R_\\infty = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n    Since resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n    $R_\\infty = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**4. Calculating $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$**\nNow we can simplify the circuit to calculate $R_{th}$. The entire infinite ladder starting from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ can be replaced by its equivalent resistance, $R_\\infty$, connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ at $a_0$ simplifies to:\n*   A resistor $r$ connects $a_0$ to $d_1$.\n*   A resistor $R_\\infty = r(\\sqrt{3}-1)$ connects $d_1$ to $c_1$.\n*   A resistor $r$ connects $c_1$ to $c_0$ (which is ground).\n\nWe need the resistance from $a_0$ to ground. In this simplified circuit, there is a single path from $a_0$ to ground, going through these three resistors in series.\nTherefore, the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ is the sum of these resistances:\n$R_{th} = r + R_\\infty + r = 2r + R_\\infty$\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n$R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**5. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe circuit at node $a_0$ acts as a simple RC low-pass filter, consisting of the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ and the capacitance $C$.\nThe voltage at node $a_0$ is given by $V_{a_0}(j\\omega) = V_{th}(j\\omega) \\frac{1/(j\\omega C)}{R_{th} + 1/(j\\omega C)}$.\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is the frequency at which the impedance of the capacitor equals the resistance, i.e., $|\\frac{1}{j\\omega_c C}| = R_{th}$.\nThis gives the well-known formula for an RC circuit's cutoff frequency:\n$\\omega_c R_{th} C = 1$\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nSubstituting our calculated value for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz would be $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. The expression for the angular frequency is typically sufficient unless specified otherwise.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation Summary:\n*   Thevenin resistance at $a_0$: $R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$.\n*   Cutoff angular frequency: $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} C)$.\n*   Final expression: $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$.\n\n<<<$1/(r(1+\\sqrt{3})C)$>>>"
