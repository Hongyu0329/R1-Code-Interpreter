    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual content of the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a prominent windmill as its central subject. The style of the windmill appears to be a Dutch or Northern European type (a smock mill or tower mill). The setting is outdoors, under a dramatic and stormy sky with dark, turbulent clouds contrasted against a patch of blue. In the background to the right, smoke and bright orange flames are visible, suggesting a building on fire. The overall atmosphere is tense and dramatic.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the artistic style and period.**\nThe painterly brushwork, the dramatic use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), and the focus on the power of nature (the storm) and dramatic events (the fire) are all characteristic of the Romanticism art movement, which flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The question confirms the painting is from the 19th century, which aligns perfectly with this style. While the subject matter is reminiscent of 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting (e.g., works by Rembrandt or Jacob van Ruisdael), the heightened drama is a hallmark of the 19th-century Romantic interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a search query and identify the artwork.**\nBased on the analysis, a targeted search can be performed. Using keywords like \"19th century romantic painting windmill storm fire\" or conducting a reverse image search with the provided fragment points towards a specific artwork. The search identifies the artist as Maxim Vorobiev (Максим Никифорович Воробьёв), a Russian Romantic landscape painter who lived from 1787 to 1855.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the painting and its title.**\nThe painting is confirmed to be by Maxim Vorobiev, created in 1842. The provided image is a well-known fragment of this work. The full painting includes a large oak tree on the left that has been shattered by a lightning strike, which is a crucial element that gives the painting its name. The title in Russian is \"Дуб, раздробленный молнией (Мельница в Охте)\".\n\n**Step 5: Determine the English title.**\nTranslated into English, the most common and accepted title for this masterpiece of Russian Romanticism is **\"Oak Fractured by a Lightning Stroke\"**. It is also sometimes referred to by its subtitle or a description of the scene, such as \"A Mill in Okhta\".\n\n<<<Oak Fractured by a Lightning Stroke>>>"
