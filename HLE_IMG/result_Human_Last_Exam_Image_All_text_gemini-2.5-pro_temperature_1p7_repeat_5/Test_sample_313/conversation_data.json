    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard (on the right) receiving a trophy from an older man (on the left) at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major events on or around June 20, 2019, reveals the NHL Awards ceremony was held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The proximity of the date makes this a very strong candidate.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had an exceptionally successful night, winning three major individual trophies: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   Winning three significant awards or scoring three goals in hockey is known as a \"hat-trick\". Kucherov's achievement was a \"hat-trick\" of awards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a homonym or a phrase with a double meaning. We need to find a term related to the first clue that also has a connection to mercury salt toxicity.\n*   A well-known historical use of mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) was in the process of felt-making for hats. This process, known as \"carroting,\" exposed hat makers to mercury, often causing neurological damage, including tremors, confusion, and erethism.\n*   This poisoning gave rise to the English idiom \"mad as a hatter,\" referring to the perceived madness of these workers.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   From Step 1, we have Nikita Kucherov performing a \"hat-trick.\"\n*   From Step 2, we have the concept of the \"mad hatter\" originating from mercury poisoning in the hat industry.\n*   The term that connects these two is \"Mad Hatter.\"\n    *   **Clue 1 fulfilled:** Nikita Kucherov can be described as a metaphorical \"Mad Hatter.\" The \"Hatter\" part comes from his awards \"hat-trick.\" The \"Mad\" part refers to the incredible or \"insane\" nature of this achievement.\n    *   **Clue 2 fulfilled:** \"Another Mad Hatter\" refers to the historical figure of the hat maker who went \"mad\" from mercury poisoning. The use of mercury in hat-making (\"hatting\") has indeed ceased due to its toxicity.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Identification:** The primary challenge is correctly identifying the person and event in the image.\n*   **Metaphorical Language:** The question uses a riddle-like format, requiring the interpretation of Kucherov's \"hat-trick\" of awards as an act that would earn him the moniker \"Mad Hatter.\"\n*   **Historical Knowledge:** The solver needs to know or be able to find the historical link between the phrase \"mad as a hatter\" and mercury poisoning in the hat-making industry.\n*   **Date Precision:** The event was on June 19, but the clue says June 20. This minor difference is common in reporting and does not invalidate the connection.\n*   **Phrase Structure:** \"X Y\" implies a two-word answer, which \"Mad Hatter\" fits perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of the visual of Nikita Kucherov's award \"hat-trick\" with the historical context of mercury use in the hat-making industry, the answer \"Mad Hatter\" satisfies all parts of the puzzle.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter"
