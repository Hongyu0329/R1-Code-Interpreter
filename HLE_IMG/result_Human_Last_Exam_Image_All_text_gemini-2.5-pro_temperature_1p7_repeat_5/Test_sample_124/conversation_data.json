    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing from the voltage source.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all components and their values.**\n*   Voltage Source V2 = 1 V\n*   Resistor R1 = 3 Ω\n*   Resistor R2 = 7 Ω\n*   Resistor R3 = 9 Ω\n*   Resistor R7 = 100 Ω\n*   Resistor R8 = 100 Ω\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the circuit connections by labeling the nodes.**\nTo understand the circuit's structure, we'll label the key nodes (junction points).\n*   Let **Node A** be the positive terminal of the voltage source V2.\n*   Let **Node G** be the negative terminal (ground).\n*   Let **Node B** be the junction between R1 and R2.\n*   Let **Node C** be the junction between R2 and R3.\n*   Let **Node D** be the junction between R7 and R8.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the circuit based on ideal wire connections.**\nIdeal wires have zero resistance, meaning all points connected by a wire are at the same electric potential.\n*   There is a wire connecting Node A to Node C. Therefore, V_A = V_C.\n*   There is a wire connecting Node B to Node D. Therefore, V_B = V_D.\n\n**Step 4: Redraw the circuit in a simpler, more intuitive form based on the node equalities.**\nLet's trace the path of each component based on this simplified node understanding. The voltage source V2 is connected between Node A (potential = 1V) and Node G (potential = 0V). We need to find the equivalent resistance between these two nodes.\n\n*   **Resistor R3:** It is connected between Node C and Node G. Since V_A = V_C, R3 is effectively connected between Node A and Node G. This forms our first parallel branch.\n    *   Branch 1: R3\n\n*   **Other Resistors:** Let's analyze the connections for R1, R2, R7, and R8.\n    *   **R1** is connected between Node A and Node B.\n    *   **R2** is connected between Node B and Node C. Since V_A = V_C, R2 is effectively connected between Node B and Node A.\n    *   **R8** is connected between Node A and Node D. Since V_B = V_D, R8 is effectively connected between Node A and Node B.\n    *   This means **R1, R2, and R8 are all in parallel** with each other, connected between Node A and the common node B/D.\n    *   **R7** is connected between Node D and Node G. Since V_B = V_D, R7 is connected between Node B and Node G.\n    *   The parallel combination of (R1 || R2 || R8) is connected to Node B/D, and R7 is also connected to Node B/D and then to ground. This means the parallel group (R1 || R2 || R8) is in **series** with R7.\n    *   This entire series combination forms a second branch connected between Node A and Node G.\n    *   Branch 2: (R1 || R2 || R8) + R7\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the circuit (Req).**\nThe total equivalent resistance is the parallel combination of Branch 1 and Branch 2.\nReq = R3 || [ (R1 || R2 || R8) + R7 ]\n\n1.  **Calculate the resistance of the parallel group (R1 || R2 || R8):**\n    1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8 = 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/100\n    To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 2100.\n    1/R_parallel = (700/2100) + (300/2100) + (21/2100) = 1021/2100 Ω⁻¹\n    R_parallel = 2100/1021 Ω ≈ 2.057 Ω\n\n2.  **Calculate the resistance of Branch 2:**\n    R_Branch2 = R_parallel + R7 = (2100/1021) + 100\n    R_Branch2 = (2100/1021) + (102100/1021) = 104200/1021 Ω ≈ 102.057 Ω\n\n3.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req):**\n    Req is the parallel combination of R3 (Branch 1) and R_Branch2.\n    1/Req = 1/R3 + 1/R_Branch2 = 1/9 + 1/(104200/1021)\n    1/Req = 1/9 + 1021/104200\n    To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9 * 104200 = 937800.\n    1/Req = (104200/937800) + (9 * 1021 / 937800)\n    1/Req = (104200 + 9189) / 937800 = 113389 / 937800 Ω⁻¹\n    Req = 937800 / 113389 Ω ≈ 8.271 Ω\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total current (I_total) using Ohm's Law.**\nI_total = V2 / Req\nI_total = 1 V / (937800 / 113389 Ω)\nI_total = 113389 / 937800 A\n\nI_total ≈ 0.120916 A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\n<<<0.121>>>"
