    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image is a raster plot showing neuronal firing activity.\n    *   The **x-axis** represents **Time in seconds (s)**, ranging from 0 to 50 seconds.\n    *   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, from 0 to 128.\n    *   Each black dot indicates a spike (firing) from a single neuron/electrode at a specific time.\n    *   **Synchronized bursts** are periods of high, coordinated firing across many electrodes. Visually, they appear as dense vertical bands.\n\n2.  **Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts:** We need to carefully identify the time at which each major synchronized burst begins. By visually inspecting the graph for the start of the dense, vertical patterns of dots, we can estimate the following start times for the bursts:\n    *   **Burst 1:** Starts at approximately **2 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** Starts at approximately **14 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** Starts at approximately **26 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** Starts at approximately **36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** Starts at approximately **48 s**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the duration between the start of one burst and the start of the next consecutive burst. Using the timestamps identified in the previous step, we can calculate the four intervals:\n    *   **Interval 1:** Between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 14 s - 2 s = **12 s**.\n    *   **Interval 2:** Between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 26 s - 14 s = **12 s**.\n    *   **Interval 3:** Between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 36 s - 26 s = **10 s**.\n    *   **Interval 4:** Between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n    *   Sum of intervals = 12 s + 12 s + 10 s + 12 s = 46 s.\n    *   Number of intervals = 4.\n    *   Average IBI = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**.\n\n5.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n    *   Our calculated average is 11.5 s, which has three significant figures (1, 1, and 5).\n    *   To round to two significant figures, we look at the third digit (5). Since it is 5 or greater, we round up the preceding digit.\n    *   Rounding 11.5 up to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Accurately identifying the start time of each distinct synchronized burst is crucial. Defining the timestamp consistently (e.g., always using the start of the burst) ensures reliable interval calculations.\n*   It's important to count the number of intervals, not the number of bursts, for the average calculation. Five bursts yield four intervals.\n*   The final calculation must adhere to the specified number of significant figures. In this case, rounding 11.5 to two significant figures results in 12.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe identified bursts occur at approximately 2s, 14s, 26s, 36s, and 48s. The inter-burst intervals are 12s, 12s, 10s, and 12s. The average inter-burst interval is (12+12+10+12)/4 = 11.5 s. Rounding to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
