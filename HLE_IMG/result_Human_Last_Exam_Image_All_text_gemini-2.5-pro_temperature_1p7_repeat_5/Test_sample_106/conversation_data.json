    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The goal is to determine the final substituents (H or CH3) at five specific positions (labeled 1 through 5) after the rearrangement. This type of reaction is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a \"backbone rearrangement,\" which is common in steroid and triterpenoid chemistry. The driving force is the formation of a thermodynamically stable product, in this case, a tetrasubstituted alkene, by relieving steric strain through a cascade of carbocation rearrangements.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) by the acid catalyst (HCl). This converts the -OH into a good leaving group (-OH2+). Subsequent loss of a water molecule (H2O) generates a secondary carbocation at C-3 of the steroid-like skeleton.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial carbocation at C-3 is not particularly stable and is far from the final site of unsaturation. To reach the final product, the positive charge must migrate through the carbon skeleton via a series of [1,2]-hydride (H:-) and [1,2]-methide (CH3:-) shifts. The question implies such a cascade occurs. The final product has a double bond between C-13 and C-18 (using standard triterpene numbering). This structure is known as olean-13(18)-ene or Î´-amyrin. The formation of this double bond is most readily explained by the elimination of a proton from C-18 from a carbocation at C-13, or elimination of a proton from C-13 from a carbocation at C-18. A cation at the tertiary C-13 is a plausible intermediate.\n\n3.  **The Backbone Rearrangement:** The migration of the positive charge from C-3 to C-13 requires a complex cascade. The textbook mechanism for the backbone rearrangement that connects these parts of the molecule involves a series of concerted or stepwise [1,2] shifts of methyl groups and hydrogen atoms that effectively move in the opposite direction to the positive charge. While the initiation from the C-3 cation is mechanistically complex, the core sequence of migrations along the B/C/D ring backbone is well-established. This cascade is:\n\n    *   A cation is formed in the B/C ring area (let's assume at C-10, subsequent to shifts starting from C-3 and propagating through C-5).\n    *   **Shift 1:** The hydrogen atom at C-9 shifts to C-10. This moves the positive charge to C-9.\n    *   **Shift 2:** The methyl group at C-8 shifts to C-9. This moves the positive charge to C-8.\n    *   **Shift 3:** The methyl group at C-14 shifts to C-8. This moves the positive charge to C-14.\n    *   **Shift 4:** The hydrogen atom at C-13 shifts to C-14. This moves the positive charge to the tertiary position C-13.\n\n4.  **Final Elimination Step:** The carbocation at C-13 then undergoes an elimination reaction. A proton is removed from the adjacent C-18 by a base (like H2O or Cl-), forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18.\n\n5.  **Determining the Final Substituents:** We now trace the consequences of these shifts to determine the final substituent at each numbered position.\n    *   **Initial state (Reactant):**\n        *   Position 1 (at C-4): two CH3 groups\n        *   Position 2 (at C-10): one CH3 group\n        *   Position 3 (at C-9): one H atom\n        *   Position 4 (at C-8): one CH3 group\n        *   Position 5 (at C-14): one CH3 group\n\n    *   **Final state (Product):**\n        *   **Position 1 (C-4):** This rearrangement cascade does not involve the gem-dimethyl group at C-4. Therefore, position 1 retains its two methyl groups. Since the required format is a single group, we identify the substituent type, which is CH3. So, **1 = CH3**.\n        *   **Position 2 (C-10):** The original CH3 group has migrated away. C-10 received an H atom from C-9. So, the substituent at position 2 is now **H**.\n        *   **Position 3 (C-9):** The original H atom has migrated away. C-9 received a CH3 group from C-8. So, the substituent at position 3 is now **CH3**.\n        *   **Position 4 (C-8):** The original CH3 group has migrated away. C-8 received a CH3 group from C-14. So, the substituent at position 4 is now **CH3**.\n        *   **Position 5 (C-14):** The original CH3 group has migrated away. C-14 received an H atom from C-13. So, the substituent at position 5 is now **H**.\n\nCombining these findings, we get the final answer.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
