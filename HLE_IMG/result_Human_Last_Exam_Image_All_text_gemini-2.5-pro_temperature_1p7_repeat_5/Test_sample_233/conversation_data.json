    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Characteristics:** The image shows a fragment of a runestone with runes carved in a very structured style. The inscription is organized into horizontal bands, separated by ruled lines. Within the bands, vertical lines separate individual runes or small groups of runes. This neat, almost 'typeset' style is distinctive. The surface of the stone is grainy granite.\n\n2.  **Transcribe the Runes:** To identify the specific stone, we need to transcribe some of the runes. The script is the Younger Futhark. Let's focus on the clearest rows:\n    *   **Second row from the top:** Reading from left to right, after the 'x' separator, the runes are ᛋ (s), ᛏ (t), ᛁ (i), and ᚾ (n). The 't' rune has a high cross-stroke, which is a notable stylistic feature. Together, these runes spell the word **stin**, which is the Old Norse word for \"stone\" (*steinn*).\n    *   **Third row from the top:** After the 'x' separator, the runes are ᛁ (i, used for 'e'), ᚠ (f), ᛏ (t), ᛁ (i), and ᛦ (ʀ). These spell out **eftiʀ**, the Old Norse word for \"in memory of\" or \"after\" (*eptir*).\n\n3.  **Identify the Inscription Formula:** The sequence \"**stin ... eftiʀ**\" (\"stone ... in memory of\") is a very common part of runestone inscriptions, forming the core of the memorial message.\n\n4.  **Identify the Stone:** We are looking for a runestone with the inscription `...stin...eftiʀ...` and the specific visual style of neat bands. A search for runestones matching these criteria points to the **Ledberg stone** in Östergötland, Sweden. Its inscription contains the exact phrase `... stin ... eftiʀ ...` (`bisi · sati · stin · þasi · eftiʀ · þurkut ...` which means \"Bisi placed this stone in memory of Thorgaut...\"). The visual style of the Ledberg stone perfectly matches the image.\n\n5.  **Determine the ID:** Every classified Swedish runestone has a unique identifier based on its province. Östergötland is abbreviated as \"Ög\". The Ledberg stone is the 181st stone cataloged in Östergötland. Therefore, its official ID is **Ög 181**.\n\n6.  **Address the \"Ingvar Runestone\" Part of the Question:** The question asks for the ID of the *Ingvar runestone* depicted. The Ingvar runestones are a specific group of about 30 stones that explicitly mention Ingvar the Far-Travelled or commemorate men who died on his ill-fated expedition to Serkland (the Caspian Sea region). The inscription on Ög 181 does not mention Ingvar. However, due to its imagery (a ship and mythological scenes), its date (c. 11th century), and its general theme of a journey, some scholars have debated its connection to the Ingvar expedition, classifying it as a possibly related monument. Despite this academic debate, it is not a core, undisputed Ingvar runestone. The stone depicted is unequivocally the Ledberg stone, Ög 181.\n\nTherefore, the ID of the stone in the image is Ög 181.\n\n<<<Ög 181>>>"
