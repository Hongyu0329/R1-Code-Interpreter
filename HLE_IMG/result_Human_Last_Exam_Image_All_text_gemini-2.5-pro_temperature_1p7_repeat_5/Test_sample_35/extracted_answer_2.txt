The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE).

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. The provided diagram shows that S100B binding to RAGE activates signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that directly lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since the level of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these pathological outcomes which determine the disease course, it can be used to predict the progression and future severity of the disorder. A higher concentration of S100B would indicate a more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis for the patient.
