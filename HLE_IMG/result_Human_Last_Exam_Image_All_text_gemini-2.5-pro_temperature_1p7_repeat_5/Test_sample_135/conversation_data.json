    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's subject and composition:** The image displays a bas-relief (low-relief sculpture) set within a decorative circular frame, known as a tondo. The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to several kneeling figures. The setting appears to be an altar. This identifies the subject as a Catholic sacrament.\n\n2.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a small banner (cartouche) with text. Looking closely at the original image and the crops, the inscription reads \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\". This can be interpreted as an archaic Italian or Latin/Italian mix for \"Sacramento dell'Altare,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Analyze the artistic style:** The style of the sculpture is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically from 15th-century Florence. The figures are rendered with grace, naturalism, and idealized beauty. The composition is balanced and clear. This particular type of refined, often white or colored glazed terracotta relief, is the hallmark of a famous Florentine family workshop.\n\n4.  **Connect style and subject to a specific artist:** The combination of the glazed terracotta medium, the Renaissance style, the tondo format, and the religious subject matter strongly points to the workshop of the **Della Robbia family**.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific artwork and artist:** A search combining the inscription \"Sacramenti de Lautel\" and the artist \"Della Robbia\" leads to a specific artwork. This tondo is a well-known detail from the **Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments**. This altarpiece is located in the church of San Martino a Mensola, in Fiesole (near Florence), and is attributed to **Luca della Robbia**, the founder of the workshop. The work is dated circa 1464-1466. The detail shown in the image represents the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The Inscription:** The text \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\" is a crucial and unique identifier that directly helps in searching for the artwork.\n*   **The Style:** Recognizing the distinctive Della Robbia style (especially the high quality of the relief sculpture, which was often executed in glazed terracotta) is key to identifying the artist's workshop.\n*   **The Context:** This is not a standalone piece but a detail of a larger altarpiece. Understanding this helps to place the work correctly in art history.\n*   **The Artist vs. Workshop:** While the Della Robbia family operated a large workshop, this major commission is generally attributed to the master himself, Luca della Robbia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the author of this detail of the Altarpiece is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
