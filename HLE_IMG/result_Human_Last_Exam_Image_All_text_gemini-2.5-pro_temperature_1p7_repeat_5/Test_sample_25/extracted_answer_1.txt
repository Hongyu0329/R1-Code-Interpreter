The result is indeterminate and should be retested. Although the Ct value (30.8) is below the cut-off (40), the amplification curve shows a very shallow, non-exponential slope and fails to reach a clear plateau. This indicates that the amplification was either extremely inefficient or non-specific (artifactual), making the result unreliable.
