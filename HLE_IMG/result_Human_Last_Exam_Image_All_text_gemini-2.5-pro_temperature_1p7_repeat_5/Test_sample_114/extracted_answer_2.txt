The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises from the rigid, bicyclic structure of the Münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. The two positions that could potentially be scrambled, the C2 position (bearing a methyl group) and the C4 position (a bridgehead carbon of the fused ring), are sterically and electronically distinct. This makes the equilibration process that would scramble them energetically prohibitive.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial to this rationale because they demonstrate that for the analogous acyclic system (from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine), such an equilibration process does occur. In Reaction 2, the C2 and C4 substituents of the Münchnone are both methyl groups. The ¹³C labeling experiment shows these two identical groups are scrambled in a 1:1 ratio, indicating a facile and degenerate equilibration is taking place. This confirms that the lack of flexibility in the cyclic proline system is the key factor that shuts down this scrambling pathway, thus enforcing high regioselectivity in Reaction 3.
