    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical structure and its chiral centers.**\n\nFirst, we need to correctly interpret the given chemical drawing. It's a line-angle formula with stereochemistry indicated by wedges (solid) and dashes (dotted). The zig-zag line represents a carbon backbone. Let's analyze the connectivity:\n\n1.  On the left, there is a carbon atom (let's call it C2) bonded to an -OH group (on a dashed bond), a -CH3 group (at the end of the line), and the rest of the chain.\n2.  The next carbon in the chain (C3) is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3, on a wedged bond).\n3.  The next carbon in the chain (C4) is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3, on a dashed bond) and an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2, on a wedged bond).\n\nAssuming the unlabeled vertices on the chain are carbons and that valencies are filled by hydrogen atoms, we can deduce the full structure. The longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (-OH) must be identified for IUPAC naming and numbering.\n\n*   Let's trace the longest chain containing the C-OH bond.\n    *   From the ethyl group: CH3-CH2-C3-C2-CH3. This is a 5-carbon chain (a pentane).\n*   Let's number this chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number. Numbering from the left methyl group gives the -OH group position 2.\n    *   C1: The methyl group on the far left.\n    *   C2: The carbon with the -OH group.\n    *   C3: The carbon with the ethyl group and another substituent.\n    *   The other substituent at C3 is -CH(CH3)(CH2NH2).\n*   This interpretation does not match the drawing, which shows three consecutive chiral centers on a chain.\n\nLet's try another interpretation, where the zig-zag backbone in the drawing connects the three chiral centers shown.\n*   C(left) is bonded to OH and CH3. This should be read as a -CH(OH)CH3 group, where the chiral carbon is the CH. Let's call this C2.\n*   C(middle) is bonded to an ethyl group. Let's call this C3.\n*   C(right) is bonded to a methyl group and a -CH2NH2 group. This has to be a -CH(CH3)(CH2NH2) group. Let's call this carbon C4.\nThis gives a chain C1(from CH3)-C2(OH)-C3(Et)-C4(Me)-C5(CH2NH2). The molecule is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. This structure has three chiral centers at C2, C3, and C4, which matches the drawing.\n\nThe absolute configuration of each chiral center (C2, C3, and C4) needs to be determined using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of C2.**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -OH, -CH3 (C1), -H, and the -C3H(Et)C4H(Me)(CH2NH2) group (let's call it the C3-group).\n*   **Assign priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (highest atomic number O=8)\n    2.  -C3 group (Carbon bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen)\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon bonded to three hydrogens)\n    4.  -H (lowest atomic number H=1)\n*   **Analyze stereochemistry:** The drawing shows the C1-C2-C3 bonds in the plane of the paper. The -OH group is on a dashed bond (pointing away/back). Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a wedged bond (pointing out/front).\n*   **Determine R/S:** With the lowest priority group (-H, #4) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path from priority #1 to #2 to #3.\n    *   1(-OH) → 2(-C3 group) → 3(-CH3)\n    *   This path is counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we must reverse the result.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of C3.**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -C2H(OH)CH3 group (C2-group), -C4H(Me)CH2NH2 group (C4-group), -CH2CH3 (ethyl group), and -H.\n*   **Assign priorities:** All are bonded via carbon. We look at the next atoms.\n    *   C2 is bonded to (O, C, H).\n    *   C4 is bonded to (C, C, N) - wait, C4 is attached to C, C, H. We look at atoms attached *to* the first C: C2 is (O,C,H), C4 is (C,C,H), C(ethyl) is (C,H,H).\n    *   Comparing the lists of attached atoms by atomic number:\n        1.  -C2 group (O > C)\n        2.  -C4 group (has a second C, while ethyl has H)\n        3.  -Ethyl group\n        4.  -H\n*   **Analyze stereochemistry:** The ethyl group is on a wedged bond (front). Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a dashed bond (back).\n*   **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is pointing away. We trace the path from #1 to #2 to #3.\n    *   1(-C2 group) → 2(-C4 group) → 3(-Ethyl group)\n    *   This path is clockwise (R).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, the configuration is as seen.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of C4.**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -CH2NH2, -C3H(Et)C2... group (C3-group), -CH3, and -H.\n*   **Assign priorities:** All are bonded via carbon except for H.\n    *   Comparing the carbon groups: The C in -CH2NH2 is bonded to (N, H, H). The C in the C3-group is bonded to (C, C, H). The C in -CH3 is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    *   Comparing the highest atomic number atoms attached: N (in -CH2NH2) vs C (in C3-group). N (Z=7) > C (Z=6).\n    *   The priority order is:\n        1.  -CH2NH2\n        2.  -C3 group\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n*   **Analyze stereochemistry:** The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedged bond (front). The -CH3 group is on a dashed bond (back). This implies that the C3-C4 bond and the C4-H bond are in the plane of the paper.\n*   **Determine R/S:** We can use the swapping rule. Swap the lowest priority group (-H, #4) with the group that is pointing back (-CH3, #3). This is one swap, so the final result for the original molecule will be the opposite of what we find for the swapped molecule.\n    *   In the swapped molecule: -H is on a dashed bond (back), and -CH3 is in the plane.\n    *   Now, with -H(#4) in the back, we look at the other three groups: -CH2NH2 (#1, wedged/front), -C3 group (#2, in plane), -CH3 (#3, in plane).\n    *   Let's project this onto a 2D plane. With H in the back, CH2NH2(#1) is pointing up (or out). The C3 group(#2) is to the left-down. The CH3 group(#3) is to the right-down.\n    *   The path 1 → 2 → 3 is clockwise.\n    *   So, the swapped molecule has an **R** configuration.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original molecule's configuration is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **S**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers are:\n*   C2: **R**\n*   C3: **R**\n*   C4: **S**\n\nSo, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<2R, 3R, 4S>>>"
