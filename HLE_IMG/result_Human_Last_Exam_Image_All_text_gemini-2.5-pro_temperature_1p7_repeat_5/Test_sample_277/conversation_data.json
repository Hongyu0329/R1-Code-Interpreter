    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided materials.**\nThe request contains a multiple-choice question and an image. The question asks to determine the isomeric relationship between \"the molecules mentioned above\". The image provided is a completely black rectangle, which means there are no molecules shown or \"mentioned above\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definitions of the options.**\nTo answer the question, we must first understand the meaning of each term provided in the options.\n*   **Isomers:** Molecules that have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (or conformers):** These are stereoisomers that can be interconverted simply by rotating around single bonds. They are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers (or structural isomers):** These isomers have the same molecular formula but a different constitution (i.e., a different order of atom connectivity).\n*   **(c) Identical:** This means the structures shown are just different orientations of the exact same molecule and are superimposable on each other.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These isomers have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but the atoms have a different arrangement in three-dimensional space. This is a general category that includes conformational isomers, enantiomers, and diastereomers.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the possibility of determining the relationship.**\nTo determine the relationship between two molecules (e.g., constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, or identical), we must be able to see their structures. We need to:\n1.  Compare their molecular formulas.\n2.  Compare the connectivity of their atoms.\n3.  Compare their three-dimensional arrangement.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the available information.**\nSince the image is blank, there are no molecular structures provided for comparison. We cannot perform any of the necessary steps to classify the relationship. The premise of the question, which is that there are molecules to analyze, is not met.\n\n**Step 5: Select the most logical answer.**\nBecause none of the classifications (conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, stereoisomers) can be applied without the actual structures of the molecules, none of the options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be confirmed as correct. The situation does not fit any of these descriptions because the objects of comparison do not exist in the provided context. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the correct option is (e) \"None of these\".\n\n<<<e>>>"
