    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nThe first step is to establish the key of the piece. The first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 \"Pathétique\" is in **C minor**. The key signature shown on the staff has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to either C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The overall tonality of this section (the *Allegro*) is firmly in C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Analyze Measure 30**\nLooking at the provided sheet music, we can locate measure 30. It is the second measure of the second system, immediately following the circle that highlights measures 29 and 30.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\nWe need to identify all the notes played in measure 30 by both hands to determine the harmony.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays an octave on the note **E** throughout the measure.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays a series of sixteenth notes that arpeggiate a chord. The notes, in order of appearance, are G♯, B, E, G♯, B, D, G♯, B. The distinct pitches present are **E, G♯, B, and D**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Chord**\nCombining the notes from both hands, we have the pitches **E - G♯ - B - D**.\n*   **Root:** E\n*   **Third:** G♯ (a major third above E)\n*   **Fifth:** B (a perfect fifth above E)\n*   **Seventh:** D (a minor seventh above E)\nThese notes form an **E dominant seventh chord (E7)**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Chord's Function in the Key of C minor**\nNow we must determine the function of this E7 chord within the context of C minor. Roman numeral analysis describes a chord's function relative to the tonic.\n*   The chord E7 is not a diatonic chord in C minor (the diatonic V chord is G7, the diatonic III chord is E♭ major, etc.).\n*   We should look at the chord that follows in measure 31 to understand its function. In measure 31, the chord is an **A minor triad** (A in the bass, with A, C, and E in the right hand).\n*   The chord E7 has a strong pull towards A minor. E is the dominant of A. Therefore, the E7 chord is functioning as the **dominant of A minor**.\n*   This type of chord is called a **secondary dominant** or an **applied dominant**. It temporarily treats a chord other than the tonic as a temporary tonic.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the Roman Numeral**\n*   The chord being tonicized in measure 31 is A minor. We first need the Roman numeral for the A minor chord in the key of C minor. The sixth scale degree in C minor is A♭, and the diatonic chord is A♭ major (VI). However, composers frequently borrow chords. A minor is the submediant chord (vi) from the parallel major key, C major, and is often used in C minor. Functionally, it is the **submediant (vi)**.\n*   The chord in measure 30 is the dominant seventh (V7) of this submediant (vi).\n*   The notation for a secondary dominant is V/[Roman numeral of the tonicized chord].\n*   Therefore, the Roman numeral for the E7 chord in measure 30, which is the V7 of vi, is written as **V7/vi**.\n\n<<<V7/vi>>>"
