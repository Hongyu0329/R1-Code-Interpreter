    "An step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the product is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\n1.  **Identify the structural components:** The starting molecule is a complex bicyclic lactam. We can break it down into three main parts:\n    *   **The PMB group:** This is a *p*-methoxybenzyl group, attached to the nitrogen atom. Its structure is -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃.\n        *   Carbons (C): 1 (from CH₂) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from OCH₃) = 8\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 2 (from CH₂) + 4 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from OCH₃) = 9\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from OCH₃)\n        *   Molecular formula of the PMB group is C₈H₉O.\n    *   **The CF₃ group:** A trifluoromethyl group.\n        *   Carbons (C): 1\n        *   Fluorines (F): 3\n    *   **The bicyclic core:** This is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenone framework. Let's count the atoms in the core structure without the substituents:\n        *   It has 6 carbons in the bicyclic framework and 1 nitrogen. The carbons are at positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n        *   C1 (bridgehead): has 1 H.\n        *   C4 (bridgehead): has 1 H.\n        *   C7 (bridge): is a CH₂ group, so 2 H.\n        *   The C₅=C₆ double bond: C₆ has 1 H. C₅ has the CF₃ group attached, so it has 0 H.\n        *   The N₂-C₃(=O) part: N₂ has the PMB group attached. C₃ is a carbonyl, with 0 H.\n        *   Core Carbons: 6 from the rings. Total C = 6 (ring) + 1 (CF₃) + 8 (PMB) = 15.\n        *   Core Hydrogens: 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C4) + 2 (at C7) + 1 (at C6) = 5. Total H = 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14.\n        *   Other atoms: 3 F (from CF₃), 1 N (from the ring), 1 O (from the carbonyl C=O), and 1 O (from the PMB group). Total O = 2.\n\n2.  **Combine the components to get the full molecular formula:**\n    *   C: 15\n    *   H: 14\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reagents are CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O. CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms.\n2.  **Determine the change in chemical composition:** The PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed from the nitrogen atom, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added in its place.\n    *   Atoms removed: C₈H₉O\n    *   Atoms added: H\n    *   Net change: -(C₈H₉O) + H = -C₈H₈O\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Start with C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n    *   Subtract C₈H₈O.\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reagents are Pd/C and H₂ in MeOH. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds.\n2.  **Determine the change in chemical composition:** The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring is reduced to a C-C single bond. This involves the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H₂) across the double bond.\n    *   Net change: +H₂\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with C₇H₆F₃NO (Intermediate 1).\n    *   Add H₂.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reagents are 4 N HCl at 70 °C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (in this case, a cyclic amide or lactam).\n2.  **Determine the change in chemical composition:** The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond (the N-C=O bond) by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). The lactam ring opens to form an amino acid.\n    *   Net change: +H₂O\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Start with C₇H₈F₃NO (Intermediate 2).\n    *   Add H₂O.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final Product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
