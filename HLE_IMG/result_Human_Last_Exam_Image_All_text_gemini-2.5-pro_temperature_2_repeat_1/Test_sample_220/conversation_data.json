    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure\nAn FCC crystal has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and in the center of each of the 6 faces. This is a common structure for many metals like aluminum, copper, gold, and silver.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]\nThe direction [110] in a cubic system corresponds to a vector pointing from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a,a,0), where 'a' is the lattice constant. This vector lies along the diagonal of the bottom face of the unit cube. To view the crystal \"along\" this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] direction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Theoretical 2D Projection Pattern\nWhen the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, a specific 2D pattern emerges. This pattern is well-known from crystallography and electron microscopy studies.\n\n*   The atoms are arranged in layers perpendicular to the [110] direction.\n*   The projection of these layers results in a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n*   This means the projected atoms form a repeating pattern of rectangles with an atom at each corner and one atom in the geometric center of the rectangle.\n*   The sides of this rectangle are along the [001] and [1-10] directions in the crystal, and their lengths are in the ratio of `a*sqrt(2)` to `a`, which is `sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414`.\n\nSo, the key feature we are looking for is a **centered rectangular pattern**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Given Patterns (A, B, C, D)\nWe need to examine each image to see if its projected pattern matches the theoretical centered rectangle. We are looking at the arrangement of the spheres as projected onto the front plane of the view (the X-Z plane in the given coordinate system).\n\n*   **Pattern A:** The projected atoms do not form a simple repeating rectangle. If we attempt to define a rectangle using the four outermost atoms, the two inner atoms are not located at the center of this rectangle. The pattern is more complex and does not fit the centered rectangular model.\n\n*   **Pattern B:** Let's look for a rectangular unit and a centering atom.\n    1.  Consider a rectangle formed by atoms at approximate (x, z) coordinates: (1, 2.5), (6, 2.5), (1, 5.5), and (6, 5.5). We can see atoms at or very close to all four of these corner positions.\n    2.  The geometric center of this rectangle would be at x = (1+6)/2 = 3.5 and z = (2.5+5.5)/2 = 4.\n    3.  Looking at the image, there is an atom projected precisely at (3.5, 4).\n    4.  This centered rectangular unit appears to repeat. For instance, the rectangle above it, with corners (1, 5.5), (6, 5.5), (1, 8.5), (6, 8.5), also has atoms at its corners and a centering atom nearby at (3.5, 6.5), which is very close to the ideal center of (3.5, 7).\n    *   This pattern clearly matches the topology of a **centered rectangular lattice**. The aspect ratio of the rectangle in the drawing is (6-1) / (5.5-2.5) = 5/3 ≈ 1.67. This is somewhat different from the theoretical sqrt(2)≈1.414, but this minor distortion is common in schematic diagrams. The topological arrangement is the key identifier.\n\n*   **Pattern C:** The projected atoms are arranged in a pattern that looks more hexagonal or honeycomb-like. It does not show a rectangular arrangement. This type of pattern is typical for a [111] projection of a cubic crystal, not [110].\n\n*   **Pattern D:** This pattern shows two interleaved rectangular grids. If you consider a rectangle formed by four atoms, there is no atom at its center. Instead, there are atoms in the middle of the vertical sides of an adjacent potential cell. This is not a centered rectangular lattice. (This pattern is more reminiscent of a projection of a body-centered orthorhombic structure).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, Pattern B is the only one that exhibits the characteristic **centered rectangular lattice** which is the known projection of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
