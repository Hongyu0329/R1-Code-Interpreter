    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the provided image:** The image is completely black. It does not contain any chemical structures, formulas, or names of molecules.\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to determine the type of isomeric relationship between \"the molecules mentioned above\". The phrase \"mentioned above\" refers to the content within the image.\n3.  **Identify the problem:** Since the image is empty, there are no molecules presented for comparison. To determine if two molecules are isomers (conformational, constitutional, stereoisomers) or identical, we need to see their structures.\n4.  **Evaluate the options based on the missing information:**\n    *   (a) **Conformers isomers:** We cannot determine this without seeing the molecular structures and if they can be interconverted by bond rotation.\n    *   (b) **Constitutional isomers:** We cannot determine this without knowing the molecular formulas and the connectivity of the atoms.\n    *   (c) **Identical:** We cannot determine if they are the same molecule without seeing them.\n    *   (d) **Stereoisomers:** We cannot determine this without knowing the connectivity and the spatial arrangement of atoms.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because no molecules are shown, it is impossible to perform any analysis or comparison. Therefore, none of the specific classifications (a, b, c, d) can be selected. The only appropriate answer is (e), which acknowledges that the conditions to answer the question are not met.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The most crucial step is to carefully observe the provided material, which in this case is a blank image.\n*   One must understand the definitions of different types of isomers to realize that comparing structures is necessary.\n*   The question is unanswerable due to the lack of information. \"None of these\" is the correct choice when the other options are definitively incorrect or cannot be verified. In this case, they cannot be verified.\n\n<<<E>>>"
