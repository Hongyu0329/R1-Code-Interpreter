    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the seal's characters:\n\n1.  **Seal Reading Direction:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left. So the reading order for these four characters is:\n    *   Top right character\n    *   Bottom right character\n    *   Top left character\n    *   Bottom left character\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in Seal Script):** The characters are carved in an ancient style called seal script (篆書, zhuànshū). We need to identify each character and then find its modern equivalent. Note that the characters on the seal are carved in mirror image so they appear correctly when stamped.\n\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This is the seal script for **長** (cháng). The form is quite recognizable, resembling a person with long hair.\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This is the seal script for **風** (fēng). It consists of an outer frame with the character '虫' (chóng) inside, which is the traditional form of the character.\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This is an ancient seal script form of **萬** (wàn). This archaic form depicts a scorpion, which was used for this character in early writing systems.\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This is the seal script for **里** (lǐ). It is composed of the radicals '田' (tián, field) on top and '土' (tǔ, earth) on the bottom, which is its standard composition.\n\n3.  **Putting it together:** Reading in the correct order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left), the characters are **長風萬里**.\n\n4.  **Converting to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   長 remains the same: **长**\n    *   風 is simplified to: **风**\n    *   萬 is simplified to: **万**\n    *   里 remains the same: **里**\n\n5.  **Final Phrase:** The full phrase in simplified Chinese is **长风万里** (cháng fēng wàn lǐ). This is a well-known poetic phrase that means \"a long wind that travels ten thousand li,\" symbolizing a long, unimpeded journey or having great ambition and a promising future.\n\n<<<长风万里>>>"
