    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Circuit Components:**\n    *   A voltage source V2 = 1 V.\n    *   Resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, R3 = 9 Ω, R7 = 100 Ω, and R8 = 100 Ω.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Connections:**\n    *   The goal is to find the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit to calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V / Req). We need to carefully examine the wiring.\n    *   Let's label the top wire (connected to the positive terminal of V2) as Node A and the bottom wire (connected to the negative terminal and ground) as Node B. The voltage at Node A is 1 V, and the voltage at Node B is 0 V.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Left Branch (R1, R2, R3):**\n    *   Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected in series. However, there is a wire connecting the point between R2 and R3 directly to the top wire (Node A).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** This wire creates a short circuit. It means the potential at the junction between R2 and R3 is the same as the potential at Node A (1 V).\n    *   Let's consider the voltage across R1 and R2. One end is at Node A (1 V). The other end (the junction between R2 and R3) is also at 1 V because of the connecting wire. Since there is no potential difference (voltage) across the series combination of R1 and R2, no current will flow through them. They are effectively bypassed.\n    *   This leaves R3. One end of R3 is connected to this same junction (at 1 V), and the other end is connected to ground (Node B, at 0 V). Therefore, R3 is directly connected across the 1 V source.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Right Branch (R7, R8):**\n    *   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series. Similar to the left branch, there is a wire connecting the point between R7 and R8 directly to the top wire (Node A).\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** This wire creates a short circuit across resistor R8. Both ends of R8 are connected to Node A (1 V).\n    *   Because there is no potential difference across R8, no current flows through it. R8 is effectively bypassed.\n    *   This leaves R7. One end of R7 is connected to the junction (at 1 V), and the other end is connected to ground (Node B, at 0 V). Therefore, R7 is also directly connected across the 1 V source.\n\n5.  **Form the Simplified Equivalent Circuit:**\n    *   From the analysis, the complex circuit simplifies to just two resistors, R3 and R7, connected in parallel across the voltage source V2.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Current:**\n    *   The total current (I_total) from the source V2 is the sum of the currents flowing through the two parallel branches (R3 and R7).\n    *   Calculate the current through R3 (I_R3):\n        *   I_R3 = V2 / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω = 1/9 A.\n    *   Calculate the current through R7 (I_R7):\n        *   I_R7 = V2 / R7 = 1 V / 100 Ω = 1/100 A.\n    *   Calculate the total current by adding the branch currents:\n        *   I_total = I_R3 + I_R7 = (1/9) A + (1/100) A.\n    *   To add the fractions, find a common denominator (which is 900):\n        *   I_total = (100/900) A + (9/900) A = 109/900 A.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n        *   I_total = 109 ÷ 900 A ≈ 0.12111... A.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\n<<<0.121 A>>>"
