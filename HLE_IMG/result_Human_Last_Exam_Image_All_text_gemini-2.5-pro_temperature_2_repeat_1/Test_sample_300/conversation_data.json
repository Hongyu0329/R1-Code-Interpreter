    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**Analysis of the artworks from left to right, top to bottom:**\n\n1.  **Top Left:** This is a figure painting in a realistic style, depicting women from an ethnic minority group in China. The signature in the upper right corner reads \"国良\" (Guó Liáng). This, along with the distinctive style of portraying minority figures in everyday life scenes, identifies the artist as **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**. This specific work is known as \"Market Day\" (赶场).\n\n2.  **Top Middle:** This is an ink wash painting of a landscape, likely a cityscape nestled in mountains. The style is highly abstract and modern, characterized by expressive lines and dots to represent forms. This is a signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a master who integrated Western modernism with traditional Chinese art. This piece is representative of his landscape sketches, such as his \"Mountain City of Chongqing\" series.\n\n3.  **Top Right:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic, cursive script (草书, cǎoshū). The powerful, free-flowing, and highly personalized style is the unmistakable hallmark of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. He was a proficient calligrapher, and this vigorous style is unique to him. The text is a couplet from a Tang dynasty poem by Wang Wei.\n\n4.  **Middle Left:** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, also in a powerful cursive script. The style is consistent with the previous work, displaying the same energy and unique character formations. This is another work by **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. The text is from a Song dynasty poem by Lin Bu.\n\n5.  **Middle Center:** This is a realistic oil painting of a young woman holding a paintbrush. The style is known as lyrical realism or scar art, often having a subtle, melancholic, and poetic quality. This is the famous painting \"Youth\" (青春, 1984) by **He Duoling (何多苓)**.\n\n6.  **Middle Right:** This is an ink and color painting of a woman in traditional attire, with stylized features and surrounded by birds. The square composition, bold ink outlines, rich color palette, and fusion of Chinese and Western techniques are all characteristic of the master **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**.\n\n7.  **Bottom Left:** This painting depicts a colorful farm courtyard scene with gourds and laundry. The work is signed \"吴冠中\" (Wú Guānzhōng) on the wooden post on the left and dated 1972. This vibrant, highly structured style, focusing on color, line, and form, is representative of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**'s efforts to modernize Chinese painting.\n\n8.  **Bottom Middle:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (shanshui hua) featuring a river gorge, cliffs, and sailboats. The monumental composition, the dense and layered application of ink to create texture and depth in the mountains, and the overall atmospheric effect are the signature techniques of **Li Keran (李可染)**, a pivotal figure in 20th-century Chinese landscape painting.\n\n9.  **Bottom Right:** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The simplicity, the masterful and economical brushwork that captures the creature's life and essence (qi), and the subject matter itself are all hallmarks of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese painters, famous for his paintings of shrimp, insects, and other small creatures.\n\n---\n\n**Final List of Authors:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the authors for each of the 9 works, from left to right and top to bottom, are:\n\n1.  Shi Guoliang\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Mao Zedong\n4.  Mao Zedong\n5.  He Duoling\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.
