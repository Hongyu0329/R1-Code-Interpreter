    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the musical measure:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the time signature of the given measure of music. The time signature defines how many beats are in a measure and what note value gets one beat. For example, in 4/4 time, there are 4 beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Rhythm in the Top Staff (Treble Clef)**\nTo find the time signature, we need to add up the rhythmic values of all the notes and rests within the measure. It's helpful to look at how the notes are grouped by beams, as this often corresponds to the beat structure.\n\n*   **Note Grouping:** The sixteenth notes (notes with two beams) in the top staff are grouped into four distinct sets. This grouping strongly suggests four main beats in the measure.\n*   **Beat 1:** The first group is slightly complex due to rests. It starts with a sixteenth-note chord (A-C#-E), followed by a sixteenth rest, then a single sixteenth note (G#), and finally another sixteenth rest. Let's add up their durations:\n    *   Sixteenth note (chord) + Sixteenth rest + Sixteenth note (G#) + Sixteenth rest = 4 sixteenth notes.\n    *   Since four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note, the total duration of this first group is one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 2:** This group consists of four sixteenth notes (A-C#-B-D). Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 3:** This group also consists of four sixteenth notes (C#-E-D-F#). Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note.\n*   **Beat 4:** The final group also has four sixteenth notes (E-G#-F#-A). Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note.\n*   **Total Duration of Top Staff:** Adding the duration of all four beats:\n    *   1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n    *   This analysis indicates a time signature with a total value of four quarter notes, which is 4/4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rhythm in the Bottom Staff (Bass Clef)**\nThe bottom staff can be used to confirm the analysis of the top staff.\n\n*   **Note Value:** The bottom staff contains a single chord (A-C#-E) written as a whole note. A whole note is a hollow note head with no stem.\n*   **Whole Note Duration:** By definition, a whole note lasts for four quarter notes.\n*   **Confirmation:** The fact that a single whole note fills the entire measure in the bass clef perfectly confirms that the total duration of the measure is four quarter notes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion and Selection of Answer**\nBoth the top and bottom staves independently show that the measure contains music with a total duration equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\n*   The time signature that represents four quarter notes per measure is **4/4**.\n\nLet's review the answer choices:\n*   A. 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure. (Incorrect)\n*   B. 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure. (Incorrect)\n*   C. 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure. (Correct)\n*   D. 3/8: Three eighth notes per measure. (Incorrect)\n*   E. 9/8: Nine eighth notes per measure. (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
