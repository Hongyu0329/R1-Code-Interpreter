    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**Careful Points & General Principles:**\n\n*   **Sexual Dimorphism in Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):** The primary task is to identify features that differ between males and females. Common differences include:\n    *   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae, sometimes with an extra segment (13 vs. 12 in females), and in some groups, they are distinctively shaped (e.g., curled).\n    *   **Face (Clypeus):** Males in many species have yellow or white markings on their faces, while females' faces are often dark.\n    *   **Abdomen Tip:** Females have an ovipositor, which is modified into a stinger in bees and wasps, making the abdomen appear pointed. Males lack a stinger, and their abdomen tip is often blunter, sometimes with visible claspers or spines.\n    *   **Eyes:** In some species, males have larger eyes that may converge at the top of the head.\n    *   **Pollen Collection:** The prompt specifies these taxa are \"without scopae on their legs\". Scopae are specialized pollen-carrying hairs. This suggests we might be looking at wasps or cleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bees, where females don't provision nests with pollen. Even if a female bee does collect pollen, a male never will.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\nThese bees are known cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bees. They do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the prompt's description.\n*   **Insect on the left (A, left):** The most striking feature is the abdomen, which tapers to a sharp, conical point. This is the characteristic abdomen of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the host's nest cell.\n*   **Insect on the right (A, right):** In contrast, the abdomen of this insect is blunt and terminates in a series of spines or prongs. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps are also pollinators that feed on nectar and lack pollen-collecting scopae.\n*   **Insect on the left (B, left):** The antennae are long and distinctly curled at the tips. Curled antennae are a classic diagnostic feature for male paper wasps (*Polistes*) and many other male vespids.\n*   **Insect on the right (B, right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen tapers to a point, concealing a stinger. These features are characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\nThis pair presents a slight puzzle with the \"no scopae\" clue, as female long-horned bees typically have very large, dense scopae on their hind legs. However, the other sexual characteristics are exceptionally clear and provide a reliable identification. We will rely on these primary features.\n*   **Insect on the left (C, left):** This bee has extremely long antennae, the key feature that gives \"long-horned bees\" their name and is a definitive trait of males in this group. Additionally, its face (clypeus) is pale yellow, another common male characteristic in many bee species.\n*   **Insect on the right (C, right):** This bee has much shorter antennae compared to the one on the left. Its face is dark. The hairs on its abdomen are bright yellow because they are covered in pollen from the aster flower it is visiting. While difficult to see clearly, its hind legs also appear to be carrying pollen. The short antennae and dark face are definitive female traits for this group.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Answer Synthesis:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> Option 4\n*   Pair B: M, F -> Option 3\n*   Pair C: M, F -> Option 3\n\nThe final sequence of indices is 4, 3, 3.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
