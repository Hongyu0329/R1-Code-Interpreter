**Product A:**
Structure: A pyrrole ring that is substituted at positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituent at position 1 is a 3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propyl group. The substituent at position 2 is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). The substituent at position 3 is an acetyl group (-COCH3).

**Product B:**
Structure: A tricyclic system composed of a fused pyrrolo-pyrazino-azepine core. Specifically, it's a derivative of hexahydro-pyrrolo[1',2':1,6]pyrazino[2,3-c]azepine-dione. It has two carbonyl groups within the ring system and a methyl ester group attached to the azepine ring's double bond.

**Product C:**
Structure: A tricyclic saturated heterocyclic system, containing two fused pyrrolidine rings and a pyrazinone ring (a 5/6/5 fused system). It possesses a carbonyl group in the six-membered ring and an acetyl group attached to one of the nitrogen atoms.
