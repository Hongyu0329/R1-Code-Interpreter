Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy sphere is a Wool Sower Gall, which is created by a cynipid wasp (*Callirhytis seminator*). The female wasp lays her eggs by injecting them directly into the woody tissue of an oak twig. The gall then grows around the developing larvae, providing both food and shelter.
