    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the venue shown in the image. The building's architecture is very distinctive. It features a combination of red brickwork (some in a herringbone pattern), a tan-colored facade with a large decorative quatrefoil emblem, a curved roofline, and an open second-story area with a white crisscross railing. A large tour-style semi-truck is parked outside, strongly suggesting it is a music or performance venue. A reverse image search or a descriptive search for \"music venue with red brick and quatrefoil design\" identifies the building as the **Uptown Theater** in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Venue:** By comparing the image with pictures of the Uptown Theater in Kansas City, all the key architectural elements match perfectly: the red brick, the tan section with the emblem, the roof shape, the light fixture, and the balcony railing.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule:** The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date. The next step is to find the event calendar for the Uptown Theater for the year 2023.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Date:** We need to look for the schedule for **October 12, 2023**. Searching through concert archives, the venue's past events list, or ticket vendor history will provide this information.\n\n5.  **Identify the Performer:** A search for events at the Uptown Theater in Kansas City on October 12, 2023, shows that the musical artist **Fletcher** performed there as part of her \"Girl of My Dreams Tour\".\n\nTherefore, the musical artist that played at this venue on October 12, 2023, was Fletcher.\n\n<<<Fletcher>>>"
