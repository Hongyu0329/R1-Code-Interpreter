    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the two numbers in the two top-most white squares of the Kakuro puzzle. Let's label the left top square as 'A' and the right top square as 'B'.\n\n2.  **Understand Kakuro Rules:**\n    *   Fill white squares with digits from 1 to 9.\n    *   The number in a black square's top-right section is a \"clue\" for the horizontal run of white squares to its right. The sum of digits in that run must equal the clue.\n    *   The number in a black square's bottom-left section is a clue for the vertical run of white squares below it. The sum of digits in that run must equal the clue.\n    *   In any single run (horizontal or vertical), digits cannot be repeated.\n    *   The lines extending from the clues in the provided diagram indicate the direction and length of the run they apply to.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues Affecting the Top Squares (A and B):**\n    *   **Vertical Clue for A:** There is a clue `17` above square A. The line from this clue points down and spans two cells: cell A and the cell directly below it (let's call it D).\n        *   This gives us the equation: `A + D = 17`.\n        *   Since A and D must be distinct digits from 1-9, the only possible pair is {8, 9}.\n        *   Therefore, **A must be either 8 or 9**.\n\n    *   **Vertical Clue for B:** There is a clue `29` above square B. The line from this clue points down and spans four cells: cell B, the cell below it (E), and two more cells below E.\n        *   This gives the equation: `B + E + (cell below E) + (cell below that) = 29`.\n        *   To find the unique set of 4 digits that sum to 29, we consider the maximum possible sum: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30. To get a sum of 29, we must reduce the total by 1. The only way to do this with unique digits is to replace the 6 with a 5.\n        *   Thus, the four digits in this column must be a permutation of {9, 8, 7, 5}.\n        *   Therefore, **B must be one of the digits 5, 7, 8, or 9**.\n\n    *   **Interaction via the second row:** The cells D (below A) and E (below B) are in the same horizontal row. There is a clue to the left of this row. Looking at the diagram, a black cell with `15/` provides the clue. The line indicates it applies to a horizontal run of three cells. These must be the cell to the left of D (let's call it C), cell D, and cell E.\n        *   This gives the equation: `C + D + E = 15`.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information to Find A and B:** Now, let's combine these facts to find the specific values of A and B.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume A = 8.**\n        *   From `A + D = 17`, we get `D = 9`.\n        *   From `C + D + E = 15`, we have `C + 9 + E = 15`, which simplifies to `C + E = 6`.\n        *   We know E must be from the set {9, 8, 7, 5}. Since E must be in the same row as D, E cannot be 9 (`E!=D`). So, E must be in {8, 7, 5}.\n        *   Now we look at `C + E = 6`. C must be at least 1, so E can be at most 5. The only value from its set {8, 7, 5} that works is `E = 5`.\n        *   If `E = 5`, then `C = 1`. This is a valid combination.\n        *   Now let's determine B. We know B is in the set {5, 7, 8, 9}. It cannot be equal to A (8) or E (5). So B could be 9 or 7.\n        *   This leads to two possibilities for the pair (A,B): **(8, 9)** or **(8, 7)**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume A = 9.**\n        *   From `A + D = 17`, we get `D = 8`.\n        *   From `C + D + E = 15`, we have `C + 8 + E = 15`, which simplifies to `C + E = 7`.\n        *   We know E must be in the set {9, 8, 7, 5}. E cannot be equal to D (8). So E is in {9, 7, 5}.\n        *   From `C + E = 7`, E must be less than 7. The only value from its set {9, 7, 5} that works is `E = 5` (which gives `C=2`) or E=... (e.g. `E=6, C=1`).\n        *   Looking at the set for E {9,7,5}, the only possibility is `E=5`, which means `C=2`.\n        *   Now let's determine B. We know B is in the set {5, 7, 8, 9}. It cannot be equal to A (9) or E (5). So B could be 8 or 7.\n        *   This leads to two possibilities for the pair (A,B): **(9, 8)** or **(9, 7)**.\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:**\n    *   Our analysis shows that the possible pairs for (A,B) are `(8,9)`, `(8,7)`, `(9,8)`, and `(9,7)`.\n    *   This means the sum of A and B can be `8+9=17`, `8+7=15`, or `9+7=16`.\n    *   A, B form a horizontal run of 2 cells. This run must have a clue. The clues for 2-cell horizontal runs shown in the diagram are `10` and `6`.\n    *   There is a contradiction: The possibilities for the sum of A and B derived from the vertical clues (15, 16, 17) do not match the horizontal clues available in the diagram (10, 6). This strongly suggests that the diagram is drawn with a mistake, either in a clue's value or its placement.\n    *   The most plausible interpretation is that the puzzle creator intended for one of the determined sums (15, 16, or 17) to be the correct one. The clues `17` and `15` are already present on the board. If the horizontal sum for A and B were `17`, it would require `{A,B}` to be `{8,9}`. This fits nicely with the possibilities derived from our analysis: `(8,9)` and `(9,8)`.\n    *   This is the most constrained and elegant solution path, resolving the inconsistencies by assuming a flaw in the diagram's horizontal clues for the top row, and inferring the sum from the more complex vertical interactions.\n    *   Therefore, the two numbers in the top squares must be 8 and 9."
