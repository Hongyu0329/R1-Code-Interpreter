    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify all the vertices and edges of the graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex by carefully examining the figure.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nA crucial observation is to analyze the subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. Let's check the connections between these four vertices:\n*   (2,3): Yes\n*   (2,4): Yes\n*   (2,5): Yes\n*   (3,4): Yes\n*   (3,5): Yes\n*   (4,5): Yes\nSince every pair of vertices in the set {2, 3, 4, 5} is connected by an edge, this subgraph is a **complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄)**.\n\nThe entire graph G can therefore be described as a K₄ on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, with an additional vertex (1) connected to two of the vertices of the K₄ (vertex 2 and vertex 5).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Compute the Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\n\nGiven the clear structure identified in Step 1, we can use a direct composition method. We will first consider coloring the K₄ subgraph and then determine the number of ways to color the remaining vertex. This is generally much simpler and less error-prone than using the deletion-contraction method from scratch, although we can use the latter for verification.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Chromatic Polynomial using Composition**\n\nLet P(G, k) be the number of ways to properly color the graph G using k colors.\n\n1.  **Color the K₄ subgraph:** The subgraph induced by {2, 3, 4, 5} is a K₄. The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    For K₄, the chromatic polynomial is:\n    P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n2.  **Color the remaining vertex (vertex 1):** After we have a valid coloring for the K₄ subgraph, we need to color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 5.\n    *   In any valid coloring of K₄, adjacent vertices must have different colors. Therefore, the color of vertex 2, let's call it c(2), must be different from the color of vertex 5, c(5). So, c(2) ≠ c(5).\n    *   The color of vertex 1, c(1), must be different from the colors of its neighbors, which are c(2) and c(5).\n    *   Since c(2) and c(5) are two distinct colors, there are two colors that are forbidden for vertex 1.\n    *   This leaves **(k-2)** choices for the color of vertex 1.\n\n3.  **Combine the results:** The number of choices for vertex 1 is (k-2) for *any* valid coloring of the K₄ subgraph. By the multiplication rule, we can find the total number of valid colorings for the entire graph G by multiplying the number of ways to color K₄ by the number of ways to color vertex 1.\n\n    P(G, k) = P(K₄, k) × (Number of choices for vertex 1)\n    P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] × (k-2)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\n**Step 4: Expand the Polynomial into Standard Form**\n\nNow, we expand the polynomial expression.\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-3)(k-2)²\nFirst, multiply the terms (k-1) and (k-3):\n(k-1)(k-3) = k² - 3k - k + 3 = k² - 4k + 3\n\nNext, expand (k-2)²:\n(k-2)² = k² - 4k + 4\n\nNow, multiply these two results:\n(k² - 4k + 3)(k² - 4k + 4)\nLet's use a substitution to simplify: let x = k² - 4k.\n(x + 3)(x + 4) = x² + 7x + 12\nSubstitute x back:\n(k² - 4k)² + 7(k² - 4k) + 12\n= (k⁴ - 8k³ + 16k²) + (7k² - 28k) + 12\n= k⁴ - 8k³ + 23k² - 28k + 12\n\nFinally, multiply by the leading factor of k:\nP(G, k) = k * (k⁴ - 8k³ + 23k² - 28k + 12)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 8k⁴ + 23k³ - 28k² + 12k\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   The most critical step is to correctly identify all edges of the graph from the image. Missing the edge (2,5) would lead to an entirely different graph and a wrong result.\n*   Recognizing the K₄ subgraph is the key to simplifying the problem significantly. Without this recognition, methods like deletion-contraction become much more complex.\n*   When using the composition method, ensure that the number of choices for the added vertex/vertices is independent of the specific coloring of the base subgraph. In this case, since c(2) is always different from c(5), the number of choices for vertex 1 is always (k-2).\n*   Algebraic expansion of the polynomial must be done meticulously to avoid errors.\n\nFinal Answer: The chromatic polynomial is k⁵ - 8k⁴ + 23k³ - 28k² + 12k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 8*k^4 + 23*k^3 - 28*k^2 + 12*k>>>"
