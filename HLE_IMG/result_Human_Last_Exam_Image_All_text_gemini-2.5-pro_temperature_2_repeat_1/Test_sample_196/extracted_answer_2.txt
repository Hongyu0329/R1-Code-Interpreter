Here are four possibilities for how the dimerization of 3-oxidopyrylium could be described in terms of [mπ+nπ]:

1.  **[4π+2π] cycloaddition**: One molecule reacts as a 4π component (diene), and the other reacts as a 2π component (dienophile).
2.  **[4π+4π] cycloaddition**: Both molecules react as 4π components (dienes).
3.  **[6π+4π] cycloaddition**: One molecule reacts as a 6π component, and the other reacts as a 4π component.
4.  **[6π+2π] cycloaddition**: One molecule reacts as a 6π component, and the other reacts as a 2π component.
