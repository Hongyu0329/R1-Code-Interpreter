The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be held erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved or swan-necked (cygneous), causing the capsule to be nodding or drooping.
