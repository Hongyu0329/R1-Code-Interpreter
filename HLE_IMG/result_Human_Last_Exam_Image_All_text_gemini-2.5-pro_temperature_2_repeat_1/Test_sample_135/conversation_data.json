    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Visual Analysis of the Artwork**\n*   **Form and Medium:** The image shows a bas-relief (low relief sculpture) set within a decorative circular frame, known as a tondo. The surface appears smooth and slightly glossy, which is characteristic of glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata), a technique famously pioneered and popularized by the Della Robbia family of Florence during the Renaissance.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a Christian religious rite. A priest, standing at an altar with a candle, is administering communion to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This scene represents the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n*   **Style:** The figures are rendered with grace and classicism, typical of the Italian High Renaissance. The composition is balanced and harmonious. The surrounding frame is decorated with a garland of leaves and fruits, a common motif in Della Robbia works.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a small cartouche with a visible inscription. The text reads \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\". This is French for \"Sacrament of the Altar\", confirming the subject as the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting the Clues**\n*   **The Della Robbia Workshop:** The combination of the glazed terracotta medium and the Renaissance style strongly points to an artist from the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence. Key members include Luca della Robbia (the founder), his nephew Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's sons, Giovanni, Luca the Younger, and Girolamo.\n*   **The French Inscription:** The inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\" is in French, not Italian (\"Sacramento dell'Altare\") or Latin (\"Sacramentum Altaris\"). This is a critical clue. It suggests that the artwork was created for a French patron or was located in France.\n*   **The Della Robbias in France:** While the Della Robbia workshop was based in Florence, one of Andrea's sons, Girolamo della Robbia (1488–1566), moved to France around 1517. He spent most of his career there, working extensively for the French court, particularly for King Francis I. This makes him the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Specific Artwork and Artist**\n*   A search for works by Girolamo della Robbia in France reveals a major commission: the \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" (also known as the \"Fontaine de Beaune\").\n*   This large altarpiece was created between 1525 and 1527 for the chapel of the Hôpital Saint-Jacques in Beaune, France. This location explains the French inscription.\n*   The altarpiece is composed of seven tondi, each depicting one of the Seven Sacraments.\n*   Comparing the image provided with documented images of the Beaune altarpiece (now housed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dijon), we can confirm that this tondo is indeed the panel representing the Eucharist from that specific work.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe relief is a detail from the \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" created for a chapel in Beaune, France. The combination of the Della Robbia style and the French inscription identifies the author as Girolamo della Robbia, the member of the family who established a successful career in France.\n\n<<<Girolamo della Robbia>>>"
