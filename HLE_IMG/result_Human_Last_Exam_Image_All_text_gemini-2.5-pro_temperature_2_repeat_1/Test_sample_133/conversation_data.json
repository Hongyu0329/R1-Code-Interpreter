    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺)**\n\n1.  **Identify the highest m/z cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio are at m/z 262, 264, and 266. This suggests that the molecular ion (M⁺) has a nominal mass of 262 amu.\n2.  **Determine the number of chlorine/bromine atoms:** The relative intensities of the isotopic peaks are crucial.\n    *   I(m/z 262) = 29.0 %\n    *   I(m/z 264) = 12.9 %\n    *   I(m/z 266) = 3.22 %\n    *   The ratio of intensities is approximately I(M⁺) : I(M⁺+2) : I(M⁺+4) ≈ 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22.\n    *   Normalizing to the smallest peak (3.22): ≈ 9.0 : 4.0 : 1.\n    *   The theoretical isotope pattern for a compound with two chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) is approximately M:M+2:M+4 = 9:6:1.\n    *   While the M+2 peak is weaker than theoretically expected (4.0 instead of 6), the M+4 peak fits well (1 vs 1). The presence of two chlorine atoms is the most plausible explanation for this pattern. The discrepancy in the M+2 peak intensity could be due to specific fragmentation behavior of the [M+2]⁺ ion.\n    *   Conclusion: The molecule contains two chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 262 is the molecular ion corresponding to the molecule containing two ³⁵Cl atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Calculate the mass of the non-halogen part:** The molecular weight (using ³⁵Cl) is 262. The mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms is 2 * 35 = 70 amu. The mass of the rest of the molecule (CₓHᵧOₙ...) is 262 - 70 = 192 amu.\n2.  **Hypothesize the elemental composition of the CₓHᵧ... part:** We need to find a combination of C, H, O, etc., that sums to 192.\n    *   Let's assume the formula is CₓHᵧ. 192 / 12 (mass of C) ≈ 16. Let's try C₁₅. 15 * 12 = 180. The remaining mass is 192 - 180 = 12, which corresponds to 12 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n3.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H + X) / 2\n    *   DBE = 15 + 1 - (12 + 2) / 2 = 16 - 14 / 2 = 16 - 7 = 9.\n    *   A DBE of 9 suggests a highly unsaturated structure, likely containing aromatic rings (a benzene ring has a DBE of 4). Two benzene rings would account for a DBE of 8. The remaining DBE of 1 could be a double bond or another ring. This supports a structure with two phenyl rings.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks**\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, with a relative intensity of 100%. From the table, the base peak is at **m/z 225**.\n2.  **Analyze the Base Peak and its neighborhood:**\n    *   We have a very strong peak at m/z 225 (I=100%) and another at m/z 227 (I=66.7%).\n    *   Let's hypothesize what ions these peaks represent. There are two main possibilities for the base peak.\n        *   **Hypothesis A:** The peak at m/z 225 is a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**. Its M+2 isotope peak (with one ³⁵Cl and one ³⁷Cl) would be at m/z 227. The theoretical intensity ratio I(M+2)/I(M) for a fragment with 2 Cl is ~6:9 or 0.67. The observed ratio is I(227)/I(225) = 66.7 / 100 = 0.67. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **Hypothesis B:** The peak at m/z 225 is a fragment containing **one chlorine atom**. Its M+2 isotope peak would be at m/z 227 with an intensity of ~1/3 of the base peak (I(227) ≈ 33%). The observed peak at m/z 227 is much too large for this. However, it could be a superposition of this isotope peak and another fragment, for example [M-Cl]⁺ which also has m/z 227.\n\n    *   The excellent match in Hypothesis A is very compelling, but the resulting fragmentation (M⁺ (262) -> Fragment⁺ (225) means a loss of 37 amu, likely a C₃H• radical) is unusual.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate Hypothesis B, as it's more chemically conventional. Assume the base peak at m/z 225 has one Cl. Then M⁺(262) -> [M-Cl]⁺(227). This fragment [M-Cl]⁺ then undergoes further fragmentation, e.g., loss of H₂, to form the base peak [M-Cl-H₂]⁺ at m/z 225. This pathway M⁺ -> [M-Cl]⁺ -> [M-Cl-H₂]⁺ is a plausible sequence for aromatic halides. The large peak at m/z 227 can be explained as the sum of the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment and the M+2 isotope of the base peak. This is a self-consistent and chemically reasonable interpretation.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n1.  **Synthesize the findings:** We are looking for a compound with the formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. Its structure should contain two chlorinated phenyl rings and a linker that facilitates the fragmentation M⁺ -> [M-Cl]⁺ -> [M-Cl-H₂]⁺.\n2.  **Candidate Structure:** A very plausible candidate is an isomer of dichlorodiphenylpropene. Let's consider **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**.\n    *   **Structure:** (4-Cl-C₆H₄)₂C=CH-CH₃\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ (matches).\n    *   **MW (for ³⁵Cl₂):** 15*12 + 12*1 + 2*35 = 180 + 12 + 70 = 262 (matches).\n    *   **DBE:** 9 (matches).\n    *   **Fragmentation:** Upon ionization, such a molecule can readily lose a chlorine radical to form the [M-Cl]⁺ ion at m/z 227. This cation can then rearrange and cyclize, expelling an H₂ molecule to form a very stable, highly conjugated/aromatic ion at m/z 225, which would be the base peak.\n3.  **Systematic IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The parent chain is propene.\n    *   The double bond is at position 1 (prop-1-ene).\n    *   There are two \"4-chlorophenyl\" groups attached to position 1.\n    *   The systematic name is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**. (Alternatively, as a benzene derivative: 1-chloro-4-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl]benzene).\n\nFinal check of other major peaks:\n*   **m/z 190:** Loss of two Cl atoms and two H atoms from M⁺ (262 - 70 - 2 = 190). This corresponds to a C₁₅H₁₀⁺• radical cation, which can be a very stable polycyclic aromatic species. This further supports the proposed parent structure.\n\n<<<1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene>>>"
