    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. \"Lifetime\" in this context refers to the stability of the complex under operating conditions, where a more stable complex leads to a longer device lifetime.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes share a common core structure: they are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, where PF6- is the counterion.\n*   **Central Metal Ion:** Iridium(III) is used in all four complexes.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** This is the bidentate ligand coordinating through two nitrogen atoms. In all four complexes, this ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this part is identical for all complexes, it will not be the differentiating factor for their relative stability. The bulky tert-butyl groups are primarily for improving solubility and preventing self-quenching through aggregation.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** These are the ligands that coordinate to the iridium center via one nitrogen atom and one carbon atom (forming a strong Ir-C bond). This is the key part of the structure that differs among the four complexes. The stability of the complex is strongly influenced by the nature of these ligands, particularly the strength of the Ir-C bond.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Cyclometalating (C^N) Ligands**\nThe C^N ligand in all cases is a derivative of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The difference lies in the fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring.\n*   **Complex 1:** The phenyl ring is substituted with two fluorine atoms (at the 2' and 4' positions). The ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine.\n*   **Complex 2:** The phenyl ring is unsubstituted. The ligand is the parent 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n*   **Complex 3:** The phenyl ring is substituted with one fluorine atom (at the 2' position). The ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n*   **Complex 4:** The phenyl ring is substituted with three fluorine atoms (at the 2', 4', and 5' positions). The ligand is 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Ligand Substitution to Complex Stability and Lifetime**\nThe operational stability (and thus lifetime) of these iridium complexes is heavily dependent on the strength of the bonds within the molecule, especially the cyclometalating Ir-C bond. Degradation of the emitter often involves the breaking of this bond.\n*   **Electronic Effect of Fluorine:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) via the inductive effect.\n*   **Strengthening the Ir-C Bond:** EWGs pull electron density away from the phenyl ring and the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This strengthens the covalent Ir-C bond. A stronger bond is more resistant to breaking under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation.\n*   **Stability Trend:** The more electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms are present on the C^N ligand, the stronger the Ir-C bonds will be, and the more stable the complex will be.\n    *   Complex 2 (no F atoms): Weakest Ir-C bonds -> Lowest stability -> Shortest lifetime.\n    *   Complex 3 (one F atom per ligand): Stronger Ir-C bonds -> Higher stability than Complex 2.\n    *   Complex 1 (two F atoms per ligand): Even stronger Ir-C bonds -> Higher stability than Complex 3.\n    *   Complex 4 (three F atoms per ligand): Strongest Ir-C bonds -> Highest stability -> Longest lifetime.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Which Complexes Have Shorter Lifetimes**\nBased on the analysis, the expected order of lifetimes is:\n**Complex 2 < Complex 3 < Complex 1 < Complex 4**\n\nThe question asks which complexes show \"shorter lifetimes\". This is a relative term. In this series:\n*   Complex 2 is clearly expected to have the shortest lifetime as it lacks the stabilizing fluorine atoms present in all others.\n*   Complex 3, with only a single fluorine atom per ligand, is more stable than 2 but significantly less stable than the highly-fluorinated complexes 1 and 4.\n*   Complexes 1 and 4 are purposefully designed with multiple fluorine atoms to achieve high stability and long lifetimes.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to group the non-fluorinated (Complex 2) and minimally-fluorinated (Complex 3) complexes together as the ones with \"shorter lifetimes\" relative to the highly-fluorinated ones. The plural form in the question (\"Which of them...\") supports selecting more than one complex.\n\nFinal choice: Complexes [2, 3] are expected to show shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
