    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the image:** The image displays a cuneiform sign. Cuneiform is one of the earliest systems of writing, developed by the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia.\n2.  **Analyze the form of the sign:** The sign is drawn in a relatively early, pictographic style. It clearly depicts a structure. There is a rectangular base, suggesting a floor plan or walls, and a triangular top, representing a roof. The lines inside the rectangle might indicate rooms, pillars, or the layout of the building. This visual representation strongly suggests a building or a dwelling.\n3.  **Determine the specific cuneiform sign:** This sign is known to scholars of Assyriology and Sumerology. It is the Sumerian sign **É** (also transliterated as **E2**).\n4.  **Recall the meaning of the sign:** The logogram É has the primary meaning of \"house,\" \"household,\" or \"temple.\" This is consistent with its pictographic origin as a diagram of a house. The question asks for its meaning in the third millennium BCE (3000-2001 BCE), a period when the connection between the sign's appearance and its meaning was often still very direct.\n5.  **Evaluate the given answer choices:**\n    *   A. Tool: Cuneiform signs for tools typically looked like the tools they represented (e.g., a pickaxe, a plow). This sign does not resemble a tool.\n    *   B. Guard: This is an occupation or a role. While there were signs for professions, this specific sign for a building would not mean \"guard.\"\n    *   C. Bread: The sign for bread (`NINDA`) typically resembled a ration bowl or a loaf of bread, which looks different from this sign.\n    *   D. Home: \"Home\" is a direct synonym for \"house.\" This aligns perfectly with the meaning of the sign É.\n    *   E. Deity: The sign for deity (`DINGIR`) was a star symbol, which looks completely different.\n    *   F. Beard: The sign for beard (`SU₆`) was usually shown as part of a human head and looked like hatch marks on the chin. This is incorrect.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the visual evidence of the pictograph and established knowledge of Sumerian cuneiform, the sign É represents a house. \"Home\" is the correct meaning among the choices provided.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Time Period:** The question specifies the \"third-millennium form.\" Cuneiform signs evolved from pictograms into more abstract, wedge-based shapes. The form shown is archaic, fitting this early period where the pictorial meaning is clearest.\n*   **Logographic Meaning:** Cuneiform signs can have multiple meanings and phonetic values. The question asks for the primary, logographic (word) meaning of this sign.\n*   **Visual Interpretation:** The most direct clue is the sign's appearance as a schematic drawing of a building, which makes \"Home\" a logical answer even without prior knowledge of the specific sign.\n\n<<<D>>>"
