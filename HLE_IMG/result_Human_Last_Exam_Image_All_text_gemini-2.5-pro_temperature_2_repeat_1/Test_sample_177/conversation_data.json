    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the *percentage reduction* in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) mode shares.\n\n2.  **What is VMT?**: VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. Car VMT is the total distance traveled by cars. It is calculated by multiplying the number of car trips by the average distance of those trips.\n\n3.  **Key Data Components**:\n    *   **Share of total trips by distance**: This represents the distribution of trips by length (e.g., 48% of all trips are 0-3 miles long). This distribution is the same for both scenarios and acts as a weighting factor.\n    *   **Mode share by distance**: For each distance category, this tells us what percentage of trips are taken by which mode.\n    *   **Average trip distance**: This provides the representative mileage for each distance category (e.g., a \"0-3 mile\" trip is, on average, 1 mile long).\n    *   **Car VMT**: To calculate this, we must consider both types of car trips: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We need to sum their shares for each distance category.\n\n4.  **Calculation Strategy**:\n    *   Since the total number of trips is not given, we can calculate a \"weighted VMT\" for a representative sample of trips (e.g., for every 1000 total trips). Because we are calculating a percentage change, the absolute number of trips is not needed and will cancel out.\n    *   The calculation will follow this formula for each scenario:\n        *`Total Weighted VMT = Σ [ (Share of total trips for category i) × (Total car mode share for category i) × (Average trip distance for category i) ]`*\n        where the sum (Σ) is over the four distance categories.\n    *   Once we have the Total Weighted VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios, we can calculate the percentage reduction using the standard formula:\n        *`% Reduction = (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline * 100%`*\n\n5.  **Careful Point - Irrelevant Data**: The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" (2.8 and 3) is not needed for calculating Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). VMT counts the miles a *vehicle* travels, not the miles each *person* travels (which is Person Miles Traveled or PMT).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car Mode Share for Each Distance Category**\n\nFor both tables, we sum the shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **Baseline (Table 1) Total Car Share:**\n    *   0-3 miles: 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   3-5 miles: 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   5-10 miles: 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   10+ miles: 42% + 47% = 89%\n\n*   **Proposed (Table 2) Total Car Share:**\n    *   0-3 miles: 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   3-5 miles: 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   5-10 miles: 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   10+ miles: 16% + 33% = 49%\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Weighted VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nWe multiply the \"share of total trips\" by the \"total car share\" by the \"average trip distance\" for each category and sum the results.\n\n*   **0-3 miles**: 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg miles) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles**: 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (avg miles) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles**: 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (avg miles) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles**: 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (avg miles) = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Weighted VMT (Baseline)** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Weighted VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe repeat the process using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles**: 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg miles) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles**: 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (avg miles) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles**: 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (avg miles) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles**: 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (avg miles) = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Weighted VMT (Proposed)** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in VMT**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100%\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
