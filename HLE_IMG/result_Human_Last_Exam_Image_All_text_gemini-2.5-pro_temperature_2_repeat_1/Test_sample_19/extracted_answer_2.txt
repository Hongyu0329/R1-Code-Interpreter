1. The music modulates to the key of **E Major**. This new key is established on the first beat of measure 12, with measure 11 serving as the harmonic preparation for the modulation.
2. The home key is C-sharp minor and the new key is E Major. These are **relative keys**, meaning they share the same key signature (four sharps). E Major is the relative major of C-sharp minor. This is a very common and closely related pairing, making it a standard and smooth-sounding modulation in Western tonal music.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is **v/III**. This indicates that the chord is the *minor dominant* (lowercase 'v') of the *mediant* (III) of the original key of C-sharp minor. The chord is B minor, which functions as the dominant of E Major (the III chord) but is borrowed from the parallel key of E minor.
