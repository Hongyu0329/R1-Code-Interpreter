    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:** The image displays a Google Trends graph, which shows the relative search interest of terms over time. The x-axis represents time, from December 2019 to mid-2023. The y-axis represents search interest on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is the peak popularity for any of the terms in the selected time range. There are three colored lines (red, blue, and yellow), each representing a different search term.\n\n2.  **Identify Patterns for Each Term:** The most prominent feature of the graph is the sharp, recurring peaks for all three lines. These peaks occur at the same time each year, indicating that the search terms are related to annual events, most likely holidays or anniversaries.\n\n3.  **Determine the Timing of the Annual Events:**\n    *   **Red Line:** This line shows a significant spike every year in late December. This strongly suggests the search term is related to Christmas (December 25th) or New Year's.\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller, but very regular, spike each year at the very end of May.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line shows a large spike each year in early-to-mid July. In one year, this peak is the highest of all three terms, reaching 100 on the scale.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis based on the Timings:** The goal is to find a single country that has three major historic events or national holidays that correspond to these three specific times of the year.\n    *   Event 1 (Red): Late December\n    *   Event 2 (Blue): Late May\n    *   Event 3 (Yellow): Early/Mid-July\n\n5.  **Evaluate Potential Countries:**\n    *   **United Kingdom:** Has Christmas/Boxing Day (late Dec) and a Spring Bank Holiday (late May), but no major national holiday in mid-July.\n    *   **France:** Has Christmas (late Dec) and Bastille Day (July 14th), which fits the yellow line's timing. However, its major May holidays are on May 1st and May 8th, which is too early for the blue line's late-May peak.\n    *   **Canada:** Has Christmas (late Dec), Victoria Day (the last Monday before May 25th, fitting late May), and Canada Day (July 1st, fitting early July). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **United States:** Has Christmas (late Dec), Memorial Day (the last Monday in May, fitting late May perfectly), and Independence Day (July 4th, fitting early July perfectly).\n\n6.  **Refine the Hypothesis and Conclude:** Both Canada and the United States seem plausible based on the timing. However, we can use the relative popularity (the height of the peaks) and the prompt's clue that the events are \"historic\" to make a final determination.\n    *   The combination of events for the United States fits perfectly:\n        *   **Red Line:** **Christmas**. A major federal holiday.\n        *   **Blue Line:** **Memorial Day**. A historic day of remembrance established after the Civil War, which falls on the last Monday of May. Its search interest is significant but generally lower than the other two, matching the graph.\n        *   **Yellow Line:** **Independence Day (4th of July)**. This is one of the most important historic events in the U.S. and is celebrated nationwide with events that generate massive search interest (e.g., \"fireworks\", \"parades\"). It's plausible that in a given year, it could generate the most search interest of the three, as shown by the peak hitting 100.\n\nThis combination of three specific, nationally significant historic holidays at these precise times of the year, with this particular pattern of relative search interest, is uniquely characteristic of the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
