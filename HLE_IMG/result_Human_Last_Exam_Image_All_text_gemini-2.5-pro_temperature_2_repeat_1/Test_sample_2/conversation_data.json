    "**Step-by-step analysis of the algorithm and its time complexity:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The provided function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive sorting algorithm. Let's break down its operation for a given array `a` and size `n`.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the recursion stops. An array with one or zero elements is already sorted.\n    -   **Recursive Step (if n > 1):**\n        a.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        b.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the array (`a[n-1]`) with the new largest element of the sorted prefix (`a[n-2]`).\n        c.  `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: If the last element is smaller, it's swapped with the element before it.\n        d.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Crucially, if a swap occurred, the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements might be broken (since a new, smaller element has been moved into position `n-2`). Therefore, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n-1)` *again* to re-sort the prefix.\n\n    This algorithm is a known (but highly inefficient) sorting algorithm, sometimes called \"Pessimal Sort\" or \"Stupid Sort\".\n\n2.  **Formulating the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n    -   The cost of the comparison and the potential swap is constant, let's call it `c` or `O(1)`.\n    -   The cost of each recursive call `sort(a, n-1)` is `T(n-1)`.\n    -   In the best case (when the `if` condition is false), the function makes only one recursive call. The relation would be `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(n)`. This happens, for example, if the array is already sorted.\n    -   In the worst case (when the `if` condition is true), the function makes *two* recursive calls. The relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1)`.\n\n    So, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where c is a constant for the comparison and swap)\n    `T(1) = d` (where d is a constant for the base case)\n\n3.  **Solving the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    `= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    `= 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    ...\n    After `k` expansions, we get:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum is a geometric series: `sum(from i=0 to k-1) 2^i = (2^k - 1) / (2-1) = 2^k - 1`.\n    So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst case happens when the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition is triggered as often as possible. Consider a reverse-sorted array like `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    -   `sort(a, n)` will first call `sort(a, n-1)`.\n    -   After this first call, the prefix `a[0...n-2]` will be sorted. The array will look like `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    -   The condition `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `if 1 < n`, which is true for `n>1`.\n    -   A swap occurs, and the array becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n    -   The second `sort(a, n-1)` is called on the prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This prefix itself has its smallest element at the end, which will trigger the worst-case behavior in the subsequent recursive calls.\n    -   This pattern confirms that a reverse-sorted array is indeed a worst-case input, leading to the `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` recurrence at each step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case scenario is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
