    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Key Signature and Tonic Key:**\n*   The key signature at the beginning of the piece has three flats: B♭, E♭, and A♭.\n*   This signature corresponds to the keys of E-flat major or C minor.\n*   This sonata is famously in **C minor**. The tonic chord is C minor (C-E♭-G).\n\n**2. Locate Measure 30:**\n*   The provided sheet music shows measure numbers. The second system of staves on the page begins with measure 28.\n*   Counting from there, the third measure in that system is measure 30. This measure is part of the circled area in the provided images.\n\n**3. Analyze the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   The measure features a pattern that alternates between two chords, each lasting for one beat.\n*   **Beats 1 and 3 (the strong beats):**\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays G octaves. The root of the chord is G.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays a 16th-note arpeggio consisting of the notes G, B-natural (♮), D, and F-sharp (♯).\n    *   **Combined Harmony:** The principal notes are G, B-natural, and D. This forms a **G major triad**. The F♯ is a coloristic, non-chord tone (an appoggiatura or added major seventh) that doesn't change the chord's fundamental function.\n*   **Beats 2 and 4 (the weak beats):**\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays C octaves. The root of the chord is C.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays a 16th-note arpeggio consisting of the notes G, C, and E-flat.\n    *   **Combined Harmony:** The notes are C, E♭, and G. This forms a **C minor triad**.\n\n**4. Determine the Roman Numerals:**\n*   We will analyze the harmony based on its relationship to the home key of C minor.\n*   **The chord on beats 1 and 3 is G major.**\n    *   The note G is the 5th degree of the C minor scale.\n    *   A major chord built on the 5th degree is the **Dominant** chord.\n    *   The B-natural is the leading tone of C minor (from the harmonic minor scale), which is characteristic of the dominant chord and creates a strong pull towards the tonic.\n    *   Therefore, the Roman numeral for the G major chord is **V**.\n*   **The chord on beats 2 and 4 is C minor.**\n    *   This is the tonic triad of the key.\n    *   Therefore, the Roman numeral for the C minor chord is **i**.\n\n**5. Synthesize the Analysis for the Entire Measure:**\n*   The harmonic progression within measure 30 is a rapid alternation: **V - i - V - i**.\n*   The question asks for \"the\" Roman numeral for measure 30. In such cases, the harmony on the downbeat (beat 1) is typically considered the defining harmony of the measure.\n*   The chord on the downbeat of measure 30 is the G major chord (V). This is also confirmed by the preceding measure (m. 29), which contains an F♯ diminished seventh chord (vii°7/V), a secondary dominant that resolves directly to the V chord at the beginning of measure 30.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe primary harmony presented in measure 30, appearing on the strong beats and at the beginning of the measure, is the dominant chord of C minor.\n\n<<<V>>>"
