    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the obverse (the left coin):** This side shows the bust of a monarch facing right. The text around the edge, though difficult to read, can be partially deciphered. Around the lower half, one can discern parts of \"LUD ... D.G.FR...REX\", which is a standard Latin inscription on French coins: \"LUDOVICUS DEI GRATIA FRANCIAE ET NAVARRAE REX\" (Louis, by the Grace of God, King of France and Navarre). The bust, with its distinct wig, is characteristic of King Louis XV.\n\n2.  **Examine the reverse (the right coin):** This side is the most crucial for identification.\n    *   The most legible word, located at the top, is \"COLONIES\". Following this word along the right edge, we can make out \"FRANÇOISES\". The full legend reads \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\", which translates to \"French Colonies\".\n    *   The central emblem consists of two intertwined, back-to-back letters \"L\", surmounted by a royal crown. This is the royal cipher of King Louis.\n    *   Below the cipher, there is a mint mark. Although indistinct, it appears to be the letter \"H\". On French coins of this era, the 'H' mint mark signifies the La Rochelle mint.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:** We have a coin issued under King Louis XV for general circulation in the French colonies. This type of coin is specifically known as a 9 Deniers, sometimes called a \"Sou Marqué\". These coins were minted from 1738 to 1758.\n\n4.  **Identify the specific colony:** The inscription \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" indicates the coin was not minted for a single, specific colony but for the French colonial empire. However, historical records show that this particular issue of 9 Deniers was intended primarily for the French territories in North America, which were collectively known as **New France** (Nouvelle-France). This vast territory included regions such as Canada (Quebec), Acadia, and Louisiana. Therefore, the coin originates from New France.\n\n<<<New France>>>"
