    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n\n1.  **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown in color. Its most prominent feature is the presence of numerous small, visible holes, known as vesicles. The texture is rough and appears lightweight. The overall grain size is very fine (aphanitic), meaning individual mineral crystals are not distinguishable with the naked eye.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates that the rock formed from lava that contained a lot of trapped gas bubbles. As the lava cooled and solidified quickly on the Earth's surface, these bubbles were preserved. This points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color often comes from the oxidation (rusting) of iron-rich minerals.\n3.  **Identification:** A highly vesicular, mafic to intermediate extrusive rock is called **scoria**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of many smaller, angular fragments (clasts) of various colors (white, grey, reddish) cemented together in a fine-grained, lighter-colored matrix.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The texture is clastic, meaning it's made of pieces of pre-existing rocks. Since the fragments are angular and appear to be of volcanic origin, the rock is likely pyroclastic. Pyroclastic rocks are formed from materials ejected during a volcanic eruption, which then become consolidated into a single rock mass.\n3.  **Identification:** A rock made of cemented, angular volcanic fragments is known as a **volcanic breccia**. If the fragments were primarily ash-sized, it would be called tuff. Given the visible, angular clasts, volcanic breccia is a fitting identification.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is very light grey or white. Like specimen H, it is highly vesicular, covered in small holes, giving it a frothy or spongy appearance. It appears to be very porous and lightweight.\n2.  **Interpretation:** This is another extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of gas-rich lava. The very light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica). Felsic lavas are more viscous, which allows them to trap gas more effectively, leading to this frothy texture.\n3.  **Identification:** A very lightweight, highly vesicular, felsic volcanic rock is called **pumice**. Pumice is often so porous that it can float on water.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals have different colors, including whitish/translucent (likely quartz), pinkish/white (likely feldspar), and dark specks (likely biotite or hornblende).\n2.  **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, allowing large crystals time to grow. This slow cooling happens deep beneath the Earth's surface. Therefore, this is an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. The mineral composition (quartz and feldspar being dominant) points to a felsic rock.\n3.  **Identification:** A coarse-grained, felsic intrusive igneous rock is called **granite**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
