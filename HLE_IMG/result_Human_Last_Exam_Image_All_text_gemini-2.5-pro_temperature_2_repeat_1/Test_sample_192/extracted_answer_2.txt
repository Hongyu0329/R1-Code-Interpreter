The XRD patterns correspond to the monoclinic phase of CuO (Tenorite). The indexing of the most prominent peaks is as follows:

| Approximate Peak Position (2θ, degrees) | Corresponding Miller Indices (h k l) |
|:---------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| ~32.5°                                  |                (110)                 |
| ~35.6°                                  |           (-111) and (002)           |
| ~38.7°                                  |           (111) and (200)            |
| ~48.7°                                  |               (-202)                 |
| ~53.5°                                  |                (020)                 |
| ~58.3°                                  |                (202)                 |

Note: The two most intense peaks around 35.6° and 38.7° are known to be composite peaks arising from multiple closely spaced crystallographic planes. The indices listed represent the main contributing reflections.
