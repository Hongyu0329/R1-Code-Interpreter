    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the musical piece from the provided sheet music.\n\n1.  **Initial Observations (Key, Tempo, Meter):**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has two flats (B♭ and E♭). The first measure clearly outlines a G minor chord in the left hand (G and D), and the melody revolves around notes of the G minor scale. Therefore, the key is G minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time (common time).\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate *Andante* tempo.\n\n2.  **Structural and Stylistic Analysis:**\n    *   **Introduction (Measures 1-2):** The piece begins quietly (*piano*) with a melancholic, descending melody in the right hand over simple broken chords in the left hand. This sets a somber, pensive mood.\n    *   **Dramatic Shift (Measure 3):** There is an abrupt and dramatic change. The dynamic shifts to *forte* (loud), and the right hand plays a rapid, ascending scale-like passage in octaves. This creates a powerful and virtuosic outburst.\n    *   **Main Body (Measures 4 onwards):** The character changes again to *mezzo-piano*. A new, agitated section begins, characterized by relentless sixteenth-note arpeggios in the right hand. The left hand provides a chordal and arpeggiated accompaniment. This continuous, flowing texture is typical of an étude (a study piece) designed to work on a specific technical challenge, in this case, arpeggios and endurance.\n    *   **Harmonic Language:** The harmony is rich and characteristically Romantic. It uses chromaticism (e.g., the C# and F# in measure 5) and explores different chordal sonorities, creating a sense of drama and emotional depth.\n    *   **Overall Impression:** The piece exhibits a wide dynamic range, virtuosic passagework, and strong emotional contrasts. These are hallmarks of the late Romantic period.\n\n3.  **Composer and Piece Identification:**\n    *   The combination of a G minor key, melancholic melodies, virtuosic outbursts, and technically demanding arpeggiated figures is highly characteristic of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n    *   While his Prelude in G minor (Op. 23, No. 5) is very famous, it has a different, more march-like opening theme.\n    *   This piece's structure, blending a lyrical melody with a virtuosic study-like section, points directly to his Études-Tableaux (\"study-pictures\").\n    *   By comparing the opening melody and subsequent passages with Rachmaninoff's works, this piece is identifiable as the **Étude-Tableau in G minor, Op. 33, No. 8**. The opening theme, the explosive octave run, and the following arpeggio section are unmistakable features of this specific étude.\n\n<<<Rachmaninoff - Étude-Tableau in G minor, Op. 33, No. 8>>>"
