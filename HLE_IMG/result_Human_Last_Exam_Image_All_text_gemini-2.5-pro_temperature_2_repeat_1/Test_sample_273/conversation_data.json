    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\nThe molecule has three chiral centers, which are the carbon atoms on the main chain bearing substituents with stereochemical indicators (wedges and dashes). Let's label them C2, C3, and C4 from left to right for this analysis. The official IUPAC numbering will be determined later, but this labeling is sufficient for assigning R/S to each center individually.\n\n**2. Analyze Chiral Center C2 (Leftmost)**\n*   **Substituents:** The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   -H (hydrogen atom, implied)\n    *   The rest of the molecule to the right (let's call it -R_chain)\n*   **Stereochemistry from Drawing:** The -OH group is shown with a dashed bond (pointing away from the viewer). The -CH3 group is also shown with a dashed bond (away). The bond to the R_chain is a simple line, which in this convention is in the plane of the page. For a tetrahedral carbon, if two groups are pointing away and one is in the plane, the fourth group (-H) must be pointing towards the viewer (wedged).\n*   **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Priority 1 (Oxygen's atomic number is higher than Carbon's).\n    2.  **-R_chain**: Priority 2 (-CH(Et)... This carbon is attached to other carbons).\n    3.  **-CH3**: Priority 3 (This carbon is attached only to hydrogens).\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4 (lowest atomic number).\n*   **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is wedged (pointing forward).\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 (-OH → -R_chain → -CH3). This path curves in a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing forward, we reverse the result. CCW becomes **R**.\n    *   So, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**3. Analyze Chiral Center C3 (Middle)**\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   The carbon chain to the left (-L_chain, which is -CH(OH)CH3)\n    *   The carbon chain to the right (-R_chain', which is -CH(CH3)CH2NH2)\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3)\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H, implied)\n*   **Stereochemistry from Drawing:** The ethyl group is wedged (forward). The bonds to the left and right chains are in the plane. Therefore, the implied -H must be dashed (away).\n*   **Assign CIP Priorities:**\n    1.  **-L_chain**: Priority 1 (Its connecting carbon is bonded to an O, a C, and an H).\n    2.  **-R_chain'**: Priority 2 (Its connecting carbon is bonded to two C's and an H. Oxygen in L_chain takes precedence).\n    3.  **-CH2CH3**: Priority 3 (Its connecting carbon is bonded to one C and two H's).\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4.\n*   **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is dashed (pointing away).\n    *   Trace the path 1 → 2 → 3 (-L_chain → -R_chain' → -CH2CH3). This path from left to right to up follows a clockwise (CW) direction.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is away, the configuration is as the direction indicates. CW means **R**.\n    *   So, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**4. Analyze Chiral Center C4 (Rightmost)**\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   The carbon chain to the left (-L_chain')\n    *   An aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H, implied)\n*   **Stereochemistry from Drawing:** The -CH2NH2 group is wedged (forward). The -CH3 group is dashed (away). The bond to the left chain (-L_chain') is in the plane. For a tetrahedral arrangement, the implied -H must also be in the plane.\n*   **Assign CIP Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: Priority 1 (The carbon is bonded to N, which has a higher atomic number than C).\n    2.  **-L_chain'**: Priority 2 (This carbon is bonded to other carbons).\n    3.  **-CH3**: Priority 3 (This carbon is bonded only to hydrogens).\n    4.  **-H**: Priority 4.\n*   **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. To simplify, we can use the \"swap\" method. Let's mentally swap the positions of the -H group (priority 4) and the -CH3 group (priority 3, which is dashed/away).\n    *   In the new, temporary arrangement, -H is dashed (away). The priorities of the other three groups are 1 (-CH2NH2, wedged), 2 (-L_chain', plane), and 3 (-CH3, now in the plane where H was).\n    *   Trace the path 1 → 2 → 3 (-CH2NH2 → -L_chain' → -CH3). This path traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction.\n    *   With the lowest priority group in the back, a CCW path indicates an S configuration.\n    *   However, this 'S' is for the swapped molecule. Since we performed one swap, the original molecule must have the opposite configuration. The opposite of S is **R**.\n    *   So, the configuration at C4 is **R**.\n\n**5. IUPAC Naming and Final Configuration**\nTo provide the standard name, we determine the principal functional group and the longest carbon chain. The alcohol group (-OH) has priority over the amine group (-NH2). The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a pentane chain. Numbering to give the -OH the lowest number makes it a pentan-2-ol. The correct IUPAC name for the molecule is (2R,3R,4R)-3-(2-amino-1-methylethyl)pentan-2-ol, but this is overly complex. A more common naming convention treats it as a pentanamine, which gives the name (2R,3R,4R)-3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine.\nRegardless of the naming convention, the absolute configurations for the chiral centers, from left to right as drawn, are all R. Following the second IUPAC name (pentanamine derivative), the carbons are numbered from right to left, making the chiral centers C2, C3, and C4. Our analysis (from left to right) corresponds to C4, C3, and C2 in IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   Leftmost center (our C2, IUPAC C4) is **R**.\n*   Middle center (our C3, IUPAC C3) is **R**.\n*   Rightmost center (our C4, IUPAC C2) is **R**.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
