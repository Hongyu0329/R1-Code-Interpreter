    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks.\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n*   **Artwork 1 (Top-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This painting depicts four fish with human-like expressions in a whimsical, cartoonish style. The lines are simple and expressive, and light color washes are used. This distinctive style, known as \"manhua\" (漫画), is the signature of **Feng Zikai (丰子恺)**, a celebrated modern Chinese artist, writer, and translator known for his profound yet simple sketches of life.\n    *   **Author:** Feng Zikai\n\n*   **Artwork 2 (Top-Middle):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The brushwork is powerful and vigorous, with strong contrasts in ink tones. The composition and the way the artist combines calligraphic lines with the painted forms are characteristic of the Shanghai School leader **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**. He was a master of the \"three perfections\" (painting, calligraphy, and seal carving), and his style is easily recognizable.\n    *   **Author:** Wu Changshuo\n\n*   **Artwork 3 (Top-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil portrait of a woman from the Tajik ethnic group. The meticulous detail, classical composition, and masterful use of light and color are hallmarks of the Chinese academic realism movement. This is one of the most famous works of contemporary Chinese oil painting, titled \"Tajik Bride\" (塔吉克新娘), by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n    *   **Author:** Jin Shangyi\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n*   **Artwork 4 (Middle-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly expressive cursive script (草书, cǎoshū). The characters are elongated, with tight centers and sprawling outer strokes, creating a unique rhythm. This is the unmistakable style of **Huang Tingjian (黄庭坚)**, one of the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty. The work shown is a famous piece of his, the \"Ju Xiang Tie\" (《菊香帖》).\n    *   **Author:** Huang Tingjian\n\n*   **Artwork 5 (Middle-Center):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This painting is a work of modern art that blends abstract forms with landscape elements. The composition featuring two colored circles (representing the sun and moon) above a minimalist, linear landscape is a signature motif of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He was a master at synthesizing Western modernism with the spirit of traditional Chinese ink painting.\n    *   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n*   **Artwork 6 (Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a perfectly executed regular script (楷书, kǎishū). The style is elegant, fluid, and well-structured, reflecting a deep study of the Jin and Tang dynasty masters. This combination of grace and scholarly refinement is the hallmark of **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**, the leading calligrapher and painter of the Yuan Dynasty. This is his famous colophon on a copy of Wang Xizhi's work.\n    *   **Author:** Zhao Mengfu\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n*   **Artwork 7 (Bottom-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a piece of calligraphy in a dynamic and idiosyncratic running-cursive script (行草书, xíngcǎoshū). The characters are slanted, and the brushwork is full of energy, speed, and textural variation. This highly personal and energetic style is the signature of **Mi Fu (米芾)**, another of the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty. This is from his renowned masterpiece, the \"Shu Su Tie\" (《蜀素帖》).\n    *   **Author:** Mi Fu\n\n*   **Artwork 8 (Bottom-Middle):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another example of modern Chinese realist oil painting. The portrait of a young woman is rendered with exceptional technical skill, creating a quiet, contemplative, and almost poetic mood. This style, often referred to as Neoclassicism, is the signature of **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**. This specific painting, often known as \"Still Water, Deep Flow\" (北方姑娘), is one of his most iconic works.\n    *   **Author:** Yang Feiyun\n\n*   **Artwork 9 (Bottom-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an ink and color painting of a dancing woman, likely of the Uyghur ethnicity. The brushwork is fast, fluid, and full of life, masterfully capturing movement and character. The signature on the left explicitly reads \"黃胄作\" (Made by Huang Zhou). **Huang Zhou (黄胄)** was a modern master renowned for his depictions of China's ethnic minorities, characterized by his dynamic and expressive ink line technique.\n    *   **Author:** Huang Zhou\n\nFrom left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\n1. Feng Zikai\n2. Wu Changshuo\n3. Jin Shangyi\n4. Huang Tingjian\n5. Wu Guanzhong\n6. Zhao Mengfu\n7. Mi Fu\n8. Yang Feiyun\n9.
