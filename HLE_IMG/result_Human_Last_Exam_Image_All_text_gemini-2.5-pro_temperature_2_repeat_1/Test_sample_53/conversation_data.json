    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from a Greek red-figure vase. It depicts a dramatic scene involving a chariot.\n    *   **Chariot and Occupants:** A chariot is moving towards the left, drawn by at least one white horse (partially visible). In the chariot are two figures. The driver, on the left, wears an ornate, patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap with the top pulled forward), indicating an Eastern or \"exotic\" origin. They are holding the reins. Next to the driver is another figure, wrapped in drapery.\n    *   **Falling Figure:** A muscular, nude male figure is shown falling backwards out of the chariot, his head towards the ground. His body is contorted, indicating a violent or fatal event.\n    *   **Winged Figure:** Above the chariot, a large winged figure is flying. This is likely a divine being, such as Nike (Victory) or Eros (Love). Given the context of a race or contest, Nike is a strong possibility.\n    *   **Decorative Elements:** The vase has typical Greek decorative motifs, such as the wave pattern at the bottom and the palmette designs on the right.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological story.**\n    The combination of a chariot race, a driver in a Phrygian cap, a female passenger, and a falling man points to a specific myth: the race of Pelops and Oenomaus.\n    *   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would race any suitor for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia. He had divine horses and had killed thirteen previous suitors. Pelops, a prince from Lydia or Phrygia (hence the Phrygian cap in art), challenged him. To win, Pelops (with Hippodamia's help) bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the lynchpins of Oenomaus's chariot with ones made of wax. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels flew off Oenomaus's chariot, and the king was thrown to his death.\n    *   **Mapping the Myth to the Image:**\n        *   **Driver:** This is Pelops, the victorious suitor, identified by his Phrygian cap.\n        *   **Passenger:** This is Hippodamia, the prize of the race, whom Pelops is now carrying off.\n        *   **Falling Figure:** This is King Oenomaus, being killed as his chariot crashes. The artist has conflated the two chariots into one scene for narrative economy, showing Oenomaus falling near the chariot of the victor.\n        *   **Winged Figure:** This is Nike, the goddess of Victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n\n*   **Step 3: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" In this depiction, the figure shown dramatically leaving the chariot is the one falling to his death. Based on the identification of the myth, this figure is King Oenomaus.\n\n*   **Summary of Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Identify the art style:** Greek red-figure vase painting.\n    2.  **Note key iconographic details:** Phrygian cap, chariot, falling male figure, winged goddess.\n    3.  **Recognize that vase painters often compress narratives:** Oenomaus is shown falling from his own wrecked chariot, but the artist depicts him next to Pelops's chariot to link the cause (Pelops's victory) and effect (Oenomaus's death) in a single frame.\n    4.  **Correctly identify all figures:** The driver is Pelops, the passenger is Hippodamia, the falling man is Oenomaus, and the winged figure is Nike.\n    5.  **Address the ambiguity of \"leaving\":** The question most plausibly refers to the most dramatic action of departure, which is the man falling out of the vehicle, rather than the driver who is simply departing from a location.\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The figure leaving (falling from) the chariot is Oenomaus.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
