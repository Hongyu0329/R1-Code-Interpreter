**Product A: N-acetylpyrrolidine**
A five-membered saturated ring containing a nitrogen atom. An acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) is attached to the nitrogen atom.

**Product B: Tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-5,7-dione**
A bicyclic compound consisting of a five-membered maleimide ring (containing a C=C double bond and two C=O groups) fused to a five-membered pyrrolidine ring. The rings are fused at the nitrogen atom and an adjacent carbon, sharing the N-C bond of the pyrrolidine ring.

**Product C: 1,2-diacetylpyrrolidine**
A five-membered saturated ring containing a nitrogen atom (pyrrolidine). An acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) is attached to the nitrogen atom (position 1), and another acetyl group is attached to the adjacent carbon atom (position 2).
