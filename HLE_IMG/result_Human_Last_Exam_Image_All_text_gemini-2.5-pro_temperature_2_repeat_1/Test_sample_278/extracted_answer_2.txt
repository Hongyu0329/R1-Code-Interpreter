The image shows a tissue sample stained with a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The microorganism observed is a dimorphic fungus, most characteristically representing a **_Candida_** species. The morphology consists of both **budding yeast cells** (small, oval structures) and **pseudohyphae** (chains of elongated cells with constrictions at the septa).
