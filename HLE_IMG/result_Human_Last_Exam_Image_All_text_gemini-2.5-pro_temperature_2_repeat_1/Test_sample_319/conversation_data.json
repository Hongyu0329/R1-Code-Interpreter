    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots representing a sound.\n    *   The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of a sound over time. It initially shows a single, strong horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of constant frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted by a vertical smudge, which represents a short burst of noise containing a wide range of frequencies. After the noise burst, the horizontal line(s) representing a tone continues.\n    *   The bottom plot is a waveform, showing the amplitude of the sound over time. It starts as a clean sine wave (a pure tone). This is followed by a chaotic, complex waveform (the noise). Finally, it settles into another periodic, but more complex, wave pattern.\n    *   These two plots together depict a specific acoustic stimulus: a tone, followed by an interrupting noise, followed by the tone again. This is a classic setup for demonstrating an auditory illusion.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question Text:** The text provides several key clues to identify the phenomenon.\n    *   It is an **illusion**. This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n    *   It is similar to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be interpreted as a 3D cube in two different orientations. Our brain fills in the depth information, and our perception can flip between the two possibilities. This clue suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain \"filling in\" missing information or resolving ambiguity to create a coherent perception.\n    *   It reveals a **common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability**. This implies it's a fundamental part of how our auditory system works to make sense of the world, often without us noticing.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   When a listener hears the sound depicted in the image (tone-noise-tone), the most common perception is not of a tone that stops and restarts. Instead, the brain perceives the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* through the burst of noise.\n    *   The noise is perceived as masking the continuous underlying tone. The brain \"restores\" or \"fills in\" the gap where the tone was physically absent.\n    *   This fits the description of an \"illusion\" because we hear a continuous tone that wasn't physically present during the noise.\n    *   It fits the Necker Cube analogy because the brain resolves the ambiguity of the interruption (did the sound stop, or was it just covered up?) in favor of continuity, creating a complete perceptual object (a continuous tone).\n    *   It is indeed a common, unconscious ability. In everyday life, sounds like speech or music are often momentarily obscured by other noises (a cough, a door slam). Our brain automatically fills in these gaps, allowing us to perceive a coherent and continuous auditory stream.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:** This well-documented psychoacoustic effect is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Perceptual Restoration of Sound**. It demonstrates the brain's tendency to assume that existing sounds will continue through periods of interruption, as long as the interruption is plausibly able to mask the original sound.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion"
