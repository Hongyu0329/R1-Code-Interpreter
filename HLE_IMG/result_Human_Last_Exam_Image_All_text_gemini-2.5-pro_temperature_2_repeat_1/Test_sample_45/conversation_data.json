    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how an object or pattern appears unchanged after being rotated around a central point by a certain angle. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry, denoted by *n*, is the number of times the pattern maps onto itself during a full 360° rotation. An *n*-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern is invariant under rotations of 360°/*n*. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°. Our goal is to find the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the given tiling.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation in the Tiling**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we must identify points within the pattern around which a rotation can be performed. We will look at the centers of individual tiles and the vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n**Step 3: Test for Different Orders of Rotational Symmetry**\nWe will systematically check for the most common types of rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **2-fold Symmetry (180° rotation):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Let's examine the center of one of the light yellow squares.\n    *   **Analysis:** A square is bordered by two blue heptagons and two light-yellow/tan pentagons on opposite sides. If we rotate the entire pattern by 180° around the center of this square, the square itself returns to its original orientation. The blue heptagon on top swaps places with the one on the bottom, and the tan pentagon on the left swaps places with the one on the right. Since these swapped pairs are identical, the overall pattern appears unchanged.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling has points of 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **4-fold Symmetry (90° rotation):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The center of a yellow square is the most likely candidate.\n    *   **Analysis:** While the square tile itself has 4-fold symmetry, its surroundings do not. A 90° rotation would move a blue heptagon into the position currently occupied by a tan pentagon. Since these shapes are different, the pattern is not invariant under a 90° rotation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling does not have 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **3-fold and 6-fold Symmetry (120° and 60° rotations):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** These symmetries require points where 3 or 6 identical elements meet in a highly symmetrical arrangement.\n    *   **Analysis:** Scanning the pattern, we find no points where tiles are arranged with 3-fold or 6-fold symmetry. For instance, the vertices where three blue heptagons meet do not have the necessary 120° angles or symmetric arrangement of further tiles.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling does not have 3-fold or 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **5-fold Symmetry (72° rotation):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Let's inspect the prominent star-like structures.\n    *   **Analysis:** At the center of these structures, we can see a single point (vertex) where the corners of five identical light-yellow/tan pentagons meet. Let's use this vertex as our center of rotation.\n        1.  If we rotate the pattern by 360°/5 = 72°, each of the five central pentagons moves perfectly into the position of its neighbor.\n        2.  Looking at the next layer of tiles, we see a ring of five orange rhombuses. A 72° rotation also moves each rhombus into the position of the next one.\n        3.  The next layer contains five yellow squares, which also perfectly align with their neighbors after a 72° rotation. The blue heptagons located between the squares also map onto each other.\n        4.  Since the arrangement of all surrounding tiles remains unchanged after a 72° rotation, the pattern has 5-fold rotational symmetry around these central points.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling possesses points with 2-fold symmetry and points with 5-fold symmetry. When asked to identify \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of symmetry found. In this case, the highest order is 5. The presence of 5-fold symmetry is a key characteristic of aperiodic tilings, often known as Penrose tilings, to which this pattern belongs.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe tiling has 5-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<5-fold>>>"
