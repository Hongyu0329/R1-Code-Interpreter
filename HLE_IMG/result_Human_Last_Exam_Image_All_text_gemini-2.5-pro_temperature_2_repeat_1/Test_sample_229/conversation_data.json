    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musical Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation & Notation:** The music is written on a single staff with a treble clef. This is typical for a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the melody and chord changes for a tune.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, indicating four beats per measure.\n    *   **Chord Symbols:** The presence of chord symbols written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-) is a strong indicator that the music is intended for a genre that involves improvisation, such as jazz or pop. The chords themselves form a progression that is common in jazz.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is characterized by syncopation (notes that fall off the main beat) and arpeggiated figures that outline the chords. There are also chromatic passing tones (like the C# in measure 7 and the G# in measure 3), which add jazzy \"color\" to the melodic line. This rhythmic and melodic content is typical of swing-era jazz.\n    *   **Structure:** The music uses standard musical navigation signs, including repeat signs, a \"To Coda\" marking (implying a Da Segno or D.S. instruction), and a Coda section. This structured but flexible form is very common in jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Determining the Musical Style:**\n    *   Based on the combination of a swing feel (implied by the syncopated rhythms), chord-based improvisation, and specific melodic phrasing, the musical style is clearly **Jazz**.\n    *   More specifically, the upbeat tempo, the particular swing feel, and the virtuosic, arpeggio-heavy melodic lines are hallmarks of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as *Jazz Manouche*). This style was pioneered in the 1930s.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Song Title:**\n    *   The melody and chord progression are distinctive. By transcribing or playing the first few measures, the tune can be identified. The melody opens with a memorable phrase over a C major chord, followed by an E7 chord, then an F major chord.\n    *   This specific melody and chord progression belong to the well-known Gypsy Jazz standard **\"Douce Ambiance\"**. The title is French for \"Sweet Atmosphere.\"\n\n4.  **Determining the Country of Origin:**\n    *   \"Douce Ambiance\" was composed by the legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n    *   Django Reinhardt, along with the violinist St√©phane Grappelli and their group the Quintette du Hot Club de France, created and popularized the Gypsy Jazz style in Paris during the 1930s.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin for both the song and the genre is **France**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the notation, harmony, rhythm, and historical context, we can confidently identify the details of the song.\n\n*   **Title:** Douce Ambiance\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz / Jazz Manouche\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<Title: Douce Ambiance\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: France>>>"
