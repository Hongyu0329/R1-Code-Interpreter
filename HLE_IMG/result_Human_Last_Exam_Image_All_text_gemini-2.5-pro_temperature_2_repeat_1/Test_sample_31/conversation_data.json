    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\n\nThe first and most critical step is to identify which knot is represented by the given diagram. This can be done by analyzing its features and comparing it to a standard knot table or atlas.\n\n1.  **Counting Crossings:** We carefully count the number of crossings in the diagram. There are four crossings in the central vertical column, two on the left side, and two on the right side, for a total of 8 crossings.\n2.  **Observing properties:** The knot is non-alternating. If we trace the knot's path, we don't pass over and under crossings in a strictly alternating sequence. For example, in the central part, we can find two consecutive \"over\" crossings (or \"under\" depending on the strand chosen).\n3.  **Consulting a Knot Atlas:** By comparing this 8-crossing, non-alternating knot diagram with standard knot tables (like the Rolfsen or Alexander-Briggs-Reidemeister tables), we can identify it. The diagram provided is the canonical representation of the knot denoted **8₁₉** (in Alexander-Briggs notation). This knot is sometimes called the \"true lover's knot\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant (s-invariant)**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from a version of Khovanov homology.\n*   It is an even integer.\n*   It provides a lower bound for the slice genus of the knot: `|s(K)| ≤ 2g₄(K)`.\n*   For a mirror image knot `-K`, we have `s(-K) = -s(K)`.\n\nDirectly computing the s-invariant from its definition is a very complex process, especially for a knot with 8 crossings. Therefore, we should look for specific properties of the knot 8₁₉ that simplify the calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Utilize Special Properties of the Knot 8₁₉**\n\nThe knot 8₁₉ has a crucial property: it is a **quasi-alternating knot**. It is, in fact, the first example of a non-alternating knot that is quasi-alternating.\n\nFor the class of quasi-alternating knots, a major theorem by Manolescu and Ozsváth establishes a simple relationship between the Rasmussen invariant and the classical knot signature (`σ(K)`):\n\n**`s(K) = 2σ(K)`**\n\nThis theorem reduces the problem of finding the s-invariant to the simpler problem of finding the knot signature.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Signature of the Knot 8₁₉**\n\nThe signature `σ(K)` is another well-known knot invariant. While its calculation can be involved (usually requiring a Seifert matrix), its values for common knots are widely tabulated in knot theory literature and databases.\n\n1.  **Consulting Knot Tables:** We look up the knot 8₁₉ in a reliable source, such as the Knot Atlas, KnotInfo database, or the appendix of a knot theory textbook (e.g., Lickorish's \"An Introduction to Knot Theory\").\n2.  **Retrieve the Value:** These sources consistently list the signature of the knot 8₁₉ as:\n    **`σ(8₁₉) = -2`**\n\n*A point of care*: The signature, like the s-invariant, depends on the knot's chirality (its \"handedness\"). The diagram shown is the standard one for the knot named 8₁₉, and the value `σ = -2` corresponds to this standard representation. For its mirror image, the signature would be +2. We assume the standard convention.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nNow we have all the necessary components:\n1.  The knot is 8₁₉.\n2.  8₁₉ is quasi-alternating.\n3.  For quasi-alternating knots, `s(K) = 2σ(K)`.\n4.  The signature is `σ(8₁₉) = -2`.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n`s(8₁₉) = 2 * σ(8₁₉) = 2 * (-2) = -4`\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot 8₁₉, as depicted in the image, is -4.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Knot Identification:** Correctly identifying the knot as 8₁₉ from its diagram is paramount.\n2.  **Using the Correct Formula:** The relation `s(K) = 2σ(K)` is not universal. Its use is justified because 8₁₉ is known to be a quasi-alternating knot.\n3.  **Relying on Tabled Values:** The signature `σ = -2` is taken from established tables, which is a standard and reliable method for this type of problem.\n4.  **Chirality:** The signs of `s(K)` and `σ(K)` depend on the specific choice of the knot versus its mirror image. We adhere to the standard convention where the given diagram corresponds to the listed invariants.\n\nThe analysis robustly leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<-4>>>"
