    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:**\n    *   **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic ring, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), an alkene with a four-membered ring.\n    *   **Reaction Condition:** The reaction is promoted by light (hv), indicating a photochemical process. Pericyclic reactions have specific selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) for photochemical conditions.\n    *   **Product:** The product is a complex tricyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀H₄F₆, featuring three fused four-membered rings in a linear fashion (a ladderane-type structure). Let's denote the skeleton as tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]decane derivative.\n    *   **Stoichiometry Issue:** Note that the reactants have a total formula of C₁₀H₆F₆, while the product shown is C₁₀H₄F₆. This implies the loss of two hydrogen atoms (H₂). The loss of H₂ is typically an oxidative process, not a pericyclic reaction. In the context of a problem focusing solely on pericyclic reactions, this discrepancy in the atom count is often an error or a simplification in the problem statement. We will focus on the formation of the carbon skeleton via pericyclic steps, assuming a C₁₀H₆F₆ product is formed first.\n\n2.  **Identify the Pericyclic Reactions:**\n    The question states that *two* photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved. We need to propose a plausible mechanism consisting of two such steps that transforms the reactants into the product's carbon skeleton. Pericyclic reactions include cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n3.  **Propose a Mechanistic Pathway (Pathway Analysis):**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n        *   The first step is a cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. An excited state of hexafluorobenzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene.\n        *   The most straightforward cycloaddition under photochemical conditions is a [2+2] cycloaddition. This involves 2 π-electrons from one double bond of the benzene ring and 2 π-electrons from the cyclobutene double bond.\n        *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n        *   This reaction forms a four-membered ring fused to the six-membered ring, creating a bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene derivative. Critically, the original benzene ring becomes a conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety within this new structure.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction**\n        *   The intermediate formed in Step 1 contains a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C) within its six-membered ring. This is a 4π-electron system.\n        *   Under continued irradiation (photochemical conditions), this conjugated diene can undergo an electrocyclic reaction.\n        *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is allowed photochemically if it proceeds via a conrotatory ring closure.\n        *   This ring closure forms a new sigma bond between the ends of the diene system, creating a new four-membered ring.\n        *   The overall skeleton transforms from a bicyclo[4.2.0] system to a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵] system, which matches the linear fusion of three four-membered rings seen in the final product.\n\n4.  **Summary of Reaction Types:**\n    *   The first reaction is an **intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition**.\n    *   The second reaction is an **intramolecular 4π photochemical electrocyclic reaction** (or simply an **electrocyclic reaction**).\n\n5.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The reaction is photochemical (`hv`), so photochemical selection rules apply.\n    *   The stoichiometry of the drawn product (C₁₀H₄F₆) does not match the reactants (C₁₀H₆F₆). This should be considered a likely error in the problem diagram and does not affect the identification of the pericyclic steps responsible for forming the carbon skeleton.\n    *   Other photochemical pathways for benzene (like isomerization to Dewar benzene or meta-photocycloaddition) are known, but the sequence of [2+2] cycloaddition followed by electrocyclization provides the most direct and elegant explanation for the specific product skeleton shown.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n2.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (a 4π ring closure) of the resulting intermediate.\n\nThe kinds of pericyclic reactions involved are a **cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
