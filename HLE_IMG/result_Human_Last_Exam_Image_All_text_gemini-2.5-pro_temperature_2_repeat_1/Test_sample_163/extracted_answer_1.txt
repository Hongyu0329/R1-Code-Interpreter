The two major products, A and B, are the two regioisomers formed by the addition of a benzoyloxy group (-OCOC₆H₅) and a tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) across the double bond of styrene.

**Compound A:** 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate
**Structure A:**
```
      O-C(=O)-C₆H₅
      |
C₆H₅ -CH -CH₂-O-C(CH₃)₃
```

**Compound B:** 2-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate
**Structure B:**
```
      O-C(CH₃)₃
      |
C₆H₅ -CH -CH₂-O-C(=O)-C₆H₅
```
Both structures are isomers with the chemical formula C₁₉H₂₂O₃.
