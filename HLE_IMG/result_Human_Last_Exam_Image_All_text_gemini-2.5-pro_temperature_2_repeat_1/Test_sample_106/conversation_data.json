    "This problem requires a detailed analysis of a complex organic reaction mechanism, specifically a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement cascade in a pentacyclic triterpenoid system.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** The starting material is a pentacyclic alcohol. It reacts with catalytic acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 °C). The products are an alkene and water. This is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction coupled with a skeletal rearrangement. The prompt explicitly mentions \"a number of [1,2] shifts\", confirming a carbocation cascade mechanism.\n\n2.  **Initiation:** The reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid catalyst. The oxygen's lone pair attacks a proton (H⁺) from HCl.\n    R-OH + H⁺ ⇌ R-OH₂⁺\n\n3.  **Carbocation Formation:** The protonated hydroxyl group is an excellent leaving group (water, H₂O). It departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the carbon atom it was attached to (let's use standard triterpenoid numbering, this is C3).\n    R-OH₂⁺ → R⁺ (at C3) + H₂O\n\n4.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade (The \"Backbone Rearrangement\"):** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of [1,2]-hydride (H⁻) and [1,2]-methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts. The goal of this cascade is to move the positive charge across the molecule to a position where a stable alkene can be formed. The product has a double bond between C12 and C13, so the cascade must terminate with the carbocation at C13. The sequence of carbocation positions is as follows:\n    C3⁺ → C4⁺ → C5⁺ → C10⁺ → C9⁺ → C8⁺ → C14⁺ → C13⁺\n\n5.  **Tracking the Migrating Groups:** Let's identify which group shifts at each step to facilitate the migration of the positive charge. We examine the substituents on the adjacent carbon from which the shift originates.\n    *   **C3⁺ → C4⁺:** A methyl group (CH₃) migrates from C4 to C3.\n    *   **C4⁺ → C5⁺:** The hydrogen atom (H) migrates from C5 to C4.\n    *   **C5⁺ → C10⁺:** The methyl group (CH₃) migrates from C10 to C5.\n    *   **C10⁺ → C9⁺:** The hydrogen atom (H) migrates from C9 to C10.\n    *   **C9⁺ → C8⁺:** The methyl group (CH₃) migrates from C8 to C9.\n    *   **C8⁺ → C14⁺:** The methyl group (CH₃) migrates from C14 to C8.\n    *   **C14⁺ → C13⁺:** The hydrogen atom (H) migrates from C13 to C14.\n\n6.  **Termination (Elimination):** The cascade stops with the carbocation at C13. To form the final stable alkene product, a proton (H⁺) is eliminated from an adjacent carbon. To form the C12=C13 double bond shown in the product, a proton is removed from C12.\n\n7.  **Determining the Substituents at the Labeled Positions:** Now we need to determine what substituent (H or CH₃) is left at each labeled carbon atom (C4, C10, C9, C8, and C14) after the rearrangement.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 initially has two CH₃ groups. One CH₃ group migrates to C3. C4 then receives an H from C5. Therefore, the final substituents on C4 are one CH₃ and one H. The diagram labels position 1 as a substituent, which is clearly a methyl group.\n        **1 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 2 (on C10):** C10 initially has a CH₃ group, which migrates to C5. C10 then receives an H from C9. Therefore, the final substituent on C10 is a hydrogen atom.\n        **2 = H**\n\n    *   **Position 3 (on C9):** C9 initially has an H atom, which migrates to C10. C9 then receives a CH₃ group from C8. Therefore, the final substituent on C9 is a methyl group.\n        **3 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 4 (on C8):** C8 initially has a CH₃ group, which migrates to C9. C8 then receives a CH₃ group from C14. Therefore, the final substituent on C8 is a methyl group.\n        **4 = CH₃**\n\n    *   **Position 5 (on C14):** C14 initially has a CH₃ group, which migrates to C8. C14 then receives an H from C13. Therefore, the final substituent on C14 is a hydrogen atom.\n        **5 = H**\n\n**Summary of Final Answer:**\nCombining our step-by-step analysis for each position:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
