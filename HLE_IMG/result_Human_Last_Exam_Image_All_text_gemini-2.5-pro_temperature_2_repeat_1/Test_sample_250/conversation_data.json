    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).\n*   The first chord is F minor (indicated as F-) and the piece seems to resolve to F, confirming the key is F minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, indicated by the 'C' symbol for common time.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the Melody (First Few Bars)**\n*   The melody in the first measure consists of four quarter notes: C, F, E♭, D.\n*   The melody in the second measure consists of a half note C, a quarter note B♭, and a quarter note A♭.\n*   This melodic phrase, especially the opening four notes (the 5th, root, flat 7th, and 6th of F minor), is a recognizable motif in the jazz repertoire.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The chord progression is a critical identifier for jazz standards. Let's list the chords for the first eight bars (the \"A\" section):\n    *   Bar 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Bar 2: E-7♭5 (E half-diminished 7th)\n    *   Bar 3: E♭-6 (E-flat minor 6th), followed by D♭maj7 (D-flat major 7th)\n    *   Bar 4: G7\n    *   Bar 5: C7\n    *   Bar 6: F- (F minor)\n    *   Bar 7: C7 (with a first ending marking)\n    *   Bar 8: C7 (with a second ending marking, which leads to the bridge or a repeat)\n*   This specific progression, especially the chromatic descent of minor-type chords from the tonic (Fm → Eø7 → E♭m6), is highly distinctive.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Tune**\n*   Based on the melody and the unique chord progression, the piece is identifiable as the bebop standard \"Half Nelson\".\n*   \"Half Nelson\" is known as a \"contrafact\"—a new melody written over the harmony of an existing song. In this case, the underlying structure is loosely based on Tadd Dameron's tune \"Lady Bird,\" but the harmony has been significantly re-worked and made more complex.\n*   The composer of \"Half Nelson\" is the legendary trumpeter and bandleader Miles Davis.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Key:** Correctly identified as F minor.\n*   **Melody:** The opening melodic phrase is a key clue and matches \"Half Nelson.\"\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression is the most definitive evidence, as the changes are unique to this composition.\n*   **Composer:** It is important to distinguish between the composer of the original tune (\"Lady Bird\" by Tadd Dameron) and the composer of this specific contrafact (\"Half Nelson\" by Miles Davis). The sheet music represents the latter.\n*   **Form:** The AABA structure is typical for this era of jazz standards, and the provided music sheet follows this form.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of the key, melody, and distinctive harmonic progression confirms that the jazz standard is \"Half Nelson,\" composed by Miles Davis.\n\n<<<Title: Half Nelson, Composer: Miles Davis>>>"
