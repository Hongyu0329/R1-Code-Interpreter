The structures of the three products are determined by analyzing the reaction cascade.

*   **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** It is a mesoionic betaine, which is a fused tricyclic 1,3-dipole formed from the starting material and acetic anhydride, with the elimination of acetic acid.

*   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** It is formed from a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between the dipole **C** and methyl propiolate, followed by the elimination of carbon dioxide (CO₂).

*   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** It is formed via a competing [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between the dipole **C** and methyl propiolate, which after rearrangement and fragmentation, eliminates a molecule of methyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₃).

Based on this analysis, the structures are:
**Product A:**
A tetracyclic product containing the fused pyrrolidine-pyrroline skeleton, with a newly formed five-membered ring from the cycloaddition holding the `-CH=C(COOCH₃)-` fragment. Its structure would be a substituted dihydropyrrolizine fused to another heterocyclic system.

**Product B:**
A heavily rearranged, highly unsaturated (aromatic-like) tetracyclic system containing two nitrogen atoms, consistent with its molecular formula having a high degree of unsaturation. An example of a plausible structure is a substituted derivative of a dipyrrolo[1,2-a:2',1'-c]quinoxaline.

**Product C:**
A fused tricyclic mesoionic betaine. This can be described as a substituted hexahydrodipyrrolo[1,2-d:2',1'-f][1,4]oxazinyliumolate.
