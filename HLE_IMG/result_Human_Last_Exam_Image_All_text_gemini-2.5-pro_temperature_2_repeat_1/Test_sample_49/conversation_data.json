    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Goal**\nThe given circuit is a resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder network. The component configuration, with a capacitor `C` connected from a node (`a_0`) to ground, suggests a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency of such a filter is the frequency at which the circuit's response has dropped to -3 dB of its passband level. For a first-order RC filter, this occurs when the magnitude of the capacitive reactance equals the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency is given by $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$, and the cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$.\nOur primary task is to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor `C` at terminals ($a_0$, $b_0$).\n\n**2. Calculating the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we perform two steps:\n1.  Remove the capacitor `C`.\n2.  Deactivate the independent input source `IN`. Since `IN` is a voltage source, we replace it with a short circuit, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground. Node $b_0$ is already ground.\n3.  Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder**\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is an infinite resistive ladder. We can simplify this infinite structure by finding the equivalent resistance of the repeating sections.\n\nLet's define $R_L$ as the equivalent resistance of the infinite part of the ladder looking upwards from any pair of nodes $(c_k, d_k)$ for $k \\geq 1$. This resistance is measured between the two nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$.\n\nDue to the ladder's infinite and repetitive nature, the resistance $R_L$ looking up from $(c_k, d_k)$ is the same as the resistance looking up from $(c_{k+1}, d_{k+1})$.\n\nA single section of the ladder can be analyzed to find a recursive relationship for $R_L$. The resistance between nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ is the horizontal resistor `r` between them, in parallel with the path \"around\" through the next section (section k+1). The resistance of this \"around\" path is the sum of the vertical resistor `r` from $c_k$ to $c_{k+1}$, the equivalent resistance $R_L$ between $c_{k+1}$ and $d_{k+1}$, and the vertical resistor `r` from $d_{k+1}$ to $d_k$.\n\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n$R_L = r \\parallel (r + R_L + r) = r \\parallel (2r + R_L)$\n\n**4. Solving for $R_L$**\nWe can now solve the equation for $R_L$:\n$R_L = \\frac{r(2r + R_L)}{r + (2r + R_L)} = \\frac{2r^2 + r R_L}{3r + R_L}$\n$R_L(3r + R_L) = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n$3r R_L + R_L^2 = 2r^2 + r R_L$\n$R_L^2 + 2r R_L - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $R_L$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$R_L = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}r}{2}$\n$R_L = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n$R_L = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**5. Calculating $R_{th}$ for the Full Circuit**\nNow we can simplify the circuit for $R_{th}$ by replacing the entire infinite ladder above nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ with the single equivalent resistor $R_L$ connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe circuit for $R_{th}$ (resistance from $a_0$ to ground, which is $c_0$) is now a simple series circuit:\n- The resistor `r` between $a_0$ and $d_1$.\n- The equivalent resistance between $d_1$ and $c_1$. This is the horizontal resistor `r` in parallel with $R_L$. Let's call this $R_{eq1}$.\n- The resistor `r` between $c_1$ and $c_0$ (ground).\n\nThese three parts are in series. Therefore:\n$R_{th} = r + (r \\parallel R_L) + r = 2r + (r \\parallel R_L)$\n\nFirst, let's calculate $r \\parallel R_L$:\n$r \\parallel R_L = \\frac{r \\cdot R_L}{r + R_L} = \\frac{r \\cdot r(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{r + r(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\frac{r^2(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{r(1+\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\frac{r(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}} = r(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$\n\nNow substitute this into the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = 2r + r(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = r(2 + 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = r(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$\n\nThis expression for $R_{th}$ can be written with a rationalized denominator:\n$R_{th} = r(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}) = r(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{3}}{3})$\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can find the cutoff frequency, $f_c$, by substituting the expression for $R_{th}$ into the formula for a first-order low-pass filter:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi C r(3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}$\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi C r(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{3}}{3})} = \\frac{3}{2\\pi C r(9-\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n<<<f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r C (3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}>>>"
