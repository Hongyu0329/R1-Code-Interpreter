The protein in question, S100B, binds with strong affinity to the V domain of the RAGE receptor. Due to its direct role in activating downstream pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neurodegeneration—the core processes driving disease progression—S100B can be utilized as a prognostic marker. Its expression level is likely to correlate with the rate and severity of the disease, allowing it to predict the clinical outcome, rather than serving solely as an adjunct marker to indicate the presence of pathology.
