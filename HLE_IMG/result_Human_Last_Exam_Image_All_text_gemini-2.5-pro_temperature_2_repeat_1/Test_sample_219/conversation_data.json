    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity (spikes) of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **Y-axis** represents the \"Electrode Number\" from 0 to 128, with each horizontal line corresponding to the activity of a single neuron or a small group of neurons recorded by one electrode.\n*   The **X-axis** represents \"Time (s)\" from 0 to over 50 seconds.\n*   Each black dot or short horizontal dash on the plot signifies an electrical spike, or an \"action potential,\" from a neuron at a specific moment in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons fire action potentials in a highly coordinated and near-simultaneous manner. In this raster plot, synchronized bursts are identifiable as dense, vertical bands of black dots, indicating that a large number of electrodes are recording high activity at the same time.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph from left to right, we can identify these prominent vertical bands. We will estimate the center time for each of these events.\n*   **Burst 1:** A clear burst of activity occurs early in the recording. Its center appears to be at approximately **2 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major synchronized event is located between 10 s and 20 s. It seems centered at approximately **17 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Another strong burst is visible shortly before the 30-second mark. We can estimate its center at approximately **28 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A very dense burst occurs between 30 s and 40 s. Its center is approximately **37 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final clear synchronized burst in the recording is close to the 50-second mark. We estimate its center at approximately **49 seconds**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the identified synchronized bursts are approximately: t1 = 2 s, t2 = 17 s, t3 = 28 s, t4 = 37 s, and t5 = 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time that elapses between consecutive bursts. We can calculate the intervals using the timestamps identified in the previous step. There are four such intervals between the five bursts.\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** t₂ - t₁ = 17 s - 2 s = **15 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** t₃ - t₂ = 28 s - 17 s = **11 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** t₄ - t₃ = 37 s - 28 s = **9 s**\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 37 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n*   Sum of IBIs = 15 s + 11 s + 9 s + 12 s = 47 s\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 47 s / 4 = **11.75 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated value is 11.75.\n*   The first two significant figures are '11'.\n*   The next digit is '7', which is 5 or greater, so we must round up the last significant digit.\n*   Rounding 11.75 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Definition:** The identification of \"synchronized bursts\" is a key step. The chosen events are clearly the most prominent and network-wide compared to the sparse background firing or smaller, less synchronized events.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The timestamps are read from the graph by eye. Small variations in these estimations (e.g., estimating 17.5 s instead of 17 s) are possible but should not significantly alter the final rounded answer. For instance, using slightly different but reasonable estimates (2.5, 17.5, 28, 37.5, 49) results in an average of 11.625 s, which also rounds to 12.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final rounding step must be performed correctly according to standard rules.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12>>>"
