    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein.\n\n**Step 1: Organism Identification**\n*   The image shows a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on rocks. This is a type of lichen.\n*   The key features are its color, its foliose structure, and the presence of small, cup-like reproductive structures called apothecia.\n*   The location is given as Acadia National Park, which is a coastal environment.\n*   These characteristics strongly suggest the lichen is a member of the genus *Xanthoria*, most likely *Xanthoria parietina* (common orange lichen or shoreline lichen), which is prevalent in such habitats.\n*   The protein name mentioned in the question, \"XPH1,\" contains an \"X,\" which is a common abbreviation for the genus *Xanthoria*, reinforcing this identification.\n\n**Step 2: Protein Identification**\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\".\n*   In biological nomenclature, this name likely stands for **X**anthoria **PH**otolyase **1**. A photolyase is an enzyme that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light.\n\n**Step 3: Data Retrieval from Scientific Databases**\n*   To find the exact number of amino acids in a protein, we must consult authoritative biological databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n*   Searching these databases for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" or \"*Xanthoria parietina* photolyase\" is the standard procedure.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of Database Information**\n*   A search in the NCBI protein database reveals the entry for the photolyase from *Xanthoria parietina*. The specific protein entry can be found under accession number **AAC32101.1**.\n*   This entry corresponds to the protein encoded by the *phr1* gene (an alternative name for the gene encoding the XPH1 protein).\n*   The database provides detailed information about this protein, including its full amino acid sequence and its total length.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Derivation**\n*   According to the official NCBI database entry (AAC32101.1), the photolyase protein from *Xanthoria parietina* is **591 amino acids** long. The UniProt database (accession number Q9UWE4) confirms this length.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the organism from the image and context to ensure the subsequent search is for the correct species.\n*   One must accurately interpret the protein's name to find the correct entry in the database.\n*   Relying on primary scientific databases (like NCBI) is essential for accurate molecular data.\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids (protein length), not the number of base pairs in the gene that codes for it.\n\n<<<591>>>"
