    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the plant.**\n    The image shows a close-up of a shrub. The most distinctive characteristic is the leaves. They are dark green with a prominent network of white or cream-colored veins, a pattern known as reticulate variegation. The leaves are relatively small, oval or lance-shaped, with smooth edges. The plant appears to be a woody shrub with new leaves emerging from the center. In the background of some crops, small round structures, possibly buds or berries, are visible.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formulate a search query to identify the plant.**\n    Based on the visual features, a search for \"shrub with green leaves and white net veins\" or \"plant with cobweb variegation\" would be appropriate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate search results and identify the plant species.**\n    Searching with these terms leads to several possibilities. One of the strongest visual matches is a cultivar named 'Silver Web' or 'Reticulata'. Investigating further, this cultivar belongs to the species *Pyracantha koidzumii*. The appearance of *Pyracantha koidzumii* 'Silver Web' (or similar reticulated cultivars) perfectly matches the leaves in the image. The shrub-like nature and the presence of small berries (pomes) characteristic of *Pyracantha* (Firethorn) are also consistent with the image.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the native range of the identified plant species.**\n    The question asks for the island to which the plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the species is native and found only in that specific location. While the plant in the photo might be a cultivar found in gardens worldwide, its parent species, *Pyracantha koidzumii*, has a specific native origin.\n\n*   **Step 5: Research the endemic location of *Pyracantha koidzumii*.**\n    A search for the origin of *Pyracantha koidzumii* reveals that it is commonly known as the Formosa Firethorn. The name \"Formosa\" is a historical name for Taiwan. Botanical sources confirm that *Pyracantha koidzumii* is a species endemic to the island of Taiwan.\n\n*   **Step 6: Formulate the final answer.**\n    The plant identified is a cultivar of *Pyracantha koidzumii*. This species is endemic to the island of Taiwan. Therefore, the answer to the question is Taiwan.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
