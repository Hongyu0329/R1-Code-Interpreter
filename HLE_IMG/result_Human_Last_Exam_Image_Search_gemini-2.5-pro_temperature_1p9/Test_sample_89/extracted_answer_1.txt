**Product A:** N-acetyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-amine (and/or its tautomers). It is an N-acylated amidine formed from the dihydropyrrole fragment of the starting material.


**Product B:** 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-3-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethylidene)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione. This is an imide containing the dihydropyrrole ring, where the side chain is derived from the Michael addition of methyl propiolate.


**Product C:** 3-acetyl-1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione. This imide is analogous to product B, but the side chain results from a Dakin-West type acylation by acetic anhydride instead of a Michael addition.
