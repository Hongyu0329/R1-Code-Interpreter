    "The tiling shown in the image has **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nBy focusing on the center of one of the prominent star-shaped motifs, it becomes evident that the entire pattern can be rotated by an angle of 360/7 degrees and remain unchanged. This is characteristic of 7-fold, or heptagonal, symmetry.\n\nThese types of patterns, often found in Islamic geometric art, are examples of quasicrystalline tilings. Unlike more common tilings that have 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold symmetry and can repeat periodically to fill a plane, patterns with 5-fold or 7-fold symmetry do not repeat in a simple periodic manner. The pattern in the image is constructed from a set of repeating shapes, including heptagons (seven-sided polygons), squares, and rhombuses, which are arranged in a complex, non-repeating structure that nevertheless has long-range order and rotational symmetry. The main structural motifs are the seven-pointed stars that are recursively surrounded by other similar stars.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
