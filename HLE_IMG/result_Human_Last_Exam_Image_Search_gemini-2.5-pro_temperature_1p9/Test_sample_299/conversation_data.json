    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the 2-move checkmate:\n\n**1. Nc5+**\n\nThe first move is for the White Knight to move from b7 to c5, placing the Black King in check.\n\n*   This move forces the Black Rook on c6 to capture the Knight on c5, as the King has no escape squares:\n    *   d4 is covered by the White Queen on a4.\n    *   d3, e3, and f3 are all covered by the White Rook on f3.\n    *   f5 is covered by the White Rook on h5 and the other White Knight on e7.\n    *   d5, e5, and f4 are blocked by Black's own pieces.\n\n**1... Rxc5**\n\nThis is Black's only legal move. The Rook on c6 captures the White Knight on c5.\n\n**2. Ne-f5#**\n\nNow, the other White Knight moves from e7 to f5, delivering the checkmate.\n\n*   The Black King on e4 is in check from the Knight on f5.\n*   The King has no escape squares as they are all still covered or blocked, as in the first move.\n*   The checking Knight on f5 cannot be captured because the White Rook on h5 protects that square.\n\nThis sequence forces a checkmate in two moves.\n\n<<<1. Nc5+ Rxc5 2. Ne-f5#>>>"
