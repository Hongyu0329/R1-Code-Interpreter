    "The cuneiform sign shown is known as PA or NIGIR. In its third-millennium BCE pictographic form, it often represents a herald, guard, or official. The symbol is thought to have originated as a pictogram of a watchtower or a person carrying a staff, befitting the role of a guard or overseer.\n\nThis sign, transliterated as ð’‰º, could function as a logogram (a sign representing a whole word) for \"guard\" or official. For example, Sumerian words for guard or soldier are sometimes written with signs that include or are related to this symbol. The use of this sign to denote a person with authority, such as a messenger or governor, is also found in later periods, as seen in the Amarna letters where it is used to introduce a messenger.\n\nA comparison with signs for the other answer choices shows they are not a match:\n*   **Bread (NINDA/GAR):** The sign for bread typically looks like a food bowl.\n*   **Home (E2):** The sign for a house is a simple rectangle or square.\n*   **Deity (DINGIR):** The sign for a god is a star-shaped symbol.\n*   **Beard (SUâ‚†):** The sign for a beard depicts a beard on a chin.\n\nTherefore, the sign in the image represents a guard.\n\n<<<B>>>"
