    "Based on the organisms visible in the photograph, the species that definitively indicates the picture was taken on the Atlantic Coast rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle.\n\nThe prominent snails in the image are Common Periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*). This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic/European coast and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century. It has since become the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast, with a range from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey. Its diet includes algae and the larvae of small invertebrates like barnacles.\n\nWhile there have been scattered reports of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific Coast of the United States, from California to Washington, it has not established sustained populations there in the way it has on the East Coast. The abundant presence of this species, as seen in the photo, is a hallmark of the intertidal zone of the North American Atlantic coast, where it has had a significant ecological impact.\n\nAlso visible are numerous barnacles, likely the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*). This species is native to the North Atlantic and is not found on the Pacific Coast, making it another strong indicator of an Atlantic location.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
