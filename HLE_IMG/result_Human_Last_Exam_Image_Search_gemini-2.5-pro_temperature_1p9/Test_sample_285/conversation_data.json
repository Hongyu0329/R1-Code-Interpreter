    "A triangulation of a set of points is a Delaunay triangulation if for every triangle in the set, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (the circumcircle) does not contain any other points from the set in its interior. This is known as the empty circle property.\n\nAn equivalent way to check this is the local Delaunay property. For any internal edge shared by two triangles (forming a convex quadrilateral), the edge is considered \"locally Delaunay\" if the vertex of one triangle does not lie inside the circumcircle of the other. This condition is violated if the sum of the angles opposite the shared edge is greater than 180 degrees.\n\nUpon examining the provided images:\n\n*   **Triangulations A and B** appear to be composed of \"well-shaped\" triangles, which is a characteristic of Delaunay triangulations. The triangles do not seem to violate the empty circle property upon visual inspection.\n*   **Triangulation D** is not a valid planar triangulation because it contains crossing edges. A triangulation by definition must be a planar graph.\n*   **Triangulation C** contains several long, \"skinny\" triangles. Let's inspect the quadrilateral formed by the top point, the two inner side points, and the inner bottom point. In triangulation C, these four points are connected by a diagonal running from the top point to the inner bottom point. This diagonal is the shared edge of two triangles. The angles within the quadrilateral that are opposite this shared edge are both visually obtuse (greater than 90 degrees). Their sum is therefore greater than 180 degrees, which indicates that this edge is not locally Delaunay. This means the circumcircle of each of these two triangles contains the fourth vertex of the quadrilateral, thus violating the empty circle property.\n\nTherefore, triangulation C violates the empty circle property.\n\n<<<C>>>"
