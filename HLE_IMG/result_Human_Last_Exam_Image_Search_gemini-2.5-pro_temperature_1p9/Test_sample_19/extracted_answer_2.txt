1. B minor
2. The Moonlight Sonata is in C-sharp minor. The modulation is part of a "fantasia" style, moving from the tonic to the relative major (E major), then its parallel minor (E minor), and then to B minor, which is the dominant of E minor, creating a logical harmonic progression while exploring distant keys.
3. The most functionally descriptive Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is **v of B minor** (the dominant of the new key), which in the context of C-sharp minor is a chromatically altered submediant chord (vi).
