    "The sheet music provided is from the battle theme of the video game *Final Fantasy VII*, which is titled \"Those Who Fight\". This piece was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The version in the image corresponds to the notoriously difficult and popular arrangement from the *Final Fantasy VII Piano Collections*.\n\nThis particular piano arrangement is known for its complexity, dynamic contrast, and virtuosic passages, as seen in the provided score with its rapid arpeggios and dense chords. The original title in Japanese is \"闘う者達\" (Tatakau Monotachi), which translates to \"Those Who Fight\". There are various arrangements available, including easier versions, but the one pictured is from the advanced solo piano collections.\n\n<<<Those Who Fight - Final Fantasy VII>>>"
