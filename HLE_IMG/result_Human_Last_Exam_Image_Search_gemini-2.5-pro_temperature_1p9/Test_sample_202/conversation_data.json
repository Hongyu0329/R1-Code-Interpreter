    "Here are the identifications for the rock specimens:\n\n**H: Scoria**\nThis is a volcanic rock characterized by its reddish-brown color and high number of vesicles (holes). These features are indicative of scoria, which forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools quickly. The reddish hue is often due to the presence of iron.\n\n**I: Volcanic Breccia or Conglomerate**\nThis rock is composed of various smaller, angular to sub-rounded rock fragments cemented together in a lighter-colored, fine-grained matrix. This structure identifies it as either a volcanic breccia, if the fragments are primarily of volcanic origin, or a sedimentary conglomerate. Breccias consist of angular fragments, while conglomerates are made of more rounded ones. This specimen contains a mix of different rock types.\n\n**J: Pumice**\nThis specimen is a light-colored, highly porous volcanic rock. Its vesicular, or frothy, appearance is characteristic of pumice. Pumice is formed from the rapid cooling of gas-rich, viscous magma, often of rhyolitic composition, which gives it its typically light color. Due to its high porosity, pumice is very lightweight and can even float on water.\n\n**K: Pegmatite**\nThis is a coarse-grained igneous rock with large, interlocking crystals, which are a defining characteristic of pegmatite. These large crystals, often bigger than a centimeter, form during the final stages of magma crystallization from water-rich fluids. Pegmatites are often granitic in composition, commonly containing large crystals of feldspar, quartz, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia or Conglomerate, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
