    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its appearance—a slender black body with a prominent reddish-brown or orange section on the upper part of its wing covers (elytra)—it is identifiable as a Black-striped Longhorn Beetle.\n\nThe scientific name of this beetle is ***Stenurella melanura***. This species is widespread across most of Europe and parts of Asia. The adults are commonly found on flowers from May through September, where they feed on pollen and nectar. The larvae develop in the decaying wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees. There is a slight difference between sexes; females tend to have reddish elytra while males have more yellow-brown elytra.\n\n<<<*Stenurella melanura*>>>"
