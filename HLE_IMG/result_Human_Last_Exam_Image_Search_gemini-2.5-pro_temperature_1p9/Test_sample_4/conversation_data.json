    "The knot presented in the image is identified as the 9₄₂ knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation. A notable characteristic of this knot is that its chirality is not detected by several common knot polynomials, including the Jones polynomial. This means the Jones polynomial for 9₄₂ is the same as for its mirror image.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the 9₄₂ knot, denoted as p(t), is:\n$t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2 - t^3 + t^4$\n\nIn the required decreasing degree order, the polynomial is:\n$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\n<<<$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$>>>"
