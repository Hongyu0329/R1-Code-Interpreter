    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary.\n\nThe key signature of the movement is C minor. The notes present in measure 30, across both the treble and bass clefs, are G, B-natural, D, and F. These notes constitute a G dominant seventh chord (G7). The lowest note in the bass clef is D.\n\nIn the key of C minor, the dominant chord is G major, which is represented by the Roman numeral V. The addition of the seventh (F) makes it a dominant seventh chord (V7). Since the D (the fifth of the chord) is the lowest sounding note, the chord is in its second inversion. The standard figured bass notation for a seventh chord in second inversion is 4/3.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral analysis for the chord in measure 30 is V4/3.\n\n<<<V4/3>>>"
