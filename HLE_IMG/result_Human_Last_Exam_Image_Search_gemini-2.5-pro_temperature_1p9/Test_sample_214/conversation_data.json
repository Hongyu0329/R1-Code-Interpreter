    "The sequence of erasure poems, including the one featured in the image, is from the artist and poet Mary Ruefle's collection *A Little White Shadow*. While erasure is the technique used to create the poems, the underlying poetic form in this and other similar works by Ruefle often resembles a specific short-verse Japanese form.\n\nThe full four-line stanza in question reads:\n\n> a milky way\n> of living things\n> ghostly velum dance\n> nacreous wavers\n\nWhen analyzing the syllable count of this stanza, a distinct pattern emerges:\n\n*   **Line 1:** a mil-ky way (3 syllables)\n*   **Line 2:** of liv-ing things (4 syllables)\n*   **Line 3:** ghost-ly vel-um dance (5 syllables)\n*   **Line 4:** na-cre-ous wa-vers (5 syllables)\n\nWhile there is some variation in the first two lines, the structure, particularly the creation of minimalist, image-driven lines, is strongly reminiscent of Japanese poetic forms like haiku or tanka. In fact, reviews of *A Little White Shadow* have specifically described the resulting poems as **\"haiku-like minifables, sideways aphorisms, and hauntingly perplexing koans.\"**\n\nTherefore, the text adheres to a form inspired by the **haiku**. Although it is a four-line stanza and doesn't strictly follow the 5-7-5 syllable structure of a traditional haiku, its brevity, focus on a single resonant image from nature, and its concise, aphoristic quality are all hallmarks of the haiku form as adapted into English. Ruefle herself has stated that her erasures are a form she can't resist, despite having resisted formal poetry for most of her life. She uses a restrictive process of only selecting words from an existing page to create her poems.\n\n<<<Haiku-inspired form>>>"
