    "Based on the provided sheet music, here are the details for the song:\n\n**Title:** \"Limehouse Blues\"\n\n**Musical Style:** The song is a well-known jazz standard. Although its title contains \"Blues,\" the composition is not a traditional 12-bar blues. It originated from a British musical revue as a foxtrot and quickly became popular with jazz musicians. It is particularly associated with Dixieland and Gypsy Jazz styles, having been famously recorded by artists like Django Reinhardt.\n\n**Country of Origin:** United Kingdom. The song was composed by Philip Braham (music) and Douglas Furber (lyrics) for the London West End revue \"A to Z,\" which premiered in 1921. The tune was written to evoke the Limehouse district in London, which was considered the city's Chinatown at the time.\n\n<<<\"Limehouse Blues\", Jazz (specifically a standard often played in Dixieland and Gypsy Jazz styles), United Kingdom>>>"
