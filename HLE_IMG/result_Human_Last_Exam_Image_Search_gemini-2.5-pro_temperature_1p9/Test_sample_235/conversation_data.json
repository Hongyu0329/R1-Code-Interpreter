    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, a careful analysis of the words presented and the context of the page is required.\n\nThe words forming the poem are: \"rules,\" \"and,\" \"lines,\" \"an intricate spider's web,\" and \"work.\" Erasure poetry, as practiced by artist Mary Ruefle, often involves creating a new text from a source, and can incorporate elements from the original page.\n\nIf we consider only the cut-out words, they form an irregular, unrhymed series of phrases, which would suggest free verse. However, a deeper look at the page reveals other text that may be part of the poem. The top of the page includes the title \"THE FIRST STEP\" and the page number \"35.\"\n\nIf we combine all the textual elements in a logical reading order, we get the following phrase: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\nNext, we must determine the syllable count of this phrase:\n*   **The first step:** 3 syllables (1+1+1)\n*   **thirty-five:** 3 syllables (2+1)\n*   **rules and lines:** 3 syllables (1+1+1)\n*   **an intricate spider's web:** 7 syllables (1+3+2+1)\n*   **work:** 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up: 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 17 syllables.\n\nThis specific length points to a poetic form known as the \"American Sentence.\" Created by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, an American Sentence is a single, 17-syllable sentence, conceived as a linear equivalent to the Japanese haiku's 5-7-5 syllable structure. The form is intended to be a concise, complete thought or observation contained within a single line.\n\nGiven that the complete text on the page forms a coherent sentence of exactly 17 syllables, this is the most fitting metric pattern among the choices.\n\n<<<F>>>"
