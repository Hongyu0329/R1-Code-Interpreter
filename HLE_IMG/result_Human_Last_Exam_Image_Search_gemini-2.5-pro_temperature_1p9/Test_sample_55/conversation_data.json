    "The chord circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397, occurs on the first beat of the measure within the key of D minor. To determine the correct Roman numeral, one must analyze the notes present and their function within the key.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has one flat (B♭), and the piece is titled in D minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** In the bass clef (left hand), the notes are F and A. In the treble clef (right hand), the notes are C♯ and E.\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony:**\n    *   The primary notes sounding on the downbeat in the bass are F and A. These establish the foundation of the chord. In the key of D minor, an F major chord (F-A-C) functions as the mediant triad, represented by the Roman numeral **III**.\n    *   The C♯ and E in the right hand are carried over from the A major chord (the dominant, V) that concluded the previous measure. These notes are dissonant against the F major harmony.\n    *   Music theorists identify these dissonant notes (C♯ and E) as non-chord tones, specifically as **appoggiaturas**. An appoggiatura is a note that is dissonant with the prevailing harmony and then resolves by step. In this case, the C♯ and E resolve on the third beat of the measure to B♭ and D, which are members of the G minor chord (the subdominant, iv).\n\nBecause the foundational harmony of the downbeat is built on F, the mediant of D minor, the most accurate Roman numeral for this sonority is III, with the C# and E understood as dissonant appoggiaturas.\n\n<<<III>>>"
