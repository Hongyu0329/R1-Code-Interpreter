    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will analyze the reaction step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Starting Material to Intermediate 1**\n\nThe starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in an acetonitrile/water solvent mixture. CAN is a well-known reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protected amines. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen atom and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Starting Material Formula:** The PMB group has the formula C8H9O. The rest of the molecule, the bicyclic lactam core with the trifluoromethyl group, has the formula C7H5F3NO. Therefore, the starting material's molecular formula is C15H14F3NO2.\n*   **Reaction:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** (C15H14F3NO2) - (C8H9O) + (H) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n    Intermediate 1 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2**\n\nThe second step is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction is a standard method for the reduction of a carbon-carbon double bond. The C=C bond in the five-membered ring of Intermediate 1 will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** (C7H6F3NO) + (H2) = **C7H8F3NO**.\n    Intermediate 2 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate 2 to Product**\n\nThe final step is the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 using 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C. Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). Under these acidic and heated conditions, the amide bond within the ring is hydrolyzed. This reaction involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the amide bond, cleaving it to form a carboxylic acid and an amine (which will be protonated to an ammonium salt in the acidic conditions). This opens the ring system to form a substituted cyclopentane amino acid. A similar lactam hydrolysis to an amino acid is shown in the literature.\n\n*   **Reaction:** One molecule of water is added to the lactam.\n*   **Product Formula:** (C7H8F3NO) + (H2O) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    The product is 3-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
