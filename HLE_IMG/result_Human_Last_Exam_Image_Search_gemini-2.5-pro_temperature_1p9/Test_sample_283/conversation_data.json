    "Based on the analysis of the recurring peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is Iran. The three historical events represented by the colored lines correspond to significant occurrences in modern Iranian history which garner annual search interest.\n\nThe three events are identified as follows:\n\n*   **The Red Line represents interest in Qasem Soleimani.** The most prominent peak on this line occurs in early January 2020, which directly corresponds to his assassination by a U.S. drone strike on January 3, 2020. The subsequent, smaller peaks align with the anniversary of his death, an event that prompts renewed interest each year.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line signifies searches related to the Iran Hostage Crisis.** This is indicated by the consistent annual peaks in early November. The crisis began on November 4, 1979, when Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The anniversary of this 444-day event is a recurring point of interest.\n\n*   **The Blue Line corresponds to the Iranian Revolution.** The revolution culminated in the overthrow of the monarchy on February 11, 1979. The regular, smaller peaks of the blue line in February of each year reflect commemorative searches for this foundational event of the modern Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nA historian would recognize the pattern of these specific annual search spikes as being directly tied to these three pivotal and interconnected events in the contemporary history of Iran.\n\n<<<Iran>>>"
