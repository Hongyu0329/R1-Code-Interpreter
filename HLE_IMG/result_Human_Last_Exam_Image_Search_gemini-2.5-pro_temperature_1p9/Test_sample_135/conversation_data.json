    "The author of this altarpiece detail is the Italian Renaissance sculptor **Desiderio da Settignano**.\n\nThis circular relief is a detail from the larger marble altarpiece known as the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (Tabernacolo del Sacramento). Created around 1461, it is located in the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe tabernacle is considered a masterpiece of 15th-century Florentine sculpture and a principal work from Desiderio's later career. The entire altarpiece consists of several sculpted elements, including this scene of communion, a relief of the Lamentation, a figure of the Blessing Christ Child, and candle-bearing angels. While some elements may have involved assistants or later alterations, the design and principal sculpture are attributed to Desiderio da Settignano. The work was likely commissioned by the powerful Medici family for their chapel in the church.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
