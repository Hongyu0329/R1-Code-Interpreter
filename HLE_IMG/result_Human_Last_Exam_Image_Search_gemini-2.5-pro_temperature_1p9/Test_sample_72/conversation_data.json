    "The user wants to identify the two pericyclic reactions occurring in the given photochemical transformation.\n\n**Analysis of the reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆). The image depicts cyclobutene, but the hydrogens on the saturated carbons are shown with *cis* stereochemistry, relevant to the product's stereochemistry.\n2.  **Condition:** The reaction is driven by light (hv), indicating a photochemical process.\n3.  **Product:** The product is a complex polycyclic molecule, specifically heptafluorotricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]dec-3,7,9-triene. Looking closely at the provided image, the product shown is actually the adduct from a different reaction, which is the reaction between hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene. The question asks for the reactions happening in the transformation shown.\n\n**Step-by-step mechanism and identification of pericyclic reactions:**\n\n*   **First Pericyclic Reaction:** The reaction is initiated by photochemical excitation of hexafluorobenzene. A well-known photochemical reaction of hexafluorobenzene is its isomerization to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation is a 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclization is photochemically allowed and proceeds via a conrotatory ring closure. More recent studies clarify that vibronic coupling promotes this specific ring-closing pathway.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1:** 4π Electrocyclization (a type of pericyclic reaction).\n\n*   **Second Pericyclic Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene. The product shown in the image is the result of a cycloaddition reaction between hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, which acts as a diene, and cyclobutene, which acts as a dienophile. This reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction. The Dewar benzene is a high-energy intermediate, and its reaction with cyclobutene to form the final adduct can proceed thermally. A thermal [4+2] cycloaddition is a classic pericyclic reaction that is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. Even though the overall process is initiated by light, the second step is a thermal cycloaddition involving the photochemically generated intermediate. The question asks for two *photochemically allowed* pericyclic reactions, which is a slight ambiguity. However, this sequence is the most plausible. Often in tandem photochemical reactions, the initial photoreaction is followed by subsequent thermal reactions of the high-energy intermediate. A direct photochemical [4+2] reaction is also possible but is mechanistically more complex (suprafacial-antarafacial). Given the context, it's most likely that a Diels-Alder reaction is the second step.\n\n    An alternative second step could be a [2+2] photocycloaddition between one of the double bonds of Dewar benzene and cyclobutene's double bond. However, the resulting product structure would differ from the one shown. The product depicted is characteristic of a Diels-Alder adduct.\n\n    Another possibility is a direct photocycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. Benzene derivatives can undergo [2+2], [3+2], or [4+2] photocycloadditions with alkenes. A [2+2] cycloaddition is a common mode. However, this is often followed by rearrangements. The overall transformation shown most closely corresponds to the two-step sequence.\n\nBased on the most established pathway for this type of reaction:\n1.  **Photochemical Valence Isomerization:** Hexafluorobenzene undergoes a 4π electrocyclization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n2.  **Cycloaddition:** Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with cyclobutene via a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction).\n\nBoth are pericyclic reactions. The first is strictly photochemical. The second, a Diels-Alder, is typically thermal but is part of the overall photochemical transformation sequence.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a 4π-electrocyclization and a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a 4π-electrocyclization and a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction).>>>"
