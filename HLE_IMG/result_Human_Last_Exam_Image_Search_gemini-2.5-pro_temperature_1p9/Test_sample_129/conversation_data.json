    "This image shows the crystal structure of the pro-form of **human matrix metalloproteinase-2 (proMMP-2)**. This protein is also known as gelatinase A.\n\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent enzymes that play a crucial role in breaking down components of the extracellular matrix. Their activity is important in both normal physiological processes like tissue remodeling and in pathological conditions such as tumor invasion.\n\nMMPs are produced as inactive precursors called proenzymes (or zymogens). The structure shown is this \"pro\" form. The larger dark blue region is the catalytic domain, while the smaller, light blue segment is the N-terminal propeptide domain. This propeptide domain effectively blocks the enzyme's active site, keeping it in a latent state. Activation occurs when this propeptide is cleaved, which can be triggered by other proteases, leading to a conformational change that unblocks the active site.\n\nThis particular representation is from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and is often associated with the entry **1CK7**.\n\n<<<pro-human Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (proMMP-2)>>>"
