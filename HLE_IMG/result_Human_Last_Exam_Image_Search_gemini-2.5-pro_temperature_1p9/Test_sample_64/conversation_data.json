    "The process depicted in the series of micrographs is **clamp connection formation** in a basidiomycete fungus. This is a characteristic feature of this fungal phylum.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the stages shown in the images:\n*   **Image L:** This panel shows the initial stage. A small, hook-like structure, which will become the clamp connection, has started to form from the terminal cell of a fungal hypha. The arrowhead points to the septum, or cross-wall, separating the terminal cell from the one below it.\n*   **Image M:** The clamp has grown in a backward direction and is in the process of fusing with the subterminal cell (the cell just behind the tip cell). The arrowhead indicates this point of fusion.\n*   **Image N:** The fusion between the clamp and the subterminal cell is complete, creating a bridge.\n\nThis entire process is crucial for maintaining the dikaryotic state of the fungus, meaning each cell segment contains two distinct nuclei. During growth, the two nuclei in the terminal cell divide simultaneously. The clamp connection ensures that one of the newly formed daughter nuclei is transported to the subterminal cell, so that the new cell created by the forward growth of the hypha and the subterminal cell both end up with a pair of different nuclei.\n\nThese structures are microscopic and their presence or absence is an important characteristic used in the classification of fungal species. The fungus in the image is likely *Schizophyllum commune*, a species in which this process has been extensively studied.\n\n<<<clamp connection formation>>>"
