    "The small fragment of the painting presented is from **\"The Windmill on the Onbekende Gracht, Amsterdam,\"** also known as **\"The Fire,\"** created by the Dutch painter **Johannes Christiaan Schotel** (1787-1838). Schotel was a prominent marine and landscape artist of the 19th century, renowned for his skill in depicting dramatic scenes with masterful light effects.\n\nThe painting captures a tumultuous scene with a dark, stormy sky providing a dramatic backdrop to a traditional Dutch windmill. To the right, the glow of a fire adds to the intensity of the moment. Johannes Christiaan Schotel was known for his ability to portray the sea and sky with great realism and a sense of movement, which is evident even in this small fragment.\n\nArtists like Jacob Maris and the renowned Rembrandt also created famous paintings featuring windmills under stormy skies, a recurring theme in Dutch art. However, the specific composition, the style of the windmill, and the inclusion of the fire in the background are characteristic of Schotel's work in question.\n\n<<<The Windmill on the Onbekende Gracht, Amsterdam (The Fire)>>>"
