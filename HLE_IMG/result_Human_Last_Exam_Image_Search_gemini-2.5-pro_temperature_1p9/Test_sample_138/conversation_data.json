    "An analysis of the key morphological features of each insect pair, combined with the provided context, allows for the determination of their biological sexes.\n\n*   **Pair A:** These insects belong to the cuckoo bee genus *Coelioxys*. A defining characteristic for sexing this genus is the shape of the abdomen. The individual on the right (A-right) has a long, sharply pointed, cone-shaped abdomen, which is characteristic of a female. The individual on the left (A-left) has a much blunter abdomen with what appear to be small spines at the tip, which is characteristic of a male. Therefore, pair A is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. In this group, a reliable feature for sex identification is the antennae. Males have distinctly longer antennae that curl or hook at the tips, as seen on the individual on the right (B-right). Females have shorter, straighter antennae, as seen on the individual on the left (B-left). Therefore, pair B is Female, Male.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These are bees. The prompt specifies they are from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. While females of many bee species have scopae, males do not. Additionally, some groups like yellow-faced bees (*Hylaeus*) lack scopae in both sexes, carrying pollen internally instead. The individual on the left (C-left) has a prominent yellow patch on its face (clypeus). This is a classic trait of male bees in many families, including long-horned bees and some bumblebees. Therefore, C-left is a male and lacks scopae. To fit the collection criteria of having no leg scopae, the bee on the right (C-right) must also be a male, or a female of a scopae-less group like *Hylaeus*. However, it is much hairier than a typical *Hylaeus* bee. The most logical conclusion is that C-right is also a male, which naturally lacks the pollen-collecting scopae that would be present on a female of its species. Therefore, pair C is Male, Male.\n\nThe correct sequence of indices is:\nA: 3 (M, F)\nB: 4 (F, M)\nC: 1 (M, M)\n\n<<<3, 4, 1>>>"
