    "Based on the clues, here's the breakdown of the answer:\n\n**Image Analysis and the First Clue**\nThe image provided is from the NHL Awards ceremony that took place in Las Vegas on June 19, 2019 (the user-provided date of June 20th is the local date in many parts of the world by that time). In the picture, Ryan O'Reilly is seen receiving the Frank J. Selke Trophy for being the best defensive forward in the league. This accounts for \"X Y\" being pictured at an event on the specified date.\n\n**The Chemical Connection and the Second Clue**\nThe second clue states that \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This refers to Mad Hatter's disease, which is a form of chronic mercury poisoning. This condition was named after the fact that hat makers in the 18th to 20th centuries used mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt, to cure felt for hats. Workers often inhaled mercury vapors and subsequently developed severe neurological symptoms, which led to the popular saying \"mad as a hatter.\" The use of mercury in hat making was banned in the United States in 1941.\n\nThe person in the picture is St. Louis Blues forward **Ryan O'Reilly**, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy and Stanley Cup that year, making it a very successful season for him, topped with a **Selke** Trophy, and in an another domain, some of us, do remember the book written by Lewis Carroll, in Alice in Wonderland, we have a character who seems to be \"mad\" which is related to the symptoms, but most importantly in another context this refers to a **Hatter**.\n\nThus, the answer X Y refers to **Hatter**.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
