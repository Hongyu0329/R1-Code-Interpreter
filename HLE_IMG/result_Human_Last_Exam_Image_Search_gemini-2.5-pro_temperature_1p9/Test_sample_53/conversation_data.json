    "The figure leaving the chariot is the sorceress Medea.\n\nThis famous red-figure volute-krater, dated to approximately 400-390 B.C., depicts the death of Talos, the bronze giant guardian of Crete. The vase is the signature work of the artist known as the Talos Painter and is housed in the Jatta National Archaeological Museum in Ruvo di Puglia, Italy.\n\nThe scene illustrates an episode from the myth of Jason and the Argonauts. The key figures depicted are:\n*   **Talos**, the bronze giant, is the large figure shown falling backward. His metallic nature is indicated by the use of white and yellowish paint. In the myth, Talos was invulnerable except for a single vein in his ankle, sealed by a nail or plug.\n*   **Medea**, the enchantress from Colchis, is the figure in the chariot, identified by her elaborate, non-Greek (\"oriental\") clothing and Phrygian cap. On this vase, she is shown having either used her magic to induce madness in Talos or having tricked him so that the plug in his ankle could be removed, causing the vital fluid, ichor, to flow out and kill him.\n*   **The Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux)**, twin heroes among the Argonauts, are often shown assisting in the giant's demise. In the full scene on the vase, they are depicted on horseback, steadying the collapsing Talos.\n*   **Poseidon and Amphitrite**, the god and goddess of the sea, are shown as divine observers of the event.\n\nTherefore, the woman in the chariot is Medea, who is central to the defeat of Talos.<<<Medea>>>"
