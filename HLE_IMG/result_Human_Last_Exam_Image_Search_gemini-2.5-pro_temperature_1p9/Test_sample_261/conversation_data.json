    "The book that has the presented fragment on its cover is **Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal**.\n\nThis is the Spanish-language edition of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" by J.K. Rowling. The cover illustration, which features the ethereal unicorn shown in the fragment, was created by Argentinian artist Dolores Avendaño. She illustrated the covers for all seven Harry Potter books released in Spanish. In an interview, Avendaño confirmed that for the cover of the first book, she included \"very magical elements like the unicorn, the castle, the three-headed dog and the apprentice of a magician flying on his broom.\"\n\n<<<Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal>>>"
