    "The image provided is completely black and does not show the molecules in question. To answer your question, I would need to see the structures of the molecules.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the definitions of the terms listed in the options, which may help you identify the correct relationship once you have the molecular structures.\n\n*   **Identical Molecules**: Two molecules are considered identical if they have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, and they are superimposable on each other. Essentially, they are the same compound.\n\n*   **Constitutional Isomers**: Also known as structural isomers, these are molecules that share the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of atoms or bonding patterns. For example, pentane and 2-methylbutane both have the formula C₅H₁₂, but their carbon atoms are connected in a different order.\n\n*   **Stereoisomers**: These isomers have the same molecular formula and the same sequence of bonded atoms (connectivity), but they differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. Stereoisomers can be further divided into enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n*   **Conformational Isomers (Conformers)**: These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be converted into one another by rotation around single bonds. Because they can typically interconvert easily at room temperature, they are often considered to be different forms of the same molecule rather than separate, isolatable compounds.\n\nTo determine which category the molecules in your question belong to, you would typically follow these steps:\n1.  **Check the molecular formula.** If they are different, the molecules are not isomers.\n2.  **Check the connectivity.** If the formulas are the same but the atoms are connected differently, they are **constitutional isomers**.\n3.  **Check the 3D arrangement.** If the connectivity is the same but the 3D arrangement is different, they are **stereoisomers**.\n4.  **Check for interconversion by bond rotation.** If the different 3D arrangements can be interconverted simply by rotating around a single bond, they are **conformational isomers**.\n5.  **Check for superimposability.** If the molecules are superimposable, they are **identical**.\n\nWithout the image of the molecules, a definitive answer cannot be provided."
