    "An analysis of the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure reveals a specific atomic arrangement when viewed along different crystallographic directions.\n\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell has atoms at each of the eight corners of a cube and in the center of each of the six faces. To determine the pattern viewed along the direction, one must project the atom positions onto a plane perpendicular to this direction. This plane is the (110) plane.\n\nThe atoms within a (110) plane of an FCC lattice form a rectangular arrangement. However, when projecting the entire 3D structure, atoms from the subsequent layers are also seen. In the FCC structure, the stacking of (110) planes is of an ABAB... type. This means the atoms in the second layer are not directly behind the atoms of the first layer but are shifted. Specifically, they are located in the center of the rectangle formed by the atoms of the first layer.\n\nTherefore, the projection of an FCC lattice along the direction results in a **centered rectangular pattern**. Let's examine the options:\n\n*   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular lattice without any atoms in the center of the rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC structure viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image B:** Shows a distorted arrangement that does not have the clear rectangular symmetry expected.\n*   **Image C:** Clearly displays a centered rectangular pattern. We can see atoms forming the corners of a rectangle, with another atom situated in the center of that rectangle. The use of different-sized circles represents the different layers of atoms (the AB stacking), which are at different depths from the viewer. This matches the expected projection for an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image D:** Presents a more complex pattern that is not a simple centered rectangle. It appears denser and more akin to a projection along the direction, which exhibits hexagonal or trigonal symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, image C correctly depicts the centered rectangular arrangement of atoms in a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\nC.\n<<<C>>>"
