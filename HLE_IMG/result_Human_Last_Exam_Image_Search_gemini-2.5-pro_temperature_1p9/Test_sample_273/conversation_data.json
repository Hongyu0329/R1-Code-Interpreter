    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\nFirst, we identify the parent carbon chain and number it according to IUPAC nomenclature. The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group, which receives priority over the amino (-NH2) group. The longest carbon chain containing the carbon bonded to the -OH group is a pentane chain. Numbering starts from the left to give the -OH group the lowest possible number (position 2). The correct IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n### **Configuration at C2**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The four groups attached to C2 are -OH, -CH3 (C1), the rest of the chain starting with C3, and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (highest atomic number atom, O)\n    2.  -CH(C2H5)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C3 group)\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n3.  **Determine 3D Orientation:** The main carbon chain is drawn in the plane. The -OH group is shown with a dash, meaning it points away from the viewer. Therefore, the implicit -H atom at C2 is on a wedge, pointing towards the viewer.\n4.  **Assign Configuration:** With the lowest-priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → -C3 group → -CH3). This path follows a clockwise direction. Because the lowest-priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we reverse the assignment. A clockwise direction normally indicates (R), so the configuration is **(S)**.\n\n### **Configuration at C3**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The four groups attached to C3 are the chain towards C2, the chain towards C4, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** To prioritize the carbon-based groups, we look at the atoms they are bonded to.\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (the C2 group, as its carbon is bonded to an oxygen)\n    2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C4 group, as its carbon is bonded to another carbon that is bonded to nitrogen)\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    4.  -H\n3.  **Determine 3D Orientation:** The ethyl group is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). This implies the implicit -H atom is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer).\n4.  **Assign Configuration:** With the lowest-priority group (-H) pointing away, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C2 group → -C4 group → -Ethyl group). This path is clockwise. Since the lowest-priority group is away from the viewer, the configuration is **(R)**.\n\n### **Configuration at C4**\n1.  **Identify Substituents:** The groups at C4 are the chain towards C3, a methyl group (-CH3), an aminoethyl group (-CH2NH2), and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H).\n2.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (The carbon is bonded to a nitrogen, which has a higher atomic number than the carbons in the other groups).\n    2.  -CH(C2H5)CH(OH)CH3 (the C3 group)\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H\n3.  **Determine 3D Orientation:** The -CH3 group is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer). Therefore, the implicit -H atom is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n4.  **Assign Configuration:** With the lowest-priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path from 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 → -C3 group → -CH3). This is a counter-clockwise path. Because the lowest-priority group is pointing towards us, we must reverse the assignment. A counter-clockwise direction normally indicates (S), so the configuration is **(R)**.\n\nCombining the results, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>>"
