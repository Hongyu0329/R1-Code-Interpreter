The total power delivered to the grid as a function of the given variables is:
$P_{\text{grid}} = (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_c) - k(P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_c)^2$

The optimal compensation power required to meet the grid demand while minimizing the undersea cable losses is:
$P_c^{\text{opt}} \approx -1.055 \text{ MW}$

The total power delivered to the grid, including the effect of cable losses, at the optimal operating point is:
$P_{\text{grid}} = 12.0 \text{ MW}$
