    "The primary and most easily distinguishable difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte possesses a short and straight seta. This erect nature gives the capsule an upright appearance on the plant.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its distinctly curved or arcuate seta. In fact, the species name \"*curviseta*\" translates to \"curved seta,\" highlighting this key feature. One of the defining characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta* is its capsule being situated on an arcuate seta. While some related species, like *Grimmia donniana* (of which *G. curviseta* has been considered a variety), may occasionally have a curved seta, it is a consistent and defining feature for *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\nTherefore, to distinguish these two species at a glance when they are in their reproductive stage, one should look at the orientation of the capsule's stalk: it will be straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved in *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
