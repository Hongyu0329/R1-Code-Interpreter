    "Based on an analysis of the chemical structures and supporting scientific literature, **Complexes and** are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe stability and, consequently, the operational lifetime of iridium(III) complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are highly dependent on the strength of the metal-ligand bonds. The four complexes shown are all cationic iridium(III) emitters which differ in the fluorination pattern of their cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands.\n\n*   **Complexes 1 and 2** feature fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring at positions that are relatively distant from the iridium center (4' and 5' positions). Fluorine is a strongly electron-withdrawing atom. When placed at these positions, it strengthens the crucial Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond through an inductive effect. This increased bond strength generally leads to enhanced molecular stability and longer device lifetimes. Studies on similar complexes confirm that fluorination at the para-position of the phenyl ring (4'-position) can lead to highly stable emitters for LECs.\n\n*   **Complexes 3 and 4** have a fluorine atom placed on the phenyl ring *ortho* to the Ir-C bond (at the C3' position). This proximity of the fluorine atom to the iridium metal center can lead to two destabilizing effects:\n    1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The fluorine atom is relatively bulky and can cause physical crowding around the metal center, potentially straining and weakening the Ir-C bond.\n    2.  **Electronic Repulsion:** The lone pairs of electrons on the fluorine atom can cause electronic repulsion with the d-orbitals of the iridium atom, further weakening the metal-ligand bond.\n\nScientific studies have indicated that while fluorination is a common strategy to tune the properties of these complexes, placing fluorine atoms at the ortho position can enhance the non-radiative decay rate, which is detrimental to the emitter's performance and stability. Weakening the Ir-C bond can create pathways for molecular degradation, thus shortening the operational lifetime of the LEC device.\n\nTherefore, the substitution pattern in Complexes and is expected to result in lower stability and shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes and.\n\n<<<J>>>"
