    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Perceptual Restoration**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is physically interrupted but the listener perceives it as continuous because the gap is filled by another sound, like a burst of noise. The top part of the image, a spectrogram, shows a constant tone (the horizontal line) being interrupted by a burst of noise (the vertical blur), while the bottom waveform shows the actual physical sound waves changing from a simple sine wave to a complex one. The illusion is that the listener's brain \"fills in\" the missing information, creating the perception of an uninterrupted tone continuing through the noise.\n\nThis ability is a common, and usually unconscious, function of our hearing. It allows our brains to create a stable and continuous perception of important sounds, like speech or music, even in noisy environments where parts of the sound might be temporarily masked or completely obliterated. When this phenomenon occurs with speech, it is often called the phonemic restoration effect, where the brain restores missing speech sounds.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because, in both cases, the brain is resolving ambiguity to create a stable perception. While the Necker Cube leads to switching between two possible visual interpretations (bistable perception), the auditory continuity illusion typically results in a single, stable (though incorrect) perception of continuous sound. This illusion demonstrates the brain's remarkable capacity to infer what is most likely happening in the environment, favoring the idea of a continuous sound source being temporarily obscured over one that coincidentally stops and starts at the same moments as an unrelated noise.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
