    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we can analyze its recursive structure.\n\nLet T(n) be the time taken by the function `sort(a, n)` for an array of size n.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, so we can define T(1) = O(1).\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on the first `n-1` elements. This takes T(n - 1) time.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: A comparison and a potential swap. These are constant time operations, O(1).\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: Another recursive call on the first `n-1` elements. This also takes T(n - 1) time.\n\nBy adding up the time for these steps, we can write a recurrence relation for T(n):\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` represents the constant time for the comparison and swap)\n\nNow, let's solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `(2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series that equals `2^k - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case, T(1). This happens when `n - k = 1`, or `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, `2^(n-1) * T(1)` is of the order O(2^n).\nThe term `c * (2^(n-1) - 1)` is also of the order O(2^n).\nTherefore, `T(n) = O(2^n) + O(2^n) = O(2^n)`.\n\nThe number of operations is dependent on `n` but not on the initial arrangement of the elements in the array. Thus, the worst-case, average-case, and best-case time complexities are all O(2^n).\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe calculated time complexity is O(2^n), which corresponds to option E. The algorithm does terminate because the problem size `n` decreases with each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
