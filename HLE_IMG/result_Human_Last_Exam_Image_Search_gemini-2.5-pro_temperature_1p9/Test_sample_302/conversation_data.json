    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are a traditional Chinese auspicious phrase.\n\nThe characters in simplified Chinese are: **长乐未央** (cháng lè wèi yāng).\n\nThis phrase translates to \"endless joy\" or \"eternal happiness,\" a common wish for enduring prosperity and delight often found on historical artifacts like seals and eaves tiles from the Han Dynasty. The script used is a form of ancient Chinese calligraphy known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū), which was standardized during the Qin dynasty and widely used for decorative purposes in the Han dynasty.\n\nThe individual characters are:\n*   **长** (cháng): long or eternal\n*   **乐** (lè): joy, happiness\n*   **未** (wèi): not yet, never\n*   **央** (yāng): end, center\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
