    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum displays a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at an m/z of 135.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume the presence of a single nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14 amu).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** These peaks correspond to C-H stretching vibrations of sp²-hybridized carbons, indicating an aromatic ring.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are due to C-H stretching of sp³-hybridized carbons, indicating an aliphatic portion of the molecule.\n*   **~1605 cm⁻¹ and ~1495 cm⁻¹:** These bands are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\nThe IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of both a phenyl group and a primary amine group.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   The molecular formula can be deduced. Assuming one nitrogen atom, the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. The seven carbon signals suggest a C₉ formula (9 x 12 = 108), leaving 13 mass units for hydrogen (13 x 1 = 13). This gives a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**, which has a molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as `(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4`. This is consistent with a single benzene ring.\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows seven distinct carbon environments at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   The four downfield signals (126.3 to 145.1 ppm) are in the aromatic region. The three upfield signals (19.2 to 49.6 ppm) are in the aliphatic region.\n*   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows five positive signals (CH or CH₃) and one negative signal (CH₂). The fact that there are six signals in the DEPT spectrum but seven in the full ¹³C spectrum confirms the presence of one quaternary carbon. This is the *ipso*-carbon of the benzene ring (the carbon attached to the substituent), likely the signal at 145.1 ppm.\n*   The remaining three aromatic signals must be CH groups, accounting for three of the positive DEPT signals.\n*   The three aliphatic carbons (49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm) must therefore correspond to one CH₂ group (the negative signal) and two other groups which are CH or CH₃ (the remaining two positive signals).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectroscopy**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **~7.2 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to approximately 5 protons, characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~2.8 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~1 proton.\n    *   **~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~2 protons.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm:** A doublet integrating to ~3 protons.\n*   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence):** This 2D spectrum correlates each carbon with its directly attached proton(s).\n    *   The carbon at **19.2 ppm** correlates to the proton signal at **1.2 ppm** (3H, doublet). This confirms a **-CH₃** group. The doublet splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   The carbon at **43.5 ppm** correlates to the proton signal at **~2.7 ppm** (2H, multiplet). This identifies the **-CH₂-** group. This corresponds to the negative DEPT-135 signal.\n    *   The carbon at **49.6 ppm** correlates to the proton signal at **~2.8 ppm** (1H, multiplet). This confirms a **-CH-** group.\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation**\nThe identified fragments are a phenyl group (Ph-), a primary amine (-NH₂), a methyl group (-CH₃), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methine group (-CH-). Combining these to satisfy the valency and observed splitting patterns leads to two main possibilities:\n\n1.  `Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`\n2.  `Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`\n\nTo differentiate between these isomers, we can analyze the chemical shifts:\n*   In isomer **1**, we have a benzylic methylene group (`Ph-CH₂-`) and a methine group attached to the amine (`-CH(NH₂)-`). Generally, a carbon attached to nitrogen is more deshielded than a benzylic carbon. This matches our experimental data, where the CH carbon is at 49.6 ppm and the CH₂ carbon is at 43.5 ppm. The literature values for the aliphatic carbons of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine are in good agreement with the experimental data.\n*   In isomer **2**, we have a benzylic methine group (`Ph-CH-`) and a methylene group attached to the amine (`-CH₂NH₂`). Here, the CH group would be expected to be less deshielded than the CH₂NH₂ group. This contradicts the observed shifts (CH at 49.6 ppm > CH₂ at 43.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the data unambiguously points to the first isomer. The structure is a propane chain with a phenyl group on carbon 1 and an amine group on carbon 2.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
