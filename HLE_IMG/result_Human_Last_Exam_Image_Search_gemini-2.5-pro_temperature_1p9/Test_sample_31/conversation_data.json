    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. Its Rasmussen invariant, also known as the s-invariant, is -6.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a powerful tool in knot theory, providing a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, this invariant is equal to the signature of the knot. The 8₁₉ knot is notable as it is the first non-obvious torus knot in the standard knot table, being the T(4,3) torus knot. It is also recognized as the first non-homologically thin knot in the Rolfsen table.\n\n<<< -6 >>>"
