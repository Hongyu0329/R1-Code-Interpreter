    "This coin originates from the **French Colonies** in general, rather than a single specific colony.\n\nThe inscriptions visible in the images identify this as a 9 Deniers coin issued under King Louis XV. The reverse of the coin clearly reads \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES,\" indicating it was intended for circulation across various French territories. These copper coins were struck in 1721 and 1722.\n\nThis particular issue was minted following a royal edict in June 1721. The coins were intended for use in France's American colonies, including Louisiana, Acadia, and Canada (New France).\n\nInterestingly, the introduction of these coins faced challenges. In 1722, a shipment of 534,000 coins was sent to Canada but was not well-received by the colonists. As a result, the majority of these coins were returned to France in 1726 and later re-shipped to other colonies, such as Louisiana (at a reduced value) and the Mascarene Islands of a Rivière du Mât region, where they were more readily accepted.\n\n<<<French Colonies>>>"
