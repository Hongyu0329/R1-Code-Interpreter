    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*. This is a type of leafy liverwort.\n\nThese organisms are commonly found on tree bark and are characterized by their dark, branched, and mat-forming growth. They can appear in colors ranging from green to dark purple or almost black, often becoming darker in winter or when dry.\n\n*Frullania* species are often mistaken for mosses or lichens but are distinguished by their structure, which consists of flattened, overlapping leaves in two rows. They are non-parasitic, meaning they use the tree for support but do not harm it, deriving their nutrients from the air and rain. Their presence is widespread, and they are known to be tolerant of dry conditions, often growing high up on tree trunks.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
