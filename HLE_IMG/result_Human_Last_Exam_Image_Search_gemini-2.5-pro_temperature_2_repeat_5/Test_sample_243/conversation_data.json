    "The plant in the image is identified as *Ficus concinna*. Contrary to the premise of the question, this plant is not endemic to a single island.\n\n*Ficus concinna* has a wide native range, extending from India to Southern China and Borneo. Its distribution includes the Andaman Islands, Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, China, the Eastern Himalayas, India, Laos, Malaya, Myanmar, the Philippines, Sumatra, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nWhile it is found on several islands, it is not exclusively native to any single one. For instance, there is a record of it from Bod Gaya in the Semporna Islands of East Sabah, Borneo, and it is also found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Notably, the type specimen used for the original description of the species was collected in the Philippines, and the plant is described as a common strangler fig in the Philippines.\n\nOne source mentions it as being endemic to the tropical forests of Xishuangbanna, in Yunnan, China, but this contradicts information from major botanical databases which indicate a much broader distribution. Therefore, based on extensive botanical records, *Ficus concinna* is native to a large region of Asia and is not endemic to one specific island.\n\n<<<The plant is not endemic to a single island, but is native to a wide region across Asia. The type specimen was collected in the Philippines.>>>"
