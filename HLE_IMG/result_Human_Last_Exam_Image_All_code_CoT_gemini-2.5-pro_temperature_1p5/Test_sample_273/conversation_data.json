    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each chiral center.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the main carbon chain.**\n\nFirst, we determine the IUPAC name to number the carbon atoms correctly. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which gets priority over the amine (-NH2). The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group has 5 carbons. Numbering to give the -OH group the lowest possible number (position 2), the IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n*   **C2:** Bonded to -OH, -CH3 (C1), the rest of the chain (C3), and an implicit Hydrogen.\n*   **C3:** Bonded to an ethyl group, the chain towards C2, the chain towards C4, and an implicit Hydrogen.\n*   **C4:** Bonded to a methyl group, a -CH2NH2 group, the chain towards C3, and an implicit Hydrogen.\n\n**Note on the drawing:** The drawing shows two \"dashed\" bonds (-OH and -CH3) on the leftmost chiral center (C2). This is a non-standard representation for a tetrahedral carbon. We will assume the most plausible intention: the horizontal backbone is in the plane of the paper, the C1-methyl group is part of this backbone, and the substituents on C2 are the -OH group (dashed, away) and an implicit Hydrogen (wedged, forward).\n\n**Step 2: Assign configuration for each chiral center.**\n\nWe will now analyze each center according to the CIP rules.\n\n```python\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Naming and Chiral Center Identification\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-OH) has 5 carbons.\")\n    print(\"Numbering to give -OH the lowest locant, the name is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The chiral centers are at C2, C3, and C4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- C2 Configuration ---\n    print(\"Step 2a: Configuration at C2\")\n    print(\"Groups attached to C2: -OH, -C3H(Et)C4..., -CH3 (C1), and -H (implicit).\")\n    print(\"Priorities (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (highest atomic number O)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3... group (C bonded to C, C, H)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3 group (C bonded to H, H, H)\")\n    print(\"4: -H (lowest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"Orientation: The drawing implies C1 and C3 are in the plane, -OH is dashed (away), so the lowest priority group (-H) must be wedged (forward).\")\n    print(\"Path 1->2->3: -OH -> C3 -> CH3.
