  # The puzzle is a mate in 1.
  # The move is for the black rook on a3 to move to h3.
  # This move is a checkmate for the following reasons:
  # 1. The white king on f4 is in check from the black rook on h3.
  # 2. All escape squares for the king are either attacked or blocked:
  #    - e5 is attacked by the black pawn on d6.
  #    - g5 is attacked by the black rook on h3.
  #    - e4 is attacked by the black pawn on f5.
  #    - f3 is attacked by the black pawn on g4.
  #    - g3 is blocked by a white pawn.
  # 3. The check cannot be blocked.
  # 4. The checking piece (rook on h3) cannot be captured. The white pawn on g3
  #    cannot capture on h3 as it's not a valid pawn capture move.
