    "An analysis of the provided algorithm reveals its time complexity. Let's break down the logic step by step to formulate and solve the recurrence relation for its worst-case performance.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Structure**: The function `sort(a, n)` is recursive.\n    *   **Base Case**: If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: If `n > 1`, the function performs the following actions:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: An unconditional recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: A comparison.\n        3.  `swap(...)`: A swap operation (if the condition is met).\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: A second recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`, which is executed *only if* the swap occurs.\n\n2.  **Worst-Case Scenario**: To find the worst-case time complexity, we need to consider the input that maximizes the number of operations. The number of operations is maximized when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true at every step of the recursion. This forces the second recursive call to be executed every time. An array sorted in descending order (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) would trigger this worst-case behavior.\n\n3.  **Recurrence Relation**: Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    *   The first recursive call costs `T(n-1)`.\n    *   The comparison and swap take constant time, let's call it `c` or `O(1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the second recursive call is always made, costing another `T(n-1)`.\n    *   This gives us the recurrence relation: `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c`, which simplifies to:\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation**: Let's expand the relation:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2*T(n-2) + c) + c = 4*T(n-2) + 2c + c = 2^2*T(n-2) + 3c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2*T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8*T(n-3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3*T(n-3) + 7c`\n    *   The general pattern is `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`.\n    *   By setting `k = n-1`, we get `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`.\n    *   Since `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`.\n\nThis means the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this exponential growth by calculating the number of function calls (`C(n)`) based on the recurrence `C(n) = 2 * C(n-1) + 1`.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the O(2^n) complexity of the given algorithm\n    by showing how the number of recursive calls grows exponentially.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the sorting algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation for the number of calls, C(n), is:\")\n    print(\"C(n) = 2 * C(n-1) + 1 for n > 1, with the base case C(1) = 1.\")\n    print(\"This relation solves to C(n) = 2^n - 1, which indicates O(2^n) complexity.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let's calculate the number of calls for the first 10 values of n:\")\n    \n    # We use the closed-form solution C(n) = 2^n - 1 for calculations\n    for n in range(1, 11):\n        if n == 1:\n            print(f\"For n = {n}: C(1) = 1 call\")\n        else:\n            # C(n-1) = 2^(n-1) - 1\n            prev_calls = 2**(n - 1) - 1\n            # C(n) = 2^n - 1\n            current_calls = 2**n - 1\n            print(f\"For n = {n}: C({n}) = 2 * C({n-1}) + 1 = 2 * {prev_calls} + 1 = {current_calls} calls\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of calls approximately doubles with each increment of n, a characteristic of exponential growth.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
