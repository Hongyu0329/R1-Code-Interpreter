    # The arpeggio that follows consists of three notes:
    # 1. The black key C-sharp (C#)
    # 2. The white key E
    # 3. The black key G-sharp (G#)
    # This arpeggio spells out a C-sharp minor chord (C#-E-G#).
    # Therefore, the piece depicted starts in the key of C-sharp minor with an arpeggiated texture.
