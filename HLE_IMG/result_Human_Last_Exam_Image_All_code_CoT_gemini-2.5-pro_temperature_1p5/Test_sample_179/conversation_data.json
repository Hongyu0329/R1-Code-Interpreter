    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Image to Transcribe the Music:** I will carefully examine the piano roll visualization, including the piano keyboard at the bottom, to determine the notes being played. The pattern of black and white keys is crucial for accurate transcription.\n2.  **Identify Key and Texture:** Based on the transcribed notes, I will determine the key signature of the piece and its musical texture (e.g., chords, arpeggios, melody). The image shows a held bass note and a series of rising arpeggios.\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** The answer choices are opus numbers. I will identify the famous musical composition associated with each opus number.\n4.  **Match the Music to an Opus Number:** I will compare the musical information derived from the image (key, texture, opening notes) with the characteristics of the pieces from the answer choices.\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** I will select the opus number that corresponds to the piece that is the best fit, even if the visualization is slightly simplified or stylized. The key signature is often the most reliable clue in such cases.\n\nBased on this plan, here is the execution:\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by identifying the piano piece from the image and its opus number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the image to determine the notes, key, and texture.\n    # The keyboard at the bottom shows the standard pattern of 2 and 3 black keys.\n    # The first long note played aligns with the black key G-sharp (G#).\n    # The arpeggio that follows consists of three notes:\n    # 1. The black key C-sharp (C#)\n    # 2. The white key E\n    # 3.
