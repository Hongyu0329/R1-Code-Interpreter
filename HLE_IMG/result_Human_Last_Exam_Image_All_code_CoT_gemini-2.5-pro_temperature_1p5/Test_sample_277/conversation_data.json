    "The image provided is black and does not contain any molecules. Therefore, I cannot definitively determine the relationship between them.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that explains the different types of isomerism listed in the options. You can use these definitions to determine the correct answer once you have the structures of the molecules in question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a function in Python that prints out clear definitions for each term: conformers, constitutional isomers, identical molecules, and stereoisomers.\n2.  The script will guide you on how to apply these definitions to compare two chemical structures.\n3.  By running this code, you will get a clear explanation of the concepts needed to solve your problem.\n\n```python\ndef explain_chemical_relationships():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the different types of relationships between molecules,\n    as mentioned in the multiple-choice options.
