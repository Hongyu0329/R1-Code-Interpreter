    Solves the cellular automaton visualization puzzle.

    The 16 visualizations (A-P) are generated by 4 different totalistic CA rules.
    Rule 'i' generates visualizations for time steps t = i+1, i+2, i+3, and i+4.

    By analyzing the visual characteristics and size progression of the patterns,
    we can group them into four distinct evolutionary sequences.

    1.  Starts with a small cross, evolves into sparse, complex crosses/stars.
        - G (size 3) -> L (size 7) -> N (size 11) -> A (size 13)
        - As 'G' is the smallest pattern, this sequence must correspond to Rule 1, starting at t=2.
        - R1_Labels = "GLNA"

    2.  Starts with a solid square core, evolves into rings and dense patterns.
        - C (size 5) -> H (size 7) -> M (size 9) -> P (size 15)
        - This sequence starts with a small pattern 'C' and fits the time slots for Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6).
        - R2_Labels = "CHMP"

    3.  Starts with disconnected corner motifs that evolve into bars, then a star, then a complex grid.
        - J (size 5) -> F (size 9) -> E (size 11) -> B (size 15)
        - This sequence starts with 'J' and fits the time slots for Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7).
        - R3_Labels = "JFEB"

    4.  Starts with different disconnected motifs, evolves through a cross phase, then into other shapes.
        - K (size 5) -> O (size 7) -> D (size 9) -> I (size 9)
        - This sequence starts with 'K' and fits the time slots for Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8).
        - R4_Labels = "KODI"

    Combining these results gives the final answer.
