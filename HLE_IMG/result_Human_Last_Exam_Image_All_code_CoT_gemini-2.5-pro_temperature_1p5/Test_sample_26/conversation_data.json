    "This is a music theory question. To solve this, I will identify the key signature, the notes in the specified measure, and then determine the chord's name and its function within the key to find the correct Roman numeral.\n\n1.  **Key Signature:** The piece is Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, \"Pathétique\". The overall key is C minor.\n2.  **Measure and Notes:** We need to analyze the chord in measure 30. Looking at the sheet music provided:\n    *   The left hand plays a low G.\n    *   The right hand plays a broken chord consisting of the notes G, B natural, D, and F sharp.\n    *   Combining these notes, we have the pitches G, B, D, F♯.\n3.  **Chord Identification:** Let's analyze the intervals above the root note, G:\n    *   G to B natural is a major third.\n    *   G to D is a perfect fifth.\n    *   G to F sharp is a major seventh.\n    *   A chord with a root, major third, perfect fifth, and major seventh is a Major 7th chord. Therefore, this is a G Major 7th chord (Gmaj7).\n4.  **Roman Numeral Analysis:** Now we determine the chord's function in the key of C minor.\n    *   The tonic (the first note of the scale) is C.\n    *   The note G is the fifth degree of the C minor scale. The Roman numeral for the fifth degree is V.\n    *   Since the chord built on G is a Major 7th chord, we combine the Roman numeral V with the quality M7.\n    *   Therefore, the full Roman numeral for this chord is V M7 (or Vmaj7). This is an unusual but powerful chromatic chord that strongly leads back to the C minor tonic chord in the following measure.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement,\n    and provides the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Notes identified from the sheet music in measure 30\n    notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\", \"F-sharp\"]\n    root = \"G\"\n    \n    # Determine the relationship of the root to the key\n    tonic = \"C\"\n    scale_degree = 5  # G is the 5th note in the C scale\n    \n    # Determine the chord quality\n    # G (root), B-natural (Major 3rd), D (Perfect 5th), F-sharp (Major 7th)\n    quality = \"Major 7th\"\n    \n    # Determine the Roman numeral\n    # 'V' represents the 5th scale degree.
