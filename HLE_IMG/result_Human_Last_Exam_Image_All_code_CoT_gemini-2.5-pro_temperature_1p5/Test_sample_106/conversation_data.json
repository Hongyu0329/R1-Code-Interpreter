    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving the analysis of a reaction product. The reaction shown is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpene alcohol, which results in a rearranged alkene. While the mechanism involves a complex series of [1,2] shifts (a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement), the question can be solved by carefully inspecting the final product structure and identifying the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the substituents:\n1.  Examine the chemical structure of the product molecule on the right side of the reaction arrow.\n2.  For each numbered position (1 through 5), I will identify the atom or group attached to the carbon backbone.\n3.  In chemical skeletal structures, a line extending from a carbon atom represents a bond. If the line terminates without an element symbol, it represents a methyl (CH3) group. If a bond is shown (often to indicate stereochemistry, like a wedge or dash) but no group is explicitly drawn, it usually indicates a hydrogen (H) atom.\n4.  I will apply these conventions to identify each substituent.\n    *   **Position 1:** Points to a wedged bond ending in a short line, which represents a CH3 group.\n    *   **Position 2:** Also points to a wedged bond representing a CH3 group.\n    *   **Position 3:** Points to a dashed bond with no group attached, indicating a hydrogen (H) atom whose stereochemistry is shown.\n    *   **Position 4:** Points to a wedged bond representing a CH3 group.\n    *   **Position 5:** Points to a dashed bond, similar to position 3, representing an H atom.\n5.  Finally, I will use a Python script to present the identified substituents in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_substituents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the substituents at the specified positions in the product molecule\n    and prints the result in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as \"1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\"\n    output_string = \", \".join([f\"{position} = {group}\" for position, group in sorted(substituents.items())])\n    \n    print(output_string)\n\nsolve_substituents()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
