# The missing simulation corresponds to a linear polymer with the lowest degree of destruction.

# Initial degree of polymerization
N0 = 20

# The degree of destruction 'a' is given by a = m/25.
# The missing plot is for m=1.
m = 1
a = m / 25

# The formula for the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn) for a linear
# polymer undergoing random scission is: Nn = N0 / (1 + (N0 - 1) * a)

# Calculate the number-average degree of polymerization
Nn = N0 / (1 + (N0 - 1) * a)
