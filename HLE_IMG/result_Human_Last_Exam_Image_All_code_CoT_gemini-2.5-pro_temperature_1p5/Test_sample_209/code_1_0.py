# The task is to re-identify a giraffe based on its unique coat pattern.
# After careful visual analysis of the target image and the options provided,
# I have identified the key distinguishing spot patterns on the giraffe's shoulder and back.

# Key features identified in the target image:
# 1. A distinctive hook-shaped spot just below the topline of the back.
# 2. Two smaller, parallel spots located directly beneath the hook-shaped spot.
# 3. A prominent spot shaped like a tilted square in the middle of the shoulder area.

# Comparing these features with each option:
# - A: Different color and pattern.
# - B: All key features match perfectly. The hook-shaped spot, the two smaller spots below it,
#      and the tilted square on the shoulder are all present and in the correct positions.
# - C: Different color and spot shapes.
# - D: Much darker coat and completely different pattern.
# - E: Similar color but the pattern does not match; the key features are absent.
# - F: Blurry image, but the visible pattern does not match the target's.

# Conclusion: Image B shows the same giraffe as the target image.

# The following code will print the letter corresponding to the correct image.
correct_answer = 'B'
print(f"The correct image is: {correct_answer}")
