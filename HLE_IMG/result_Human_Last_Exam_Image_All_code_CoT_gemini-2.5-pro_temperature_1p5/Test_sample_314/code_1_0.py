# Based on the step-by-step analysis of the band structure plots:

# Condition 1: Minimum hopping parameter (t).
# By elimination, this corresponds to simulation 3.
cond_1_simulation = 3

# Condition 2: Minimum overlap magnitude (|s|).
# Based on asymmetry analysis (Ratio = |E_min|/E_max), simulation 2 is the most symmetric (smallest ratio), thus has the minimum |s|.
cond_2_simulation = 2

# Condition 3: Unique overlap sign (sign(s)).
# Simulation 4 is the only one with s<0 (upward stretching), while others have s>0 (downward stretching).
cond_3_simulation = 4

# Condition 4: Maximum overlap magnitude (s).
# Based on asymmetry analysis, simulation 1 has the largest asymmetry ratio, thus has the maximum s.
cond_4_simulation = 1

# The problem asks for the simulation indices ordered by the condition met.
