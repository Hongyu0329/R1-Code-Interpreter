    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will follow the reaction sequence step by step, calculating the change in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n**Our plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.** We will break it down into its constituent parts: the bicyclic core and the para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group, and sum their atoms.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (CAN in ACN/H2O).** This is a standard reaction for the oxidative deprotection of a PMB group from a nitrogen atom. We will subtract the atoms of the PMB group and add a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Pd/C, H2).** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). We will also assume it is effective enough under these conditions to reduce the ketone (C=O) to an alcohol (CH-OH). This means adding two molecules of H2 (a total of 4 hydrogen atoms) to find the formula of Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (4 N HCl, 70 Â°C).** Heating an alcohol in strong acid is a classic method for dehydration. This will eliminate a molecule of water (H2O) to form a new double bond, yielding the final product. We will subtract H2O from the formula of Intermediate 2.\n5.  **Final Calculation and Output.** We will sum up all the atomic changes and present the final molecular formula.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final product's formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is a derivative of 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n    # Core: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one fragment\n    core = {'C': 7, 'H': 5, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 1}\n    # PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group: -CH2-C6H4-OCH3\n    pmb_group = {'C': 8, 'H': 9, 'O': 1}\n    # Starting material formula is the sum of the core and the PMB group.\n    start_material = {\n        'C': core['C'] + pmb_group['C'],\n        'H': core['H'] + pmb_group['H'],\n        'F': core['F'],\n        'N': core['N'],\n        'O': core['O'] + pmb_group['O']\n    }\n    print(\"Step 0: Starting Material Formula Calculation\")\n    print(f\"Bicyclic Core (C7H5F3NO) + PMB Group (C8H9O) = C{start_material['C']}H{start_material['H']}F{start_material['F']}N{start_material['N']}O{start_material['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Initialize the current formula with the starting material's formula\n    current_formula = start_material.copy()\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - PMB deprotection with CAN\n    # This reaction removes the PMB group (-C8H9O) and adds one hydrogen to the nitrogen atom.\n    print(\"Step 1: PMB Deprotection (CAN, ACN/H2O)\")\n    print(\"Change: - PMB group (-C8H9O) + 1 H\")\n    current_formula['C'] -= pmb_group['C']\n    current_formula['H'] -= pmb_group['H']\n    current_formula['O'] -= pmb_group['O']\n    current_formula['H'] += 1\n    int1_formula = current_formula.copy()\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: C{int1_formula['C']}H{int1_formula['H']}F{int1_formula['F']}N{int1_formula['N']}O{int1_formula['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2\n    # This reduces the C=C double bond and the C=O ketone, adding 4 hydrogen atoms in total (2 x H2).\n    print(\"Step 2: Hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2)\")\n    print(\"Change: + 4 H (for reduction of C=C and C=O)\")\n    current_formula['H'] += 4\n    int2_formula = current_formula.copy()\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: C{int2_formula['C']}H{int2_formula['H']}F{int2_formula['F']}N{int2_formula['N']}O{int2_formula['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Dehydration with HCl at 70 C\n    # This removes a molecule of water (H2O) from the alcohol formed in the previous step.\n    print(\"Step 3: Dehydration (4N HCl, 70 C)\")\n    print(\"Change: - 1 H2O\")\n    current_formula['H'] -= 2\n    current_formula['O'] -= 1\n    final_formula = current_formula.copy()\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Final Output\n    print(\"Final Product Formula Calculation Summary:\")\n    print(f\"Start: C{start_material['C']}H{start_material['H']}F{start_material['F']}N{start_material['N']}O{start_material['O']}\")\n    # Print the equation representing the changes\n    c_change = -pmb_group['C']\n    h_change = -pmb_group['H'] + 1 + 4 - 2\n    o_change = -pmb_group['O'] - 1\n    \n    # We can represent the entire transformation in one equation\n    # (Start) - PMB + H + 2*H2 - H2O = Final\n    # C15H14F3NO2 - C8H9O + H + H4 - H2O = C7H8F3N\n    print(f\"Overall change: - C{pmb_group['C']} H{pmb_group['H']} O{pmb_group['O']} (PMB) + H1 + H4 - H2O1\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    # Formatting the final formula string\n    formula_str = (\n        f\"C{final_formula['C']}\"\n        f\"H{final_formula['H']}\"\n        f\"F{final_formula['F']}\"\n        f\"N{final_formula['N'] if final_formula.get('N', 0) > 1 else ''}\"\n    )\n    print(f\"The molecular formula of the final product is: {formula_str}\")\n    \n    # Let's also print the equation with the final numbers\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"C: {start_material['C']} - {pmb_group['C']} = {final_formula['C']}\")\n    print(f\"H: {start_material['H']} - {pmb_group['H']} + 1 + 4 - 2 = {final_formula['H']}\")\n    print(f\"F: {start_material['F']} = {final_formula['F']}\")\n    print(f\"N: {start_material['N']} = {final_formula['N']}\")\n    print(f\"O: {start_material['O']} - {pmb_group['O']} - 1 = {final_formula.get('O', 0)}\")\n    return formula_str\n\nfinal_formula_string = calculate_product_formula()\n# The final answer format as requested.\n# print(f'<<<{final_formula_string}>>>')\n\n```\n<<<C7H8F3N>>>"
