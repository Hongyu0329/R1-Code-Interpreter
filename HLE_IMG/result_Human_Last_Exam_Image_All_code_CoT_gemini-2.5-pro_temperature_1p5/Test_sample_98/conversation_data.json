    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the artifact shown in the image. The medallion features two royal figures, one with a ram's horn, which is a characteristic feature of coinage from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Specifically, this is a well-known gold octodrachm depicting Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his sister-wife, Arsinoe II.\n2.  Next, I will determine the historical period of this medallion. These coins were first minted following the marriage of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, which occurred around the year 272 B.C.\n3.  Finally, I will identify the century corresponding to the year 272 B.C. This year falls within the 3rd century B.C.\n4.  I will then generate a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_medallion_century():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the century of the Ptolemaic medallion.\n    The medallion, a gold octodrachm of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II,\n    was first minted around 272 B.C.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year 272 B.C. is in the 3rd century B.C.\n    century_number = 3\n\n    # We format the output to state the century clearly.\n    # The equation here is simple: we are just presenting the number '3' in the final string.\n    print(f\"{century_number}rd century B.C.\")\n\nfind_medallion_century()\n```\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
