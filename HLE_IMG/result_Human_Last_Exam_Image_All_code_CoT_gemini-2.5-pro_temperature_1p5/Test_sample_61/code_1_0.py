# Let's determine the molecular formula for Compound A.
# The reaction described is the alkylation of a beta-keto ester followed by saponification and decarboxylation.
# The final product (A) is 2-benzyl-1-indanone.

# We will calculate the molecular formula by summing the atoms of its constituent parts.
# Product A = (Indanone Core) + (Benzyl Group)

# Part 1: Define atoms in the modified indanone core.
# The structure is a benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing a ketone.
# One hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by the benzyl group.
indanone_core_C = 9
indanone_core_H = 7
indanone_core_O = 1

# Part 2: Define atoms in the benzyl group (-CH2-C6H5).
benzyl_group_C = 7
benzyl_group_H = 7
benzyl_group_O = 0

# Part 3: Calculate the total number of atoms in compound A by summing the parts.
total_C = indanone_core_C + benzyl_group_C
total_H = indanone_core_H + benzyl_group_H
total_O = indanone_core_O + benzyl_group_O

# Display the calculation process and the final molecular formula.
