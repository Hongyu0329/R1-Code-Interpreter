def solve_rebus():
  """
  This function solves the rebus puzzle presented in the image.
  
  The puzzle consists of two parts:
  1. A visual pun on the sound of the idiom: People breaking a cobblestone ("булыжная") pavement.
  2. An illustration of the idiom's meaning: A contrast between a taxi and an old carriage, symbolizing choices of transport and the idea of not being extravagant.
  
  The Russian idiom "В булочную на такси не ездят" fits both parts:
  - "В булочную" (to the bakery) sounds like "булыжную" (cobblestone).
  - The meaning is "One doesn't take a taxi to the bakery," which advises against extravagance.
