    "Of course, I can help you solve this circuit problem. Here is my plan:\n\n**Circuit Analysis Plan**\n\n1.  **Identify Nodes and Voltages:** I will first identify the main nodes in the circuit. Based on the diagram:\n    *   The leftmost vertical wire is connected directly to the positive terminal of the 41V battery, so it's at a potential of **41 V**.\n    *   The bottom horizontal wire and the entire rightmost vertical wire are connected to the battery's negative terminal and the ground symbol, so they are at **0 V**.\n2.  **Analyze Circuit Topology:** I will trace the connections for each resistor.\n    *   Resistors `R1 (76 Ω)` and `R2 (8 Ω)` are connected in parallel between the 41 V source wire and the first middle node.\n    *   The wire where current `I` is measured is also connected between the 41 V source wire and that same middle node. A plain wire has negligible resistance, so it acts as a **short circuit** across the parallel resistors `R1` and `R2`.\n3.  **Simplify the Circuit:** Because `R1` and `R2` are shorted by the wire `I` is on, no current will flow through them. The voltage at the node where `R3` begins is therefore 41 V.\n4.  **Calculate Equivalent Resistance:** The remainder of the circuit consists of `R3 (14 Ω)` in series with the parallel combination of `R4 (11 Ω)` and `R5 (29 Ω)`. I will calculate this total equivalent resistance (`R_total`).\n5.  **Calculate Current I:** The current `I` is the total current flowing from the 41 V source into this simplified part of the circuit. I will use Ohm's Law (`I = V / R_total`) to find its value.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan and shows the calculation steps.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given electrical circuit to find the value of current I.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the component values from the circuit diagram\n    V_source = 41  # Voltage in Volts\n    R1 = 76        # Resistance of R1 in Ohms\n    R2 = 8         # Resistance of R2 in Ohms\n    R3 = 14        # Resistance of R3 in Ohms\n    R4 = 11        # Resistance of R4 in Ohms\n    R5 = 29        # Resistance of R5 in Ohms\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # According to the analysis, I flows from the source into a path\n    # consisting of R3 in series with the parallel combination of R4 and R5.\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of R4 and R5 in parallel (R_45)\n    R_45 = (R4 * R5) / (R4 + R5)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the total resistance of the path for current I\n    R_total = R3 + R_45\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the current I using Ohm's Law\n    I = V_source / R_total\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"An analysis of the circuit shows that the wire with current 'I' creates a short circuit across resistors R1 and R2.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the current I flows into the rest of the circuit, which consists of R3 in series with the parallel combination of R4 and R5.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation is as follows:\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"1.
