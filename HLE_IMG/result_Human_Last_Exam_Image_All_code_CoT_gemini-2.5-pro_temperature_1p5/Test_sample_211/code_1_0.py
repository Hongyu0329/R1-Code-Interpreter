# The user wants me to identify the correct bird from the options.
# I have visually analyzed the target image and compared it to options A through I.
#
# Key features of the Target bird:
# 1. A distinct scalloped pattern on the back and upper wings.
# 2. Prominent white edges on the lower wing feathers.
# 3. A specific small dark mark/feather imperfection on the upper-right side of the back.
# 4. A particular posture, with the head turned slightly to its left.
#
# Comparing with the options:
# - A, F: Lighting is too dark.
# - B, G: Coloration is too light/washed out.
# - D, H: The angle is different.
# - I: The pattern, while similar, doesn't match as closely on the upper back.
# - E: A very strong candidate, likely the same bird, but the posture is slightly more upright.
# - C: This image is a near-perfect match. The lighting, coloration, posture, and the specific details of the feather pattern, including the small dark mark, all align with the target image.
#
# Therefore, image C is the correct answer.
# The following code will print the final answer.

correct_image = 'C'
print(f"The correct image is {correct_image}.")
