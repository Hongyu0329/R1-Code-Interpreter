    "This problem requires identifying the biological sexes of three pairs of insects (A, B, and C) based on visual dimorphism. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** Both insects shown are likely from the genus *Coelioxys* or a similar kleptoparasitic bee group. A key characteristic for females in this group is a highly modified, sharply pointed abdomen (tergum) used to lay eggs in the nests of other bees. Both individuals in pair A exhibit this pointed abdomen. Therefore, both are females. This corresponds to option 2 (F, F).\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. We can distinguish males and females by several features. The individual on the left has shorter antennae and a more slender build with a pointed abdomen, which are typical characteristics of a female. The individual on the right has longer antennae with curled tips and a very yellow face (clypeus), which are classic traits of a male paper wasp. Thus, the pair is a female and a male. This corresponds to option 4 (F, M).\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** This pair belongs to the Eucerini tribe, commonly known as long-horned bees. The name itself hints at the primary sexual dimorphism. The individual on the left has extremely long antennae that are much longer than its head, a definitive characteristic of a male. The individual on the right has significantly shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. Therefore, the pair is a male and a female. This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\n\nThe resulting sequence of indices for pairs A, B, and C is 2, 4, 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the indices for the biological sexes of the three insect pairs.\n    - Pair A: Both insects are female Cuckoo bees with pointed abdomens. (F, F) -> Index 2\n    - Pair B: The left wasp is a female (shorter antennae), and the right wasp is a male (yellow face, longer antennae). (F, M) -> Index 4\n    - Pair C: The left bee is a male Long-horned bee (very long antennae), and the right is a female (shorter antennae). (M, F) -> Index 3\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices corresponding to the options: 1) M,M  2) F,F  3) M,F  4) F,M\n    answer_A = 2  # F, F\n    answer_B = 4  # F, M\n    answer_C = 3  # M, F\n    \n    # Print the answer in the required format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<2, 4, 3>>>"
