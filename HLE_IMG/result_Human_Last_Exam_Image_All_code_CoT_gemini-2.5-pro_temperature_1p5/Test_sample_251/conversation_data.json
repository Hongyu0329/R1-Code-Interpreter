    "To determine the longest R-R interval in seconds from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Paper Speed:** The ECG is recorded at a standard speed of 25 mm/sec. This means:\n    *   One small square (1 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 1/25 = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   One large square (5 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 5 * 0.04 = 0.20 seconds.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the entire ECG strip, we can identify the longest pause between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complexes). This pause is clearly visible in the fourth rhythm strip, starting around the time marker `0:06:08`.\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** We will measure the distance between the R-wave preceding the pause and the R-wave ending the pause by counting the grid squares.\n    *   The interval spans approximately 8 full large squares.\n    *   There are an additional 3 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** We will now convert this measurement into seconds using the known paper speed.\n    *   Duration from large squares: 8 large squares * 0.20 seconds/large square = 1.60 seconds.\n    *   Duration from small squares: 3 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = 0.12 seconds.\n    *   Total duration = 1.60 seconds + 0.12 seconds = 1.72 seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the time values for small and large squares on a standard ECG (25 mm/sec).\n# 2. Identify and count the number of large and small squares in the longest R-R interval from the image.\n# 3. Calculate the total time in seconds.\n# 4. Print the calculation steps and the final result.\n\n# Time conversion factors for an ECG at 25 mm/sec\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 0.04\ntime_per_large_square_sec = 0.20\n\n# Measurement from the ECG strip for the longest R-R interval\nnum_large_squares = 8\nnum_small_squares = 3\n\n# Calculate the total duration in seconds\nduration_from_large_squares = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square_sec\nduration_from_small_squares = num_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\ntotal_rr_interval_sec = duration_from_large_squares + duration_from_small_squares\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Calculation for the longest R-R interval:\")\nprint(f\"The longest interval spans {num_large_squares} large squares and {num_small_squares} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"Time for large squares: {num_large_squares} * {time_per_large_square_sec} s = {duration_from_large_squares:.2f} s\")\nprint(f\"Time for small squares: {num_small_squares} * {time_per_small_square_sec} s = {duration_from_small_squares:.2f} s\")\nprint(f\"Total R-R interval = {duration_from_large_squares:.2f} s + {duration_from_small_squares:.2f} s = {total_rr_interval_sec:.2f} s\")\nprint(\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {:.2f} seconds.\".format(total_rr_interval_sec))\n```\n<<<1.72>>>"
