    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction followed by a Python script to detail the resulting compound A.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a three-component reaction, a variant of the Strecker synthesis. It involves an amine (2-aminopyridine), a dialdehyde (o-phthalaldehyde), and a cyanide source (trimethylsilyl cyanide, TMSCN).\n2.  **Role of Reagents**:\n    *   **2-Aminopyridine**: Acts as the primary amine nucleophile.\n    *   **o-Phthalaldehyde**: Provides two electrophilic carbonyl centers.\n    *   **TMSCN**: In the presence of a fluoride source like KF and water, it generates the cyanide anion (CN⁻). The fluoride ion attacks the silicon atom, releasing cyanide. Water also facilitates the generation of HCN which is the active cyanide species.\n    *   **KF/Water**: Catalyzes the release of cyanide from TMSCN and provides the aqueous medium for the reaction.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism**:\n    *   **Step 1: Imine Formation**: The primary amine group of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde, followed by dehydration to form an imine intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2: Cyanide Addition**: The cyanide ion (CN⁻) then attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine. This is the key step of the Strecker synthesis, forming an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\n    *   **Step 3: Intramolecular Cyclization**: The newly formed secondary amine group in the α-aminonitrile intermediate attacks the second, unreacted aldehyde group on the same molecule. This intramolecular reaction forms a five-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Step 4: Product Formation**: The cyclization results in a stable cyclic hemiaminal. This structure, an isoindolin-1-ol derivative, is the final product, Compound A. The reaction does not proceed to dehydration to form an isoindole under these mild conditions.\n\n### **Identity of Compound A**\n\nBased on the mechanism, Compound A is **3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindolin-1-ol**. It has the molecular formula **C₁₄H₁₁N₃O**.\n\nThe following Python script will summarize the reaction and calculate the molecular weight of the product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chemical reaction and provides details about the product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Reactant Information ---\n    # The effective reactants are 2-aminopyridine, o-phthalaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN),\n    # as TMSCN reacts with water to form HCN and TMSOH.\n    reactants = {\n        \"2-Aminopyridine\": \"C5H6N2\",\n        \"o-Phthalaldehyde\": \"C8H6O2\",\n        \"Hydrogen Cyanide\": \"HCN\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Product Information ---\n    # The reaction is a three-component synthesis leading to a specific heterocyclic product.\n    # The overall reaction is: C5H6N2 + C8H6O2 + HCN -> C14H11N3O + H2O\n    product_A = {\n        \"name\": \"3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindolin-1-ol\",\n        \"formula\": \"C14H11N3O\"\n    }\n    \n    water = {\n        \"name\": \"Water\",\n        \"formula\": \"H2O\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Atomic Weights (g/mol) ---\n    atomic_weights = {\n        'C': 12.011,\n        'H': 1.008,\n        'N': 14.007,\n        'O': 15.999\n    }\n\n    def get_molecular_weight(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the molecular weight of a compound from its formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        \n        # Find all atom-count pairs in the formula (e.g., C14, H11, N3, O)\n        # re.findall will find patterns like 'C14', 'H11', 'N3', 'O1' (implicitly)\n        elements = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        \n        total_weight = 0.0\n        for element, count in elements:\n            # If count is an empty string, it means 1 atom\n            num_atoms = int(count) if count else 1\n            if element in atomic_weights:\n                total_weight += num_atoms * atomic_weights[element]\n        return total_weight\n\n    # --- Output the Results ---\n    print(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The reaction is a three-component synthesis of a substituted isoindoline.\")\n    print(\"\\nReaction equation with stoichiometry and molecular formulas:\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    # Here, we print the balanced chemical equation.\n    print(\"1 C5H6N2 + 1 C8H6O2 + 1 HCN -> 1 C14H11N3O + 1 H2O\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Product A Details ---\")\n    print(f\"Name: {product_A['name']}\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {product_A['formula']}\")\n    \n    # Calculate and print molecular weight\n    mw = get_molecular_weight(product_A['formula'])\n    print(f\"Molecular Weight: {mw:.3f} g/mol\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindolin-1-ol>>>"
