    "My plan to identify the figure is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the visual elements in the ancient Greek vase painting. The image displays a dramatic scene involving a chariot.\n2.  I will identify the central figure who is in control of the chariot. This figure is wearing distinctive clothing, specifically a patterned, long-sleeved garment and an ornate headdress, which are typical signifiers for a non-Greek, often \"Eastern,\" character in Greek art.\n3.  I will recognize the mythological narrative. The scene of a woman in a chariot, often depicted as winged or drawn by dragons (though here it appears to be horses), escaping over the bodies of the dead, is one of the most famous and frequently depicted episodes from the myth of Medea.\n4.  This specific scene portrays Medea's escape from Corinth after she has murdered her two sons (seen as pale figures in the chariot with her) and Jason's new wife. The man being trampled on the ground is also a victim of her flight.\n5.  Based on this iconographic evidence and the well-known myth, the figure driving the chariot and thus \"leaving\" is the sorceress Medea.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this identification.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to pretty-print the explanation\ndef explain_and_identify():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the identification of the figure in the vase painting\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The original image is a famous red-figure vase from Southern Italy (Apulia),\n    # dated to around 330-310 BC.\n    \n    # It depicts a key moment from the myth of Medea.\n    mythological_scene = \"The escape of Medea from Corinth.\"\n    \n    # Analysis of the main figure:\n    # The figure driving the chariot is a woman.\n    # Her clothing, particularly the Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap) and the patterned,\n    # long-sleeved garment, identifies her as a foreigner, specifically from the East\n    # (in mythology, Colchis on the Black Sea).\n    figure_in_chariot = \"A woman in 'Eastern' or Phrygian attire.\"\n    \n    # This specific iconography is consistently used for the sorceress Medea.\n    # She is leaving Corinth in a magical chariot, sent by her grandfather Helios (the sun god),\n    # after taking revenge on her husband Jason.\n    # Her revenge included murdering their two sons (depicted as the pale, lifeless figures in the\n    # chariot with her) and Jason's new wife, Glauce.\n    # The figure on the ground being trampled is another victim of her wrathful escape.\n    \n    # Conclusion: The figure commanding and leaving in the chariot is Medea.\n    identified_figure = \"Medea\"\n    \n    print(f\"The figure driving the chariot and leaving the scene is {identified_figure}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nexplain_and_identify()\n\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
