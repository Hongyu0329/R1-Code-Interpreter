    "Based on the image provided, my plan is to:\n1.  Identify the prominent white, fuzzy object on the plant's stem.\n2.  Recognize this object as a type of insect gall, specifically a wool sower gall found on oak trees.\n3.  Explain that this gall is clear evidence of insect activity, created by a gall wasp.\n4.  Detail the life cycle, explaining that the female wasp lays her eggs *into* the oak's stem or the vein of a leaf, which then triggers the tree to form the gall as a protective home for the developing larvae.\n5.  I will generate a Python script to print this explanation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the insect activity visible in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The prominent white, fuzzy object is the main evidence of insect activity.\n  object_name = \"wool sower gall\"\n  \n  # This gall is created by a specific insect.\n  insect_name = \"cynipid gall wasp (Callirhytis seminator)\"\n  \n  # The location where the eggs are laid to create the gall.\n  egg_location = \"the stem or the central vein of a developing oak leaf\"\n  \n  print(\"Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image.\")\n  print(f\"The white, fuzzy ball on the twig is a '{object_name}'.\")\n  print(f\"This gall is created by the {insect_name}.\")\n  print(\"\\nWhere the eggs are laid:\")\n  print(\"The gall itself is evidence that the wasp has *already* laid its eggs.\")\n  print(f\"The female wasp injects her eggs directly into the plant's tissue, specifically on {egg_location}.\")\n  print(\"The tree then reacts by growing the gall, which provides food and shelter for the larvae developing inside.\")\n\nexplain_insect_activity()\n```\n<<<Yes, the image shows a wool sower gall on an oak tree, which is evidence of a cynipid gall wasp. The wasp lays its eggs inside the woody tissue of the oak's stem or the central vein of a leaf, causing the gall to form around the larvae.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there evidence of insect activity in this image?
