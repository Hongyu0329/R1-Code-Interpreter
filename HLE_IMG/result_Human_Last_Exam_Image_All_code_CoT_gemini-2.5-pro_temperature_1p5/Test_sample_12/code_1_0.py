  Analyzes the provided framework to answer the question about learner differences.

  explanation = """Based on the provided text and diagram, the framework defines the salience of diagnostic information through four components: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity. Let's analyze each one:

1.  **Access:** Described as whether information is 'physically available', which is a characteristic of the simulation's design.
2.  **Prominence:** Described as how much information 'stands out' due to factors like 'audiovisual cues and plot structure', which are elements designed into the simulation.
3.  **Simplicity:** Described by the 'amount and complexity' of information and the 'number of diagnostic decisions', which are determined by the designers of the simulation.
4.  **Clarity:** Described as how 'clearly the available information leads to precise and unambiguous diagnostic decisions', which is a property of the information itself within the simulation.

In all cases, these components are presented as controllable properties of the simulation or the stimuli within it. The text and diagram do not mention that these factors depend on or are adjusted for the learner's individual differences (such as prior knowledge, experience, or cognitive abilities). Therefore, within the context of this specific framework, salience is treated as an objective feature of the simulation's design, not a subjective experience dependent on the learner.
