    The reaction to form compound A proceeds in two major steps under the given conditions (0.1 M HCl, reflux, 12 h):

    1.  **Hydrolysis:** The starting material shown in the image is a trityl-like cation where the three phenyl rings are linked by isopropylidene ketal bridges (-O-C(CH3)2-O-). In the presence of aqueous acid and heat, these three ketal groups are hydrolyzed. This step breaks the bridges and forms an intermediate, the tris(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium cation, releasing three molecules of acetone.
        Intermediate Formula: [C19H15O6]+

    2.  **Intramolecular Dehydration/Cyclization:** The intermediate, being highly crowded, undergoes a subsequent triple dehydration reaction under the harsh reflux conditions. Three pairs of adjacent hydroxyl groups from neighboring phenyl rings react to eliminate three molecules of water (H2O) and form three new ether (-O-) linkages.

    3.  **Compound A:** The final product, Compound A, is a large, C3-symmetric, planar, fused polycyclic aromatic cation. Its structure consists of the central carbocation fused to the three phenyl rings via the newly formed ether bridges.
        Final Product (A) Formula: [C19H9O3]+
