# Parameters of the Goldberg Polyhedron

# Step 1: Define the parameters m and n based on visual inspection.
# By tracing the path of hexagons between two adjacent pentagons in the image,
# we observe a straight path of 4 hexagons, a 60-degree turn, and
# another straight path of 2 hexagons. Given the hint m > n, we set:
m = 4
n = 2

# Step 2: Define the number of pentagonal faces, P.
# For any Goldberg polyhedron, the number of pentagons is a constant 12.
P = 12

# Step 3: Calculate the number of hexagonal faces, H, using the formula.
# The formula is H = 10 * (m^2 + m*n + n^2 - 1).
# We break this down to show the calculation steps.
m_squared = m**2
m_times_n = m * n
n_squared = n**2
T_number = m_squared + m_times_n + n_squared
H = 10 * (T_number - 1)

# Step 4: Print the full calculation and the final answer in the specified format.
# The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.
