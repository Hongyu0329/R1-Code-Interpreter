# Plan:
# 1. Define the fundamental power loss.
# 2. Calculate the loss from the 3rd harmonic (10% of fundamental).
# 3. Calculate the loss from the 5th harmonic (10% of fundamental).
# 4. Sum all losses to get the total loss and print the final equation.

# 1. Given fundamental power loss in MW.
fundamental_loss = 2.0

# Define the percentage of additional loss per harmonic order.
harmonic_loss_factor = 0.10  # 10%

# 2. Calculate the power loss due to the 3rd harmonic.
third_harmonic_loss = fundamental_loss * harmonic_loss_factor

# 3. Calculate the power loss due to the 5th harmonic.
fifth_harmonic_loss = fundamental_loss * harmonic_loss_factor

# 4. Calculate the total power loss.
total_loss = fundamental_loss + third_harmonic_loss + fifth_harmonic_loss

# Output the results including the equation as requested.
