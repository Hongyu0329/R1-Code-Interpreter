    "The user wants me to identify which of the four Iridium complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. The key difference between them is the number of fluorine atoms on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorine atoms per ppy ligand (difluoro-ppy).\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has no fluorine atoms per ppy ligand (ppy).\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has one fluorine atom per ppy ligand (monofluoro-ppy).\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has three fluorine atoms per ppy ligand (trifluoro-ppy).\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability and Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of these emitters in LECs is largely dependent on their chemical stability, especially their resistance to oxidation during device operation.\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Adding fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand withdraws electron density from the molecule.\n    *   This electron withdrawal stabilizes the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which has significant character on the Iridium center and the phenyl rings.\n    *   A lower (more stable) HOMO makes the complex more difficult to oxidize.\n    *   Increased oxidative stability leads to less degradation and, therefore, a longer device lifetime.\n\n3.  **Identify Complexes with Shorter Lifetimes:** Based on the reasoning above, the lifetime of the complexes is expected to increase with the degree of fluorination.\n    *   Expected Lifetime Order: Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2.\n    *   The question asks for the complexes with **shorter** lifetimes. These are the least stable complexes, which are the ones with the fewest fluorine atoms.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the number of fluorine atoms for each complex.\n    *   Sorts the complexes based on this number to find the ones with the fewest fluorine atoms.\n    *   Prints the reasoning and the numbers of the identified complexes.\n\n```python\ndef find_shorter_lifetime_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which of the four Iridium complexes are expected to have\n    shorter lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based\n    on their chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the complexes and their level of fluorination.\n    # This level serves as a proxy for chemical stability.\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'fluorine_count': 2},\n        2: {'fluorine_count': 0},\n        3: {'fluorine_count': 1},\n        4: {'fluorine_count': 3},\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the scientific principle.\n    print(\"Scientific Principle:\")\n    print(\"The lifetime of an emitter in an LEC is related to its chemical stability.
