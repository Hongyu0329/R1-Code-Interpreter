    "Answering this question requires understanding how the 3D atomic arrangement of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice appears when projected onto a 2D plane. Each viewing direction creates a unique 2D pattern.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical pattern:** First, I will establish the known theoretical 2D pattern for an FCC lattice when viewed along the [110] direction.\n2.  **Analyze the given images:** I will then examine each of the four images (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the theoretical pattern.\n3.  **Use coordinates for verification:** For the best match, I will use the coordinates from the image's axes to calculate the aspect ratio of its unit cell and compare it to the theoretical value.\n4.  **Final conclusion:** Based on the pattern type and aspect ratio, I will identify the correct image.\n\nThe python code below will print out this step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_crystallography_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided crystal lattice patterns to identify the\n    FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Theoretical Background\n    print(\"Step 1: Theoretical Pattern for FCC [110] View\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice projected along the [110] direction results in a 'centered rectangular' pattern.\")\n    print(\"This means the projected atoms form a grid of rectangles, with an atom at each corner and one in the center of each rectangle.\")\n    print(\"The ideal ratio of the rectangle's side lengths (let's call them L1 and L2) is L1/L2 = sqrt(2) or 1/sqrt(2).\")\n    sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)\n    print(f\"So, the aspect ratio should be approximately {sqrt_2:.3f} or {1/sqrt_2:.3f}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the Image Options\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of the Provided Images\")\n    print(\" - Image A: Shows a simple rectangular pattern. It lacks atoms in the center of the rectangles. This is incorrect.\")\n    print(\" - Image B: Shows a centered pattern. However, the rectangle appears to be a square (equal side lengths, ratio = 1). This pattern corresponds to the FCC [100] view. This is incorrect.\")\n    print(\" - Image C: Shows a complex pattern that does not resemble a simple centered rectangle. This is incorrect.\")\n    print(\" - Image D: Clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. The rectangle is visibly not a square. This is the correct pattern type.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Quantitative Verification of Image D\n    print(\"Step 3: Verification of Image D using coordinates\")\n    print(\"Let's identify a unit cell in Image D and check its aspect ratio.\")\n    # By observing Image D, we can estimate the coordinates of the atoms forming a centered rectangular cell.\n    # Corner atoms are at approximately y=6.5 and y=12.5, and x=0.5 and x=5.5.\n    height = 12.5 - 6.5\n    width = 5.5 - 0.5\n    \n    # There is also a center atom at approximately (3, 9.5), which is the center of the rectangle.\n    \n    ratio = height / width\n    \n    print(f\"The rectangle height is approximately {12.5} - {6.5} = {height}\")\n    print(f\"The rectangle width is approximately {5.5} - {0.5} = {width}\")\n    print(f\"The aspect ratio is height / width = {height} / {width} = {ratio:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"This calculated ratio {ratio:.2f} is different from the ideal {sqrt_2:.2f}, which can be due to plotting distortions. However, the qualitative pattern—a non-square, centered rectangle—is the key identifier.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Conclusion\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"Image D is the only option that displays the correct 'centered rectangular' pattern characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n\nsolve_crystallography_problem()\n<<<D>>>"
