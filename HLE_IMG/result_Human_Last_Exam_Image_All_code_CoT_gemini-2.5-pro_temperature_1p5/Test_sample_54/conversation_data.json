    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. I will identify the reagents A and B by analyzing the structural changes between the reactant and product for each step.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the first reaction (1 → 2) to find Reagent A:**\n    *   Compound **1** is a pyrylium salt derivative, characterized by a positively charged oxygen atom within a six-membered aromatic ring. This structure is highly electrophilic.\n    *   Compound **2** is an N-aminopyridinium salt derivative. The oxygen atom of the pyrylium ring in compound **1** has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is further bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   The conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-substituted pyridinium salt is a classic reaction in heterocyclic chemistry. It occurs by reacting the pyrylium salt with a primary amine (R-NH₂). The amine acts as a nucleophile, leading to a ring-opening and subsequent ring-closing mechanism that incorporates the nitrogen atom into the ring.\n    *   To obtain an N-aminopyridinium salt (with a >N⁺-NH₂ group) as in compound **2**, the primary amine used must be **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is Hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the second reaction (2 → 3) to find Reagent B:**\n    *   Compound **2** is an N-aminopyridinium salt, featuring an amino group (-NH₂) on the positively charged nitrogen.\n    *   Compound **3** is an N-propylpyridinium salt. The N-amino group of compound **2** has been replaced by an N-propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This transformation (`>N⁺-NH₂` → `>N⁺-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) is a specific type of reductive alkylation. It is a known, though less common, reaction where N-aminopyridinium salts react with aliphatic aldehydes to yield N-alkylpyridinium salts.\n    *   The reaction proceeds as follows: `Py⁺-NH₂ + R-CH₂-CHO → Py⁺-CH₂-CH₂-R`. The alkyl group introduced onto the nitrogen corresponds to the alkyl group of the aldehyde, plus one additional CH₂ group from the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.\n    *   In our case, the product **3** has an n-propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). To form this group, the aldehyde must be **propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO)**. In the formula `R-CH₂-CHO`, R would be `CH₃`. The resulting N-alkyl group is `-CH₂-CH₂-R` which becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B is Propanal**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given chemical transformations.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = {\n        \"name\": \"Hydrazine\",\n        \"formula\": \"H2N-NH2\"\n    }\n\n    reagent_B = {\n        \"name\": \"Propanal\",\n        \"formula\": \"CH3CH2CHO\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The problem shows a two-step synthesis starting from compound 1.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Compound 1 -> Compound 2, using Reagent A.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: Compound 2 -> Compound 3, using Reagent B.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the analysis of the structural changes:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A['name']} ({reagent_A['formula']})\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B['name']} ({reagent_B['formula']})\")\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂), B is Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO)>>>"
