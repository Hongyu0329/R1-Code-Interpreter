The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis), identifiable by its reddish-brown body and the ornate, whitish markings on its scutum (the shield on its back). 
    
Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the deer tick. American Dog Ticks are not competent vectors for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. However, they can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, so caution and proper removal are still essential after any tick bite."""
