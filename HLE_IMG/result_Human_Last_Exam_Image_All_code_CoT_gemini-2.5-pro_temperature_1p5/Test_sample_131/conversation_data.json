    "My plan to identify the alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Chemical Structure:** I will examine the provided image to identify the key structural features of the molecule, such as the ring system, functional groups, and stereochemistry.\n2.  **Identify the Core Skeleton:** The molecule has a distinctive tetracyclic (four-ring) system containing two nitrogen atoms. One of the rings includes a lactam (a cyclic amide) functional group. This framework is characteristic of a well-known class of alkaloids.\n3.  **Search and Match:** I will compare this structure against a database of known alkaloids. The specific ring fusion and stereochemistry will allow for a precise match.\n4.  **Provide the Name:** Based on the match, I will provide the common name for this alkaloid compound.\n5.  **Generate Code:** As per the instructions, I will write a Python script that prints the name of the compound.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n    The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid containing a lactam.\n    This specific structure corresponds to the compound known as Matrine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
