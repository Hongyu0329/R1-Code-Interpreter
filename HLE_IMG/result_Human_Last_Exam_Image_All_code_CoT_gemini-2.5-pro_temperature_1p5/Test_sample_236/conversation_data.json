    "I will identify the insect in the image and provide its scientific name using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the insect:** The image displays an insect with distinct black and orange markings. It is sitting on a yellow flower, likely goldenrod. The key features are its black head, orange-and-black pronotum (the segment behind the head), and black wings with orange/red borders. These characteristics strongly suggest it is an Eastern Boxelder Bug.\n2.  **Find the scientific name:** The scientific name for the Eastern Boxelder Bug is *Boisea trivittata*.\n3.  **Create Python code:** I will write a simple Python script to print this scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the animal in the image and returns its scientific name.\n    The animal is identified as the Eastern Boxelder Bug.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scientific name for the Eastern Boxelder Bug\n    scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
