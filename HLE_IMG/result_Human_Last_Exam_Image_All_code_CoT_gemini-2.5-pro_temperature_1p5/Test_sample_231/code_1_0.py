    # Step 1: Deduce the molecular formula of cation A from the provided image and reaction type.
    # The structure is a complex dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium cation.
    # Based on a detailed structural analysis of the drawing, a plausible formula is derived.
    # Let's assume A = [C34 H31 O8]+. This structure contains 7 methoxy groups.

    # C is formed by the demethylation of all 7 methoxy groups (-OCH3) in B to hydroxyl groups (-OH).
    # Each demethylation corresponds to a loss of a CH2 group.
