    "This Kenken puzzle is unsolvable as presented due to logical contradictions in its design. The most straightforward contradiction can be found by analyzing the rightmost column. I will provide a Python script that explains this proof.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Focus on the rightmost column (Column 3) of the 4x4 grid.\n2.  This column is divided into two cages: a top cage of two cells with the rule `8*` (product is 8), and a bottom cage of two cells with the rule `8+` (sum is 8).\n3.  According to Kenken rules, the four cells in this column must contain a unique set of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n4.  For the top cage (`8*`), the only pair of distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4} that can be multiplied to get 8 is {2, 4}.\n5.  This means the numbers in the top two cells of this column must be 2 and 4.\n6.  Consequently, the numbers in the bottom two cells of this column must be the remaining numbers, which are {1, 3}.\n7.  The rule for the bottom cage is `8+`, meaning the numbers in it must sum to 8.\n8.  However, we deduced the numbers must be 1 and 3. Their sum is 1 + 3 = 4.\n9.  This leads to a contradiction: the sum must be 8, but it can only be 4. Therefore, the puzzle has no solution.\n\nThe following Python code will print this logical argument. As the puzzle is unsolvable, a top row cannot be determined. The code will instead output the numbers involved in the contradictory equation (`1 + 3 = 4`) as requested by the prompt's instruction.\n\n```python\ndef explain_contradiction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains why the provided Kenken puzzle is unsolvable by analyzing its rightmost column.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This puzzle contains a logical contradiction and cannot be solved.\")\n    print(\"Here is a step-by-step proof based on the rightmost column:\")\n    \n    # The set of numbers allowed in a 4x4 Kenken puzzle.\n    kenken_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    \n    # Define the cages in the rightmost column\n    top_cage_rule = \"8*\"\n    bottom_cage_rule = \"8+\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the top cage\n    print(f\"\\n1.

Their actual sum is {num1} + {num2} = {actual_sum}.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Final conclusion\n    print(f\"\\n4. This creates a contradiction: the sum must be {target_sum}, but it is impossible for it to be anything other than {actual_sum}.\")\n    print(\"   - Therefore, the puzzle is unsolvable.\")\n\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nThe final contradictory equation is 1 + 3 = 4.
