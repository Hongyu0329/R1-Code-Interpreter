    "To solve this problem, I will first visually identify the timestamps corresponding to the center of each synchronized burst of neuronal activity. These bursts are visible as dense vertical bands in the provided raster plot. Then, I will calculate the time intervals between each consecutive burst. Finally, I will compute the average of these inter-burst intervals and round the result to two significant figures.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps**: By examining the x-axis (Time in seconds), the synchronized bursts appear to be centered at approximately 5 s, 17 s, 28 s, 37 s, and 49 s.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between each successive burst.\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will sum the calculated intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n4.  **Format and Output**: The final Python code will perform these calculations and print the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts, calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs),\n    and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph\n    burst_timestamps = [5, 17, 28, 37, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the calculation and the final result\n    # Constructing the equation string\n    intervals_str = ' + '.join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    equation = f\"({intervals_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCalculation for average inter-burst interval:\")\n    # Using the print function to display each number in the equation\n    print(f\"Average = ({inter_burst_intervals[0]} + {inter_burst_intervals[1]} + {inter_burst_intervals[2]} + {inter_burst_intervals[3]}) / 4 = {average_ibi:.2f} s\")\n    \n    # Rounding to two significant figures for the final answer.\n    # For a number like 11.00, two significant figures is 11.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_ibi:.1g}\") if average_ibi >= 10 else float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s (rounded to two significant figures).\")\n    \n    return final_answer\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    result = calculate_average_ibi()\n    # The final answer format is handled by the platform,\n    # but we can print it here for clarity.\n    # print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
