    This function identifies the city from the image provided.
    
    The image shows a beach at sunset next to a large body of water.
    Key features that help in identification are:
    1.  The large body of water is consistent with Puget Sound.
    2.  The presence of a bonfire on the beach. Beach bonfires are a popular and permitted activity in specific parks in the area.
    3.  The forested shoreline across the water.
    4.  The overall scenery is strongly indicative of Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington.
    
    Therefore, the city is identified as Seattle.
