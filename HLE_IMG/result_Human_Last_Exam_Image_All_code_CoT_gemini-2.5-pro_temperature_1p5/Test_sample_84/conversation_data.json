    "The coat of arms in the image is a stylized representation of the coat of arms of Ochakiv, a city in the Mykolaiv Oblast of southern Ukraine.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the similarities:\n*   **Shield Division:** Both are divided horizontally (\"per fess\").\n*   **Top Field:** The top part is blue (\"azure\") and features a crescent moon.\n*   **Bottom Field:** The bottom part is gold/yellow (\"or\") and features a black crab (\"sable\").\n*   **Symbolism:** The colors blue and yellow are the national colors of Ukraine. The city is located on the Black Sea coast, which explains the crab.\n\nThe crown and the surrounding wreath of olive and oak branches in the image are artistic embellishments and differ from the official greater coat of arms of Ochakiv, but the central shield is a clear match.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the city with a coat of arms similar to the one provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Ochakiv, Ukraine\"\n    print(f\"The city with a coat of arms very similar to the one in the image is: {city_name}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Ochakiv, Ukraine>>>"
