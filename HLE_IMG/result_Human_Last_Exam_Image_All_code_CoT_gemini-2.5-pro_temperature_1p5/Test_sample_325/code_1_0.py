def solve_reaction_diffusion_plots():
    """
    This function determines the parameter change for each plot based on qualitative analysis.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Plot 2 is the baseline '0'.
    2. We analyze the time-evolution plots (bottom row) to see how concentrations of A and B change relative to the baseline at a late time (t=40).
    3. Plot 5: ca(40) is up, cb(40) is up. This signature (faster transport, more fuel, more product) uniquely matches doubled diffusion 'D'.
    4. Plot 1: ca(40) is down, cb(40) is down. This signature (slower transport, less fuel, less product) uniquely matches halved diffusion 'd'.
    5. Plot 3: ca(40) is down, cb(40) is up. This indicates a faster reaction. We assign it 'K' (doubled rate constant).
    6. Plot 4: ca(40) is up, cb(40) is down. This indicates a slower reaction. We assign it 'k' (halved rate constant).
    7. Plot 6: ca(40) is way up, cb(40) is way down. This indicates a much slower reaction. The flat shape of ca in the spatial plot points to a higher reaction order. We assign it 'N' (doubled order).
    
    The resulting six-character string is formed by these assignments.
