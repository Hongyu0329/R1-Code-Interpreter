  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites.

The primers are E1F1, E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R,E1F2, and E1F3. Primer pairs and PCR cycles are indicated above each panel.The lengths of the PCR products are (B) band 1, 190 bp; band 2, 159 bp; (C) band 1, 584 bp; band 2, 553 bp; (D) 551 bp; (E) 1,005 bp; (F) 972 bp; (G) band 1, 1,003 bp; band 2, 931 bp. The intensity of band 1 in (G) increased relative to band 2. (H) Band 1, 450 bp; band 2, 419 bp; (I) bands 1–4, 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n\nBased on this information, find all splice species.

    "Based on the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify and count the unique splice species by analyzing the bands in each gel panel. Each distinct band, especially when identified with splice-junction specific primers, represents a unique splice variant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Analyze each panel (B-I) to identify the number of unique splice species it reveals.\n2.  Account for experiments that confirm existing species versus those that identify new ones. For example, Panel C confirms the two species from Panel B, so it doesn't add to the total count. Panel I is a more sensitive version of Panel H, so we'll use the higher count from Panel I.\n3.  Sum the number of unique species from each informative experiment to get the total count.\n\nThe informative panels that reveal unique species are:\n*   **Panel B:** Shows two splice variants.\n*   **Panel D:** Uses a splice-junction primer (E1F2) and shows one new species.\n*   **Panel E:** Shows a unique product size with a new primer combination, indicating another species.\n*   **Panel G:** Uses a different splice-junction primer (E1F3) and shows two new species.\n*   **Panel I:** Shows four distinct splice variants connecting the early and late regions.\n\nThe python code below calculates the total by summing the counts from these panels.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of splice species based on the analysis\n    of the provided RT-PCR gel image results.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step identification of splice species from the RT-PCR results:\")\n\n    # Panel B (E1F1/E4R) reveals two alternatively spliced products.\n    species_from_B = 2\n    print(f\"- Panel B shows {species_from_B} bands, representing 2 splice species.\")\n    print(\"  (Panel C confirms these 2 species, but adds no new ones).\")\n\n    # Panel D (E1F2/E5R) uses a primer (E1F2) specific for the 929^3465 splice junction,\n    # identifying one specific species.\n    species_from_D = 1\n    print(f\"- Panel D, using a splice-junction primer, identifies {species_from_D} new species.\")\n    print(\"  (Panel F confirms this species with a different primer, but adds no new ones).\")\n\n    # Panel E (E1F1/L2R) shows a band of a unique size (1,005 bp) compared to other\n    # products in the same region, representing another distinct species.\n    species_from_E = 1\n    print(f\"- Panel E shows a unique band, representing {species_from_E} new species.\")\n    \n    # Panel G (E1F3/L2R) uses a primer (E1F3) specific for the 929^3506 splice junction,\n    # revealing two different species that share this splice.\n    species_from_G = 2\n    print(f\"- Panel G, using another splice-junction primer, shows {species_from_G} bands, representing 2 new species.\")\n\n    # Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles) shows four distinct bands, which are all different splice variants.\n    # This is a more sensitive amplification than Panel H, so we use its count.\n    species_from_I = 4\n    print(f\"- Panel I reveals {species_from_I} distinct bands, representing 4 new splice species.\")\n\n    # The total number of species is the sum of unique species found in these panels.\n    total_species = species_from_B + species_from_D + species_from_E + species_from_G + species_from_I\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of unique splice species:\")\n    print(f\"Total species = {species_from_B} (from B) + {species_from_D} (from D) + {species_from_E} (from E) + {species_from_G} (from G) + {species_from_I} (from I)\")\n    print(f\"Total species = {species_from_B} + {species_from_D} + {species_from_E} + {species_from_G} + {species_from_I} = {total_species}\")\n\n    # This is the final answer for the user prompt.\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, {total_species} splice species can be found in this image.\")\n    print(f\"\\n<<<10>>>\")\n\ncalculate_splice_species()\n```"
