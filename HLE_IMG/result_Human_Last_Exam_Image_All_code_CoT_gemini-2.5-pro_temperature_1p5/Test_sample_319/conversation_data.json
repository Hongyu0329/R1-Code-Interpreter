    "The image you've provided is a visual representation of a famous auditory illusion. The top panel is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of a sound over time. The bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the image depicts:\n1.  A continuous pure tone is playing (the single horizontal line in the spectrogram and the regular sine wave).\n2.  This tone is briefly interrupted by a burst of noise (the vertical smear in the spectrogram).\n3.  The tone then continues.\n\nThe illusion occurs because a human listener would not perceive a silence during the noise burst. Instead, their brain would \"fill in\" the missing part of the tone, making it seem as though the tone continued uninterrupted right through the noise. This is the **Auditory continuity illusion**. It's a powerful example of how our brain makes assumptions to create a coherent perception of the world from incomplete sensory data.\n\nTo provide the answer as requested, here is a Python script that prints the name of the phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef solve_illusion_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion\n  represented by the provided spectrogram and waveform.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The phenomenon where a sound is perceived as continuous even when\n  # it's interrupted by another sound (e.g., noise) is known as the\n  # Auditory continuity illusion.\n  phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n  print(phenomenon_name)\n\nsolve_illusion_name()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
