    Reaction analysis:
    1. Intermediate: Ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate from triethyl phosphonoacetate.
       SMILES: C=C(P(=O)(OCC)OCC)C(=O)OCC
    2. Second step reagents: 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde (from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol) and Et3N.
       SMILES: O=CCS
    3. Reaction: Thia-Michael addition followed by intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons cyclization.
       - Thiolate attacks the double bond.
       - Ylide forms at the carbon bearing the phosphonate.
       - Intramolecular attack on the aldehyde.
       - Ring formation (5-membered) and double bond creation.
    4. Product SMILES: O=C(OCC)C1=CSCC1
