    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the chemical transformation, followed by a Python script that explains the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\nThe overall transformation shown is a photochemical reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. To understand the pericyclic reactions involved, we can break down the process into two sequential steps.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Photochemical Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene.**\n    The first step involves the reactant hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). Under UV light (indicated by *hv*), aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo valence isomerization to form less stable, strained isomers. In this case, hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to its Dewar form: hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene. This reaction is a pericyclic reaction. Specifically, it can be described as an **intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**. It involves the interaction of two pi bonds (4π electrons in total) within the same molecule to form two new sigma bonds, creating a cyclobutane-like ring structure within the molecule. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Cycloaddition of the Intermediate with Cyclobutene.**\n    The highly reactive intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, has two double bonds. It then reacts with the second starting material, cyclobutene. The reaction occurs between one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This forms a new four-membered ring, linking the two molecules together to yield the final product. This reaction is an **intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**. It involves a 2π electron system from the Dewar benzene and a 2π electron system from cyclobutene (4π electrons in total). Just like the first step, this photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition is an allowed process.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nHere is a Python script that summarizes this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the given photochemical reaction and identifies the two\n    pericyclic reactions involved.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the photochemical transformation step-by-step:\")\n    print(\"=========================================================\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation of the first reaction\n    print(\"Step 1: The first pericyclic reaction\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The first reactant, hexafluorobenzene, absorbs light (hv) and undergoes a valence isomerization.\")\n    print(\"It converts into hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (a Dewar benzene derivative).\")\n    print(\"This reaction is an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\")\n    print(\"  - 'Intramolecular' because it occurs within a single molecule.\")\n    print(\"  - '[2+2]' because it involves two pi systems, each contributing 2 electrons, for a total of 4 pi electrons.\")\n    print(\"  - This type of reaction is photochemically allowed according to pericyclic reaction rules.\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation of the second reaction\n    print(\"Step 2: The second pericyclic reaction\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The reactive intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene.\")\n    print(\"A double bond from the Dewar benzene and the double bond from cyclobutene react to form the final product.\")\n    print(\"This reaction is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\")\n    print(\"  - 'Intermolecular' because it occurs between two different molecules.\")\n    print(\"  - '[2+2]' again signifies that two 2-pi-electron systems react to form a new four-membered ring.\")\n    print(\"  - This reaction is also photochemically allowed.\\n\")\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"-----------\")\n    answer = \"An intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition and an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\"\n    print(f\"The two pericyclic reactions involved are: {answer}\")\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{answer}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    analyze_pericyclic_reactions()\n```"
