# The side length of the red regular hexagon.
s = 3

# The reasoning is based on the 1:1 ratio of red and white shapes in the tiling,
# which implies their areas are equal.
# We calculate the area of the red hexagon.
# The formula for the area of a regular hexagon is (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2.

# Perform the calculation
area = (3 * math.sqrt(3) / 2) * (s**2)

# Print the explanation and the result.
# Remember to show each number in the final equation.
print("Based on the tiling properties, Area(white shape) = Area(red hexagon).")
