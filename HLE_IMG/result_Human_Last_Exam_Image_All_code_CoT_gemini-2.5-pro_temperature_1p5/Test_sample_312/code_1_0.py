def solve_nanotube_plots():
    """
    This function encapsulates the reasoning to determine the chiral index 'm' for each plot
    and prints the final result in the specified format.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  **Nanotube Properties for n=4:**
        - (4,0): Semiconducting (S). Chiral angle θ=0°. Smallest diameter among S-tubes.
        - (4,1): Metallic (M). θ=10.9°.
        - (4,2): Semiconducting (S). θ=19.1°.
        - (4,3): Semiconducting (S). θ=25.3°. Largest diameter among S-tubes shown.
        - (4,4): Metallic (M). θ=30° (Armchair). Largest diameter overall.

    2.  **Plot Identification Strategy:**
        There are 5 dipole plots (#1,3,5,7,9) and 4 oscillator strength (OS) plots (#2,4,6,8).
        The OS plots show 1 M-tube and 3 S-tubes, so the missing plot is for an M-tube.

    3.  **Assigning Dipole Plots (a complete set for m=0 to 4):**
        - Plot #9: Shows a large, clear bandgap. This corresponds to the semiconductor with the largest gap (smallest diameter), which is (4,0). Thus, Plot #9 is m=0.
        - Plot #1: Shows the unique, simple linear band crossing of an armchair (n,n) metallic tube. This must be (4,4). Thus, Plot #1 is m=4.
        - Plots #3, #5, #7 are for the remaining tubes: (4,1)M, (4,2)S, (4,3)S. They are distinguished by the number of energy bands, which relates to the number of atoms in the unit cell. The calculated order of band complexity is (4,2) < (4,1) < (4,3). The visual order of bands is #3 < #7 < #5. Matching gives: Plot #3 -> m=2, Plot #7 -> m=1, Plot #5 -> m=3.

    4.  **Assigning Oscillator Strength Plots (m=0,1,2,3; m=4 is missing):**
        - Plot #2: The only OS plot where cutting lines pass through K-points, identifying it as metallic. It must be (4,1) as (4,4) is the missing M-tube plot. Thus, Plot #2 is m=1.
        - Plots #4, #6, #8 are for the S-tubes (4,0), (4,2), (4,3). We distinguish them by the tilt of the cutting lines, which increases with the chiral angle.
        - The order of chiral angles is θ(0) < θ(2) < θ(3).
        - The visual order of the line tilt is Plot #4 < Plot #6 < Plot #8.
        - Matching gives: Plot #4 -> m=0, Plot #6 -> m=2, Plot #8 -> m=3.

    5.  **Final Sequence Construction:**
        Compiling the 'm' values for each plot from 1 to 9.
