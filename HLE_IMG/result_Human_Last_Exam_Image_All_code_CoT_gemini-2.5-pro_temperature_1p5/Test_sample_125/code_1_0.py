# Plan:
# 1. Identify all numerical locants from the chemical names given in the problem.
# 2. Group the numbers corresponding to the product and the reactants.
# 3. Calculate the sum of numbers for the product and the reactants separately.
# 4. Divide the product's sum by the reactants' sum to get the result.
# 5. Print the entire equation and the final answer in the specified format.

# Numbers from the product name: as-indaceno[3,2,1,8,7,6-pqrstuv]picene
product_locants = [3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6]

# Numbers from the starting material and reagent names:
# 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene -> 1, 4, 2
# 2-acetylnaphthalene -> 2
reactant_locants = [1, 4, 2, 2]

# Calculate the sums
sum_product = sum(product_locants)
sum_reactants = sum(reactant_locants)

# Calculate the final result
# The problem asks for the minimum number of steps, which should be an integer.
# We perform integer division.
min_steps = sum_product // sum_reactants

# Build the equation string for printing
product_eq_part = " + ".join(map(str, product_locants))
reactant_eq_part = " + ".join(map(str, reactant_locants))

# Print the final equation as requested
print(f"({product_eq_part}) / ({reactant_eq_part}) = {min_steps}")

# The final answer in the required format is not printed by the script itself
# but provided at the end of the entire response.
