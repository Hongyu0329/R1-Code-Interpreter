# The final answer is D. This is a conceptual question in biochemistry and molecular engineering.
# There is no calculation or code required to determine the answer.
# The reasoning is based on the chemical properties of fluorescein and common strategies
# for creating enzyme-activatable fluorescent probes.

# The reasoning process:
# 1. Identify key functional groups on fluorescein: two phenolic OH groups and one COOH group.
# 2. Understand how fluorescein fluorescence works: It depends on the equilibrium between a non-fluorescent lactone form and a fluorescent quinoid form.
# 3. Analyze how modifying each functional group affects fluorescence:
#    - Modifying OH groups (e.g., to esters) locks the molecule in a non-fluorescent state. This is effective caging.
#    - Modifying the COOH group (e.g., to an amide) removes a negative charge that stabilizes the fluorescent form, thus shifting the equilibrium to the non-fluorescent lactone. This is also effective caging.
# 4. Evaluate the uncaging strategy for cell-type specificity:
#    - The uncaging must be done by an enzyme expressed only in target cells.
#    - Option D suggests forming an amide bond and using an enzyme to cleave it. This is typically achieved by making the amide part of a specific peptide sequence that is a substrate for a highly specific protease.
#    - This protease-based activation is a very common and powerful method for achieving cell-type specificity.
#    - Option B, using an ester, is also valid. However, creating an ester cage that is selectively cleaved by one engineered esterase but not by any native cellular esterases can be more challenging than using a specific protease-peptide system.
# 5. Conclude that Option D presents a superior and more widely applicable strategy for achieving high genetic cell-type specificity.
