    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define a Calculation Method**: We will calculate a weighted average VMT for a single \"person trip\" under both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. This allows for a direct comparison. The total VMT is the sum of VMT from single-occupant cars and VMT from carpools.\n2.  **Calculate Baseline VMT**:\n    *   For each distance bracket (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles), calculate the person-miles traveled for single-occupant cars and carpools. This is done by multiplying: `(share of total trips in bracket) * (mode share for the car type in that bracket) * (average trip distance for the bracket)`.\n    *   Sum these values across all brackets to get the total person-miles for each car type.\n    *   For carpools, convert person-miles to vehicle-miles (VMT) by dividing by the average carpool occupancy (2.8 for Baseline). For single-occupant cars, person-miles are equal to vehicle-miles.\n    *   Sum the VMT from both car types to get the total Baseline VMT.\n3.  **Calculate Proposed VMT**:\n    *   Repeat the same process using the data from the Proposed table. The key differences will be the mode shares for cars and the increased average carpool occupancy (3.0 for Proposed).\n4.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**:\n    *   Use the standard formula for percentage change:\n        `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_car_vmt(scenario_name, mode_shares, carpool_occupancy, share_total_trips, avg_trip_dist):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per person trip for cars.\n    It prints the detailed calculation steps.\n    \n    Args:\n        scenario_name (str): The name of the scenario (e.g., \"Baseline\").\n        mode_shares (dict): Dictionary with mode shares for car types.\n        carpool_occupancy (float): The average occupancy for carpools.\n        share_total_trips (list): List of trip shares by distance.\n        avg_trip_dist (list): List of average distances for each bracket.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total calculated VMT for cars.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Calculating Car VMT for {scenario_name} Scenario ---\")\n    \n    # Calculate VMT for 'car, 1 occupant'\n    vmt_car_1_occupant = 0\n    equation_parts_1_occ = []\n    for i in range(len(share_total_trips)):\n        term = share_total_trips[i] * mode_shares[\"car_1_occupant\"][i] * avg_trip_dist[i]\n        vmt_car_1_occupant += term\n        equation_parts_1_occ.append(f\"({share_total_trips[i]}*{mode_shares['car_1_occupant'][i]}*{avg_trip_dist[i]})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate VMT for 'Car, 1 occupant'\")\n    print(f\"VMT_1_occupant = {' + '.join(equation_parts_1_occ)}\")\n    print(f\"VMT_1_occupant = {vmt_car_1_occupant:.4f}\")\n\n    # Calculate person-miles for carpools\n    person_miles_carpool = 0\n    equation_parts_carpool_pm = []\n    for i in range(len(share_total_trips)):\n        term = share_total_trips[i] * mode_shares[\"carpool\"][i] * avg_trip_dist[i]\n        person_miles_carpool += term\n        equation_parts_carpool_pm.append(f\"({share_total_trips[i]}*{mode_shares['carpool'][i]}*{avg_trip_dist[i]})\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate VMT for 'Car, with more than 2 occupants' (Carpool)\")\n    print(\"First, calculate total Person-Miles for carpools:\")\n    print(f\"Person-Miles_carpool = {' + '.join(equation_parts_carpool_pm)}\")\n    print(f\"Person-Miles_carpool = {person_miles_carpool:.4f}\")\n\n    # Convert person-miles to vehicle-miles (VMT)\n    vmt_carpool = person_miles_carpool / carpool_occupancy\n    print(f\"Then, divide by average occupancy to get VMT:\")\n    print(f\"VMT_carpool = {person_miles_carpool:.4f} / {carpool_occupancy} = {vmt_carpool:.4f}\")\n\n    # Calculate total car VMT\n    total_vmt = vmt_car_1_occupant + vmt_carpool\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate Total Car VMT for the scenario\")\n    print(f\"Total_VMT = VMT_1_occupant + VMT_carpool\")\n    print(f\"Total_VMT = {vmt_car_1_occupant:.4f} + {vmt_carpool:.4f} = {total_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    return total_vmt\n\n# --- Data from Tables ---\n\n# Common data for both scenarios\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\navg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n# Baseline Scenario Data from Table 1\nbaseline_mode_share = {\n    \"car_1_occupant\": [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42],  # Mode share for 'car, 1 occupant'\n    \"carpool\": [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]          # Mode share for 'car, with more than 2 occupants'\n}\nbaseline_carpool_occupancy = 2.8\n\n# Proposed Scenario Data from Table 2\nproposed_mode_share = {\n    \"car_1_occupant\": [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16],\n    \"carpool\": [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n}\nproposed_carpool_occupancy = 3.0\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# Calculate VMT for each scenario\nbaseline_vmt = calculate_car_vmt(\n    \"Baseline\", \n    baseline_mode_share, \n    baseline_carpool_occupancy, \n    share_of_total_trips, \n    avg_trip_distance\n)\n\nproposed_vmt = calculate_car_vmt(\n    \"Proposed\", \n    proposed_mode_share, \n    proposed_carpool_occupancy, \n    share_of_total_trips, \n    avg_trip_distance\n)\n\n# Calculate the percentage reduction\nreduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\npercentage_reduction = (reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n# --- Final Result ---\nprint(\"--- Calculating Final Percentage Reduction ---\")\nprint(f\"Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT\")\nprint(f\"Reduction = {baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f} = {reduction:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nPercentage Reduction = (Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is: {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n# Capture final answer for the system\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout \nsys.stdout = open('/dev/null', 'w')\nprint(f'<<<{percentage_reduction:.1f}>>>')\nsys.stdout.close()\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n```"
