# This problem requires matching short-term cellular automata patterns (1-15)
# with their long-term counterparts (A-O) based on visual characteristics.
# The matching is done by analyzing the evolution of features like shape,
# internal patterns, and overall behavior (e.g., expansion, replication).

# Let's outline the deduced matches:
# 1 -> A: Small checkerboard diamond grows into a large complex checkerboard pattern.
# 2 -> C: Hollow diamond grows and merges into a single large hollow diamond.
# 3 -> L: Diamond with a simple core grows and merges into a large diamond with a geometric interior.
# 4 -> M: Solid cross grows into a dense grid-like pattern.
# 5 -> E: Solid-looking diamond grows and merges into a large, bright, solid pattern.
# 6 -> F: Diamond with a '+' shaped hole evolves into a merged diamond with a complex, wavy interior.
# 7 -> G: Amorphous, fuzzy pattern expands into a large, chaotic, space-filling pattern.
# 8 -> K: Fuzzy star-shaped pattern evolves into a large, intricate fractal pattern.
# 9 -> B: A very small, faint "blinker" acts as a "gun", creating a sparse, regular grid of dots.
# 10 -> J: Diamond with a checkerboard shell grows and merges, retaining the checkerboard texture.
# 11 -> D: Sparse cross pattern is a replicator, creating four copies of itself.
# 12 -> N: Simple '+' sign evolves into a complex pattern with diagonal wavefronts (matched by elimination).
# 13 -> I: Diamond with an 'X' core evolves into two large, separate diamonds with complex interiors.
# 14 -> H: Small blocky diamond appears to be a replicator, creating four larger diamond-like patterns.
# 15 -> O: Diamond with a bright star-like core evolves into two large, separate diamonds with similar bright, star-like cores.

# We create an ordered dictionary to store the mapping from number to letter.
