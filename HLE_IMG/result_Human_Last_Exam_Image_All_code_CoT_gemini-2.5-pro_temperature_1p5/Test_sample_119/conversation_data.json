    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion (M+) peak is at m/z 135. An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (the Nitrogen Rule).\n*   The prominent fragment at m/z 91 is a classic indicator of a benzyl fragment, [C₆H₅-CH₂]⁺.\n*   Subtracting this fragment's mass from the molecular ion's mass gives 135 - 91 = 44. This remaining mass, containing one nitrogen, corresponds to an ethylamine fragment, -CH(NH₂)CH₃ or -CH₂CH₂NH₂.\n*   Combining the benzyl fragment and the C₂H₅N fragment gives a molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which is consistent with one benzene ring.\n\n**2. IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   The pair of peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the N-H stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   Signals above 3000 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C-H), below 3000 cm⁻¹ (aliphatic C-H), and at ~1450-1600 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C) confirm the presence of an aromatic ring and aliphatic chains.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   There are 7 unique carbon signals: 4 aromatic (δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) and 3 aliphatic (δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2).\n*   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n*   The aromatic region contains one quaternary carbon (δ 145.1, invisible in DEPT) and three types of CH carbons (giving 3 positive signals).\n*   The aliphatic region must therefore contain the CH₂ group (negative signal) and the remaining two positive signals (one CH and one CH₃).\n*   Based on chemical shifts, the aliphatic assignments are: δ 43.5 (CH₂), δ 49.6 (CH), and δ 19.2 (CH₃).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis:**\n*   The ¹H NMR confirms the structure: a multiplet for 5 aromatic protons (~7.3 ppm), a doublet for 3 methyl protons (~1.2 ppm), and complex signals for the remaining 3 aliphatic protons (~2.7-3.0 ppm).\n*   The doublet for the methyl group (-CH₃) indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates the proton and carbon signals, confirming the connectivities:\n    *   H at ~1.2 ppm correlates with C at δ 19.2 (-CH₃).\n    *   H at ~2.7 ppm correlates with C at δ 43.5 (-CH₂-).\n    *   H at ~2.9 ppm correlates with C at δ 49.6 (-CH-).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll data consistently point to the structure being **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**. The IUPAC name is derived by identifying the longest carbon chain with the principal functional group (propanamine), numbering it to give the amine the lowest number (propan-2-amine), and naming the substituent (1-phenyl).\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this analysis and prints the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data (MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, HSQC)\n    to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the unknown organic compound.\n    The analysis logic is summarized in the print statements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Fragment Identification ---\n    # From MS, IR, and NMR data, the key fragments are identified:\n    # - A phenyl group (C6H5-)\n    # - A primary amine group (-NH2)\n    # - A methylene group (-CH2-)\n    # - A methine group (-CH-)\n    # - A methyl group (-CH3)\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Structure Assembly and Naming ---\n    # Assembling these fragments consistent with all spectral data (especially NMR coupling)\n    # leads to the structure: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3.\n    # IUPAC Naming logic:\n    # - The parent chain with the amine is 3 carbons long: propane.\n    # - The amine is on position 2: propan-2-amine.\n    # - The phenyl substituent is on position 1: 1-phenyl.\n    \n    print(\"Based on the comprehensive analysis of all provided spectra,\")\n    print(\"the determined molecular structure is C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3.\")\n    \n    name_part_1 = \"1\"\n    name_part_2 = \"-phenylpropan-\"\n    name_part_3 = \"2\"\n    name_part_4 = \"-amine\"\n    \n    final_name = name_part_1 + name_part_2 + name_part_3 + name_part_4\n\n    print(\"\\nThe IUPAC name is constructed as follows:\")\n    print(\"Parent Chain: propane\")\n    print(f\"Amine Group at Position: {name_part_3}\")\n    print(f\"Phenyl Group at Position: {name_part_1}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final IUPAC Name ---\")\n    print(f\"The name is: {name_part_1}{name_part_2}{name_part_3}{name_part_4}\")\n\n\n# Execute the analysis to display the result.\nsolve_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
