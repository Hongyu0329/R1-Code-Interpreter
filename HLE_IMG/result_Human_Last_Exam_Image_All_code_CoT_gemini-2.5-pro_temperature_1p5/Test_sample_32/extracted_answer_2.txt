The main difference is in the **seta** (the stalk supporting the spore capsule). In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is short and **straight**, resulting in an erect capsule that sits upright among the leaves. In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is distinctly **curved** (arcuate), which causes the capsule to be nodding or drooping.
