    "This is a problem from the field of topology, specifically concerning three-manifolds and their Heegaard diagrams. To identify the three-manifold, we need to analyze the provided diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the Genus:** The genus of the Heegaard splitting is determined by the number of curves in the alpha-set (red) or the beta-set (blue). In this diagram, there are three alpha curves (`α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`) and three beta curves (`β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`). Therefore, this is a genus-3 Heegaard splitting.\n2.  **Analyze the Gluing Map:** The three-manifold is formed by gluing two genus-3 handlebodies. The way they are glued is described by the relationship between the alpha and beta curves. Specifically, we can determine the fundamental group of the manifold, `π₁(M)`, from the diagram. The group has a presentation with `g=3` generators (`x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`), corresponding to the alpha curves, and `g=3` relators, read from how the beta curves intersect the alpha curves.\n3.  **Read the Relators:** To find the relators, we trace each beta curve and record every time it crosses a disk bounded by an alpha curve.\n    *   The alpha curves (`α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`) are the small red circles around the inner vertices.\n    *   The beta curves (`β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`) are the larger blue loops that enclose the edges of the outer triangle.\n    *   By inspecting the diagram, we can see that the beta curves are drawn in a region completely separate from the alpha curves. There are no intersections between any alpha curve and any beta curve.\n4.  **Determine the Fundamental Group:** Since there are no intersections, the relators are trivial (i.e., they are the empty word, leading to the relation `1=1`). Thus, the fundamental group is the free group on 3 generators:\n    `π₁(M) = <x₁, x₂, x₃ | > = F₃`\n5.  **Identify the Manifold:** The prime three-manifold whose fundamental group is the free group on `g` generators (`F_g`) is the connected sum of `g` copies of `S¹ × S²`. Since we have `g=3`, the manifold is the connected sum of three copies of `S¹ × S²`. This is because a Heegaard diagram with disjoint alpha and beta curve systems is reducible and corresponds to such a connected sum.\n\nThe following Python code will formalize this conclusion and print the final equation for the manifold, explicitly showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Identify the genus of the Heegaard diagram.\n# The number of alpha curves (or beta curves) is 3.\ng = 3\n\n# Step 2: From the diagram, we observe that the alpha and beta curves are disjoint.\n# This implies the relators in the fundamental group presentation are trivial.\n\n# Step 3: Determine the fundamental group.\n# For a genus-g Heegaard diagram with trivial relators, the fundamental group\n# is the free group on g generators, F_g.\n# For g=3, this is F_3.\n\n# Step 4: Identify the corresponding 3-manifold.\n# The prime 3-manifold with fundamental group F_g is the connected sum (#)\n# of g copies of the product of a 1-sphere and a 2-sphere (S^1 x S^2).\n\n# Step 5: Construct and print the formula for the manifold.\n# We explicitly define the numbers used in the equation as requested.\nsphere_dim_1 = 1\nsphere_dim_2 = 2\n\n# Create the string for one component of the connected sum\ncomponent = f\"(S^{sphere_dim_1} \\u00d7 S^{sphere_dim_2})\" # using unicode for 'x'\n\n# Create the full manifold description\n# It is the connected sum of 'g' such components.\nmanifold_formula = f\" # \".join([component] * g)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"The Heegaard diagram represents the three-manifold M given by the following equation:\")\n# The final equation prints each number: the '1' and '2' for the sphere dimensions, repeated 3 times.\nprint(f\"M = {manifold_formula}\")\n\n```\n<<<M = (S¹ × S²) # (S¹ × S²) # (S¹ × S²)>>>"
