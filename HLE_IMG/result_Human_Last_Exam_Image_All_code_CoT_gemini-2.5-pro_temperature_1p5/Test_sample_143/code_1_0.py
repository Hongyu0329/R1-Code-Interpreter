    This function provides the solution to the plant identification puzzle.
    
    Analysis:
    - A: The right image shows a dense monoculture characteristic of an invasive species (Garlic Mustard). The left shows it in a more diverse, native-like setting. This is 'right invaded' (3).
    - B: The left image shows a dense, aggressive stand of lupines, typical of an invasion. The right shows a sparser, more balanced population, suggesting a native range. This is 'left invaded' (4).
    - C: The papaya plants in both images are not forming invasive monocultures. They appear as individual, non-dominant plants. This is best described as 'both native' or non-invasive (1).
    
    The final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.
