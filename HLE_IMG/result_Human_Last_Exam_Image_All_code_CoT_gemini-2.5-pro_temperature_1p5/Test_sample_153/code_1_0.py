    # The calculation combines the sequential efficiencies of the components.

    # --- Step 2: Assemble the final equations based on Option C ---
    # Option C uses the calculated factor of 0.9604 and the correct line impedance.
    # The coefficient for the reactive power compensation (0.979) is taken from the option,
    # as its derivation is not clear from the problem statement, but other options are flawed.
