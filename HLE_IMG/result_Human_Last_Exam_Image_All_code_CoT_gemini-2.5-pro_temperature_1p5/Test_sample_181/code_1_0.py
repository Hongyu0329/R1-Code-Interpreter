# Description of the plan and the physics behind the calculation.
print("To determine the shape of the Moon's orbit around the Sun, we need to compare the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Earth on the Moon.")
print("The shape of an object's path is determined by the net force acting on it; it always curves towards the direction of the net force.")
print("Let's calculate the ratio of the Sun's gravitational pull to the Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon.\n")

# Known astronomical constants
# We don't need the gravitational constant G or the moon's mass as they will cancel out in the ratio.
M_sun = 1.989e30  # Mass of the Sun in kg
M_earth = 5.972e24 # Mass of the Earth in kg
r_earth_moon = 3.844e8  # Average distance from Earth to Moon in meters
r_sun_earth = 1.496e11  # Average distance from Sun to Earth in meters (1 AU)

# We approximate the Sun-Moon distance as the Sun-Earth distance,
# as the Earth-Moon distance is very small in comparison.
r_sun_moon = r_sun_earth

# Gravitational Force Formula: F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2
# We calculate the terms for the ratio F_sun / F_earth
# F_sun_on_moon ~ G * M_sun * m_moon / r_sun_moon^2
# F_earth_on_moon = G * M_earth * m_moon / r_earth_moon^2
# The ratio simplifies to: (M_sun / M_earth) * (r_earth_moon / r_sun_moon)^2

force_ratio = (M_sun / M_earth) * (r_earth_moon / r_sun_moon)**2

print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
print(f"The Sun's gravitational pull on the Moon is approximately {force_ratio:.2f} times stronger than the Earth's pull.")
print("Because the Sun's force is always dominant, the net force on the Moon is always directed towards the Sun.")
print("This means the Moon's orbit around the Sun is always concave (curved inward) towards the Sun.")
print("It never loops backward or becomes convex. Therefore, the path looks like a slightly wavy circle.")
print("Over a short period of 2-4 months, this path segment looks like a simple, gentle curve that is always bending inward.")
