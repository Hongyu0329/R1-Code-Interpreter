    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use a method based on graph decomposition and counting. The overall plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure**: The graph has 5 vertices. I will identify a key subgraph that is easier to analyze. The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with one edge, (2, 5), removed. Let's call this subgraph `G_sub`.\n\n2.  **Partition Colorings of the Subgraph**: The rest of the graph consists of vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5. To determine the number of ways to color vertex 1, we need to know if its neighbors, 2 and 5, have the same color or different colors in a valid coloring of `G_sub`. Therefore, I will calculate two separate polynomials for `G_sub`:\n    *   `P_eq(k)`: The number of ways to color `G_sub` with `k` colors such that `color(2) = color(5)`.\n    *   `P_neq(k)`: The number of ways to color `G_sub` with `k` colors such that `color(2) â‰  color(5)`.\n\n3.  **Compute the Final Polynomial**: The total chromatic polynomial `P(G, k)` can be computed by considering these two cases:\n    *   For the colorings counted by `P_eq(k)`, vertices 2 and 5 have the same color. Vertex 1 must avoid this one color, so there are `(k-1)` choices for it. The total ways for this case is `P_eq(k) * (k-1)`.\n    *   For the colorings counted by `P_neq(k)`, vertices 2 and 5 have different colors. Vertex 1 must avoid these two colors, leaving `(k-2)` choices. The total ways for this case is `P_neq(k) * (k-2)`.\n    *   The final polynomial is the sum: `P(G, k) = P_eq(k) * (k-1) + P_neq(k) * (k-2)`.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: I will use Python with the `sympy` library to define `k` as a symbol and perform the polynomial calculations. This avoids manual algebraic errors and provides the final polynomial in both factored and expanded forms. The code will print out each step of the calculation to show how the final equation is constructed.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the chromatic polynomial for the given graph using a decomposition method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define k as a symbolic variable for the number of colors\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # The graph can be analyzed by considering the subgraph G_sub on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}\n    # and then adding vertex 1, which connects to 2 and 5.\n    # G_sub is a K4 with the edge (2,5) removed.
