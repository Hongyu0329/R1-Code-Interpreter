def solve_vortex_puzzle():
  """
  Analyzes 16 plots of three interacting vortices to identify the unique vortex.

  The analysis identifies the unique vortex in each plot (1-16) by its color and relative strength.
  - Uppercase (R, G, B) indicates a vortex with twice the strength of the other two.
  - Lowercase (r, g, b) indicates a vortex with half the strength of the other two.

  The principle is that a stronger vortex has a smaller, more central orbit,
  while a weaker vortex is tossed around on a larger, more complex orbit.
