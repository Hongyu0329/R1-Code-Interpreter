# Plan:
# 1. Based on visual analysis, map each plot number to an integer 'n' from 0 to 8.
#    Lower 'n' corresponds to lower eccentricity and less chaos (more regular plots).
#    Higher 'n' corresponds to higher eccentricity and more chaos (more complex plots).
#    The mapping derived from visual inspection is as follows:
#    Plot 1: Most regular -> n=0
#    Plot 3: Large stable sphere -> n=1
#    Plot 9: Smaller stable sphere -> n=2
#    Plot 8: Regular horizontal slices -> n=3
#    Plot 2: Fairly regular cross-sections -> n=4
#    Plot 7: Increasingly complex vertical slices -> n=5
#    Plot 4: More fragmented slices -> n=6
#    Plot 5: Small, distorted stable region -> n=7
#    Plot 6: Most chaotic -> n=8
