    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will read the words of the poem from the image and combine them into a single line. The words are \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", and \"work\".\n2.  Next, I will count the number of syllables for each word and sum them to find the total syllable count for the entire line.\n3.  Then, I will compare this total syllable count against the definitions of the metric patterns given in the answer choices.\n4.  Finally, for the most likely pattern, I will perform a scansion (analysis of stressed and unstressed syllables) to confirm if the poem's rhythm matches the pattern's structure.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef analyze_poem_meter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the given erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the poem's words and the syllable count for each.\n    # The poem text is reconstructed from the collage.\n    words = [\"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", \"work\"]\n    \n    # Syllable counts based on standard English pronunciation.\n    syllable_counts = {\n        \"rules\": 1,\n        \"and\": 1,\n        \"lines\": 1,\n        \"an\": 1,\n        \"intricate\": 3,\n        \"spider's\": 2,\n        \"web\": 1,\n        \"work\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Reconstruct the poem and list the syllables for each word.\")\n    poem_line = \" \".join(words)\n    print(f'The poem reads: \"{poem_line}\"')\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe syllable count for each word is as follows:\")\n    count_strings = []\n    for word in words:\n        # Remove punctuation for dictionary lookup.\n        clean_word = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\']', '', word)\n        count = syllable_counts[clean_word]\n        print(f\"- '{word}': {count} syllable(s)\")\n        count_strings.append(str(count))\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of syllables.\n    total_syllables = sum(syllable_counts.values())\n    equation = \" + \".join(count_strings)\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the total syllable count by summing the counts of each word.\")\n    print(f\"Total Syllables = {equation} = {total_syllables}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compare the total count with the definitions of the metric patterns.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze the syllable count against the choices.\")\n    print(f\"The poem has {total_syllables} syllables.
