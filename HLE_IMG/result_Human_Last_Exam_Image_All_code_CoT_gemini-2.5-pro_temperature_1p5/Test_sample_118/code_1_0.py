    This function prints the optimal path from Billoweg to Laubiweg.

    The optimal path is determined by these criteria in order:
    A) Minimum exchanges.
    B) Minimum stations.
    C) Latest possible exchanges.

    The analysis shows the best path is:
    1. Start at Billoweg on line 72.
    2. Travel to Giesshübel (9 stations).
    3. Exchange to line 5.
    4. Travel to Laubiweg (6 more stations).
    This path has 1 exchange and a total of 15 stations, which is the minimum possible.
