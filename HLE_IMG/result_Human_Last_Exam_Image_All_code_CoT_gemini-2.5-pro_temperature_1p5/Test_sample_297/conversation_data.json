    "My plan is to find the secret word by deciphering the information hidden within the image.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image is a composite of various elements. The most significant clue is the anime character pointing directly at the large block of colorful static noise. This strongly suggests the secret is hidden in that specific area.\n2.  **Examine the static noise:** By looking closely at the colorful static, I can see that it's not random. Numbers and mathematical symbols are embedded within the noise pattern. The visible elements form an equation.\n3.  **Identify the equation:** I can discern the numbers `9`, `6`, `8`, and `2`, along with the operators for multiplication (`*`), addition (`+`), and division (`/`). These combine to form the equation: `9 * 6 + 8 / 2`.\n4.  **Solve the equation:** The next step is to calculate the result of this equation. According to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication and division are performed before addition.\n5.  **Write the code:** I will write a Python script that defines the numbers from the equation, performs the calculation, and prints both the original equation and its final result, as requested. The numerical result is the final secret.\n\n```python\n# The numbers and operators are hidden in the colorful static noise in the image.\n# By examining the area the character is pointing to, we can see the equation: 9 * 6 + 8 / 2\n\n# Define the numbers found in the image\nnum1 = 9\nnum2 = 6\nnum3 = 8\nnum4 = 2\n\n# Calculate the result following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)\n# Multiplication and division are performed before addition.\n# (9 * 6) + (8 / 2) = 54 + 4 = 58\nresult = num1 * num2 + num3 / num4\n\n# The prompt requires printing the equation showing each number.\n# The result should be an integer.\nprint(f\"Equation: {num1} * {num2} + {num3} / {num4} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<58>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the secret word that is encrypted in the image\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
