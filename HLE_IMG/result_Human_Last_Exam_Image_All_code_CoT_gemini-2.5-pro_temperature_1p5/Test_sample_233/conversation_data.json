    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the Ingvar runestone from the provided image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Style:** The most striking feature of the runestone fragment is its unique style. The runes are inscribed within a grid of horizontal and vertical lines, creating rectangular boxes for the characters. This is a highly unusual design for a runestone.\n2.  **Identify as an Ingvar Runestone:** The prompt specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This narrows the search to a well-defined group of about 26 runestones commemorating those who died in Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to the Caspian Sea (c. 1036-1041).\n3.  **Cross-reference Style and Group:** By searching for Ingvar runestones with a grid or banded pattern, one particular stone stands out: **U 778** in Svinnegarn's Church, Uppland, Sweden. It is famous for this exact grid-like design.\n4.  **Confirm with Runic Text:** To confirm the identification, I will transliterate parts of the inscription from the image and compare them to the known text of U 778.\n    *   **The inscription on U 778 includes the phrase:** `... i : ikuars : liþi : kuþ : hialbi ...` which translates to \"... in Ingvar's retinue. May God help ...\".\n    *   **Matching the image:**\n        *   The end of the top row in the image reads `...rþi : i : iku...` which matches the end of `sturþi` (\"steered\") and the beginning of `i ikuars`.\n        *   The middle row reads `...ars : liþi...`, perfectly matching the end of `ikuars` (\"Ingvar's\") and the word `liþi` (\"retinue\").\n        *   The bottom row begins `...kuþ : hial...`, perfectly matching the beginning of the common runic prayer `kuþ hialbi` (\"God help\").\n5.  **Conclusion:** The visual style and the runic text are a definitive match for the runestone with the Rundata catalog ID **U 778**.\n\nHere is the Python code that outputs the identified ID.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image.\n    \n    The identification process is as follows:\n    1. The runestone's unique grid-like inscription style is noted.\n    2. This style is cross-referenced with the known Ingvar runestones.\n    3. The style is a definitive match for the runestone U 778 at Svinnegarn's Church, Sweden.\n    4. The runic text in the image is compared to the known inscription of U 778 to confirm.\n       - Image top row: ...rþi : i : iku...  (matches \"...sturþi : i : ikuars...\")\n       - Image middle row: ...ars : liþi... (matches \"...ikuars : liþi...\")\n       - Image bottom row: ...kuþ : hial... (matches \"...kuþ : hialbi...\")\n    5. The match is confirmed. The ID is U 778.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The ID of the runestone is composed of a region code and a number.\n    region_code = \"U\"\n    number = 778\n    \n    # Print the full ID\n    runestone_id = f\"{region_code} {number}\"\n    print(f\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {runestone_id}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<U 778>>>"
