    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image.
    
    The identification process is as follows:
    1. The runestone's unique grid-like inscription style is noted.
    2. This style is cross-referenced with the known Ingvar runestones.
    3. The style is a definitive match for the runestone U 778 at Svinnegarn's Church, Sweden.
    4. The runic text in the image is compared to the known inscription of U 778 to confirm.
       - Image top row: ...rþi : i : iku...  (matches "...sturþi : i : ikuars...")
       - Image middle row: ...ars : liþi... (matches "...ikuars : liþi...")
       - Image bottom row: ...kuþ : hial... (matches "...kuþ : hialbi...")
    5. The match is confirmed. The ID is U 778.
