    "This is a task that requires medical knowledge and cannot be solved by writing code. Based on my analysis of the provided histopathological image, here is the diagnosis.\n\nThe image displays a kidney glomerulus stained with H&E. The key pathological features are:\n1.  **Cellular Crescent:** The most striking feature is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped collection of cells filling Bowman's space, the area between the glomerular tuft and the outer capsule. This \"crescent\" is compressing the glomerular tuft. It is composed of proliferating parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells.\n2.  **Glomerular Hypercellularity:** The glomerular tuft itself is hypercellular, with an increased number of cells obscuring the normal capillary loop architecture.\n3.  **Fibrinoid Necrosis:** There are eosinophilic (pink), smudgy, and amorphous deposits within the glomerular tuft, consistent with fibrin deposition and necrosis of the capillary walls.\n\nThese findings, particularly the prominent cellular crescent, are the classic histopathological features of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This is the morphological hallmark of the clinical syndrome known as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), which is a medical emergency characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
