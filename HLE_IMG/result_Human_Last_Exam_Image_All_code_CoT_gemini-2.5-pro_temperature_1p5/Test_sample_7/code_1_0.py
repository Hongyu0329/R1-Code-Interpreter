  This function prints the formula for the second voltage plateau of a graphite anode.
  
  The derivation is as follows:
  1. The voltage of the first plateau (V_I) is related to the chemical potential of Stage 1 (mu_1):
     V_I = -(mu_1 - mu_ref) / e
  2. The voltage of the second plateau (V_II) is related to the chemical potential of Stage 2 (mu_2):
     V_II = -(mu_2 - mu_ref) / e
  3. By eliminating the reference potential (mu_ref) from these two equations, we get:
     V_II = V_I + (mu_1 - mu_2) / e
  4. Substituting the given value V_I = 0.09 V gives the final formula.
