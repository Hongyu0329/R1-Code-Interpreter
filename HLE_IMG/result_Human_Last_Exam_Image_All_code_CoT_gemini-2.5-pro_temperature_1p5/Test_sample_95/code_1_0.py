# Step 1 & 2: Set up the problem based on the provided constraints.
# We are looking for the smallest integer k > 1 such that (2k) is the hypotenuse
# of a Pythagorean triple (a, b, 2k), where a and b are non-zero integers.

k = 2
found = False
a, b = 0, 0
while not found:
    target_c_sq = (2 * k)**2
    # Search for integer solutions for a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    for i in range(1, 2 * k):
        j_sq = target_c_sq - i**2
        if j_sq > 0:
            j = math.isqrt(j_sq)
            if j*j == j_sq and j > 0:
                a = i
                b = j
                found = True
                break
    if not found:
        k += 1

# Step 3: From the smallest k, determine the parameters of the layout.
# From visual inspection, delta_y > delta_x, so we assign the larger value to b.
if a > b:
    a, b = b, a

r_w = 0.5 * k
delta_x = 0.5 * a
delta_y = 0.5 * b

# Step 4: Calculate the coordinates of the center of the right-most white circle (C6).
# Assume the center of the bottom-left circle (C1) is at (r_w, r_w).
x_c1 = r_w
y_c1 = r_w

# The right-most circle is C6 in the middle row.
# Its center is horizontally shifted from C1 by delta_x plus two diameters (4*r_w),
# and vertically by delta_y.
# Wait, the x-coord of the middle row's first circle (C4) is x_c1 + delta_x.
# C6 is two circles to the right of C4, so their centers are separated by 2 * (2*r_w).
# x_c6 = x_c4 + 4*r_w = (x_c1 + delta_x) + 4*r_w = 5*r_w + delta_x
x_c6 = 5 * r_w + delta_x

# The y-coord of the middle row's center is y_c1 + delta_y
y_c6 = y_c1 + delta_y

# The puzzle asks for the answer in the format x:y.
print(f"The radius of a white circle, r_w = {r_w} cm.")

print(f"The vertical shift between rows, delta_y = {delta_y} cm.")
print(f"The x-coordinate of the center is {5} * {r_w} + {delta_x} = {x_c6} cm.")
print(f"The y-coordinate of the center is {r_w} + {delta_y} = {y_c6} cm.")
