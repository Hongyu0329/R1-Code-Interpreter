    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the smallest angle by which the entire pattern can be rotated around a point to look identical to its original state. The order of rotational symmetry, *n*, is then calculated as 360 degrees divided by this smallest angle.\n\n1.  **Analyze the pattern:** The tiling is composed of three types of polygons: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, and orange rhombuses.\n2.  **Identify potential centers of rotation:** We look for points in the pattern around which a rotation can map the tiling onto itself.\n    *   **Center of a hexagon:** Let's consider the center of one of the dark blue hexagons. The hexagon itself has 6 sides. It is surrounded by 6 squares and 6 rhombuses in a symmetrical arrangement. If we rotate the pattern by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around the center of this hexagon, the hexagon maps onto itself, and each surrounding tile maps onto an identical tile. The entire tiling pattern remains unchanged. This indicates a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Center of a square:** Now, let's look at the center of a light yellow square. The square is surrounded by four rhombuses. Rotating the pattern by 360 / 4 = 90 degrees around the center of the square also leaves the entire tiling unchanged. This indicates a 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n3.  **Determine the overall symmetry:** A pattern can have multiple centers of rotation with different orders. The rotational symmetry of the entire tiling is defined by the highest order of rotational symmetry present.\n4.  **Conclusion:** We have found centers of 6-fold and 4-fold symmetry (as well as 2-fold). The highest order is 6. Therefore, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the minimum angle of rotation and states the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and explains the rotational symmetry of the given tiling.\n    \n    Through visual inspection, we can identify several points of rotational symmetry:\n    1. The center of each dark blue hexagon is a point of 6-fold symmetry.\n    2. The center of each light yellow square is a point of 4-fold symmetry.\n    3. The point where the acute angles of two orange rhombuses meet is a point of 2-fold symmetry.\n\n    The overall rotational symmetry of a pattern is defined by the highest order found.\n    In this case, the highest order is 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The highest order of rotational symmetry found in the tiling.\n    n_fold_symmetry = 6\n    \n    # Total degrees in a full rotation.\n    full_rotation_degrees = 360\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum angle of rotation that leaves the pattern invariant.\n    minimum_angle = full_rotation_degrees / n_fold_symmetry\n    \n    print(f\"The tiling has multiple centers of rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"The highest order of rotational symmetry is {n_fold_symmetry}-fold.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to rotating the tiling around the center of any of the hexagons.\")\n    print(\"The calculation for the minimum angle of rotation is:\")\n    # Print the equation with each number.\n    print(f\"{full_rotation_degrees} / {n_fold_symmetry} = {int(minimum_angle)} degrees.\")\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n\nprint(\"<<<6>>>\")\n```"
