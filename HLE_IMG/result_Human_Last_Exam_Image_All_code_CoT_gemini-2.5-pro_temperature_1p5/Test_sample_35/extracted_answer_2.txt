The protein S100B shows strong affinity for the V domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts). It could be used as a prognostic marker. The level of S100B directly correlates with the activation of pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. This correlation allows it to predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
