    explanation = f"""Based on the provided diagram, the protein {protein} exhibits a strong affinity for the {domain} of the {receptor}.

The S100B protein would serve as a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker in the pathology of neurological disorders. Here's the explanation:

1.  **Direct Causation of Pathology:** The diagram illustrates that the binding of {protein} to {receptor} directly initiates downstream signaling cascades that are central to disease progression. It activates both the {pathway_1} pathway, leading to caspase activation and cellular {outcome_1} (programmed cell death), and the {pathway_2} pathway.

2.  **Predicting Disease Severity:** The activation of {pathway_2} results in the production of {outcome_2}, which, along with other factors, drives the ultimate pathological outcomes: {final_outcome}. Since the over-expression of {protein} is the trigger for these degenerative processes, its concentration levels would directly correlate with the extent of neuroinflammation and neuronal loss.

Therefore, measuring S100B levels does more than just help confirm a diagnosis (adjunct role); it provides crucial information about the potential future course and severity of the disease, making it a valuable prognostic marker."""

The level of S100B directly correlates with the activation of pathways (JNK/JUN and NFκB) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. This correlation allows it to predict the severity and progression of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker."""
