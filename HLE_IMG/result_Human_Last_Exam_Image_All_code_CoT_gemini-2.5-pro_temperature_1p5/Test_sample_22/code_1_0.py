    Analyzes the six provided knot diagrams and identifies which ones are isotopic to the unknot.
    
    The analysis is based on visual inspection and application of Reidemeister moves:
    - K1: Stevedore knot (6_1), not the unknot.
    - K2: A complex diagram that simplifies to the unknot via Reidemeister I and II moves.
    - K3: Figure-eight knot (4_1), not the unknot.
    - K4: Cinquefoil knot (5_1), not the unknot.
    - K5: A diagram that simplifies to the unknot via three separate Reidemeister II moves.
    - K6: 6_2 knot, not the unknot.
    
    The indices of the unknots are 2 and 5.
