    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Cluster**: I will first examine the peaks at the highest mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio to determine the molecular weight and the number of chlorine or bromine atoms based on the isotopic pattern.\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**: Based on the molecular weight and the number of chlorine atoms, I will calculate the mass of the non-halogenated portion of the molecule. I'll use this mass to deduce the most plausible hydrocarbon formula (CₓHᵧ).\n3.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**: I will examine the most prominent peaks (especially the base peak) and the mass differences between them and the molecular ion. This helps confirm the structure and identify characteristic functional groups.\n4.  **Propose a Structure and Name**: Combining all the evidence, I will propose a likely structure for the molecule and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the provided data.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_mass_spec():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mass spectrometry data to identify an unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Data from the table\n    # Columns: m/z, I,%\n    data_string = \"\"\"\n    35,3.09\n    36,3.38\n    37,1.04\n    47,18.4\n    48,4.62\n    49,6.24\n    59,3.10\n    71,10.6\n    73,3.45\n    76,1.10\n    77,1.08\n    82,4.57\n    83,19.4\n    84,4.01\n    85,7.09\n    94,15.3\n    95,8.79\n    96,10.1\n    97,0.99\n    98,1.04\n    106,10.8\n    108,7.20\n    110,1.25\n    117,2.98\n    118,43.5\n    119,4.41\n    120,29.6\n    121,2.06\n    122,4.88\n    129,2.05\n    130,4.10\n    131,3.42\n    132,1.52\n    141,28.1\n    143,27.8\n    145,9.37\n    147,1.02\n    153,15.9\n    155,16.1\n    157,5.24\n    164,1.36\n    166,1.75\n    188,36.7\n    189,1.61\n    190,48.4\n    191,2.15\n    192,24.5\n    193,1.07\n    194,5.44\n    196,0.45\n    223,60.1\n    224,2.52\n    225,100\n    226,4.40\n    227,66.7\n    228,2.93\n    229,22.2\n    230,0.98\n    231,3.70\n    233,0.95\n    258,17.4\n    260,34.8\n    261,1.53\n    262,29.0\n    263,1.28\n    264,12.9\n    266,3.22\n    268,0.43\n    \"\"\"\n    df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data_string), header=None, names=['mz', 'I'])\n    df = df.set_index('mz')\n\n    def get_intensity(mz):\n        return df.loc[mz]['I'] if mz in df.index else 0\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion Cluster\")\n    # The highest m/z cluster appears to start around m/z 260.\n    m_peak = 260\n    m_plus_2_peak = 262\n    m_plus_4_peak = 264\n    m_plus_6_peak = 266\n\n    i_m = get_intensity(m_peak)\n    i_m2 = get_intensity(m_plus_2_peak)\n    i_m4 = get_intensity(m_plus_4_peak)\n    i_m6 = get_intensity(m_plus_6_peak)\n\n    # Normalize to the most intense peak in the cluster (m/z 260)\n    norm_i_m = i_m / i_m * 100\n    norm_i_m2 = i_m2 / i_m * 100\n    norm_i_m4 = i_m4 / i_m * 100\n    norm_i_m6 = i_m6 / i_m * 100\n    \n    # Theoretical ratios for 3 chlorine atoms (35Cl:37Cl approx 3:1)\n    # Ratio is approx.
