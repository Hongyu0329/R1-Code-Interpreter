# --- Given Parameters ---
# From the problem description
voltage_drop_percentage = 2.5  # %
harmonic_5th_distortion = 10.0 # %
harmonic_3rd_distortion = 5.0  # %

# From the diagram at the Inverter (Bus 6), which is where compensation is needed.
P_inv = 254.97  # MW
Q_inv_1 = 14.58 # MVAr (This is the fundamental reactive power)

# --- Step 1: Calculate Reactive Power needed for Harmonic Compensation ---

# Convert percentages to decimal ratios for calculation
h5_ratio = harmonic_5th_distortion / 100.0
h3_ratio = harmonic_3rd_distortion / 100.0

# Calculate fundamental apparent power (S1) at the inverter
S1 = math.sqrt(P_inv**2 + Q_inv_1**2)

# Calculate the total apparent power (S_total) including the effect of harmonics
S_total = S1 * math.sqrt(1 + h3_ratio**2 + h5_ratio**2)

# Calculate the total reactive power (Q_total) from the total apparent power and active power
Q_total = math.sqrt(S_total**2 - P_inv**2)

# The reactive power compensation needed for harmonics is the difference
# between the total reactive power and the fundamental reactive power.
Q_harmonic = Q_total - Q_inv_1

# --- Step 2: Calculate Reactive Power needed for Voltage Support ---

# Convert voltage drop percentage to a decimal ratio
voltage_drop_ratio = voltage_drop_percentage / 100.0

# Use the approximation Q_comp = 2 * (dV/V) * S_load, where S_load is S_total.
Q_volt_comp = 2 * voltage_drop_ratio * S_total

# --- Step 3: Calculate the Total Reactive Power Compensation ---

# The total compensation is the sum of the compensation for harmonics and for the voltage drop.
Q_total_comp = Q_harmonic + Q_volt_comp

# --- Print the results with detailed steps and equations ---
