    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as color, texture, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly porous with many visible holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive volcanic rocks that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. Its color suggests a composition rich in iron. This type of rock is known as **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen consists of various angular rock fragments of different sizes and colors cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is known as pyroclastic. This rock is a **Volcanic Breccia** or **Tuff**, formed from the explosive eruption of a volcano.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored (white to light gray) rock that is also very porous and appears lightweight. Its frothy texture is due to a very high number of gas bubbles trapped during rapid cooling. This rock is **Pumice**, which is notable for often being able to float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, deep underground. The light-colored minerals are likely quartz and feldspar. The extremely large crystal size is characteristic of a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now generate a Python code to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A reddish, vesicular (porous) volcanic rock.',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia / Tuff - A rock composed of angular volcanic fragments cemented together.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock that is very lightweight.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - A coarse-grained igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, description in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia/Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
