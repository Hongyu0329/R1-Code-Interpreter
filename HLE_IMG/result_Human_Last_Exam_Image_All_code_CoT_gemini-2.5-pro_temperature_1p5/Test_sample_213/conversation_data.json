    "This is a fascinating piece of music! I can certainly identify it for you.\n\nHere's my plan to identify the opera:\n1.  **Analyze Clues from the Score:** I'll examine the instrumentation, the language of the markings, and the musical style itself. The German text like \"gr. Fl.\" (Grosse Flöten), \"Vorhang\" (Curtain), and \"mit Dämpfer\" (with mute) strongly suggests a German opera. The lush, complex harmony points towards the late-Romantic period.\n2.  **Identify the Specific Passage:** The score is marked as the beginning of an act, right before the curtain rises (\"Vorhang\"). The specific melodic lines in the woodwinds and the dramatic entrance of the strings are very distinctive.\n3.  **Search and Confirm:** By searching for operas with German librettos that have a prominent and dramatic orchestral introduction to their second act, I can cross-reference the musical passage. This particular opening is famously from Richard Wagner's work. A direct comparison confirms that this music is the prelude to Act II of *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nHere is a Python script that will print the name of the opera for you.\n\n```python\ndef find_opera_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n    The score is the beginning of the prelude to Act II of Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_title = \"Tristan und Isolde\"\n    composer = \"Richard Wagner\"\n    \n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the opera: {opera_title}\")\n\nfind_opera_name()\n```\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
