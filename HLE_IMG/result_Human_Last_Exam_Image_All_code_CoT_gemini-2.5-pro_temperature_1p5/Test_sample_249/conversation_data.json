    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. The image shows a close-up of a boxfish, also known as a cofferfish or trunkfish. The distinctive feature is its skin, which is covered in hexagonal, plate-like scales that are fused together to form a solid, box-like carapace. Based on this characteristic morphology, the animal belongs to the family Ostraciidae.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and provides its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  common_name = \"Boxfish (or Trunkfish)\"\n  scientific_name = \"Ostraciidae\"\n  \n  print(f\"Yes, the animal in the image is a {common_name}.\")\n  print(f\"Its scientific name (family) is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Ostraciidae>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
