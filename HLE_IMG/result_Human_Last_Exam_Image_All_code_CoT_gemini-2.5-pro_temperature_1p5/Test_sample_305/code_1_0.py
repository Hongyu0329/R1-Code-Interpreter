    This script solves the riddle about a WWII product.
    
    The clues point to a product that:
    1. Was advertised to British workers during WWII.
    2. Claimed to help overcome "inherent limitations" (like fatigue).
    3. Has a name with a connection to the French language.

    The product identified is Bovril. Its name is derived from Latin 'bos' (ox),
    which is the root of the French word 'boeuf' (beef). It was famously
    advertised as a drink to give workers strength and energy.
