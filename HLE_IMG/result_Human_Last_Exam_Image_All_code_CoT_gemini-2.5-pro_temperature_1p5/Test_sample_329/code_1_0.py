    # w (spread): By elimination, w must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The middle beam is wider than the outer two,

    # u (tilt): The pattern is clearly tilted to the right. This is a monotonic change in u (Rule 2).
    # h (intensity): The left slit is brightest, while the middle and right slits are dimmer and equally bright (h1 > h2 = h3).
    #                This means h1 is the unique parameter (Rule 3).

    # h (intensity): The three slits have the same brightness (h1 = h2 = h3). This is the constant parameter (Rule 1).
    # w (spread): The spread of the beams increases from left to right. This means the slit width w decreases from left
    #             to right (w1 > w2 > w3). This is a monotonic change (Rule 2).
    # u (tilt/phase): By elimination, u must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The pattern is not simply tilted but
    #                 shows a complex interference disruption, strongest in the center, suggesting the phase of the
    #                 middle slit is different (u2 is unique).

    # --- Simulation 4 Analysis ---
    # h (intensity): The three slits appear to have the same brightness (h1 = h2 = h3). This is the constant parameter (Rule 1).
    # u (tilt): The pattern is clearly tilted to the left. This is a monotonic change in u (Rule 2).
    # w (spread): By elimination, w must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The beams from slit 1 and 2 have a similar spread,
    #             while the beam from slit 3 is noticeably wider (meaning w3 is narrower). So w3 is unique.
