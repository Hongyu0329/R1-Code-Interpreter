    This function explains the solution to the chess puzzle.

    The puzzle requires finding the location of a hidden piece and then
    determining how Black can mate in the fewest possible moves.
    """

    # Step 1: Identify the hidden piece.
    # By counting the pieces, we find the White King is missing.
    # Therefore, the hidden piece is the White King.
    hidden_piece = "White King"

    # Step 2: Analyze the position.
    # The Black King on c6 is in check by the White Pawn on d6.
    # Since it is Black's turn to play, this means Black is forced to move out of check.
    black_king_is_in_check = True

    # Step 3: Find Black's forced move and the location of the White King.
    # The puzzle asks for a mate in the fewest moves, suggesting a mate in 1.
    # This means a legal move for Black must also deliver checkmate.
    # Black's only legal moves to escape check are 1... Kb7 and 1... Kd7.
    # We test which move could be mate, which depends on the White King's location.

    # Let's test the hypothesis that the move is 1... Kd7 and it is mate.
    # For this to be true, the White King must be on a square that becomes attacked
    # and from which it cannot escape. The Black King moving to d7 attacks c8, d8, and e8.

    # - If the White King were on c8, after 1... Kd7+, White could escape to b8. Not mate.
    # - The White King cannot be on e8 initially, as it is attacked by the Black Queen on e2.
    # - If the White King is on d8:
    #   - It is not in check initially. This is a legal placement.
    #   - Black plays 1... Kd7. This is a legal move to escape the pawn check.
    #   - The move 1... Kd7 puts the White King on d8 in check from the Black King.
    #   - The White King cannot move to c8 or e8 (both controlled by the Black King).
    #   - The check cannot be blocked.
    #   - The Black King on d7 cannot be captured, as it's protected by the Queen on e2.
    #   - This is checkmate.
