    "The image displays a bryophyte with very distinctive falcate-secund leaves, meaning the leaves are sickle-shaped and arranged on one side of the stem. This arrangement gives the plant a characteristic plaited, braided, or catkin-like appearance. This morphology is a hallmark of the genus *Hypnum*, commonly known as plait-moss or cypress moss.\n\n```python\ndef get_genus_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the genus of the bryophyte shown in the image.\n  The key features for identification are the falcate-secund leaves\n  which give the stems a braided or plaited appearance.\n  \"\"\"\n  genus = \"Hypnum\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the genus is: {genus}\")\n\nget_genus_name()\n```\n<<<Hypnum>>>"
