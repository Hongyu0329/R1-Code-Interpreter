    "Based on the melody and the chord progression (starting with F-, E-7b5, Eb-6), I can identify the jazz standard.\n\nThe tune starts on the fifth of the F minor chord (C), and the chord progression is highly characteristic of this specific song. This analysis leads me to the following identification.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the title and composer of the piece.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
