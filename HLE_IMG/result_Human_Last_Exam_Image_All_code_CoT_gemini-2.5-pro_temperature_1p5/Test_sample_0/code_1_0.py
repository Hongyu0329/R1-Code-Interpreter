# This is a classic mate-in-2 chess problem.
# The problem asks for the sequence of black moves that lead to checkmate in 2,
# regardless of White's move.

# Black's first move:
move1 = "1. ... Nb2"

# This move puts White in zugzwang.
# Case 1: If White moves their bishop (e.g., to capture the knight or flee),
# the g2 square is no longer defended by the bishop.
# Black's second move in this case:
mate1 = "2. ... Ng2#"

# Case 2: If White moves a pawn, the bishop remains on c1.
# This allows for a different mate.
# Black's second move in this case:
mate2 = "2. ... Rf1#"

# The problem asks for one sequence. We will print the sequence from Case 1.
# The sequence is formed by Black's two moves.
print("The mating sequence for Black is:")
print(move1)
# Note: White makes a move in between, but the problem asks to leave it out.
print(mate1)

# To fulfill the final answer format, we will provide the sequence as a string.
# The format specifies leaving out the white move.
final_answer = "Nb2, Ng2#"
