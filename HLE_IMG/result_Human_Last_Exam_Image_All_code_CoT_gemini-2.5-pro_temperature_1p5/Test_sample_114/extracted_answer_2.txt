The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of its Munchone intermediate, which contrasts sharply with the intermediates in Reactions 1 and 2. Here's a breakdown of the rationale:

**Reaction Mechanism:**
All three reactions are [3+2] cycloadditions between a 1,3-dipolar species called a Munchone (a mesoionic oxazolium-5-olate) and the dipolarophile, methyl propiolate. The Munchone is generated in situ from the N-acyl amino acid starting material by dehydration using acetic anhydride (Ac2O) and a base (TEA). The initial cycloadduct then readily extrudes carbon dioxide (CO2) to form a pyrrole ring.

**Reactions 1 & 2: Acyclic Flexibility Leads to Scrambling**
*   The starting material is N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, an acyclic and conformationally flexible molecule. The nitrogen atom is bonded to two different acyl-type groups: an acetyl group (`CH3-CO-`) and an N-methyl-alaninyl group (`-CH(CH3)COOH`).
*   The key finding from the 13C labeling in Reaction 2 is that the methyl groups from the acetyl and alanine portions become scrambled, indicating the formation of a common symmetrical intermediate before the cycloaddition step.
*   This scrambling occurs because the flexible, sterically similar acyl groups can form a symmetrical six-membered ring intermediate (an N-methyl-1,3-oxazine-dione derivative). This intermediate can cleave in two equally probable ways, producing a 1:1 mixture of two different Munchones where the original positions of the acetyl and alaninyl groups are swapped.
*   Therefore, the lack of regioselectivity is not in the cycloaddition itself, but in the **formation of the Munchone intermediate**, which proceeds through two equally likely pathways.

**Reaction 3: Cyclic Rigidity Enforces Selectivity**
*   The starting material is N-acetyl-proline. Here, the nitrogen atom's substituents are an acetyl group and the proline ring itself.
*   Unlike the flexible alaninyl group, the proline backbone is locked into a rigid 5-membered ring. It is sterically and electronically distinct from the acetyl group and cannot participate in forming a symmetrical intermediate.
*   Consequently, only **one** specific and highly unsymmetrical Munchone intermediate can be formed. This intermediate has a bicyclic fused-ring structure.
*   This single, well-defined Munchone has electronically and sterically distinct ends (C2 and C4). When it reacts with the unsymmetrical alkyne, there is a strong electronic and steric preference for one orientation of addition over the other.
*   This preference results in the highly regioselective formation of a single product isomer, Product B.

**Conclusion:**
The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish a crucial principle: when the N-substituents of the starting amino acid are flexible and similar, a scrambling mechanism via a symmetrical intermediate prevents regiocontrol in the formation of the 1,3-dipole. Reaction 3 demonstrates that when this flexibility is removed by incorporating one of the substituents into a rigid ring (proline), the scrambling pathway is blocked. This generates a single, unsymmetrical Munchone, whose inherent structural bias directs the subsequent cycloaddition to proceed with high regioselectivity.
