    "This is a Chinese seal with characters written in an ancient script style known as seal script (篆書, zhuànshū). Chinese seals are traditionally read from right to left, and from top to bottom.\n\n1.  **Right column (top to bottom):**\n    *   Top character: 長 (cháng), meaning \"long\" or \"longevity\".\n    *   Bottom character: 庚 (gēng), which is the name of an ancient star (Venus, the evening star), also associated with longevity. Together, 長庚 (Cháng Gēng) is a term for Venus and carries auspicious meanings.\n\n2.  **Left column (top to bottom):**\n    *   Top character: 不 (bù), meaning \"not\" or \"no\".\n    *   Bottom character: 老 (lǎo), meaning \"old\". Together, 不老 (bù lǎo) means \"ageless\" or \"never growing old\".\n\nPutting it all together, the phrase is **長庚不老 (Cháng Gēng Bù Lǎo)**. This is a well-wishing phrase for eternal youth and longevity, like the ever-shining star.\n\nHere are the characters in simplified Chinese: **长庚不老**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print these characters.\n\n```python\ndef print_seal_characters():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the simplified Chinese characters found on the seal.\n    The characters are read from right to left, top to bottom.\n    Right column: 长 (cháng), 庚 (gēng)\n    Left column:  不 (bù), 老 (lǎo)\n    The full phrase is 长庚不老 (Cháng Gēng Bù Lǎo).\n    \"\"\"\n    characters = \"长庚不老\"\n    print(f\"The characters on the seal are: {characters}\")\n\nprint_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<长庚不老>>>"
