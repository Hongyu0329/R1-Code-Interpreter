3 parts answer:
1. The music modulates to E Major.
2. The justification is that E Major is the relative major of the home key, C-sharp minor. This is a common and tonally close modulation because they share the same key signature.
3. The Roman numeral marking is V/III. The chord is a B Major triad, which is the dominant (V) of E Major. Since E Major is the mediant (III) of the original key, the full analysis is 'V of III'.
