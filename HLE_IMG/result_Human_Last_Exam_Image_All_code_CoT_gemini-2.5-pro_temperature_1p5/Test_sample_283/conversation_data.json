    "Here is my plan to identify the country from the Google Trends graph:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph for Patterns:** I will examine the provided Google Trends graph, which displays search interest for three topics over time (from December 2019 to late 2023). I'll pay close attention to the dates of the recurring peaks for each of the three colored lines (red, blue, and yellow).\n2.  **Identify the Events:** Based on the timing of these annual peaks, I will deduce the specific historical events or observances they represent.\n    *   **Red Line:** This line shows consistent peaks in February and again in late May/early June each year. This pattern corresponds to Black History Month (February) and the anniversary of the George Floyd protests (starting May 25, 2020) in the United States.\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line shows smaller but regular peaks in mid-to-late January. This aligns with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line displays very sharp, high peaks around early-to-mid September each year. This is characteristic of search interest for the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.\n3.  **Determine the Country:** Since all three of these major historical events and observances (September 11th attacks, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Black History Month/George Floyd protests) are central to the recent history and culture of the United States, the country in question is the United States.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning in its comments and prints the final answer as a string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in a Google Trends graph to identify a country.\n\n    The graph shows three distinct, recurring search interest patterns corresponding to\n    major historical events and observances in a single country.\n\n    1. Red Line Analysis:\n       - Shows annual peaks in two specific periods:\n         - February: This corresponds to Black History Month.\n         - Late May/Early June: This corresponds to the anniversary of the\n           murder of George Floyd (May 25, 2020) and the subsequent protests.\n\n    2. Blue Line Analysis:\n       - Shows an annual peak in mid-to-late January.\n       - This corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday.\n\n    3. Yellow Line Analysis:\n       - Shows a very sharp, high peak around September 11th each year.\n       - This corresponds to the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.\n\n    Conclusion:\n       - All three events—Black History Month/George Floyd protests, Martin Luther King Jr. Day,\n         and the September 11th attacks—are prominent and significant events in the\n         history and culture of the United States.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"United States\"\n    print(f\"The country where these historic events took place is: {country}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer.\nsolve_historical_mystery()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
