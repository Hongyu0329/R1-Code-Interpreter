    """
    This function analyzes the patterns in a Google Trends graph to identify a country.

    The graph shows three distinct, recurring search interest patterns corresponding to
    major historical events and observances in a single country.

    1. Red Line Analysis:
       - Shows annual peaks in two specific periods:
         - February: This corresponds to Black History Month.
         - Late May/Early June: This corresponds to the anniversary of the
           murder of George Floyd (May 25, 2020) and the subsequent protests.

    2. Blue Line Analysis:
       - Shows an annual peak in mid-to-late January.
       - This corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday.

    3. Yellow Line Analysis:
       - Shows a very sharp, high peak around September 11th each year.
       - This corresponds to the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.

    Conclusion:
       - All three events—Black History Month/George Floyd protests, Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
         and the September 11th attacks—are prominent and significant events in the
         history and culture of the United States.
