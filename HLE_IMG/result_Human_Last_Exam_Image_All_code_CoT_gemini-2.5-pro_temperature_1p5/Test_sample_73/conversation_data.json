    "My plan is to determine the stereochemical assignment, (R) or (S), for each of the four stereocenters shown in the reaction scheme, moving from left to right. This involves the following steps for each center:\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents**: List the four different groups attached to the chiral carbon atom.\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: Rank these substituents from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest) based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The primary rule is to rank based on the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center.\n3.  **Determine Configuration**: Observe the 3D arrangement of the substituents from the provided drawing. Mentally orient the molecule so that the lowest-priority group (4) points away from the viewer. Trace the path from the highest-priority group (1) to the second (2) to the third (3). If this path is clockwise, the configuration is (R); if it is counter-clockwise, the configuration is (S). I will account for cases where the lowest priority group is not in the back, for instance, by using the rule that if the highest-priority group is in the back, the R/S assignment is reversed.\n4.  **Analyze the Product**: The reaction is an esterification which does not break any bonds at the chiral centers, so their absolute 3D configurations are retained. However, a change in a substituent (e.g., -COCl to -COOR') can alter the CIP priorities, which may change the (R) or (S) designation. I will re-evaluate the priorities for the product stereocenters to determine their correct assignments.\n\nBased on this plan, I will determine the sequence of the four assignments.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the four\n    stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme, from left to right.\n\n    The assignments are determined by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Center 1: The chiral carbon in the acyl chloride reactant.\n    # Priorities: 1(-OCH3), 2(-COCl), 3(-CF3), 4(-C6H5).\n    # With group 1 (-OCH3) in the back, tracing the path 2 -> 3 -> 4 is counter-clockwise.\n    # The rule is reversed when the highest priority group is in the back, so counter-clockwise means (R).\n    center1 = \"R\"\n\n    # Center 2: The chiral carbon in the alcohol reactant.\n    # Priorities: 1(-OH), 2(-CH2OMe), 3(-CH2CH(Me)2), 4(-H).\n    # With group 4 (-H) in the back, tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\n    # The standard rule applies, so counter-clockwise means (S).\n    center2 = \"S\"\n    \n    # Center 3: The chiral carbon in the product, originating from the alcohol.\n    # The absolute configuration is retained.
