    "My plan is to analyze the sequence of events shown in the three panels, L, M, and N. I will describe the changes in the filamentous structure step-by-step to determine the biological process being depicted.\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel L:** I'll observe the initial state of the structure, which appears to be a filament made of several cells. I'll note the arrowhead pointing to a cross-wall (septum).\n2.  **Analyze Panel M:** I'll examine the change occurring at the septum from panel L. There is a visible bulge forming, causing the filament to start bending.\n3.  **Analyze Panel N:** I'll observe the progression of the bulge. It has grown larger, causing a more pronounced bend or break in the filament.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the observation of a cell swelling and rupturing at a weak point due to internal pressure, I will identify the specific biological term for this process. Finally, I will encapsulate this explanation within a Python script that prints the description.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the biological process shown in the provided images.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) showing the process of cytolysis in a filamentous organism, likely a fungal hypha.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  In panel L, we see a healthy filament. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is the cross-wall between two cells.\n2.  In panel M, the cell at the septum has started to bulge outwards. This indicates that the cell wall has weakened at this point, and the internal turgor pressure is causing it to swell.\n3.  In panel N, the bulge has enlarged significantly, causing the filament to buckle and rupture.\n\nThis entire process, where a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance or a compromised cell wall leading to an influx of water and subsequent rupture, is known as **cytolysis** (or specifically, hyphal bursting).\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Cytolysis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
