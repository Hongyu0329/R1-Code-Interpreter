Here is a step-by-step breakdown:
1.  In panel L, we see a healthy filament. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is the cross-wall between two cells.
2.  In panel M, the cell at the septum has started to bulge outwards. This indicates that the cell wall has weakened at this point, and the internal turgor pressure is causing it to swell.
3.  In panel N, the bulge has enlarged significantly, causing the filament to buckle and rupture.

This entire process, where a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance or a compromised cell wall leading to an influx of water and subsequent rupture, is known as **cytolysis** (or specifically, hyphal bursting)."""
