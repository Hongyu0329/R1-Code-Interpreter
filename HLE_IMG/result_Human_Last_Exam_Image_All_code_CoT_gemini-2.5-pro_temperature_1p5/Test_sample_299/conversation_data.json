    "This chess puzzle presents an illegal starting position, as the Black King at e4 is already in check from the White Rook at f3, which shouldn't happen on White's turn. However, assuming this is an error in the problem's setup, we can deduce the intended solution. The key is to find a move that forces checkmate regardless of Black's reply.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  White's first move is **Rh5-e5+**. This puts the Black King in a double check from the Rook at e5 and reveals a check from the Queen at a4 against the d4 square. It forces Black to respond to the check from the Rook on e5.\n2.  Black has two legal ways to get out of check:\n    *   Capture the rook at e5 with their pawn (`fxe5`).\n    *   Capture the rook at e5 with their Queen (`Qxe5`).\n3.  We need a mating move for both of these scenarios.\n    *   If Black plays **1... fxe5**, the pawn that was on f4 is now on e5. White delivers checkmate with **2. Rf3-f4#**. The Black King is trapped by a network of pieces.\n    *   If Black plays **1... Qxe5**, the Black Queen is now on e5. White delivers checkmate with **2. Nb7-d6#**. This check, combined with the positions of the other white pieces, leaves the Black King with no escape squares.\n\nThe following Python code will print this solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the step-by-step solution for the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Explanation of the initial position's issue\n    print(\"Note: The provided chess position is technically illegal as the Black King starts in check.\")\n    print(\"Assuming this is a setup error, the intended mate-in-2 solution is as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # White's first move\n    print(\"1.
