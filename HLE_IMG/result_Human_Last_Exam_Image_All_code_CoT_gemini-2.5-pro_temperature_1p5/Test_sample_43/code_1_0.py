The reaction proceeds through a multi-step mechanism:

1.  **Deprotonation**: The primary alcohol in compound 1 is acidic. One equivalent of the methyl magnesium bromide (CH3MgBr) base deprotonates the alcohol to form a magnesium alkoxide.

    Equation for deprotonation: R-OH + CH3MgBr -> R-O-MgBr + CH4

2.  **Intramolecular Rearrangement**: The reaction is carried out with an excess ({grignard_equivalents} equivalents) of CH3MgBr at an elevated temperature ({temperature}°C) for {time} hours. These conditions promote a subsequent intramolecular reaction. The newly formed alkoxide is geometrically positioned to act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon atom of the adjacent benzodioxole group.

3.  **Ring Expansion**: This nucleophilic attack opens the five-membered benzodioxole ring and forms a new, more stable seven-membered dioxepine ring. A stable phenoxide ion is generated as a leaving group in this step.

4.  **Protonation**: During the final workup step, the phenoxide ion is protonated to give the final product, which contains a phenol group and the newly formed dioxepine ring. This pathway explains the formation of a single major product with a high yield of {yield_percent}%.

This corresponds to the product and mechanism described in option C.

The numbers in the reaction are:
{grignard_equivalents} equivalents of CH3MgBr
{temperature} °C temperature
{time} hours reaction time
{yield_percent}% yield
