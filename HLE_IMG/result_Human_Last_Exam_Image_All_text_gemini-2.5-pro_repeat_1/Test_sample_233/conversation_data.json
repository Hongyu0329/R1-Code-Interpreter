    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Request**\nThe goal is to determine the specific catalog ID of the Ingvar runestone shown in the image fragment. Ingvar runestones are a distinct group of Viking Age runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition, which helps narrow down the possibilities. Runestone IDs typically consist of a provincial code and a number (e.g., U 654, Sö 179).\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Visual Evidence**\nThe image shows runes carved into a stone surface, organized into horizontal bands separated by lines. The runes are clearly incised. 'X'-shaped symbols are used as word dividers. The style of the runes is the Younger Futhark, featuring a mix of long-branch and short-twig variants.\n\n**Step 3: Transcribe the Runes**\nLet's transcribe the visible runes row by row, from left to right.\n\n*   **Top Row:** The visible runes read `...þ u r u i þ r...` (...ᚦᚢᚱᚢᛁᚦᚱ...). This transliterates to the name *Þyrviðr* or similar.\n*   **Middle Row:** The visible runes read `... s u n : s i a ...` (...ᛋᚢᚾ : ᛋᛁᛅ...). The 'x' symbol (`:`) is a word separator. This transliterates to *sun sia*, meaning \"their son\".\n*   **Bottom Row:** The visible runes read `... r u n a r : þ i s a r` (...ᚱᚢᚾᛅᚱ : ᚦᛁᛋᛅᚱ). This transliterates to *rūnaR þessaR*, meaning \"these runes\".\n\n**Step 4: Search and Identify**\nWith these transcribed fragments, we can search the database of runic inscriptions, specifically looking for an Ingvar runestone that contains these phrases.\n\n*   The fragment *rūnaR þessaR* (\"these runes\") is a common closing phrase for runic inscriptions, often indicating the carver's signature.\n*   The phrase *sun sia* (\"their son\") points to a memorial context.\n*   The combination of these fragments, especially the specific closing phrase, is highly distinctive.\n\nA search for Ingvar runestones with these textual features leads to one specific stone: **Södermanland Runic Inscription 9**, more commonly known as **Sö 9**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Identification**\nLet's check the full inscription of Sö 9 to confirm the match.\n\n*   **Runic Transliteration of Sö 9:**\n    *   A: `þuruiþr : auk : tan : kerþu : stin : þensa : at : ansuar : sun : sia : auk : þuruiþr : at : bunta : sia :`\n    *   B: `han : uarþ : tauþr : austr : miþ : ikuari : kuþ : hialbi : ant : ans : þurkutr : risti : runar : þisar`\n*   **Old Norse Normalization:**\n    *   *Þyrviðr(?) ok Dan gærðu stæin þennsa at Andsvar, sun sinn, ok Þyrviðr at boanda sinn. Hann varð dauðr austr með Ingvari. Guð hialpi and hans. Þorgautr risti runaR þessaR.*\n*   **English Translation:**\n    *   \"Þyrviðr(?) and Dan made this stone in memory of Andsvarr, their son, and Þyrviðr in memory of her husbandman. He died in the east with Ingvarr. May God help his spirit. Þorgautr carved these runes.\"\n\nThe inscription explicitly mentions Ingvar, confirming it is an Ingvar runestone. All the fragments we transcribed from the image are present in the full text of Sö 9.\n\n*   `...þuruiþr...` is present.\n*   `...sun : sia...` is present.\n*   `...runar : þisar` is the exact ending of the inscription.\n\nTherefore, the image is a fragment of the Sö 9 runestone.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
