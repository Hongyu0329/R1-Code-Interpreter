    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Reading Order:** Traditional Chinese seals are read from top to bottom, and from right to left. Therefore, the characters should be read in this order:\n    1.  Top right character\n    2.  Bottom right character\n    3.  Top left character\n    4.  Bottom left character\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in Seal Script and conversion to Modern Chinese):**\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This character is the seal script form of **長** (cháng). It means \"long\" or \"eternal\".\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This is the seal script for **樂** (lè). It means \"joy\" or \"happiness\".\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This is the seal script for **未** (wèi). It means \"not yet\" or \"never\".\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This is the seal script for **央** (yāng). It means \"end\" or \"cease\".\n\n3.  **Combining the Characters:** When read in the correct order (right to left, top to bottom), the characters form the phrase **長樂未央** (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng).\n\n4.  **Meaning and Simplification:**\n    *   The phrase \"長樂未央\" is a famous classical Chinese idiom that means \"Eternal happiness without end\" or \"Everlasting joy\".\n    *   To convert this to simplified Chinese:\n        *   長 remains 长.\n        *   樂 becomes 乐.\n        *   未 remains 未.\n        *   央 remains 央.\n    *   Therefore, the simplified Chinese content is **长乐未央**.\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
