    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how an object or pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. If a pattern looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/*n* degrees, it is said to have *n*-fold rotational symmetry. The question asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry (*n*) present in the tiling.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Inspect the Tiling for Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe tiling is complex, composed of multiple shapes: large blue decagons (10-sided), light-yellow pentagons (5-sided), yellow squares (4-sided), and orange rhombi. To find the rotational symmetry, we need to identify points in the pattern that can act as centers of rotation. Let's examine the prominent features.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Key Feature and Test its Symmetry**\nOne of the most striking features is the star-like motif formed by a ring of 10 orange rhombi pointing inwards, surrounding a central point. Let's select the center of one of these stars as our potential center of rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Perform a Mental Rotation**\nImagine placing a pin at the center of this star.\n*   The star itself has 10 points (the tips of the 10 orange rhombi).\n*   Let's rotate the entire pattern around this central point. The smallest angle of rotation that would make the star map onto itself is 360 degrees / 10 = 36 degrees.\n*   Now, we must check if the *entire* tiling, not just the star, looks the same after this 36-degree rotation.\n*   Looking at the tiles surrounding the central star, we see a ring of 10 light-yellow pentagons. A 36-degree rotation maps each of these pentagons onto the position of its neighbor.\n*   Looking further out, we see that the arrangement of the larger blue decagons and all other tiles also perfectly aligns with the original pattern after a 36-degree rotation.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Order of Rotational Symmetry**\nSince the entire tiling pattern remains unchanged after a rotation of 36 degrees (360/10), it possesses 10-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Local vs. Global Symmetry:** The question asks for the symmetry of the tiling, which refers to the symmetry of the infinite pattern that this patch represents. We are looking for the highest order of symmetry present anywhere in the pattern.\n*   **Other Symmetries:** The pattern also contains points of 5-fold rotational symmetry (e.g., at the vertex where five light-yellow pentagons meet) and 2-fold rotational symmetry. However, the convention is to state the highest order of symmetry present. Since 10-fold symmetry exists, this is the defining rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n*   **Aperiodic Tiling:** This pattern is an example of an aperiodic tiling (specifically, a Penrose-like tiling). Unlike standard periodic (wallpaper) patterns which are restricted to 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold symmetry, aperiodic tilings can exhibit \"forbidden\" symmetries like the 10-fold symmetry observed here.\n\nBased on the analysis, the highest order of rotational symmetry for this tiling is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
