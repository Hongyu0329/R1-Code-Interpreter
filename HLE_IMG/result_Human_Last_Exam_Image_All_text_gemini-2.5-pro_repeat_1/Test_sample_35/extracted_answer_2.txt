The protein S100B exhibits strong affinity for the extracellular domains of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), specifically the V, C1, and C2 domains, with the V-domain being the principal binding site.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. According to the provided diagram, S100B binding to RAGE directly activates downstream pathways (JNK/JUN and NF-ÎºB) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since the concentration of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these pathological outcomes, its levels can be used to predict the progression and future severity of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. While it would be used in an adjunctive capacity (alongside other tests, due to its lack of absolute specificity), its ability to forecast the disease course makes it a prognostic marker, not solely an adjunct one.
