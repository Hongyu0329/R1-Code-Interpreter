The XRD patterns correspond to the standard monoclinic phase of CuO (Tenorite). The prominent diffraction peaks are indexed based on the JCPDS card No. 45-0937. The following table lists the approximate 2θ positions of the most prominent peaks from the graph and their corresponding Miller indices (h k l).

| Approximate Peak Position (2θ, degrees) | Miller Indices (h k l) |
