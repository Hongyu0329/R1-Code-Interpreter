**Product A:** A structure containing an N-acetyl group, a methyl ester, and two C=C bonds, derived from the Michael addition, cyclization, and acetylation pathway. An example structure is methyl 4-(4-acetamidobutanoyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate.
**Product B:** A complex, oxidized and rearranged polycyclic structure, likely a pentacyclic cage compound derived from a cascade reaction, or a bicyclic imide-lactone system attached to a pyrrole ring.
**Product C:** A fragmentation product containing an N-acetyl group and a carboxylic acid, for instance, a substituted N-acetylated bicyclic lactam like (S)-1-acetyl-2-((S)-3-carboxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizin-2-yl)pyrrolidine.
