    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and Identify Synchronized Bursts**\n\nThe provided image is a raster plot showing neuronal firing activity over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s). The total duration shown is 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the electrode number, from 0 to 128.\n*   Each black dot indicates a spike (an action potential) from a neuron detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n*   A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons across many electrodes fire in a coordinated manner. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands on the plot.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate the Timestamps of Each Synchronized Burst**\n\nWe need to visually inspect the graph and estimate the center time for each major synchronized burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** There is a clear, dense burst near the beginning. It starts around 1 s and ends around 4 s. The center of this burst is approximately at **t₁ = 2.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major burst starts around 12 s and ends around 15 s. Its center can be estimated at **t₂ = 13.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Another burst, slightly less dense but still a clear network event, is centered around the 25 s mark. We can estimate its timestamp as **t₃ = 25.0 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A very dense burst occurs between 35 s and 38 s. The center is estimated at **t₄ = 36.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final burst is visible at the end of the recording, starting around 48 s. We can estimate its center at **t₅ = 49.0 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the identified bursts are approximately: 2.5 s, 13.5 s, 25.0 s, 36.5 s, and 49.0 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have 5 bursts, which means there are 4 intervals between them.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** t₂ - t₁ = 13.5 s - 2.5 s = **11.0 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** t₃ - t₂ = 25.0 s - 13.5 s = **11.5 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** t₄ - t₃ = 36.5 s - 25.0 s = **11.5 s**\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** t₅ - t₄ = 49.0 s - 36.5 s = **12.5 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\n\nNow, we calculate the average of the four intervals.\n\n*   Sum of intervals = 11.0 s + 11.5 s + 11.5 s + 12.5 s = 46.5 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of intervals) / (Number of intervals) = 46.5 s / 4 = 11.625 s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\n\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.625 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1.\n*   The third digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the second digit.\n*   Rounding 11.625 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
