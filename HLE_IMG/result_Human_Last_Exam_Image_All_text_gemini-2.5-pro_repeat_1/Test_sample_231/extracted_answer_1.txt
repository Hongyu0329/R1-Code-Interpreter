The final compound C is a triphenylmethane cation. It consists of a central carbon atom bonded to three substituted aromatic rings. Two of these rings are 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl groups. The third ring is a 4-diethylamino-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl group. The overall molecule has a positive charge that is delocalized throughout the conjugated system. The structure can be represented as [C(C6H2(OH)3)2(C6H2(NEt2)(OH)2)]+.
Here is a 2D representation of the structure:
```

       C6H2(OH)2--OH
```
A more explicit drawing shows a central carbon atom (which can be depicted with a positive charge) single-bonded to the C1 position of three separate benzene rings. Two of the rings have -OH groups at their C2, C4, and C6 positions. The third ring has -OH groups at its C2 and C6 positions and a -N(CH2CH3)2 group at its C4 position.
