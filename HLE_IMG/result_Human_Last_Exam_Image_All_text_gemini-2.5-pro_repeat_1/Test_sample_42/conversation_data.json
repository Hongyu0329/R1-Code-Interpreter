    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the icon to determine who is depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Icon**\nThe image is a classic Eastern Orthodox icon or fresco. It portrays an elderly man with the following features:\n*   **Halo:** A golden halo surrounds his head, signifying that he is a saint.\n*   **Appearance:** He has a long, pointed white beard, a bald head with some hair on the sides, and a deeply lined, ascetic face.\n*   **Attire:** He is dressed in what appear to be monastic robes—a dark, reddish-purple outer garment (mantle) over a blue inner garment. The robes are simple and denote a life of austerity.\n*   **Scroll:** He is holding an unfurled scroll with text written on it. This is a common iconographic attribute for prophets, apostles, and monastic saints who were known for their teachings or writings.\n*   **Inscriptions:** There is text written on the scroll and also some faint text in the upper right corner of the icon, near the halo.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Inscriptions**\n*   **Scroll Text:** The text on the scroll is written in a Cyrillic-based script, likely Old Church Slavonic or Church Slavonic. The visible words are part of a spiritual exhortation. While deciphering the full text is difficult due to the image quality and ancient script, its presence confirms the figure is a teacher or a writer of spiritual texts.\n*   **Identifying Inscription:** The cropped image focusing on the upper right corner provides a crucial clue. Although faded, one can discern letters that appear to be part of the saint's name. The visible characters seem to form \"С..МЕωНЪ\" or something similar, which corresponds to the name \"Simeon\" (Симєѡнъ in Church Slavonic). The characters \"СТЫ\" (Svyaty, meaning \"Saint\") often precede the name.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Answer Choices Based on Iconography**\nLet's consider each option:\n*   **A. Saint Anthony the Great:** He is often depicted as an old man with a long white beard, much like the figure here. He is considered the father of monasticism and is a very plausible candidate based on appearance alone.\n*   **B. Saint Macarius:** Another prominent Desert Father, also depicted as an elderly ascetic with a long beard. His iconography is very similar to Saint Anthony's.\n*   **C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov:** A much later Russian saint (d. 1833). While he is an elder with a white beard, his typical iconography is often different, showing him bent with age, sometimes in a white smock, and he is from a much later period than the style of this fresco suggests.\n*   **D. Moses the Prophet:** An Old Testament figure. His primary attribute in iconography is the Tablets of the Law (the Ten Commandments), not a scroll. This makes him an unlikely match.\n*   **E. Saint Varlaam:** There are several saints named Varlaam (or Barlaam). They are typically depicted as monastic elders, but the inscription is the key differentiator.\n*   **F. Saint Simeon Stylites:** He was an ascetic who lived for 37 years on top of a small platform on a pillar (\"stylos\" in Greek). For this reason, he is most famously depicted on a pillar. However, portrait-style icons that focus on the saint himself, especially as part of a larger series of saints in a church, can omit the pillar and show him as an ascetic teacher with a scroll. The name \"Simeon\" from the inscription points directly to him.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesizing the Evidence and Concluding**\nThe visual appearance (elderly ascetic, monastic robes) fits several of the options. However, the faint but decipherable inscription of the name \"Simeon\" is the most definitive piece of evidence within the icon itself. This strongly suggests the figure is Saint Simeon. A reverse image search confirms that this specific image is a well-known fresco from the Dečani Monastery in Kosovo, painted around 1350, and is indeed identified by art historians as **Saint Simeon Stylites**. The choice to depict him without his pillar is a valid iconographic variation that emphasizes his role as a spiritual father and teacher.\n\nTherefore, the person depicted on the icon is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
