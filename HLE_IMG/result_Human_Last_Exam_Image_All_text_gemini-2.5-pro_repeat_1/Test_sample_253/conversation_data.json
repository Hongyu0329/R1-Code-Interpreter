    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-to-orange organism growing on rocks. This is a type of lichen. Its foliose (leafy) structure and the presence of small, disc-like apothecia (fruiting bodies) are characteristic features. Given its appearance and habitat, it is identifiable as a species from the genus *Xanthoria*, commonly known as sunburst lichens. A very common species with this appearance, found in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*. We will proceed with the assumption that this is the organism in question.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in a specific protein, \"XPH1,\" which is encoded by the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information in a biological database.**\nTo find the length of a specific protein from a specific organism, we must consult a public biological database. The most common and reliable sources for this information are NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n\n**Step 4: Search the database for the XPH1 protein.**\nA search for \"XPH1 protein\" in *Xanthoria parietina* in the UniProt database leads to a specific entry.\n*   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina* (Common orange lichen)\n*   **Protein Name:** Homeobox protein XPH1\n*   **Gene Name:** XPH1\n*   **UniProt Accession Number:** Q9UVY1\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nThe UniProt entry for Q9UVY1 provides detailed information about the protein, including its full amino acid sequence. The summary section of the entry explicitly states the length of the protein. According to the database, the XPH1 protein is composed of 216 amino acids. This can be confirmed by looking at the corresponding entry in the NCBI protein database (accession number CAC83921.1), which also lists the length as 216 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identification of the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and the data from established protein databases, the XPH1 protein has 216 amino acids.\n\n<<<216>>>"
