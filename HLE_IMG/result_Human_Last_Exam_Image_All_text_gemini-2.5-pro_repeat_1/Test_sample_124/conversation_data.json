    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing from the voltage source.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the total current flowing through the circuit. This is the current supplied by the voltage source, V2. To find this, we'll use Ohm's Law: I_total = V_total / R_equivalent.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Voltage source, V2 = 1 V\n    *   Resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, R3 = 9 Ω, R7 = 100 Ω, R8 = 100 Ω.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Circuit Structure:** The circuit consists of the voltage source connected to two main branches in parallel.\n    *   **Branch 1:** Contains resistors R1, R2, and R3.\n    *   **Branch 2:** Contains resistors R7 and R8.\n\n4.  **Simplify Branch 1 (The middle branch):**\n    *   We can see resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected end-to-end.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** There is a wire connected across resistor R2. This wire connects the node between R1 and R2 to the node between R2 and R3.\n    *   A wire is assumed to have zero resistance, creating a short circuit. When a resistor is in parallel with a short circuit, all the current flows through the short circuit (the path of least resistance).\n    *   Therefore, resistor R2 is effectively bypassed or \"shorted out\". No current will flow through R2.\n    *   As a result, for the purpose of calculating the branch's resistance, we can consider the current flowing through R1, then the wire, and then through R3. This makes R1 and R3 effectively in series.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of Branch 1 (R_branch1) is:\n        R_branch1 = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω.\n\n5.  **Simplify Branch 2 (The right branch):**\n    *   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected one after another in a single path. This is a simple series connection.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Resistors in series are added together.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of Branch 2 (R_branch2) is:\n        R_branch2 = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_equivalent):**\n    *   The simplified Branch 1 and Branch 2 are connected in parallel across the voltage source V2.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The formula for two parallel resistors is R_eq = (R_a * R_b) / (R_a + R_b).\n    *   R_equivalent = (R_branch1 * R_branch2) / (R_branch1 + R_branch2)\n    *   R_equivalent = (12 Ω * 200 Ω) / (12 Ω + 200 Ω)\n    *   R_equivalent = 2400 / 212 Ω\n    *   Simplifying the fraction (dividing numerator and denominator by 4), we get R_equivalent = 600 / 53 Ω.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   Now we use Ohm's Law with the total voltage and total equivalent resistance.\n    *   I_total = V2 / R_equivalent\n    *   I_total = 1 V / (600 / 53 Ω)\n    *   I_total = 53 / 600 A\n\n8.  **Final Answer Calculation:**\n    *   Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    *   I_total = 53 ÷ 600 A ≈ 0.088333... A.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.0883 A.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary**\n*   Resistance of the shorted branch (R1 and R3 in series): 12 Ω.\n*   Resistance of the other series branch (R7 and R8): 200 Ω.\n*   Total equivalent resistance of the two parallel branches: R_eq = (12 * 200) / (12 + 200) = 2400 / 212 Ω.\n*   Total current: I = V / R_eq = 1 V / (2400 / 212 Ω) = 212 / 2400 A.\n*   I = 212 / 2400 A ≈ 0.0883 A.\n\n<<<0.0883 A>>>"
