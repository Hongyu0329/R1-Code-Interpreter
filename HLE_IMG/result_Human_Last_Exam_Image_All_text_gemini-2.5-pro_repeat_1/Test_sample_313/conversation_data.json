    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Visual Clue**\n\n*   **Identify the event and date:** The question states the event took place on June 20, 2019. The image shows an awards ceremony.\n*   **Identify the people and the award:** The image shows a younger man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man. The trophy is distinctive, featuring a globe-like sphere on a hexagonal base.\n*   **Research the event:** A search for major awards ceremonies on or around that date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The one-day discrepancy is likely a minor inaccuracy in the prompt.\n*   **Identify the award and recipient:** The trophy in the image is an exact match for the Ted Lindsay Award, presented to the \"most outstanding player\" in the NHL as voted by fellow players. In 2019, the recipient of this award was Nikita Kucherov, a Russian-born player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The man presenting the award is identifiable as NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. The person pictured (\"X Y\") is therefore Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clue**\n\n*   **Deconstruct the clue:** The clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Identify the key elements:** The core of this clue is the connection between a term (\"X Y\") and an obsolete practice involving \"mercury salts.\"\n*   **Research historical uses of mercury salts:** One of the most famous historical industrial uses of mercury salts was in the felt-making industry for creating hats. A solution of mercuric nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur, making it easier to felt.\n*   **Connect to the obsolete practice:** Workers in this trade were known as \"hatters.\" They were frequently exposed to mercury vapor, which led to a neurological disorder called erethism, characterized by symptoms like tremors, shyness, and irritability. This condition gave rise to the popular phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" Due to the extreme toxicity of mercury, this process was banned in the United States in 1941 and has since been discontinued worldwide.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Find \"X Y\"**\n\n*   **Find the link:** The puzzle requires finding a single term (\"X Y\") that connects the hockey player from the visual clue with the obsolete, mercury-related profession from the textual clue.\n*   **Connect hockey to hats:** In ice hockey, a major achievement for a player is scoring three goals in a single game, which is called a \"hat trick.\" It is a tradition for fans to throw their hats onto the ice to celebrate this feat.\n*   **Formulate the answer:** A player who scores a hat trick, especially a prolific scorer like Nikita Kucherov, can be figuratively referred to as a \"hatter.\" This provides the crucial link. The word that satisfies both clues is \"Hatter.\"\n    *   **The first \"Hatter\" (from the image):** A figurative hatter – a hockey player known for scoring hat-tricks.\n    *   **The \"other Hatter\" (from the text):** A literal hatter – a maker of hats, a profession whose historical methods involving toxic mercury salts have ceased to be used.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Date Discrepancy:** The prompt's date of June 20, 2019, is one day after the actual event on June 19. This is a minor inaccuracy that does not change the core identification of the event and person.\n2.  **Figurative Language:** The connection between a hockey player and the word \"hatter\" is figurative, based on the term \"hat trick.\" Riddles often rely on such non-literal connections and wordplay.\n3.  **Placeholder Format:** The use of \"X Y\" as a placeholder does not necessarily mean the answer must be two words. In this case, it represents the single-word answer that solves the riddle.\n4.  **Clue Phrasing:** The phrase \"ceased to be used\" is slightly unusual when referring to a profession but is understandable in the context of the riddle, referring to the specific, now-obsolete manufacturing process.\n\nBy combining the visual identification of a famous hockey player with the historical knowledge about the hat-making industry and its connection to mercury, we can deduce the answer.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
