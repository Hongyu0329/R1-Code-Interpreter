    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the parent chain and number the carbons according to IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the molecule is an alcohol. The suffix will be \"-ol\".\n2.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the carbon atom bearing the -OH group (the carbinol carbon).\n    *   Tracing various paths, the longest chain containing the carbinol carbon is a 5-carbon chain. Let's trace it: from the leftmost methyl group (C1), to the carbinol carbon (C2), to the carbon with the ethyl group (C3), to the carbon with the methyl and aminomethyl groups (C4), and finally to the carbon of the aminomethyl group (C5, which is -CH2NH2).\n    *   Wait, the aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2) is a substituent, not part of the main pentane chain according to IUPAC rules, which prioritize the longest carbon chain. Let's re-evaluate the longest chain.\n    *   Let's re-identify the structure based on the drawing. We have a central C-C-C fragment.\n        *   Left Carbon (let's call it C2) has substituents -OH and -CH3. The -CH3 is C1.\n        *   Middle Carbon (C3) has an ethyl substituent.\n        *   Right Carbon (C4) has a methyl substituent and is connected to a -CH2NH2 group (C5).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH group is: CH3(C1)-CH(OH)(C2)-CH(CH2CH3)(C3)-CH(CH3)(C4)-CH2NH2. In this case, the main chain is C1-C2-C3-C4, with C5 being part of the aminomethyl substituent at C4. This gives a butane derivative. Name: 4-amino-3-ethyl-2-methylbutan-2-ol. This does not match the drawing, which has H on C2.\n    *   Let's retry finding the longest chain. The structure is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol. Let's verify this name against the drawing.\n        *   Pentan-2-ol means a 5-carbon chain with an OH on C2.\n        *   C1: CH3\n        *   C2: CH(OH)\n        *   C3: CH(CH2CH3)\n        *   C4: CH(CH3)\n        *   C5: CH2NH2\n        *   Let's map this to the drawing:\n            *   The leftmost chiral center has an -OH and a -CH3 group. This matches C2, with the -CH3 group being C1.\n            *   The middle chiral center has an ethyl group. This matches C3.\n            *   The rightmost chiral center has a methyl group and is attached to a -CH2NH2 group. This matches C4, which is attached to a methyl group and to C5 (the -CH2NH2 group).\n    *   This confirms the structure is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center.**\n\n**Chiral Center C3 (the middle carbon):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -C2 (the CH(OH)CH3 group), -C4 (the CH(CH3)CH2NH2 group).\n*   **Assign Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):**\n    1.  **-C2:** The carbon is attached to (O, C, H).\n    2.  **-C4:** The carbon is attached to (C, C, H), where one C leads to N. More precisely, it's attached to C(of CH2NH2), C(of CH3), and H. Let's expand: C(N,H,H), C(H,H,H), H.\n    3.  **-CH2CH3 (ethyl):** The carbon is attached to (C, H, H).\n    4.  **-H:** Lowest priority.\n    *   Comparing the atoms attached to C3: C2 vs C4 vs C(ethyl). All are carbon. We look at the next atoms.\n    *   C2 is attached to (O, C, H). C4 is attached to (C, C, H). C(ethyl) is attached to (C, H, H).\n    *   Comparing the highest atomic number atom in each set: O vs C vs C. Oxygen wins. Thus, **-C2 is priority 1**.\n    *   Comparing C4 and ethyl: C4 is attached to (C, C, H). Ethyl is attached to (C, H, H). The second C on C4's list beats the H on ethyl's list. Thus, **-C4 is priority 2**.\n    *   **Ethyl (-CH2CH3) is priority 3**.\n    *   **-H is priority 4**.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** In the drawing, the ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedge (coming out of the page). In a zig-zag chain representation, this means the implicit -H (priority 4) is on a dash (going into the page).\n*   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n*   Path: C2 (left) -> C4 (right) -> Ethyl (up). This traces a **clockwise** circle.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is R**.\n\n**Chiral Center C4 (the rightmost carbon):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, -C3.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2:** The carbon is attached to (N, H, H).\n    2.  **-C3:** The carbon is attached to (C, C, H), as determined before.\n    3.  **-CH3:** The carbon is attached to (H, H, H).\n    4.  **-H:** Lowest priority.\n    *   Comparing the atoms attached to C4: C(of CH2NH2) vs C(of C3) vs C(of CH3). All are carbon. We look at the next atoms.\n    *   From -CH2NH2: (N, H, H).\n    *   From -C3: (C, C, H).\n    *   From -CH3: (H, H, H).\n    *   Comparing the highest atomic number atom: N vs C vs H. Nitrogen wins. Thus, **-CH2NH2 is priority 1**.\n    *   Comparing -C3 and -CH3: C vs H. Carbon wins. Thus, **-C3 is priority 2**.\n    *   **-CH3 is priority 3**.\n    *   **-H is priority 4**.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The drawing shows -CH2NH2 (priority 1) on a wedge and -CH3 (priority 3) on a dash. This means the other two bonds (-H and -C3) lie in the plane of the zig-zag chain.\n*   To determine the configuration, we can orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (-H) points away. Let's mentally rotate the molecule around the C3-C4 bond so H points away from us. Alternatively, we can use the swap method. Let's swap the positions of -H (4) and -CH3 (3). Now, -H is on the dash, pointing away. The new arrangement is C3(2) in the plane, -CH2NH2(1) on a wedge, and -CH3(3) in the plane.\n*   With -H pointing away, we trace 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n*   Path: -CH2NH2 (up/wedge) -> C3 (left) -> -CH3 (right). This traces a **clockwise** circle.\n*   This means the configuration of the *swapped* molecule is R. Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at **C4 is S**.\n\n**Chiral Center C2 (the leftmost carbon):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -OH, -CH3 (which is C1), -C3.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH:** Oxygen has the highest atomic number. Priority 1.\n    2.  **-C3:** Attached to (C, C, H). Priority 2.\n    3.  **-CH3:** Attached to (H, H, H). Priority 3.\n    4.  **-H:** Lowest priority.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The drawing for C2 is ambiguous under standard conventions, as it shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group on dashed bonds. In a tetrahedral carbon with two bonds in the plane (the backbone), the other two must be one wedge and one dash. However, if we assume the drawing is a valid, albeit non-standard, 3D representation, the two dashed bonds going \"back\" would force the fourth bond (to the implicit -H) to be on a wedge, pointing \"forward\".\n*   Let's proceed with this interpretation: -H (priority 4) is on a wedge.\n*   When the lowest priority group points towards the observer, the configuration is the reverse of what the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path indicates.\n*   Path: -OH (1, back) -> -C3 (2, right/plane) -> -CH3 (3, back). This traces a **clockwise** circle.\n*   Since -H is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) is reversed to Counter-clockwise (S).\n*   Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is S**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining the configurations of the three chiral centers, we get:\n*   C2: S\n*   C3: R\n*   C4: S\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<(2S, 3R, 4S)>>>"
