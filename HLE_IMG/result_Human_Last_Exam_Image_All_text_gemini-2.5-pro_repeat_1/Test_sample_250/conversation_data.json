    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n    *   **Tonic Chord:** The first chord is F minor (F-), and the piece resolves to an F chord at the end. This strongly establishes the key as **F minor**.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n    *   **Melody:** The opening melodic phrase starts on the note C, descends to A♭, then G. The notes are C, A♭, G.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The most distinct feature is the chord progression in the first few bars.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Harmonic Progression:**\n    *   The first four bars of the piece have the following chord progression:\n        `| F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 ... |`\n    *   This progression is built on a **chromatic descending root movement**: F → E → E♭ → D♭.\n    *   This specific harmonic sequence is very distinctive and serves as a musical \"fingerprint\".\n\n3.  **Matching the Progression to a Jazz Standard:**\n    *   This unique opening progression is the signature of the famous jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n    *   While the tune is most famously recorded in B♭ minor, it is often played in other keys, such as the F minor seen in this chart. The harmonic relationship between the chords remains the same:\n        `| i- | viiø7 | bvii-6 | bVImaj7 |`\n\n4.  **Identifying the Composer:**\n    *   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the renowned jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. He first recorded it in 1956 with the Jazz Messengers.\n\n5.  **Addressing Inconsistencies (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Melody:** A careful listener or musician might notice that the melody written on this sheet music does not perfectly match the standard \"head\" (main melody) of \"Nica's Dream\" as it is most commonly played.\n    *   **Form:** Furthermore, the overall structure of the tune on this sheet (a 24-bar form) is a simplification and alteration of the original composition's much longer and more complex form (typically a 64-bar AABA form where each section is 16 bars).\n    *   **Conclusion on Inconsistencies:** The provided image is a handwritten lead sheet, likely from a musician's personal \"fake book\". Such charts are often simplified, re-harmonized, or contain inaccuracies from being transcribed by ear or from memory. Despite these differences, the opening chord progression is so uniquely tied to \"Nica's Dream\" that it remains the definitive clue for identification.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the unmistakable and famous chromatic chord progression that opens the piece, the jazz standard is identified as \"Nica's Dream\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
