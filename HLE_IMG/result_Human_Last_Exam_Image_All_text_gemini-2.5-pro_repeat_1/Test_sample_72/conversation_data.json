    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves two molecules:\n    1.  Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆): An aromatic ring with a 6π electron system.\n    2.  Cyclobutene (C₄H₄): A four-membered ring with a 2π electron system.\n*   **Reaction Conditions**: The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This is a critical piece of information, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical processes.\n*   **Product**: The product is a complex polycyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀H₄F₆ (derived from C₆F₆ + C₄H₄). The drawing shows a cage-like structure. The question states that the formation of this product involves two distinct pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Propose and Analyze Plausible Mechanistic Pathways**\n\nPericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. We need to find a sequence of two photochemically allowed reactions that transform the reactants into the product.\n\nTwo primary mechanistic pathways can be considered for the reaction between benzene derivatives and alkenes under photochemical conditions.\n\n**Pathway A: Intermolecular Cycloaddition followed by Intramolecular Electrocyclic Reaction**\n\n1.  **First Reaction: [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n    *   The first step is a direct intermolecular cycloaddition between one of the π bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the π bond of cyclobutene.\n    *   This is a [π2 + π2] cycloaddition. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    *   This reaction forms an intermediate which is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene fused to a cyclobutane ring. This intermediate contains a conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene system (a 4π electron system).\n    *   **Reaction Type 1: Cycloaddition**\n\n2.  **Second Reaction: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Closure**\n    *   The 1,3-diene system in the intermediate can undergo a subsequent photochemical reaction.\n    *   This involves the 4π electron system of the diene undergoing an electrocyclic ring closure to form a cyclobutene ring.\n    *   According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed via a conrotatory process.\n    *   This second step converts the bicyclic diene part of the intermediate into a more complex cage structure containing a new four-membered ring.\n    *   **Reaction Type 2: Electrocyclic Reaction**\n\n**Pathway B: Intramolecular Valence Isomerization followed by Intermolecular Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **First Reaction: Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene, upon photolysis, can isomerize to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene is known to be significantly more stable than its non-fluorinated parent compound.\n    *   This valence isomerization involves the reorganization of the 6π system of benzene to form a bicyclic structure. This process is a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction. It can be classified as a complex **electrocyclic reaction** or formally as an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Reaction Type 1: Electrocyclic Reaction** (or Valence Isomerization)\n\n2.  **Second Reaction: [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n    *   The hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate, which contains two reactive double bonds, then reacts with cyclobutene.\n    *   This reaction is a [π2 + π2] photocycloaddition between one of the double bonds of Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction is photochemically allowed.\n    *   The final product is formed by fusing the cyclobutene ring to the Dewar benzene structure.\n    *   **Reaction Type 2: Cycloaddition**\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion on the Types of Reactions**\n\nBoth plausible pathways, A and B, involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions:\n*   A **cycloaddition**, where two separate π systems combine to form a ring.\n*   An **electrocyclic reaction**, where a conjugated π system within a single molecule forms a ring.\n\nThe question asks for the kinds of pericyclic reactions involved. Regardless of the exact sequence of events (Pathway A or B), the transformation is accomplished through one cycloaddition and one electrocyclic reaction.\n\nFinal list of careful points:\n*   The reaction is photochemical, so Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical reactions apply.\n*   The reactants combine to form a C₁₀ polycyclic system.\n*   Two plausible mechanistic sequences exist, but both involve the same two types of pericyclic reactions.\n*   Pathway A involves an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic reaction.\n*   Pathway B involves an intramolecular electrocyclic reaction (valence isomerization) followed by an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n*   In both cases, the two types of pericyclic reactions are **cycloaddition** and **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\nThe final answer is the identification of these two reaction types.\n\n<<<A cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction>>>"
