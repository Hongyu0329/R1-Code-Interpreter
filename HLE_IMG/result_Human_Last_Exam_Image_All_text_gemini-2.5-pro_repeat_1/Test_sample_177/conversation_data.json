    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by cars when moving from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** The total miles traveled by vehicles. We are concerned with the VMT of cars, which includes both single-occupant cars and carpools.\n*   **Weighted Average:** Since trips are distributed across different distance categories, we need to calculate a weighted total VMT based on the share of trips in each category. The formula for the VMT contribution of each category is: `(Share of total trips) x (Mode share for cars) x (Average trip distance)`.\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nFirst, for each distance category, we find the total mode share for cars by adding the share for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% (share of total trips) * 53% (car share) * 1 mile = 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% (share of total trips) * 81% (car share) * 4 miles = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% (share of total trips) * 85% (car share) * 7.5 miles = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% (share of total trips) * 89% (car share) * 20 miles = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT (as a weighted value):**\n`Baseline VMT = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% (share of total trips) * 3% (car share) * 1 mile = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% (share of total trips) * 27% (car share) * 4 miles = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% (share of total trips) * 41% (car share) * 7.5 miles = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% (share of total trips) * 49% (car share) * 20 miles = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT (as a weighted value):**\n`Proposed VMT = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n---\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) * 100%`.\n\n*   **Initial Value (Baseline VMT):** 4.7077\n*   **Final Value (Proposed VMT):** 2.2505\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   `Reduction = ((4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077) * 100`\n*   `Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100`\n*   `Reduction = 0.52195... * 100`\n*   `Reduction â‰ˆ 52.2%`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question asks for **Vehicle** Miles Traveled (VMT), not **Person** Miles Traveled (PMT). The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are irrelevant for calculating VMT and should be ignored.\n*   The VMT for each distance category must be weighted by the \"share of total trips\" for that category.\n*   Car VMT includes both single-occupant and carpool (more than 2 occupants) trips. Their mode shares must be combined.\n*   The calculation uses all four distance categories to arrive at a total VMT value for each scenario.\n\n---\n**Final Answer:**\nThe percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
