The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises from the steric hindrance of the bicyclic Münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. The fused five-membered ring creates a sterically crowded environment around the C4 position of the 1,3-dipole. Consequently, the bulky methoxycarbonyl group of the dipolarophile (methyl propiolate) preferentially attacks the less hindered C2 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomer, Product B. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish a baseline, showing that when the substituents at C2 and C4 of the Münchnone are sterically similar and small (as in the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine precursor), there is no steric preference, and the cycloaddition proceeds without regioselectivity, yielding a mixture of products. This comparison highlights that the rigid, sterically demanding framework of the proline-derived intermediate is solely responsible for enforcing the high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3.
