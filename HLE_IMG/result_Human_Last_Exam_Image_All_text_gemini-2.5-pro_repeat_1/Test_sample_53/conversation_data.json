    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from a piece of ancient Greek pottery, specifically a red-figure vase. We see a central scene involving a chariot.\n    *   **In the chariot:** There are two figures. The driver is a woman wearing ornate, patterned clothing and a distinctive headdress (often identified as a Phrygian cap, indicating an Eastern origin). She holds the reins and a goad or scepter. Next to her is another figure, draped in white cloth, whose form is less clear but appears to be a body being transported.\n    *   **The Chariot and Horse:** The chariot is drawn by at least one white horse, partially visible on the left. A large white wing is depicted above the scene, suggesting the chariot is magical and capable of flight.\n    *   **On the ground:** A nude male figure lies prone on the ground in front of the chariot, appearing dead or dying. His body is positioned as if run over or left behind by the departing chariot.\n    *   **Style and Context:** The style is typical of South Italian (Apulian) red-figure vase painting from the 4th century BCE. These vases often depicted dramatic mythological scenes.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the mythological scene.**\n    The combination of a powerful female figure in foreign attire, a magical winged chariot, and dead children is a classic representation of the myth of **Medea**.\n    *   **The Story:** Medea, a sorceress from Colchis, helped Jason obtain the Golden Fleece. He later abandoned her to marry Glauce (or Creusa), the princess of Corinth. In revenge, Medea murdered Glauce and her father, King Creon. To complete her vengeance and inflict maximum suffering on Jason, she then murdered her own two sons. Finally, she escaped from Corinth in a chariot drawn by winged serpents (or dragons), sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n    *   **Matching the Scene to the Myth:**\n        *   The female driver is **Medea**. Her Eastern dress is a key attribute.\n        *   The winged chariot is the magical chariot of Helios.\n        *   The figure on the ground is one of her murdered sons.\n        *   The draped figure in the chariot with her is the body of her other son, which she is taking away to deny Jason the right to bury them.\n\n*   **Step 3: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" The term \"leaving\" can be interpreted as being left behind or having departed from the group in the chariot. The figure on the ground has been left for dead as Medea makes her escape. He is dramatically separated from the chariot's occupants. Therefore, the figure is one of Medea's sons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The painting depicts Medea's escape from Corinth after murdering her children. The figure on the ground, who has been \"left\" by the departing chariot, is one of the two sons she had with Jason.\n\n<<<One of Medea's sons>>>"
