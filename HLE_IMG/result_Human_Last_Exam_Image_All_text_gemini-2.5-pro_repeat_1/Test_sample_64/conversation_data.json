    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the depicted process:\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The image consists of three panels labeled L, M, and N. Each panel shows a close-up, microscopic view of a long, thin, filamentous structure. This structure is divided into compartments by cross-walls, which are known as septa. This morphology is characteristic of fungal hyphae. The panels appear to show a sequence of events.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Panel L:** This panel shows a segment of a fungal hypha. It is relatively straight. The internal content appears granular, representing the cytoplasm. An arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall separating two adjacent cells in the hypha. This panel seems to represent the starting condition.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Panel M:** In this panel, the same hypha is shown, but a change has occurred. A small, rounded bulge or swelling is emerging from the side of the hypha, located near the septum that was pointed out in panel L. The arrowhead in this panel specifically indicates this new outgrowth. This suggests the initiation of a new structure.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Panel N:** This panel shows a later stage of the process. The bulge seen in panel M has grown and elongated significantly, forming a new, smaller hypha that extends away from the original one. This new structure is a branch. The arrowhead now points to the junction where the new branch has formed. The main hypha also appears to have bent at this point.\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Conclusion:** By observing the progression from panel L to M to N, we can see a clear developmental sequence. An existing hypha (L) initiates an outgrowth (M), which then develops into a new, secondary hypha (N). This process of forming a new hypha from an existing one is called **hyphal branching** or **lateral branching**. This is a primary mechanism of growth for fungi, allowing them to form an extensive network called a mycelium. The arrowheads meticulously track the location where the branch originates and develops.\n\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"
