    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Sheet Music Basics**\n*   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature. This indicates the key is C Major or A minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The \"C\" symbol after the clef indicates 4/4 time, also known as common time.\n*   **Chord Symbols:** The music includes chord symbols written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7). This format, a melody line with chord changes, is called a \"lead sheet\" and is very common in jazz and popular music.\n*   **Tempo:** A tempo marking at the top left reads \"M.M. ‚ô© = 120\", indicating a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute.\n*   **Musical Structure:** The sheet music includes navigation markings like \"D.S. al Coda\" (which is what \"To go out, take ùÑã to Coda\" means, with ùÑã being the Segno sign) and a \"Coda\" (ending section). This is a standard structure for jazz tunes and popular songs, allowing for improvisation over the main form before jumping to a concluding passage.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Melody and Harmony**\n*   **Melody:** Let's transcribe the first few bars of the melody to identify the tune.\n    *   Pickup notes: G, A\n    *   Measure 1 (over a C chord): B, C, D, E\n    *   Measure 2 (over a C chord): G, F, E, D\n    *   Measure 3 (over an E7 chord): C, B, A, G#\n    *   Measure 4 (over an F chord): A, B, C, B\n*   **Recognition:** This melodic phrase is highly distinctive and is the main theme of the song **\"Limehouse Blues\"**.\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression shown (C -> E7 -> F -> C -> Dm7 -> G7 -> C) is a classic jazz progression and is characteristic of \"Limehouse Blues\". The E7 chord acts as a secondary dominant, leading to the subdominant F chord (or its relative minor, A minor, which is often implied). The Dm7 -> G7 -> C sequence is a standard ii-V-I cadence, the most common harmonic progression in jazz.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Musical Style**\n*   The song \"Limehouse Blues\" was originally composed as a foxtrot for a musical revue.\n*   However, its catchy melody and harmonically interesting chord changes made it extremely popular with jazz musicians shortly after it was written.\n*   It quickly became a widely performed and recorded **Jazz** standard.\n*   The syncopated rhythm, the melodic phrasing with arpeggios and chromatic notes, and the fast tempo on this particular lead sheet are especially characteristic of the **Gypsy Jazz** (or \"Jazz Manouche\") style, famously pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist St√©phane Grappelli. Their recording of \"Limehouse Blues\" is one of the definitive versions of the tune.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\n*   \"Limehouse Blues\" was written in 1921. The music was composed by Philip Braham and the lyrics by Douglas Furber.\n*   It was created for a London-based stage revue called \"A to Z\".\n*   Limehouse is a district in the East End of London, England.\n*   Therefore, the song's country of origin is the **United Kingdom**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, notation style, and historical context, we can identify all the required elements.\n\n*   **Title:** Limehouse Blues\n*   **Musical Style:** Jazz (specifically, the arrangement suggests the Gypsy Jazz subgenre)\n*   **Country of Origin:** United Kingdom\n\n<<<Title: Limehouse Blues\nMusical Style: Jazz / Gypsy Jazz\nCountry of Origin: United Kingdom>>>"
