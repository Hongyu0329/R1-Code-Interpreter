    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe circuit is an infinite RC ladder network. We need to find the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The cutoff frequency (or -3dB frequency) of a filter is the frequency at which the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its passband (or DC) value. For a simple first-order RC low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $C$ is the capacitance and $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit looking into node $a_0$ with the capacitor $C$ removed and the input voltage source at 'IN' deactivated. Deactivating a voltage source means replacing it with a short circuit, so node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n\nThe problem is now to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. We can solve this by applying a test voltage $V_x$ at node $a_0$ and calculating the current $I_x$ drawn from the source. Then, $R_{th} = V_x / I_x$.\n\n**3. Setting up Nodal Analysis Equations**\nLet the potentials at the nodes be $v_{cn}$ and $v_{dn}$. We have the following conditions:\n*   $v_{a0} = V_x$\n*   $v_{c0} = 0$ (ground)\n*   The current from the test source is $I_x = (V_x - v_{d1}) / r$.\n\nWe can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for the nodes (assuming all resistors have resistance $r$):\n*   **Node $d_1$**: The sum of currents leaving the node is zero.\n    $\\frac{v_{d1} - V_x}{r} + \\frac{v_{d1} - v_{c1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{d1} - v_{d2}}{r} = 0$\n    $3v_{d1} - v_{c1} - v_{d2} = V_x$  (Eq. 1)\n\n*   **Node $c_1$**:\n    $\\frac{v_{c1} - v_{c0}}{r} + \\frac{v_{c1} - v_{d1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{c1} - v_{c2}}{r} = 0$\n    Since $v_{c0}=0$, this simplifies to:\n    $3v_{c1} - v_{d1} - v_{c2} = 0$  (Eq. 2)\n\n*   **General nodes for $n \\ge 2$**:\n    $3v_{dn} - v_{d(n-1)} - v_{cn} - v_{d(n+1)} = 0$  (Eq. 3)\n    $3v_{cn} - v_{c(n-1)} - v_{dn} - v_{c(n+1)} = 0$  (Eq. 4)\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\nFor the infinite part of the ladder ($n \\ge 2$), we look for solutions that decay to zero as $n \\to \\infty$. A standard technique is to define sum and difference variables: $s_n = v_{cn} + v_{dn}$ and $m_n = v_{cn} - v_{dn}$. Adding and subtracting (Eq. 3) and (Eq. 4) yields two decoupled difference equations for $n \\ge 2$:\n*   $s_{n+1} - 2s_n + s_{n-1} = 0$\n*   $m_{n+1} - 4m_n + m_{n-1} = 0$\n\nThe solutions that decay to zero at infinity are:\n*   $s_n = 0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n*   $m_n = A \\cdot k^n$, where $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nBy extending the logic to the boundary nodes, we find that $s_1 = v_{c1} + v_{d1} = 0$, which implies $v_{c1} = -v_{d1}$.\nFrom the recurrence for $m_n$, we have $m_2 = k \\cdot m_1$.\n$m_1 = v_{c1} - v_{d1} = -v_{d1} - v_{d1} = -2v_{d1}$.\n$m_2 = v_{c2} - v_{d2}$. Since $s_2=v_{c2}+v_{d2}=0$, we have $v_{c2}=-v_{d2}$, so $m_2 = -2v_{d2}$.\nSubstituting these into $m_2 = k \\cdot m_1$ gives:\n$-2v_{d2} = (2-\\sqrt{3})(-2v_{d1}) \\Rightarrow v_{d2} = (2-\\sqrt{3})v_{d1}$.\n\n**5. Calculating $R_{th}$**\nNow we substitute $v_{c1} = -v_{d1}$ and $v_{d2} = (2-\\sqrt{3})v_{d1}$ into the KCL equation for node $d_1$ (Eq. 1):\n$3v_{d1} - (-v_{d1}) - (2-\\sqrt{3})v_{d1} = V_x$\n$v_{d1}(3 + 1 - 2 + \\sqrt{3}) = V_x$\n$v_{d1}(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = V_x \\Rightarrow v_{d1} = \\frac{V_x}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nNow we can find the current $I_x$:\n$I_x = \\frac{V_x - v_{d1}}{r} = \\frac{V_x - \\frac{V_x}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}}{r} = \\frac{V_x}{r} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}\\right)$\n$I_x = \\frac{V_x}{r} \\left(\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{V_x}{r} \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_x}{I_x}$:\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3}}{1 + \\sqrt{3}}$.\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}-1)$:\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{(2 + \\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = r \\frac{2\\sqrt{3} - 2 + 3 - \\sqrt{3}}{3-1} = r \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we substitute $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{C \\cdot r \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{rC(1 + \\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nTo get a cleaner expression, we can rationalize the denominator:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{rC(1 + \\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{rC(3-1)} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{2rC} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency (in rad/s) is given by this expression.\n\n<<<$ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC} $>>>"
