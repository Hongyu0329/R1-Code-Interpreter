    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\n*   **Artwork Type:** The image displays a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame, also known as a tondo.\n*   **Medium:** The glossy surface and style are characteristic of glazed terracotta, a medium famously perfected and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in Renaissance Florence.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a priest administering a sacrament to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This is a religious ceremony.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a plaque with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be translated from a mix of Latin and Old French/Italian as \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is a term for the Eucharist or Holy Communion.\n*   **Style:** The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and piety. The composition is balanced and clear. The surrounding frame is elaborately decorated with fruit and leaf motifs (garlands), another hallmark of the Della Robbia style.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the initial analysis.**\nThe combination of the medium (glazed terracotta), the style (Florentine Renaissance), and the characteristic decorative elements strongly suggests the author is a member of the Della Robbia workshop. The most prominent artists from this workshop are Luca della Robbia and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Step 3: Use specific details to confirm the hypothesis and identify the exact artwork and artist.**\n*   The subject matter, the Eucharist, is one of the Seven Sacraments. It is plausible that this tondo is part of a larger altarpiece dedicated to the Seven Sacraments.\n*   A search for \"Della Robbia Seven Sacraments Altarpiece\" or \"Della Robbia 'Sacramenti de l'autel'\" leads to a specific, well-known work.\n*   This tondo is a detail from the *Altarpiece of the Sacraments* located in the Pieve delle Sante Flora e Lucilla in the town of Santa Fiora, Tuscany, Italy.\n*   Art historical records confirm that this altarpiece, which includes several tondos depicting the sacraments surrounding a baptismal font, was created by **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525).\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe detail shown in the image is the tondo representing the Eucharist from the *Altarpiece of the Sacraments* in Santa Fiora. The author of this masterpiece is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
