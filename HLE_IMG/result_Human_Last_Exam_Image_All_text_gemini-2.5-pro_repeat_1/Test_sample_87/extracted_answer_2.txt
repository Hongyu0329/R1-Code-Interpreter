**Product A:**
The structure is 2-acetyl-2-((E)-2-(methoxycarbonyl)vinyl)-1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine.

A more accurate representation: A pyrrolidine ring. At N1, a 1-pyrrolin-2-yl group is attached. At C2, both an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a -CH=CHCOOCH3 group are attached.

**Product B:**
The structure is an aromatic pyrrolizine derivative. A plausible structure is 6-hydroxy-1-(methoxycarbonyl)-4-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)-4H-pyrrolizine.
This consists of a bicyclic aromatic pyrrolizine core. It has a methoxycarbonyl group on the aromatic ring, a hydroxyl group on the saturated ring, and the nitrogen atom of the core is attached to a pyrrolidinone (lactam) ring.

**Product C:**
The structure is 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride. It is the starting material where the -COOH group has been converted to a -CO-O-CO-CH3 group.
