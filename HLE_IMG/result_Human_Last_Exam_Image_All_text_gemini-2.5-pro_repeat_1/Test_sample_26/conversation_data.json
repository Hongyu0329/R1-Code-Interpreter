    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Key Signature:**\n    *   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided score, we can locate measure 28, and count two measures forward to find measure 30. This measure is circled in the provided image.\n    *   The key signature shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor (or its relative major, E♭ major). Given the context of the \"Pathetique\" Sonata's first movement (*Allegro di molto e con brio* section), the tonic key is C minor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are a two-note chord, D and F♯, played as eighth notes throughout the measure.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are a rapid passage of 32nd notes. The pattern is G-B♮ followed by F♯-A.\n\n3.  **Combine the Notes to Determine the Chord:**\n    *   Let's list all the distinct pitches present in the measure: D, F♯, A, G, B♮.\n    *   The foundational harmony is typically outlined by the bass and the notes on the stronger beats. The left hand clearly establishes D and F♯.\n    *   In the right hand, the note A falls on a relatively strong part of the beat pattern. Together with the left hand, the notes D, F♯, and A form a **D major triad**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Function of the Chord within the Key:**\n    *   We are in the key of C minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is C minor.\n    *   The dominant chord (V) is G major. The dominant chord is major because the leading tone (B) is raised to B♮.\n    *   The chord we have identified in measure 30 is a D major chord. D is the second scale degree (supertonic) in C minor.\n    *   A D major chord is not diatonic to C minor (the diatonic supertonic is a D diminished triad: D-F-A♭).\n    *   This D major chord functions as a **secondary dominant**. It is the dominant chord of another chord in the key. A D major chord (D-F♯-A) is the dominant of G.\n    *   Since G major is the dominant (V) of C minor, the D major chord is the **dominant of the dominant**.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for the dominant of the dominant is written as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n    *   We also need to check the inversion. The root of the D major chord is D. The lowest note played in the measure is D (in the left hand). Therefore, the chord is in **root position**.\n\n6.  **Consider the \"Extra\" Notes:**\n    *   What about the G and B♮ in the right hand? These notes are not part of the D major triad. They are best analyzed as non-chord tones.\n    *   Specifically, they can be interpreted as anticipatory notes that hint at the upcoming dominant (V) harmony (G major chord: G-B♮-D). Beethoven cleverly combines the V/V harmony with elements of the V chord to create intense harmonic tension that drives the music forward to the resolution in the following measures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fundamental harmony of measure 30 is a D major triad, which functions as the dominant of the dominant (V/V) in the key of C minor. It is in root position.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
