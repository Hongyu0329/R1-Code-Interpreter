    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sexes. The analysis will rely on key morphological differences (sexual dimorphism) between males and females in these insect groups.\n\n**Careful Points & General Principles for Sexing:**\n\n*   **Antennae:** In many Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), males have longer antennae with more segments than females (typically 13 in males vs. 12 in females). The shape of the antennae, especially the tip, can also be a key indicator.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** The shape of the abdomen's tip is often different. Females have an ovipositor (egg-laying organ), which is modified into a stinger in many bees and wasps, making the abdomen appear pointed. Males lack a stinger and have external genitalia, often resulting in a blunter abdominal tip, sometimes with claspers or spines. The number of visible abdominal segments can also differ (typically 7 in males vs. 6 in females).\n*   **Facial Markings:** In some species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (particularly the clypeus) than females.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The problem states the collection is of taxa *without* scopae. This is a crucial clue. Scopae are dense brushes of hair on the hind legs (or sometimes abdomen) of female bees used for carrying pollen. Their absence points towards groups like cuckoo bees (which are kleptoparasites and don't collect pollen), wasps, or male bees (which also don't collect pollen).\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\nThis genus is known for being kleptoparasites of leafcutter and mason bees. Females lack scopae because they don't provision their own nests.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This bee has a very distinct, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This specialized shape is characteristic of a **female** *Coelioxys*. She uses this pointed abdomen to pierce the nest cell of a host bee and lay her egg inside.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This bee's abdomen is blunt at the tip and features several noticeable spines or teeth. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a **male** *Coelioxys*.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (likely genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps do not have scopae. Males and females can be distinguished by their antennae and abdominal tips.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic characteristic of **male** paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. The abdomen appears to end in a point, which would conceal the stinger. This morphology is consistent with a **female** paper wasp (a worker or a queen).\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*)**\nThis pair presents a slight puzzle with the \"no scopae\" rule, as female long-horned bees have very prominent scopae. However, the sexual dimorphism in this group is so pronounced that we can rely on other features. The rule likely applies to the collection in general (like pairs A and B) or refers to the fact that males lack scopae.\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee exhibits two definitive male characteristics. First, its antennae are extremely long, extending well beyond its head. This is the feature that gives \"long-horned bees\" their name. Second, its face has a large, bright yellow patch on the clypeus (the plate below the antennae). This is a **male**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee, seen from above, has antennae that are visibly much shorter, a typical trait for a **female** of this group. The abdomen is also broader and more robust, consistent with a female.\n\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Female, Male (F, M) -> **4**\n*   **Pair B:** Male, Female (M, F) -> **3**\n*   **Pair C:** Male, Female (M, F) -> **3**\n\nCombining these indices gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
