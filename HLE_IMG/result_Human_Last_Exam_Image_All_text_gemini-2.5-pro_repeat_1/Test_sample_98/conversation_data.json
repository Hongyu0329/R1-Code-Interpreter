    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The image shows a famous ancient artifact. By analyzing its features, specifically the double portrait in profile and the Hellenistic style, the object is identified as the **Gonzaga Cameo**. The provided image is a black and white photograph, possibly of an impression made from the original gem.\n\n2.  **Iconography:** The cameo depicts a man and a woman. The most widely accepted identification is that they are the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt, **Ptolemy II Philadelphus** and his sister-wife **Arsinoe II**. The male figure wears a laurel wreath and an aegis, symbols of royalty and divinity. This type of portrait was used to promote the royal cult and solidify the dynasty's power.\n\n3.  **Origin and Style:** The cameo was created in Alexandria, Egypt, a major center for arts and culture during the Hellenistic period. The style of carving—with its idealized yet distinct features, subtle modeling, and expert craftsmanship—is a prime example of the high quality of Alexandrian court art.\n\n4.  **Dating:** Archaeologists and art historians date the cameo based on the reign of the depicted rulers. Ptolemy II Philadelphus reigned from 283 to 246 BC. The cameo was likely commissioned during their joint rule (c. 275–270 BC) or shortly after Arsinoe's death to commemorate their deified union. This places the creation of the object firmly within the **3rd century BC**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on historical and stylistic evidence, the Gonzaga Cameo is ascribed to the 3rd century BC. The question asks for the century. Following the provided example format \"9 A.D.\" (which uses a number and an era designation), the answer is formatted as the century number followed by the era.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The object must be correctly identified as the Gonzaga Cameo.\n*   The figures must be correctly identified as Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, which is the key to dating the object.\n*   The reign of Ptolemy II places the object in the 3rd century BC (specifically, between 300 BC and 201 BC).\n*   The answer format must be considered. The example \"9 A.D.\" suggests a format of `[Number] [Era]`. Applying this to the \"3rd century B.C.\" leads to the format \"3 B.C.\". It's important to distinguish this from the year 3 B.C.; in the context of the question and the example, it represents the 3rd century B.C.\n\n<<<3 B.C.>>>"
