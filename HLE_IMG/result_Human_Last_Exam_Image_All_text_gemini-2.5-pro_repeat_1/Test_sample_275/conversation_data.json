    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR data.\n\n**Goal:** Identify and count all unique splice species (mRNA variants) detected by the various RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. A splice species is a unique mRNA molecule defined by its specific combination of exons resulting from splicing. Each distinct band on the gel represents at least one unique species.\n\n**Analysis of Each Panel:**\n\n1.  **Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R):**\n    *   This experiment uses a forward primer in the E1 gene and a reverse primer in the E4 gene.\n    *   Two distinct bands are observed: band 1 (190 bp) and band 2 (159 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates there are **two different splice species** in this region. These species differ by a splicing event that removes an additional 31 bp (190 - 159) in one variant compared to the other.\n    *   **Running Count: 2 species.**\n\n2.  **Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R):**\n    *   This uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a reverse primer further downstream in the E5 gene (E5R).\n    *   Two bands are again observed: band 1 (584 bp) and band 2 (553 bp). The size difference is again 31 bp (584 - 553).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the existence of the same two splice variants found in Panel B, showing they both extend to the E5 region. No new species are identified here.\n    *   **Running Count: 2 species.**\n\n3.  **Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R):**\n    *   This uses a specific forward primer, E1F2, which is designed to span the splice junction between nucleotides 929 and 3465.\n    *   A single band of 551 bp is observed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a new species that is different from the two in Panel B/C because it uses a different 5' splice site (nt 929). This is a **third distinct splice species**.\n    *   **Running Count: 2 + 1 = 3 species.**\n\n4.  **Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R):**\n    *   This pair amplifies a region from E1 to L2, spanning across the early polyadenylation site (AE).\n    *   A single band of 1,005 bp is observed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This represents a transcript that is initiated in the E1 region (like those in panel B) but continues past the early polyadenylation site. This long read-through transcript is a **fourth distinct species**.\n    *   **Running Count: 3 + 1 = 4 species.**\n\n5.  **Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R):**\n    *   This uses the 929^3465 splice-specific primer (E1F2) and amplifies into the L2 region.\n    *   A single band of 972 bp is observed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a long read-through transcript that also contains the 929^3465 splice. It is distinct from the species in Panel D (different 3' end/read-through) and Panel E (different 5' splice site). This is a **fifth distinct species**.\n    *   **Running Count: 4 + 1 = 5 species.**\n\n6.  **Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R):**\n    *   This uses another splice-specific primer, E1F3, spanning the 929^3506 junction, and amplifies to the L2 region.\n    *   Two distinct bands are observed: band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n    *   **Conclusion:** These two bands represent two different splice species that both share the 929^3506 splice but differ in another splicing event elsewhere. Since they use a splice junction not previously detected (929^3506), they represent **two new species**.\n    *   **Running Count: 5 + 2 = 7 species.**\n\n7.  **Panels H and I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R):**\n    *   This pair amplifies a region from the early gene E1 all the way to the late gene L1. Panel I is the same reaction as H but run for more cycles to detect less abundant products.\n    *   Panel H shows two main bands (450 bp and 419 bp).\n    *   Panel I shows a total of four bands: 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Each of these four different-sized products must arise from a unique splicing pattern that joins the E1 region to the L1 region. Therefore, these experiments reveal **four additional distinct splice species**.\n    *   **Running Count: 7 + 4 = 11 species.**\n\n**Final Tally:**\nBy systematically analyzing each experiment and counting only the unique species identified by each distinct band or set of bands, we find:\n*   2 species from Panel B.\n*   1 new species from Panel D.\n*   1 new species from Panel E.\n*   1 new species from Panel F.\n*   2 new species from Panel G.\n*   4 new species from Panels H/I.\n\nTotal = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 different splice species detected in these experiments.\n\n<<<11>>>"
