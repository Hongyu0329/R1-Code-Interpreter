    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Structure\nThe given function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm designed to sort an array `a` of size `n`. Let's break down its components:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is considered sorted by definition. The `if n > 1:` condition handles this.\n2.  **Recursive Step 1:** `sort(a, n - 1)` is called. This call is meant to sort the prefix of the array, i.e., the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n3.  **Comparison and Swap:** After the first recursive call, it checks if the last element of the current sub-problem, `a[n-1]`, is smaller than the element preceding it, `a[n-2]`. If it is, the two elements are swapped. This step is similar to a single comparison-and-swap pass in Bubble Sort.\n4.  **Recursive Step 2:** If the swap occurred, the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]` might have been disturbed. Specifically, the old `a[n-2]` is now at index `n-1`, and the smaller `a[n-1]` is now at index `n-2`. The prefix `a[0...n-2]` is no longer guaranteed to be sorted. The algorithm then makes a second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, to re-sort this prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n` in the worst case.\n\n*   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n*   The comparison `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the `swap` operation take constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n*   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. To find the worst-case complexity, we must assume the condition that triggers this call is always met. In this worst-case scenario, this call also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\nThe base case is `T(1) = O(1)` (or `d` for some constant `d`), as the function does nothing when `n=1`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Worst-Case Scenario\nThe worst case occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true after the first `sort(a, n - 1)` call, for every `n` from `n` down to 2. Let's see if such an input exists.\n\nConsider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]`.\nLet's trace `sort(a, 4)`:\n1.  Call `sort(a, 3)` on `[4, 3, 2]`. This will recursively sort the prefix `a[0...2]`, making it `[2, 3, 4]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n2.  Now, back in the `sort(a, 4)` frame, check `if a[3] < a[2]`. This is `1 < 4`, which is true.\n3.  A swap occurs. `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n4.  The second recursive call `sort(a, 3)` is made on the prefix `[2, 3, 1]`. This input will also require a significant amount of work, triggering further worst-case behavior in the levels below.\n\nThis shows that a reverse-sorted array is a valid input that triggers the worst-case behavior where both recursive calls are made at each step.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`.\n\nLet's expand the relation:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is a geometric series which equals `2^k - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\nTo reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince `T(1)` is a constant `d`, the equation becomes:\n*   `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Big-O Complexity\nThe dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d + c) * 2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, we ignore constant factors and lower-order terms.\nTherefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\nThis is an exponential time complexity, which is highly inefficient for a sorting algorithm.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is `O(2^n)`. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
