    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam. It features a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one core. The nitrogen atom is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group, and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is attached to the double bond.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O). CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from amines and alcohols. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The PMB group is removed, and the nitrogen atom becomes part of a secondary amide (N-H). The rest of the bicyclic structure remains unchanged.\n    *   To determine the formula of Intermediate 1, let's analyze its structure: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   Counting the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 carbons in the bicyclic framework (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7) and 1 carbon in the CF3 group, totaling 7 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 1H on C1, 1H on C4, 1H on C5, 2H on C7, and 1H on the nitrogen (N2). Total = 6 hydrogens.\n        *   Fluorine (F): 3 fluorines in the CF3 group.\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1 nitrogen atom.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 oxygen in the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond. The amide carbonyl and the CF3 group are unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the saturated analog of Intermediate 1.\n    *   To find its molecular formula, we add H2 to the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    *   Starting with C7H6F3NO, we add 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Reaction 3**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These conditions promote the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide). A molecule of water (H2O) adds across the amide bond (N-C=O), cleaving it.\n    *   The ring opens.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH2). In the acidic conditions, it will exist as its ammonium salt (-NH3+), but for determining the molecular formula, we consider the neutral form.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is a substituted cyclopentanecarboxylic acid containing an amino group and a trifluoromethyl group.\n    *   To find its molecular formula, we add H2O to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Starting with C7H8F3NO, we add one molecule of water (H2O).\n        *   Carbon (C): 7\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   Fluorine (F): 3\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Final Product** is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Identify the functional groups in the starting material (lactam, alkene, N-PMB, CF3).\n2.  Recognize the specific role of each reagent: CAN for PMB deprotection, Pd/C and H2 for alkene hydrogenation, and hot aqueous acid for amide hydrolysis.\n3.  Accurately track the changes in atom count at each step. Deprotection removes the PMB group and adds a hydrogen. Hydrogenation adds two hydrogens. Hydrolysis adds one molecule of water (H2O).\n4.  Be systematic in counting atoms for the initial intermediate to ensure the subsequent calculations are correct.\n5.  The final molecular formula should represent the neutral molecule, even though the amine group would be protonated in the final acidic reaction mixture.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
