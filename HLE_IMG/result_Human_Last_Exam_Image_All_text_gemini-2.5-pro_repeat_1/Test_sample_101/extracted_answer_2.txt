The final product A is 2-((cyano(phenyl)amino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol. Its structure is a pyridine ring with a hydroxyl group at position 3. At position 2, it is substituted with a methyl group which itself is substituted with a cyano group and a phenylamino group. The structure is as follows:
A six-membered aromatic ring containing one nitrogen atom (a pyridine ring). A hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to the carbon at position 3. A substituted methyl group is attached to the carbon at position 2. This methyl carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a cyano group (-Câ‰¡N), and a phenylamino group (-NH-Ph).
