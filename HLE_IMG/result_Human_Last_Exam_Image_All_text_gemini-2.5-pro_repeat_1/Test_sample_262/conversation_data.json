    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the four complexes.**\nAll four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n*   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n*   The ancillary N^N ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine.\n*   The counter-ion is the same: hexafluorophosphate (PF6-).\n*   The key difference lies in the cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). Specifically, the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand is substituted with a varying number of fluorine atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific C^N ligands and count the fluorine atoms.**\nBy examining the provided chemical structures, we can identify the number of fluorine atoms on each C^N ligand:\n*   **Complex 1:** Each phenyl ring has two fluorine atoms. (Total of 4 fluorine atoms on the two C^N ligands).\n*   **Complex 2:** The phenyl ring is unsubstituted (ppy). It has zero fluorine atoms.\n*   **Complex 3:** Each phenyl ring has one fluorine atom. (Total of 2 fluorine atoms on the two C^N ligands).\n*   **Complex 4:** Each phenyl ring has three fluorine atoms. (Total of 6 fluorine atoms on the two C^N ligands).\n\nThe degree of fluorination on the C^N ligands increases in the order: Complex 2 (none) < Complex 3 (low) < Complex 1 (medium) < Complex 4 (high).\n\n**Step 3: Understand the degradation mechanisms in LECs and the effect of fluorination.**\nThe question specifies that these emitters are for use in **LECs**. This is a critical piece of information. Unlike in vacuum-deposited Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), the emissive layer in an LEC contains mobile ions (the complex cation and the PF6- anion). During operation, these ions drift under the applied voltage, leading to a unique operating mechanism but also introducing specific degradation pathways.\n\nA primary degradation pathway for ionic iridium complexes in LECs is **reductive decomposition**. The Ir(III) center can be reduced to a less stable Ir(II) or Ir(I) species, which then decomposes. The susceptibility of a complex to reduction is measured by its reduction potential. A higher (less negative) reduction potential means the complex is easier to reduce.\n\n**Step 4: Relate fluorination to electrochemical stability.**\n*   Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group when attached to the phenyl ring.\n*   These electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms pull electron density away from the iridium metal center.\n*   This makes the metal center more electron-deficient and thus **easier to reduce**.\n*   Therefore, increasing the number of fluorine atoms on the ligands increases the complex's reduction potential, making it more susceptible to reductive degradation.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the relative lifetimes of the four complexes.**\nThe operational lifetime of the emitter in an LEC is often inversely correlated with its susceptibility to reductive degradation.\n*   The ease of reduction follows the degree of fluorination: Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2.\n*   Therefore, the expected operational lifetime should follow the reverse order: Complex 2 > Complex 3 > Complex 1 > Complex 4.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude and select the answer.**\nThe question asks for the complexes expected to show **shorter lifetimes**. According to our analysis, the complexes with the highest degree of fluorination, Complex 1 and Complex 4, will be the most susceptible to reductive degradation and thus will have the shortest lifetimes. Complex 4 is expected to have the shortest lifetime, followed by Complex 1. These two are significantly more fluorinated than Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should include both Complex 1 and Complex 4.\n\n*Careful Points:*\n*   The context is LECs, not OLEDs. In OLEDs, fluorination often *increases* stability by strengthening C-F and Ir-C bonds. In LECs, the electrochemical environment makes reductive stability a dominant factor, reversing this trend.\n*   The question asks for \"shorter lifetimes\" (plural), suggesting a comparison and grouping. The highly fluorinated complexes (1 and 4) form a logical group distinct from the non-fluorinated or lightly fluorinated ones (2 and 3).\n*   The analysis relies on the number of fluorine atoms as the primary factor, which is a well-established principle for tuning the electrochemical properties of such complexes.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, complexes [1] and [4] are expected to have shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to option G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
