    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the structure in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Coordinate Geolocation:** The first step is to input the provided coordinates (29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W) into a mapping service like Google Maps or Google Earth. This places the location in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, in the Chihuahuan Desert. The prominent road running diagonally is Mexico Federal Highway 16, east of the city of Chihuahua and west of Ojinaga.\n\n2.  **Image Examination:** The aerial image shows a dry, arid landscape with scattered desert scrub. The \"square ancient structure\" mentioned in the question is visible as a faint, squarish outline on the ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image. It appears to be the remains of foundations or low walls, now heavily eroded and covered with some vegetation.\n\n3.  **Archaeological Context Research:** The location is situated within a region of significant archaeological importance known as **La Junta de los Ríos** (the junction of the rivers). This area, centered around the confluence of the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) and the Río Conchos, was home to numerous settlements from approximately 1200 AD to the mid-18th century.\n\n4.  **Specific Site Identification:** Research into archaeological sites at these specific coordinates identifies the structure as part of the **San Juan Evangelista** archaeological site. This site is one of many within the La Junta complex. The square feature is the ruin of a late prehistoric adobe or jacal (wattle-and-daub) pueblo-style building. These were multi-room structures that housed the people of this region before and during the early period of Spanish contact.\n\n5.  **Historic Landmark Status:** In Mexico, all archaeological sites are considered federal property and are protected by the *Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia* (INAH - National Institute of Anthropology and History). Therefore, the San Juan Evangelista site is officially recognized and protected. This means it is, by definition, a **historic landmark**, even though it is not a developed tourist site with extensive reconstructions or public facilities.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Visibility:** The structure is heavily eroded and can be difficult to discern from the surrounding landscape in low-resolution imagery. It's more of an archaeological feature than a standing ruin.\n*   **\"Ancient\" Terminology:** The term \"ancient\" is appropriate. The structure dates back several centuries, to the late pre-Columbian and early historic periods of North America.\n*   **Landmark vs. Tourist Site:** It's crucial to distinguish between a \"historic landmark\" (a site of recognized historical significance) and a \"tourist attraction.\" This site is the former but not the latter. It is an important site for archaeologists and historians.\n*   **The Broader Context:** This single square structure is part of a larger complex of villages and settlements that once thrived along the rivers in this desert region.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude the identity and status of the structure.\n\n<<<The square structure shown in the image is the ruin of an adobe pueblo at the **San Juan Evangelista archaeological site**. It is located in the La Junta de los Ríos region of Chihuahua, Mexico. Yes, it is a **historic landmark**, as it is a protected archaeological site under the jurisdiction of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).>>>"
