    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Core Question and Context.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific product advertised in Britain during World War II. The context is the massive recruitment of new workers, particularly women, for the war effort, as depicted in the provided image of a woman working on a tank.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Claims and Clues.**\n*   **Target Audience:** New workers in Britain during WWII (specifically women, as implied by the ad).\n*   **Product's Claim:** It helped these workers \"overcome inherent limitations.\"\n*   **Product's Name:** The name is \"French-derived.\"\n*   **Image Context:** The ad shows a woman in a factory with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom.\" This establishes the theme of women's contribution to industrial war production.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the phrase \"inherent limitations.\"**\nFrom the perspective of the 1940s, a woman's \"inherent limitations,\" especially in the context of physically demanding factory work, would most pointedly refer to the menstrual cycle. This was often seen and advertised as a period of handicap, discomfort, and reduced capability. A product that helped manage this would allow a woman to work consistently, thereby \"overcoming\" this \"limitation.\" Other interpretations like fatigue or morale exist, but menstruation is a more direct and biologically \"inherent\" limitation as it would have been viewed at the time.\n\n**Step 4: Search for a Product Matching All Criteria.**\nWe need to find a product that:\n1.  Was sold in Britain during WWII.\n2.  Was targeted at women.\n3.  Had a French-derived name.\n4.  Was advertised as a solution to an \"inherent limitation.\"\n\nConsidering the analysis in Step 3, a sanitary product is the most likely candidate. A prominent brand of sanitary towels in Britain during this era was **Femme-Daj**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify \"Femme-Daj\" against the criteria.**\n*   **Sold in WWII Britain:** Yes, Femme-Daj was a common brand of sanitary towels available at the time.\n*   **Targeted at Women:** Yes, it was a female hygiene product.\n*   **French-derived name:** Yes, \"Femme\" is the French word for \"woman.\"\n*   **Claimed to \"overcome inherent limitations\":** Yes. Advertising for Femme-Daj from the period explicitly used language to this effect, suggesting that on days when a woman feels \"handicapped,\" the product allows her to \"carry on\" with her duties, confident and serene. This perfectly matches the prompt's description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the specific incomplete advertisement in the image was for Bourjois cosmetics (which is a French brand), the product that most accurately fits the description of helping women \"overcome inherent limitations\" with a French-derived name is the sanitary towel brand, Femme-Daj. The advertising for Femme-Daj directly addressed the perceived handicap of menstruation for working women, making it the stronger answer to the question as phrased.\n\n<<<Femme-Daj>>>"
