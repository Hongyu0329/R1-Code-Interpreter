    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and General Style:** The music is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs). The tempo is moderately slow (♩ = 80), but the piece contains passages with rapid sixteenth notes, suggesting a virtuosic and dynamic character. The wide range of dynamics, from *piano* (p) to *forte* (f), further supports this.\n\n2.  **Key and Harmony:** The key signature is C major / A minor (no sharps or flats). However, the piece is filled with accidentals (sharps and flats), indicating a highly chromatic harmonic language that frequently moves away from the home key. This creates a sense of tension and drama.\n\n3.  **Structure and Texture (Measure-by-Measure Analysis):**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, quiet melody in the right hand (G-A-B-C-D-E-F) over sustained chords (C major then G major) in the left hand. This creates a calm, almost serene atmosphere.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden shift in dynamics to *forte* (f) and texture. The right hand plays a powerful octave melody on the note E, while the left hand plays fast, driving sixteenth-note arpeggios based on an A minor chord. This abrupt change introduces significant drama.\n    *   **Measures 4-6:** This dramatic pattern continues. The octave melody in the right hand ascends through a chromatic and unusual sequence of notes (F#, A#, D#), while the left-hand arpeggios outline a complex harmonic progression (D minor, G# diminished, C# minor).\n    *   **Measures 8-11:** After a brief transition in measure 7, the texture of octave melody over sixteenth-note arpeggios returns. The melody here is more diatonic, moving G-A-B-C, creating a powerful build-up over a more standard chord progression (F-C-G-C).\n    *   **Measure 11 (end):** The build-up culminates in a dramatic arpeggiated flourish (a glissando-like effect indicated by the wavy line) leading to a large chord.\n\n4.  **Identification:** The combination of these elements—the calm, simple opening followed by an explosive, virtuosic section featuring an octave melody over rapid arpeggios, and the specific chromatic melody—is highly characteristic of one of the most famous pieces in video game music. The melody, harmony, and structure are unmistakably those of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the theme of the antagonist Sephiroth from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*. The arrangement is specifically from the *Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII* album.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel (from Final Fantasy VII)>>>"
