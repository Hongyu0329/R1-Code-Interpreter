    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺•) and Isotope Pattern**\n1.  **Identify the highest m/z cluster:** The peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio are in the range of m/z 258-268. The most significant peaks in this cluster are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%). This complex pattern suggests the presence of multiple halogen atoms.\n2.  **Apply the Nitrogen Rule:** The nominal molecular weight appears to be even (260 or 262), which suggests the molecule contains an even number of nitrogen atoms (including zero).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Base Peak and Key Fragments**\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum. From the graph and the table, the peak at **m/z 225** has a relative intensity (I) of 100%.\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak:** We must examine the peaks around the base peak to determine its elemental composition.\n    *   m/z 225: I = 100%\n    *   m/z 227: I = 66.7%\n    *   m/z 229: I = 22.2%\n    The ratio of the peak at m/z 227 to the peak at m/z 225 is 66.7 / 100 = 0.667. This is approximately 2/3.\n    The theoretical isotope abundance for chlorine is ³⁵Cl (75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (24.2%), a ratio of roughly 3:1.\n    *   A fragment with one Cl atom would show an M+2 peak with ~32.5% the intensity of the M peak.\n    *   A fragment with **two Cl atoms** would show an M+2 peak with an intensity of 2 * 32.5% = **65%** of the M peak.\n    The observed ratio of 66.7% is an excellent match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n    The peak at m/z 229 is the M+4 peak for this fragment. Its theoretical intensity for two Cl atoms is (0.325)² ≈ 10.6% of the M peak. The observed intensity (22.2%) is higher than expected, which could be due to overlapping fragments or other complex processes, but the M+2 peak is the most reliable indicator.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n1.  **Relate the Base Peak to the Molecular Ion:** The base peak at m/z 225 is very likely a fragment of the parent molecule. Let's calculate the mass difference between the proposed molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak.\n    *   Mass Loss = 260 - 225 = 35 amu.\n    This mass loss corresponds exactly to a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n2.  **Combine the Information:**\n    *   The base peak ([M-Cl]⁺) at m/z 225 contains two Cl atoms.\n    *   The molecule lost one Cl atom to form this base peak.\n    *   Therefore, the original molecule must have contained 2 + 1 = **3 chlorine atoms**.\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecule has a formula of R-Cl₃, where R is the organic backbone.\n    *   The fragment [R-Cl₂]⁺ has a mass of 225 (using ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The mass of the organic part R is 225 - 2 * 35 = 155 amu.\n    *   The most likely formula for a hydrocarbon radical with mass 155 is **C₁₂H₁₁** (12 * 12 + 11 * 1 = 144 + 11 = 155).\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight: The nominal mass for C₁₂H₁₁³⁵Cl₃ is 155 + 3*35 = 260. This matches the start of the highest mass cluster. The observed cluster at 260, 262, 264, 266 is consistent with the theoretical pattern for a C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ molecule (M, M+2, M+4, M+6).\n4.  **Propose a Structure:**\n    *   The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ has a degree of unsaturation of 12 - (11+3)/2 + 1 = 6. This high value suggests the presence of at least one aromatic ring (DBE=4).\n    *   The fragmentation shows that the loss of one Cl atom is highly favored (forming the base peak). This indicates that one Cl atom is in a chemically different, more labile position than the other two (e.g., an allylic or benzylic position).\n    *   A plausible structure that fits these criteria is an isomer of **phenyl-trichlorocyclohexene**. This structure contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅) and a trichlorocyclohexene ring (C₆H₆Cl₃), giving the correct formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and the correct DBE (phenyl ring=4, cyclohexene ring=1, cyclohexane ring=1, total=6).\n    *   A structure like **1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-1-ene** would have chlorine atoms on the double bond (vinylic) and an allylic chlorine at position 3. The loss of the allylic chlorine would be favored, forming a stable allylic cation, which explains why [M-Cl]⁺ is the base peak.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nBased on the analysis, the compound is an isomer of trichlorophenylcyclohexene. A specific and plausible structure is 1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-1-ene. We will provide this as the systematic name.\n\nFinal IUPAC Name: **1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-1-ene**\n\n<<<1,2,3-trichloro-4-phenylcyclohex-1-ene>>>"
