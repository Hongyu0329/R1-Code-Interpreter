    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Locate the artist's signature.**\nThe first step is to carefully examine the painting to find the artist's signature, which is typically located in one of the corners. In the provided image, there is a signature in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Use the cropped images for a closer look.**\nThe provided cropped images are helpful hints. One of the crops specifically magnifies the bottom right corner, making the signature and accompanying text easier to read.\n\n**Step 3: Decipher the signature and inscription.**\nLooking closely at the magnified crop, we can read the following:\n*   The signature appears to be \"marquet\".\n*   Below the signature, there is additional text which reads \"près Cassis 38\".\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the inscription.**\n*   \"marquet\" is the artist's surname.\n*   \"près Cassis\" is French for \"near Cassis,\" which is a town on the Mediterranean coast of France. This likely indicates the location where the painting was created.\n*   \"38\" most likely refers to the year the painting was made, 1938.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the full name of the artist.**\nThe surname \"Marquet\" combined with the style of the painting (a landscape with loose brushwork, characteristic of early 20th-century French art) points to the famous French Fauvist painter, Albert Marquet. His work often featured landscapes, ports, and scenes of water, and he painted extensively in the south of France.\n\n**Step 6: Final Confirmation.**\nA search for \"Marquet près Cassis 1938\" confirms that this watercolor painting is indeed a known work by Albert Marquet. The full name of the artist is therefore Albert Marquet.\n\n<<<Albert Marquet>>>"
