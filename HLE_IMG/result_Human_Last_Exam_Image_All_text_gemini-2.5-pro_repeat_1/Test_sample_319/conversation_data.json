    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image consists of two plots representing a sound signal over time.\n    *   The top plot is a **spectrogram**, which shows frequency on the y-axis, time on the x-axis, and the intensity of the sound as color. It clearly shows a single-frequency tone (the horizontal line) that is interrupted. During the interruption, there is a burst of sound across a wide range of frequencies (the vertical bar), which represents noise. After the noise, the single-frequency tone resumes.\n    *   The bottom plot is a **waveform**, which shows the amplitude of the sound signal over time. It visually confirms the structure seen in the spectrogram: a regular, periodic wave (the tone), followed by a chaotic, high-amplitude section (the noise), and then the tone again.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** Physically, the tone is not present during the noise burst. There is a gap.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"illusion\"**: This tells us that what is perceived is different from the physical reality shown in the plots.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: The Necker Cube is an optical illusion where the brain resolves an ambiguous 2D drawing into one of two possible 3D interpretations. This suggests the auditory phenomenon in question involves the brain making an interpretation or \"filling in\" information to create a coherent perception, rather than just passively receiving the raw sensory data. The brain chooses a more plausible interpretation (a continuous sound being briefly masked) over a less likely one (a sound stopping exactly as another one starts, and then restarting exactly as the other one stops).\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This points to a fundamental cognitive process, not just a laboratory curiosity. It's something our brain does automatically in everyday life. This ability is essential for understanding sounds, particularly speech, in noisy environments where parts of the signal might be momentarily obscured.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The stimulus is a tone interrupted by noise.\n    *   The listener, however, does not perceive the interruption. They perceive the tone as continuing *behind* the noise.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" of the missing auditory information is the illusion.\n    *   This perceptual completion is a vital, automatic brain function that helps maintain the continuity of our auditory world.\n    *   The most famous example of this phenomenon involves speech. When a phoneme (a basic sound unit of speech) in a word is replaced by a noise like a cough, listeners not only perceive the word as intact but are often unable to identify where the cough even occurred.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name:**\n    *   The general principle is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n    *   The specific and most well-known application of this principle to speech sounds is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Given that diagrams like the one shown are standard illustrations for this effect in psychology and neuroscience, and the description points to its importance in everyday perception (like understanding speech), the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the precise and intended name for this well-documented phenomenon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe image and description point to a perceptual illusion where the brain fills in missing auditory information that has been replaced by noise. This allows for the perception of a continuous sound. While the general term is the auditory continuity illusion, the most famous and specific example, which highlights its importance as a common perceptual ability for understanding language, is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
