    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components:** The question asks to compare the **sporophytes** of two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of three main parts: the foot (embedded in the gametophyte), the **seta** (the stalk), and the **capsule** (which contains the spores). The goal is to find a difference that is easily visible \"at a glance.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Name *Grimmia curviseta***: The specific epithet *curviseta* provides a major clue. In Latin, \"curvus\" means curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. Thus, the name itself suggests that *Grimmia curviseta* has a **curved seta**.\n\n3.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***: Botanical descriptions of *Grimmia montana* consistently note that its sporophyte has a **short and straight seta**. This results in the capsule being **immersed** or **emergent**, meaning it sits nestled within or just slightly above the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the base of the sporophyte). The image provided, showing capsules nestled among the leafy stems, is characteristic of a moss with immersed capsules, like *G. montana*.\n\n4.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***: As its name implies, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a **distinctly curved or arcuate seta**. This curved seta is also typically longer than that of *G. montana*, causing the capsule to be **exserted** (held well above the leaves) and to hang or nod to one side.\n\n5.  **Compare the Two Species:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***:\n        *   **Seta:** Short and **straight**.\n        *   **Capsule Position:** Immersed or emergent (sits upright within the leaves).\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***:\n        *   **Seta:** Longer and **curved (arcuate)**.\n        *   **Capsule Position:** Exserted and often nodding or cernuous (hangs to the side).\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Main Difference:** The most striking and easily observable difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **shape and length of the seta**, which in turn dictates the position and orientation of the capsule. One has a straight seta with an immersed capsule, while the other has a curved seta with an exserted, nodding capsule. This is the primary feature used to distinguish them visually when sporophytes are present.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Taxonomic Note:** The classification of some *Grimmia* species can be complex, and names may vary in different botanical floras. However, the features associated with these specific names remain consistent.\n*   **Observation Conditions:** This difference is only visible when the mosses have produced sporophytes.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This implies a macroscopic feature that doesn't require a microscope. The seta's shape and the resulting capsule position fit this description perfectly. The image provided shows immersed capsules on what must be very short, straight setae, a feature consistent with *Grimmia montana*.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (the stalk supporting the capsule)**.\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is **short and straight**, which causes the capsule to be **immersed** (nestled down among the leaves) or emergent (sitting just at the top of the leaves).\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is **distinctly curved (arcuate)** and longer, which causes the capsule to be **exserted** (held out beyond the leaves) and to nod or hang to one side.\n\nTherefore, the straight vs. curved seta and the resulting immersed vs. exserted capsule position is the key distinguishing feature."
