The main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (the stalk supporting the capsule)**.

*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is **short and straight**, which causes the capsule to be **immersed** (nestled down among the leaves) or emergent (sitting just at the top of the leaves).
*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is **distinctly curved (arcuate)** and longer, which causes the capsule to be **exserted** (held out beyond the leaves) and to nod or hang to one side.

Therefore, the straight vs. curved seta and the resulting immersed vs. exserted capsule position is the key distinguishing feature.
