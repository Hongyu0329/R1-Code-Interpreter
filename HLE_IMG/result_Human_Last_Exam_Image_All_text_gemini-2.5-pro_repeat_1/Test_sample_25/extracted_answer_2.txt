The result should be interpreted as negative. Although the curve crosses the threshold before the 40-cycle cut-off, the shape of the curve is not sigmoidal and lacks a distinct exponential phase. This indicates the signal is likely an artifact from non-specific amplification or background drift, not a true positive result.
