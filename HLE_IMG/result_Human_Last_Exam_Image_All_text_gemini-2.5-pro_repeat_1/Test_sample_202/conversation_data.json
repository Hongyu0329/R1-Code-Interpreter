    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n1.  **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous texture with many visible holes (vesicles).\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates it is an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed from lava that cooled quickly on the Earth's surface, trapping gas bubbles. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron in mafic (iron-rich) lava.\n3.  **Identification:** A highly vesicular, typically mafic, extrusive igneous rock is called **scoria**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous angular fragments (clasts) of different sizes and colors, all cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix.\n2.  **Interpretation:** This texture is known as pyroclastic. It forms from the consolidation of material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption, such as volcanic ash, lapilli, and bombs. A rock composed of angular volcanic fragments is a breccia.\n3.  **Identification:** This specimen is a **volcanic breccia** or **tuff**. Tuff refers to the rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash, and breccia refers to the angular clasts.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n1.  **Observation:** The specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and extremely vesicular, giving it a frothy or spongy appearance.\n2.  **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is an extrusive igneous rock that cooled rapidly. However, its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. The extreme vesiculation makes it very low in density.\n3.  **Identification:** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is identified as **pumice**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals are mostly light in color (white, pinkish, or gray) with some smaller dark minerals mixed in.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The large crystal size (coarse-grained or phaneritic texture) indicates that the rock is intrusive, meaning it formed from magma that cooled very slowly deep within the Earth's crust. The light-colored minerals are likely quartz and feldspar, characteristic of a felsic composition.\n3.  **Identification:** An exceptionally coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock is called a **pegmatite**. This one has a granitic composition.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
