    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction in a cubic system is a vector pointing from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a, a, 0), where 'a' is the lattice constant. This vector lies along the face diagonal of the bottom face of the cubic unit cell. When we view the crystal along this direction, we are looking at the projection of the atoms onto a plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Atomic Pattern of the [110] Projection**\nTo visualize the projection, we can consider the stacking of atomic planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These are the (110) planes.\n1.  In an FCC lattice, the (110) planes stack in a repeating ABAB... sequence.\n2.  The atoms within a single (110) plane (let's call it plane A) form a rectangular array. The rectangle's sides are parallel to the [001] and [1-10] directions, with side lengths of `a` and `a√2`, respectively.\n3.  The atoms of the next plane (plane B) are not directly on top of the atoms of plane A. Instead, they are located precisely in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of plane A.\n4.  When we project these two planes (A and B) on top of each other, the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means there are atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the exact center of that rectangle. The aspect ratio of this rectangle's sides is `a√2 / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Image for the Centered Rectangle Pattern**\nNow, let's examine the four given images to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. The images are perspective drawings, so we should focus on the topological arrangement (how atoms are connected) rather than precise geometric measurements which might be distorted.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple or primitive rectangular lattice. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but no atoms in the centers. This pattern is incorrect for an FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image displays a more complex pattern. It can be described as two interpenetrating primitive rectangular lattices that are offset from each other. If you trace the atoms, they form zigzag chains. This pattern is characteristic of the diamond or zincblende (ZnS) crystal structure viewed along the [110] direction, not a simple FCC lattice.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern also appears to be based on a rectangular grid. However, like D, it lacks atoms in the center of the main rectangular cells. For example, considering a rectangle with corners at (3,7), (9,7), (3,14), and (9,14), there is no atom at the center position (6, 10.5). The pattern is more complex than a simple centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image, despite the perspective view, is the only one that shows the correct topological feature of a centered lattice. Let's identify a cell. Pick the atom at approximately (4, 6). It is surrounded by four other atoms at approximately (4, 3), (4, 9), (1.5, 5.5), and (6.5, 6.5). These four atoms form a parallelogram (which is the perspective view of a rectangle), and the atom at (4, 6) is located at its center. This \"centered parallelogram\" topology is precisely what a \"centered rectangle\" looks like under a perspective projection. This repeating pattern of a central atom within a cell formed by other atoms is the key identifier.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, Image B is the only one that exhibits the characteristic centered rectangular pattern of an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
