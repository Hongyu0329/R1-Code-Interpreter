    "This coat of arms is extremely similar to the one belonging to the Bakhmut Raion (a district) in Ukraine. The shield is divided horizontally into blue and gold, with a crescent moon on the blue field and a black crab on the gold field, which is a direct match. The administrative center and largest city of this district is Bakhmut. Therefore, the city in question is Bakhmut.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the name of this city.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the city whose\n    district's coat of arms closely matches the provided image.\n\n    The key features of the coat of arms are:\n    - Shield: Divided horizontally (per fess).\n    - Top half (chief): Blue (azure) with a gold crescent moon.\n    - Bottom half: Gold (or) with a black crab (sable).\n    - These elements correspond to the coat of arms of the Bakhmut Raion in Ukraine.\n    - The city that serves as the administrative center for this raion is Bakhmut.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Bakhmut\"\n    print(f\"The city with a coat of arms very similar to the one in the image is: {city_name}\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Bakhmut>>>"
