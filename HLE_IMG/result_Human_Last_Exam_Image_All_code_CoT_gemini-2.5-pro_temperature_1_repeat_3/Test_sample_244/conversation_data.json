    "Based on the visual evidence provided in the image, I will identify the genus of the epiphytic species.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the key features of the organism growing on the tree bark. It forms a dense, dark, web-like mat.\n2.  Observe the structure of the organism. It consists of very fine, flat, branching strands. The branching pattern appears to be dichotomous (splitting into two equal forks).\n3.  These characteristics—being an epiphyte with a flat, thalloid, dichotomously branching structure that forms intricate mats—are highly indicative of a specific type of liverwort.\n4.  Compare these features to known genera of epiphytic liverworts. The appearance strongly matches the genus *Metzgeria*, commonly known as veilworts.\n5.  I will write a Python script that stores this identified genus in a variable and then prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_epiphyte_genus(image_features):\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the genus of an epiphyte based on its visual characteristics.\n\n  Args:\n    image_features: A dictionary describing the visual traits of the epiphyte.\n\n  Returns:\n    A string with the identified genus and a descriptive sentence.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The organism exhibits a dark, web-like growth pattern on tree bark.\n  # The structure is thalloid (not differentiated into true stems and leaves)\n  # and branches dichotomously (forks repeatedly).\n  # These are classic features of the liverwort genus Metzgeria.\n  if (image_features[\"growth_habit\"] == \"epiphytic_mat\" and\n      image_features[\"structure\"] == \"thalloid\" and\n      image_features[\"branching\"] == \"dichotomous\"):\n    \n    genus = \"Metzgeria\"\n    return f\"The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus {genus}.\"\n  else:\n    return \"Genus could not be identified with the given features.\"\n\n# Define the features observed in the provided image\nobserved_features = {\n    \"growth_habit\": \"epiphytic_mat\",\n    \"structure\": \"thalloid\",\n    \"branching\": \"dichotomous\"\n}\n\n# Run the identification and print the result\nidentification_result = identify_epiphyte_genus(observed_features)\nprint(identification_result)\n\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
