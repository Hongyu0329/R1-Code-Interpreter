    "This is a case of a sellar mass, and the provided histopathology image is stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights fungal elements in a bright magenta/purple color against a lighter background, with cell nuclei stained blue/purple by hematoxylin.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n1.  **Fungal Morphology:** The image clearly shows broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae. These hyphae are largely non-septate or pauciseptate (having few septa).\n2.  **Branching Pattern:** Where branching is visible (especially in the main image and some crops), the hyphae branch at wide, often right (90-degree) angles.\n3.  **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** There is a dense inflammatory background composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, indicating an active infection. There also appears to be necrosis.\n\n**Clinicopathological Correlation:**\nThe combination of these histopathological features—broad, pauciseptate or aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching—is characteristic of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. The resulting infection is called mucormycosis.\n\nA mass in the sella turcica due to infection is often an extension from the sphenoid sinus. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an aggressive and often fatal fungal infection that can present this way, particularly in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., those with diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancies, or on immunosuppressive therapy).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the classic morphological features seen in the histopathology slides, the diagnosis is mucormycosis.\n\nI will not provide a code block as it is not relevant to a medical diagnosis question.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    28 year old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica.
