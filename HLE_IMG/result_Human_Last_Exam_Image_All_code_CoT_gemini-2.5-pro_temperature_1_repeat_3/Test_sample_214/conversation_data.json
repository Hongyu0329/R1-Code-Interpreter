    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the poetic form of a sequence of erasure poems.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        1.  The sequence is composed of four-line stanzas.\n        2.  An image represents the third line of one of these stanzas. The text in the image includes \"ghostly\", \"velum\", \"forms like a dance\".\n        3.  The final poem in the sequence contains the line \"nacreous wavers\".\n    *   **Task:** Use coding skills to present the solution. The code should explain the reasoning and print the final answer. The final printed output must include the numbers of any equations used.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: The Line from the Image.** The words \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\" are presented as the third line. I'll count the syllables to find a pattern.\n        *   `ghost-ly` (2) + `ve-lum` (2) + `forms` (1) + `like` (1) + `a` (1) + `dance` (1) = 8 syllables.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Line from the Final Poem.** The line is \"nacreous wavers\". I'll count these syllables.\n        *   `na-cre-ous` (3) + `wa-vers` (2) = 5 syllables.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Stanza Structure.** The prompt specifies a \"four-line stanza\".\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Search for a Matching Poetic Form:**\n    *   I am looking for a four-line poetic form that has lines with 5 and 8 syllables.\n    *   There is no common, well-known four-line poetic form (quatrain) with a fixed syllable structure of this nature. This suggests one of the clues might be slightly misleading or requires interpretation.\n    *   Let's reconsider the clues, focusing on the syllable counts (5 and 8), which are very specific.\n    *   A 5-syllable line is a hallmark of Japanese poetry, specifically Haiku (5-7-5) and **Tanka** (5-7-5-7-7).\n    *   A Haiku has three lines, which contradicts the \"four-line stanza\" clue.\n    *   A **Tanka** has five lines. This also contradicts the \"four-line stanza\" clue. However, let's see if the syllables fit.\n        *   The Tanka structure is 5-7-5-7-7.\n        *   The line \"nacreous wavers\" has **5 syllables**, which perfectly matches the first or third line of a Tanka.\n        *   The line \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\" has **8 syllables**. In poetry, it's very common for a line to have one extra syllable than the strict metrical form requires. An 8-syllable line is a very plausible variation of a 7-syllable line. This could fit the second, fourth, or fifth line of a Tanka.\n\n4.  **Formulating a Conclusion:**\n    *   The syllable evidence (a 5-syllable line and an 8-syllable line) points very strongly toward the **Tanka** form.\n    *   The primary contradiction is that a Tanka has five lines, whereas the prompt states it's a four-line stanza. Given that erasure poetry is an experimental form, and that the syllabic evidence is so strong, it is most likely that either the prompt is slightly inaccurate about the line count or the artist presents the five-line Tanka in a visually distinct way (e.g., as a quatrain plus a final line).\n    *   Between the conflicting pieces of information, the syllable counts are the hardest, most specific evidence. The Tanka is the only well-known form that fits them this well.\n\n5.  **Constructing the Python Code:**\n    *   The Python script will not perform complex calculations but will serve as a vehicle to explain the logic clearly.\n    *   It will define the syllable structure of a Tanka.\n    *   It will analyze the provided lines and show how their syllable counts fit the Tanka form.\n    *   It will address the \"four-line stanza\" contradiction and explain why Tanka is still the most logical answer.\n    *   It will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final conclusion.\n    *   Crucially, it will print the equation for the Tanka syllable structure, showing each number, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poetry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes clues about an erasure poem to determine its poetic form.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the syllable structure of a Tanka\n    tanka_line_1_syllables = 5\n    tanka_line_2_syllables = 7\n    tanka_line_3_syllables = 5\n    tanka_line_4_syllables = 7\n    tanka_line_5_syllables = 7\n    total_syllables = tanka_line_1_syllables + tanka_line_2_syllables + tanka_line_3_syllables + tanka_line_4_syllables + tanka_line_5_syllables\n\n    # Given clues from the prompt\n    line_from_image = \"'ghostly velum forms like a dance'\"\n    line_from_final_poem = \"'nacreous wavers'\"\n\n    # Syllable counts of the given lines\n    syllables_line_image = 8  # ghost-ly(2) + ve-lum(2) + forms(1) + like(1) + a(1) + dance(1)\n    syllables_line_final = 5  # na-cre-ous(3) + wa-vers(2)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the poetic form by analyzing syllable counts.\")\n    print(\"The most likely poetic form is the Tanka.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Define the structure of a Tanka.\")\n    print(\"A Tanka is a five-line Japanese poem.
