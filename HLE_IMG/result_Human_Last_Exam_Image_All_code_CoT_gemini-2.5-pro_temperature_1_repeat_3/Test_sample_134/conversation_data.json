    "This image displays a complex, belt-shaped molecule with a distinct twist, characteristic of a Möbius topology. It is composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, forming a macrocycle that includes aromatic rings (phenylene units), alkyne linkers (-C≡C-), and alkene linkers (-CH=CH-).\n\nThis specific structure was synthesized and reported in 2022 by a research group led by Kenji Itami. It is the first example of a carbon nanobelt with a Möbius twist. The common and accepted name for this molecule, as designated by its creators, reflects its unique shape and composition.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print the name of this molecule.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the molecule shown in the image.\n# The molecule is a large, twisted macrocycle composed of aromatic rings,\n# alkynes, and alkenes. It is known as a Möbius carbon nanobelt.\n\nmolecule_name = \"Möbius carbon nanobelt\"\nprint(molecule_name)\n```\n<<<Möbius carbon nanobelt>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name the molecule.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
