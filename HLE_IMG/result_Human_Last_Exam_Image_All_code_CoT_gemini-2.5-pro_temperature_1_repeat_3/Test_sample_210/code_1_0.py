    This function identifies the correct image.
    Based on visual analysis, the key features for identification are:
    1. Horn shape: Long, lyre-shaped with light tips.
    2. Spot pattern: A distinct cluster of spots on the rear flank and a single spot behind the shoulder.

    - Target: Has these specific features.
    - A: Incorrect horn size (too small).
    - B: Matches the horn shape and the unique spot patterns on the flank and shoulder.
    - C: Different coloration and stripe pattern.
    - D: Different spot pattern on the flank.
    - E: Different horn shape and spot pattern.
    - F: Partially obscured, but doesn't show a clear match.

    Therefore, image B shows the same nyala.
