    "To solve this, I will first identify each mineral specimen based on its visual characteristics. Then, I will determine the silicate structure for each mineral. Silicate structures are classified based on the degree of polymerization of the silica (SiOâ‚„) tetrahedra, which means how many oxygen atoms are shared between tetrahedra. The complexity increases from isolated tetrahedra to a full 3D framework.\n\n1.  **Identify Specimens:**\n    *   **A:** A dark, elongated prismatic crystal with a somewhat triangular cross-section. This is characteristic of **Tourmaline**.\n    *   **B:** A thin, flaky mineral that peels into sheets, showing perfect basal cleavage. This is a **Mica** group mineral.\n    *   **C:** A granular mass of olive-green crystals. This is characteristic of **Olivine**.\n    *   **D:** A translucent, glassy, six-sided crystal. This is a classic example of **Quartz**.\n\n2.  **Determine Silicate Structure and Complexity:**\n    The complexity of silicate minerals increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms in the silica tetrahedra.\n    *   **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** No shared oxygens. Example: **Olivine (C)**. This is the simplest structure.\n    *   **Cyclosilicates (Ring Silicates):** Two shared oxygens per tetrahedron, forming rings. Example: **Tourmaline (A)**.\n    *   **Phyllosilicates (Sheet Silicates):** Three shared oxygens per tetrahedron, forming sheets. Example: **Mica (B)**.\n    *   **Tectosilicates (Framework Silicates):** All four oxygens are shared, forming a 3D framework. Example: **Quartz (D)**. This is the most complex structure.\n\n3.  **Order by Increasing Complexity:**\n    Based on the classification above, the order from least complex to most complex is:\n    Olivine (Nesosilicate) -> Tourmaline (Cyclosilicate) -> Mica (Phyllosilicate) -> Quartz (Tectosilicate).\n    This corresponds to the specimen order: **C -> A -> B -> D**.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this identification and ordering process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the specimens with their identified mineral type and silicate structure.\n    # We assign a complexity score where a lower number is less complex.\n    # Nesosilicate (1) < Cyclosilicate (2) < Phyllosilicate (3) < Tectosilicate (4)\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Tourmaline', 'structure': 'Cyclosilicate', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the specimens based on their complexity score.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 3: Print the identification for each specimen.\n    print(\"Specimen Identification:\")\n    # Create a copy sorted by label for clear printing\n    specimens_by_label = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['label'])\n    for spec in specimens_by_label:\n        print(f\"Specimen {spec['label']}: {spec['mineral']} ({spec['structure']})\")\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final ordered list.\n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    \n    # Extract the labels from the sorted list\n    ordered_labels = [spec['label'] for spec in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    # Build the final equation string showing the order\n    final_order_string = \" -> \".join(ordered_labels)\n    \n    print(f\"{sorted_specimens[0]['label']} ({sorted_specimens[0]['structure']}) -> {sorted_specimens[1]['label']} ({sorted_specimens[1]['structure']}) -> {sorted_specimens[2]['label']} ({sorted_specimens[2]['structure']}) -> {sorted_specimens[3]['label']} ({sorted_specimens[3]['structure']})\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe final order is: {final_order_string}\")\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C -> A -> B -> D>>>"
