    """
    This function provides the solution to the cellular automata visualization puzzle.

    The solution was determined through a step-by-step logical deduction process:
    1.  **Pattern Size Analysis**: Each image (A-P) was categorized based on the size of its non-white pattern's bounding box. This provided a rough mapping of images to possible time steps, as patterns generally grow over time.
        - 3x3: G
        - 5x5: C
        - 7x7: D, F, J, K, L
        - 9x9: A, E, H, I, N, O
        - 11x11: M
        - 13x13: B, P

    2.  **Identifying Strong Visual Chains**: I searched for visually plausible sequences of evolution. Certain groups of images showed clear thematic and structural progression.
        - The most compelling chain was `F -> H -> M -> P`. This shows a pattern of bars (`F`) connecting to form a square (`H`), which then develops a complex boundary (`M`), and finally expands (`P`). The size progression (7x7 -> 9x9 -> 11x11 -> 13x13) perfectly matches the time steps `t=3,4,5,6` for Rule 2.
        - Another strong chain was `C -> J -> E -> B`. `C` is the only 5x5 image, making it the unique candidate for the `t=2` state of Rule 1. Its pattern evolves plausibly into the L-shapes of `J`, which then replicate in a fractal-like manner to form `E`. `E`'s complex grid then densifies into the hook patterns of `B`. The size progression (5x5 -> 7x7 -> 9x9 -> 13x13) fits `t=2,3,4,5` for Rule 1.

    3.  **Deduction of Remaining Sequences**: With two rules solved, the remaining eight images {A, D, G, I, K, L, N, O} had to form the sequences for Rule 3 and Rule 4.
        - By looking for plausible, size-ordered chains within this remaining set, two groups were identified.
        - The chain `G -> L -> A -> I` shows a cross-like pattern (`G`, `L`) that evolves into more complex symmetric patterns (`A`, `I`). Its size progression (3x3, 7x7, 9x9, 9x9) fits the non-decreasing size requirement for Rule 3 (`t=4,5,6,7`).
        - The final four images {D, K, N, O} form the last sequence. The order `DKNO` shows a plausible evolution and has a non-decreasing size progression (7x7, 7x7, 9x9, 9x9) that fits Rule 4 (`t=5,6,7,8`).

    4.  **Final Answer Assembly**: The four identified sequences were assembled into the required format.
