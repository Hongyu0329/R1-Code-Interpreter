    "This image displays the prime knot known as $9_{42}$ in Alexander-Briggs notation. To find its Jones polynomial, we can consult established mathematical resources for knot theory.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I have identified the knot shown in the image as the $9_{42}$ knot, which is an alternating knot with 9 crossings.\n2.  I will use the known Jones polynomial for the $9_{42}$ knot. The standard form of this polynomial is $V(t) = t^4 - t^3 + 2t^2 - 2t + 3 - 2t^{-1} + 2t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^4$.\n3.  I will write a Python script that takes the coefficients and powers of this polynomial and formats them into a single string, as requested. The terms will be arranged in decreasing order of their power. The script will handle the signs, coefficients, and powers to produce a standard mathematical representation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_jones_polynomial_for_9_42():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot.\n    The polynomial is pre-determined from knot theory databases.\n    The function formats it as a string in decreasing degree order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is:\n    # t^4 - t^3 + 2t^2 - 2t + 3 - 2t^-1 + 2t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4\n    # We represent this as a list of (coefficient, power) tuples.\n    # The list is already in decreasing order of power.\n    poly_terms = [\n        (1, 4),\n        (-1, 3),\n        (2, 2),\n        (-2, 1),\n        (3, 0),\n        (-2, -1),\n        (2, -2),\n        (-1, -3),\n        (1, -4),\n    ]\n\n    poly_parts = []\n    is_first_term = True\n\n    for coeff, power in poly_terms:\n        # Build the string for the current term\n        term_str = \"\"\n\n        # Handle the sign\n        if is_first_term:\n            if coeff < 0:\n                term_str += \"-\"\n        else:\n            if coeff < 0:\n                term_str += \" - \"\n            else:\n                term_str += \" + \"\n        \n        # Handle the coefficient\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        if power == 0:\n            term_str += str(abs_coeff)\n        elif abs_coeff != 1:\n            term_str += str(abs_coeff)\n\n        # Handle the variable 't' and its power\n        if power != 0:\n            if power == 1:\n                term_str += \"t\"\n            else:\n                term_str += f\"t^{power}\"\n\n        poly_parts.append(term_str)\n        is_first_term = False\n\n    final_polynomial = \"\".join(poly_parts)\n    print(final_polynomial)\n\nget_jones_polynomial_for_9_42()\n```\n<<<t^4 - t^3 + 2t^2 - 2t + 3 - 2t^-1 + 2t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
