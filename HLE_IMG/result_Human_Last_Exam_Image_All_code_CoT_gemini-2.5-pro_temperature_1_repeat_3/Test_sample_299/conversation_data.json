    "This is a mate-in-2 chess puzzle. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:**\n    *   White's pieces: Queen on a4, Knight on b7, Knight on e7, Pawn on b4, Rook on f3, Rook on h5, King on h4, Bishop on g2, Bishop on g1.\n    *   Black's pieces: Rook on c6, Queen on d5, Pawn on e5, Pawn on f4, King on e4.\n    *   It is White's turn to move.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Black King's safety:**\n    *   The Black King on e4 is very exposed. I'll check its escape squares.\n    *   `d3` is attacked by the White Bishop on g1.\n    *   `d4` is attacked by the White Queen on a4.\n    *   `e3` is attacked by the White Rook on f3.\n    *   `f5` is attacked by the White Knight on e7.\n    *   The other adjacent squares (`d5`, `e5`, `f4`, `f3`) are occupied.\n    *   Conclusion: The Black King is currently completely trapped and has no legal moves.\n\n3.  **Find the first move for White:**\n    *   Since the king is already trapped, White needs to deliver a check that cannot be legally stopped in one move. A forcing move is required.\n    *   Let's try the knight sacrifice: **1. Nd6+**.\n    *   This puts the Black King in check. As established, the king cannot move. The check is from a knight, so it cannot be blocked.\n    *   Black's only legal option is to capture the checking knight on d6. There are two pieces that can do this: the Queen on d5 (`Qxd6`) or the Rook on c6 (`Rxd6`). Black is forced into one of these two replies.\n\n4.  **Analyze Black's forced replies and find the mating move:**\n\n    *   **Case A: If Black plays 1... Qxd6**\n        *   The Black Queen is now on d6. It's White's turn.\n        *   White needs to deliver a final, unanswerable check.\n        *   White plays **2. Nf5#**. The Knight from e7 moves to f5.\n        *   This creates a **double check**: one from the Knight on f5, and a *discovered* check from the Rook on h5 (whose attack on e4 was previously blocked by the knight on e7).\n        *   A double check can only be answered by moving the king. However, the king's escape squares remain covered: d3 (by Bg1), d4 (by Qa4), e3 (by Rf3), and f5 is now occupied by the checking knight.\n        *   This is checkmate.\n\n    *   **Case B: If Black plays 1... Rxd6**\n        *   The situation is very similar. The Black Rook is now on d6.\n        *   White again plays **2. Nf5#**.\n        *   It is the exact same double check from the Knight on f5 and the Rook on h5. The king's escape squares are all controlled.\n        *   This is also checkmate.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The solution is to sacrifice the knight on d6, forcing a reply that allows a decisive double check on the next move.\n\n```python\ndef find_mate_in_two():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the 2-move checkmate solution for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the moves in algebraic notation\n    white_move_1 = \"1. Nd6+\"\n    black_reply_q = \"Qxd6\"\n    black_reply_r = \"Rxd6\"\n    white_move_2 = \"2. Nf5#\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the solution\n    print(\"The checkmate in 2 moves is found through a knight sacrifice followed by a double check.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"White's first move is a check: {white_move_1}\")\n    print(\"The Black King has no escape squares and cannot block, so Black is forced to capture the knight.\")\n    print(\"\\nIf Black plays 1. ... \" + black_reply_q + \", the final sequence is:\")\n    print(f\"1. Nd6+ {black_reply_q} 2. {white_move_2[3:]}\")\n    print(\"\\nIf Black plays 1. ... \" + black_reply_r + \", the final sequence is:\")\n    print(f\"1. Nd6+ {black_reply_r} 2. {white_move_2[3:]}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn both cases, White's second move, Nf5, is a double check from the Knight and the Rook on h5, which is checkmate.\")\n\nfind_mate_in_two()\n<<<1.
