    "Here is my plan to solve this entomological puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (*Coelioxys* cuckoo bees):** I will identify the sexes based on the shape of the abdomen. Female *Coelioxys* have a sharply pointed, conical abdomen for laying eggs in host nests, while males have a blunter abdomen, often with multiple spines at the tip.\n    *   The bee on the left has a distinctly pointed abdomen, characteristic of a female.\n    *   The bee on the right has a blunter abdomen with terminal spines (though not perfectly clear, the overall shape is not the female's sharp point), which is characteristic of a male.\n    *   Conclusion for A: Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (*Polistes* paper wasps):** I will determine the sexes primarily by observing the antennae. Male paper wasps have antennae with distinctly curled tips, whereas females have straight antennae.\n    *   The wasp on the left has straight antennae. This is a female.\n    *   The wasp on the right has clearly curled tips on its antennae. This is a male.\n    *   Conclusion for B: Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index **4**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned bees, likely *Melissodes* or similar):** The most prominent feature for sexing these bees is the length of the antennae. Males, known as \"long-horned bees,\" have remarkably long antennae, while females have much shorter antennae.\n    *   The bee on the left has very long antennae that curve back over its body. This is a male.\n    *   The bee on the right has short, standard-length antennae. This is a female.\n    *   Conclusion for C: Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:** I will combine the indices for A, B, and C into a single, comma-separated string as requested. The resulting sequence of indices is 4, 4, 3. I will then write a Python script to print this final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the insect sexing puzzle based on entomological analysis.\n    The analysis is as follows:\n    - Pair A (Coelioxys bees): Left is Female (pointed abdomen), Right is Male (blunt, spined abdomen). This is option 4 (F, M).\n    - Pair B (Polistes wasps): Left is Female (straight antennae), Right is Male (curled antennae). This is option 4 (F, M).\n    - Pair C (Long-horned bees): Left is Male (very long antennae), Right is Female (short antennae). This is option 3 (M, F).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices corresponding to the options: 1) M,M  2) F,F  3) M,F  4) F,M\n    index_A = 4\n    index_B = 4\n    index_C = 3\n    \n    # Print the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
