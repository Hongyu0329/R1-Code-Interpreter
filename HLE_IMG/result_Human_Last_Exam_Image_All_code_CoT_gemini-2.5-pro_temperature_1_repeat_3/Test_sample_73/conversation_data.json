    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), for each of the four stereocenters shown in the reaction scheme, moving from left to right. This involves analyzing the two reactants and then the two chiral centers in the product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reactant (acid chloride):** Identify the chiral center and the four groups attached to it. Assign priorities to these groups using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. Determine the configuration ((R) or (S)) based on the 3D arrangement of these groups.\n2.  **Analyze the second reactant (alcohol):** Repeat the process for the chiral center in the alcohol molecule.\n3.  **Analyze the reaction:** The reaction is an esterification. In this type of nucleophilic acyl substitution, the stereochemistry at the chiral centers of both the acyl component and the alcohol component is retained.\n4.  **Determine the product's stereochemistry:** Based on the principle of retention of configuration, assign the (R)/(S) configuration to the two stereocenters in the product molecule. The product is drawn with the alcohol part on the left and the acid chloride part on the right.\n5.  **Compile the final sequence:** Combine the four assignments in order from left to right as they appear in the reaction scheme.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through these steps and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignments for the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Part 1: Analysis of the Acid Chloride (Reactant 1) ---\n    print(\"1.
