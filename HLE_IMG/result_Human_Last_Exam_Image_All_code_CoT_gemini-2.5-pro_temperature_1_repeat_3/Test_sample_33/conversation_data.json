    "This is a complex ECG that requires a systematic approach. Here is the step-by-step analysis that leads to the diagnosis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** Determine if the R-R interval is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Analyze the Rate:** Calculate the ventricular rate.\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complex:** Measure the duration (narrow or wide) and assess the morphology (is it consistent or variable?).\n4.  **Analyze Atrial Activity:** Look for P waves or other signs of atrial activity (like a chaotic baseline).\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Combine the above features to differentiate between the given answer choices.\n\nThis plan will be executed using a Python script to simulate the diagnostic process.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script simulates the step-by-step analysis of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1-4: Define the key features observed in the ECG image.\n    # The ECG shows a tachycardia with an estimated average rate of around 180 bpm.\n    # The R-R intervals are clearly not constant, so the rhythm is irregularly irregular.\n    # The QRS complexes are wider than 3 small squares (>0.12s).\n    # The shape of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat.\n    # There are no discernible P waves; instead, the baseline is chaotic.\n    \n    rate_bpm = 180\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    qrs_duration_threshold_s = 0.12\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable and Wide\"\n    atrial_activity = \"Absent P waves with a chaotic baseline\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Breakdown:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"1.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
