    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the knot:** I will first identify the specific knot shown in the diagram by analyzing its crossings and structure. This knot is known in knot theory as the **6₂ knot**.\n2.  **Use properties of alternating knots:** The provided diagram is an \"alternating diagram,\" meaning that as you travel along the knot, the crossings alternate between over and under. For alternating knots, there is a fundamental theorem that simplifies the calculation of the Rasmussen invariant.\n3.  **Apply the theorem:** The theorem states that for an alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant, s(K), is equal to its signature, σ(K).\n4.  **Find the signature:** The signature of the 6₂ knot is a well-known value in knot theory tables. It is -2.\n5.  **State the result:** Using the equality s(K) = σ(K), I can conclude that the Rasmussen invariant of the 6₂ knot is -2.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and presents the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_6_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image (6_2 knot).\n\n    The knot is identified as the 6_2 knot.
