    "Based on a visual analysis of the emission spectrum provided, the element can be identified by comparing its characteristic spectral lines to known values. The spectrum in the image displays several prominent lines across the visible range, including distinct lines in the violet, blue, green, and yellow regions. This specific pattern is a well-known fingerprint for the element Mercury (Hg).\n\nHere is a Python script that outlines this identification by listing the key spectral lines of Mercury that are visible in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the element based on its characteristic spectral lines visible in the image.\n    The pattern strongly matches the emission spectrum of Mercury (Hg).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    element = \"Mercury (Hg)\"\n\n    # Prominent spectral lines of Mercury in the visible spectrum (in nanometers)\n    spectral_lines = {\n        404.7: \"Violet\",\n        435.8: \"Blue\",\n        546.1: \"Green\",\n        577.0: \"Yellow\",\n        579.1: \"Yellow-Orange\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The element with the spectral lines shown in the image is: {element}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis identification is based on the following characteristic emission lines which are visible in the spectrum:\")\n\n    # Print each prominent line as evidence, matching it to the image\n    print(\"\\nImage Spectrum => Mercury's Known Lines\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    for wavelength, color in spectral_lines.items():\n        print(f\"A prominent {color} line is visible => Corresponds to the {wavelength} nm line of Mercury.\")\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Mercury>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
