    "To solve this problem, we need to determine what a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure looks like when viewed along the [110] direction and match it to one of the provided images.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the FCC structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the 8 corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n2.  **Understand the [110] projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector pointing from the origin to the (1,1,0) position.\n3.  **Determine the resulting 2D pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the pattern consists of repeating rectangular cells, each with atoms at the four corners and one atom in the very center of the rectangle.\n4.  **Analyze the images:** We will inspect each image (A, B, C, and D) to see which one matches this centered rectangular pattern.\n\n### Execution:\nThe Python code below will print a step-by-step analysis of each image to identify the correct one based on the expected pattern.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystallography():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct\n    crystal lattice pattern for an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.  The question asks to identify the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\")\n    print(\"2.  In an FCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces.\")\n    print(\"3.  When projecting this 3D structure onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the atoms form a specific 2D pattern.\")\n    print(\"4.  The theoretical and well-established pattern for an FCC [110] projection is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the repeating unit cell is a rectangle with an atom at each corner and another atom precisely in the center of the rectangle.\")\n    print(\"5.  Now we examine the given options:\")\n    print(\"    - **Image A** shows a simple rectangular lattice, with atoms only at the corners of the rectangles. It lacks the central atom, so it is incorrect.\")\n    print(\"    - **Image B** shows a pattern that is not immediately recognizable as a regular lattice. It does not clearly show the centered rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"    - **Image C** shows a rectangular lattice with atoms that appear to be in the body-center of the cell. This pattern is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction.\")\n    print(\"    - **Image D** clearly exhibits the centered rectangular pattern. We can identify rectangles formed by atoms, with another atom located at the center of each rectangle. For example, consider the four atoms forming a rectangle at coordinates approximately (2,8), (4,8), (2,12), and (4,12). There is an atom in the center of this rectangle at (3,10). This repeating unit confirms the centered rectangular lattice structure.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Based on this analysis, image D correctly represents the crystal lattice pattern of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n\nsolve_crystallography()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
