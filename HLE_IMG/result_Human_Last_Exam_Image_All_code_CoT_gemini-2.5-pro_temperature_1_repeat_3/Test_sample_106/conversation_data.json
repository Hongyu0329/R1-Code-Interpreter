    "This problem requires us to determine the identity of substituents (either a hydrogen atom, H, or a methyl group, CH3) at five specific positions in the product of a chemical reaction. The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a complex alcohol, which results in a multi-step carbocation rearrangement known as a Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangement.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification**: The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It reacts with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat. These conditions are classic for alcohol dehydration (loss of H₂O) via a carbocation intermediate. The prompt explicitly mentions \"[1,2] shifts,\" confirming that a carbocation rearrangement occurs.\n\n2.  **Mechanism - Carbocation Formation**: The first step is the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid, forming a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺). This group departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the carbon where the alcohol was attached (C3).\n\n3.  **Mechanism - Rearrangement Cascade**: Secondary carbocations are unstable and tend to rearrange to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This initiates a cascade of [1,2] shifts, where a group (either H or CH₃) on an adjacent carbon moves to the positively charged carbon, transferring the positive charge. This process continues across the molecule's backbone.\n    *   **Shift 1**: A methyl group (CH₃) shifts from C4 to C3. This creates a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n    *   **Shift 2**: A hydride (H⁻) shifts from C5 to C4, moving the positive charge to C5.\n    *   **Shift 3**: A methyl group shifts from C10 to C5, moving the positive charge to C10.\n    *   **Shift 4**: A hydride shifts from C9 to C10, moving the positive charge to C9.\n    *   **Shift 5**: A methyl group shifts from C8 to C9, moving the positive charge to C8.\n    *   **Shift 6**: A methyl group shifts from C14 to C8, moving the positive charge to C14.\n    *   **Shift 7**: A hydride shifts from C13 to C14, moving the positive charge to C13.\n\n4.  **Mechanism - Elimination**: The cascade stops at the C13 carbocation. Finally, a proton (H⁺) is removed from the adjacent carbon C12. This forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, yielding the final product.\n\n5.  **Identifying Final Substituents**: By tracing the movements of each group, we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position in the product.\n    *   **Position 1 (at C4)**: Started with two CH₃ groups. One CH₃ moved to C3, and an H moved in from C5. Therefore, one **CH₃** group remains at C4.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C10)**: Started with a CH₃ group (this is standard for this skeleton and fits the mechanism). The CH₃ moved to C5, and an H moved in from C9. Therefore, an **H** atom is now at C10.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C9)**: Started with an H atom. The H moved to C10, and a CH₃ moved in from C8. Therefore, a **CH₃** group is now at C9.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C8)**: Started with a CH₃ group. This CH₃ moved to C9, and a new CH₃ moved in from C14. Therefore, a **CH₃** group is now at C8.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C14)**: Started with a CH₃ group. The CH₃ moved to C8, and an H moved in from C13. Therefore, an **H** atom is now at C14.\n\nThe following Python code will assemble and print the final answer based on this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at the numbered positions\n    in the product of the given backbone rearrangement reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Based on the mechanistic analysis, we can assign the final substituent at each position.\n    # The positions are mapped to their respective substituents (H or CH3).\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Prepare the list of strings for the final output.\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent_identity = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent_identity}\")\n\n    # Join the parts into a single string, separated by \", \".\n    final_answer_string = \", \".join(output_parts)\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(final_answer_string)\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
