    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for an amino group. The CbzCl reacts with the primary amine of tryptophan under basic conditions (provided by NaOH) to form a carbamate. This protecting group is called a carboxybenzyl or Cbz group.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a coupling reaction to form an amide-like bond. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agents EDC and HOBt. This activated intermediate then reacts with the amine component, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn), which is liberated from its hydrochloride salt by the base Et3N. The reaction forms a N-(benzyloxy)amide, also known as a protected hydroxamic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-N'-(benzyloxy)-(S)-tryptophanamide.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction condition is highly effective at cleaving benzyl groups through a process called hydrogenolysis. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n        1.  The Cbz group on the nitrogen (C6H5CH2-O-CO-).\n        2.  The benzyl (Bn) group on the oxygen (C6H5CH2-O-).\n    *   Both groups are removed in this single step. The Cbz group removal regenerates the primary amine. The O-benzyl group removal generates a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule has the core structure of tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group. The IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid. This compound is a known matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, and its common name is **Batimastat**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the common name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the product from the given chemical reaction sequence.\n    Step 1: Protection of tryptophan's amine with a Cbz group.\n    Step 2: Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a protected hydroxamic acid.\n    Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenation to remove both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.\n    The final product is tryptophan hydroxamic acid, commonly known as Batimastat.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Batimastat\"\n    print(product_name)\n\nget_product_name()\n```\n<<<Batimastat>>>"
