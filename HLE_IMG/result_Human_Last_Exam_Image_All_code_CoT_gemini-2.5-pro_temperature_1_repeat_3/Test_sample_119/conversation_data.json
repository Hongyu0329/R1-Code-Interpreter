    "My plan is to determine the structure of the unknown compound by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** I will use the molecular ion peak (M+) to determine the molecular weight. The Nitrogen Rule will help me deduce the presence of nitrogen and propose a molecular formula.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Using the molecular formula, I will calculate the DBE to understand the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n3.  **IR Spectroscopy:** I will look for characteristic absorption bands to identify key functional groups present in the molecule, such as aromatic rings, C-H bonds, and potential N-H bonds.\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135:** I will count the number of unique carbons and classify them as CH₃, CH₂, CH, or quaternary (Cq) carbons. This will give me a carbon skeleton inventory.\n5.  **¹H NMR:** I will analyze the chemical shifts, integration values, and splitting patterns to identify different types of protons and their connectivity.\n6.  **HSQC:** I will use this 2D spectrum to correlate each proton signal with its directly attached carbon atom, confirming the assignments from the 1D NMR spectra.\n7.  **Structure Elucidation:** I will piece together the fragments identified from the various spectra, considering possible isomers, and select the one that best fits all the available data. The fragmentation pattern in the mass spectrum will serve as a final confirmation.\n8.  **IUPAC Name:** Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the elucidated structure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum\")\n    mw = 135\n    print(f\"The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = {mw}.\")\n    print(\"According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (most likely one).\")\n    print(\"Based on the NMR data, the formula is determined to be C9H13N.\")\n    print(f\"Let's verify the mass: (9 * 12) + (13 * 1) + (14 * 1) = 108 + 13 + 14 = {108 + 13 + 14}, which matches the molecular weight.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\")\n    C, H, N = 9, 13, 1\n    dbe = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\n    print(f\"For the formula C{C}H{H}N{N}, the DBE is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"DBE = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\")\n    print(f\"DBE = {C} + 1 - ({H} / 2) + ({N} / 2) = {dbe}\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Analysis of NMR Spectra (1H, 13C, DEPT, HSQC)\")\n    print(\"The 1H NMR spectrum shows:\")\n    print(\" - A multiplet for 5H at ~7.2 ppm, indicating a monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\")\n    print(\" - A 3H doublet at ~1.2 ppm, indicating a CH3 group next to a CH group.\")\n    print(\" - A 1H multiplet at ~2.7 ppm, indicating a CH group.\")\n    print(\" - A 2H multiplet at ~2.8-2.9 ppm, indicating a CH2 group.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe 13C NMR and DEPT spectra show 7 distinct carbon signals:\")\n    print(\" - 4 signals in the aromatic region (126-146 ppm).
