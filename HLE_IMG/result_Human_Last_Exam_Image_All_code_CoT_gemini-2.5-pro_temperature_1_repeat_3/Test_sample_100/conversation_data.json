    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first determine the molecular formula of the starting compound, `7-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one`.\n    *   The core `7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one` structure with a `CF3` group and `H` on the nitrogen has the formula `C7H6F3NO`.\n    *   The `p-methoxybenzyl` (PMB) protecting group (`-CH2-C6H4-OCH3`) has the formula `C8H9O`.\n    *   By combining the core (with N instead of NH) and the PMB group, I will calculate the total molecular formula of the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (CAN, ACN/H2O)**: Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB-protected amines. This reaction removes the PMB group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. I will calculate the molecular formula of `Intermediate 1` by adjusting the atom counts.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Pd/C, H2)**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) in the bicyclic ring. It may also reduce the ketone (`C=O`), but the reduction of the alkene is much faster and more reliable under these conditions. I will assume only the alkene is reduced and add two hydrogen atoms to the formula to get `Intermediate 2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (4 N HCl, 70 °C)**: The conditions of hot, aqueous acid suggest a hydrolysis reaction. While the bicyclic amino-ketone core is relatively stable, the trifluoromethyl (`-CF3`) group can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) under these conditions. This is a known transformation that accounts for the specific reaction conditions and high yield. I will calculate the change in atomic composition when `-CF3` is replaced by `-COOH`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Formula**: Based on the transformation in step 4, I will determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations step-by-step and print the resulting molecular formula at each stage, finally outputting the formula of the end product.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Core: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one.\n    # Let's count atoms:\n    # Carbons: 6 in the bicyclic ring + 1 in CF3 = 7\n    # Hydrogens: 1(C1), 2(C3), 1(C4), 1(C6) = 5 on the carbon skeleton.\n    # Nitrogen: 1\n    # Oxygen: 1 (ketone)\n    # Fluorine: 3\n    # Core (unprotected): C7H6F3NO (with H on N)\n    \n    # PMB group: p-methoxybenzyl, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3\n    # C: 1(CH2) + 6(ring) + 1(CH3) = 8\n    # H: 2(CH2) + 4(ring) + 3(CH3) = 9\n    # O: 1\n    # PMB formula: C8H9O\n    \n    # Starting material: Core with N-PMB instead of N-H\n    # So, we take the core formula C7H5F3NO (without H on N) and add C8H9O\n    atoms = {\n        'C': 7 + 8,\n        'H': 5 + 9,\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 1 + 1\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Reaction Scheme Analysis:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Starting Material (C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']})\")\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - Deprotection of N-PMB with CAN\n    # The N-PMB group is replaced by N-H.\n    # This means we subtract the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one H.\n    # Net change: subtract C8H8O.\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 9\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    atoms['H'] += 1 # Add H to Nitrogen\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: PMB Deprotection (CAN)\")\n    print(f\" -> Intermediate 1: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2\n    # This reduces the C=C double bond, adding two hydrogen atoms.\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2)\")\n    print(f\" -> Intermediate 2: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Hydrolysis with 4N HCl at 70 C\n    # This hydrolyzes the CF3 group to a COOH group.\n    # We lose a CF3 group and gain a COOH group.\n    # Change: -C, -F3, +C, +O2, +H.\n    # Net change: -F3, +O2, +H\n    atoms['F'] -= 3\n    atoms['O'] += 2\n    atoms['H'] += 1\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: CF3 Hydrolysis (HCl, 70°C)\")\n    \n    # Construct the final formula string\n    formula_parts = []\n    if atoms.get('C', 0) > 0:\n        formula_parts.append(f\"C{atoms['C']}\")\n    if atoms.get('H', 0) > 0:\n        formula_parts.append(f\"H{atoms['H']}\")\n    if atoms.get('F', 0) > 0:\n        formula_parts.append(f\"F{atoms['F']}\")\n    if atoms.get('N', 0) > 0:\n        formula_parts.append(f\"N{atoms['N'] if atoms['N'] > 1 else ''}\")\n    if atoms.get('O', 0) > 0:\n        formula_parts.append(f\"O{atoms['O']}\")\n    \n    final_formula = \"\".join(formula_parts)\n    print(f\" -> Final Product: {final_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Final print of the composition as requested\n    print(\"\\nFinal Product Composition:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Nitrogen atoms: {atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Oxygen atoms: {atoms['O']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms: {atoms['F']}\")\n    \n    return final_formula\n\n# Run the calculation and store the final answer\nfinal_product_formula = calculate_product_formula()\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{final_product_formula}>>>\")\n```"
