    "Based on my analysis of the provided sheet music, I can identify the opera.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Score's Characteristics:** I will examine the instrumentation (e.g., `engl. Horn`, `gr. Fl.`), musical notation, and German text annotations (`Vorhang`, `mit DÃ¤mpfer`).\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:** The word `Vorhang` is German for \"curtain,\" strongly indicating a theatrical work like an opera. The lush, chromatic, and complex orchestration is characteristic of the late Romantic or early 20th-century period.\n3.  **Synthesize Clues:** The combination of a large orchestra, a specific atmospheric mood, and German text points towards German opera from that era. The prominent, melodic line for the English Horn at the beginning is a very distinctive feature.\n4.  **Identify the Opera:** These clues, especially the specific musical passage, are iconic and belong to the opera *Salome* by Richard Strauss. This specific music opens Scene 4, which follows the orchestral interlude and is often treated as the beginning of Act II in some productions.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the opera as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_opera():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n    The score is the opening of Scene 4 from a well-known opera.\n\n    Clues from the score:\n    - Text: \"(Vorhang)\" which is German for \"Curtain\".\n    - Instrumentation: A large orchestra including English Horn (\"engl. Horn\").\n    - Musical Style: Late-Romantic / early 20th Century, with lush and dissonant harmony.\n\n    These features are characteristic of Richard Strauss's opera \"Salome\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_title = \"Salome\"\n    composer = \"Richard Strauss\"\n    \n    print(f\"The provided sheet music is from the opera titled: {opera_title}\")\n    print(f\"It was composed by: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_opera()\n```\n<<<Salome>>>"
