    "Based on my analysis of the raster plot, I will identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts of neuronal activity. Then, I will calculate the time intervals between these consecutive bursts. Finally, I will compute the average of these intervals and present the result rounded to two significant figures.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** Visually inspect the graph to find the center time for each dense vertical band of activity, which represents a synchronized burst.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** Compute the difference in time between each pair of consecutive bursts.\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** Find the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The bursts are the dense vertical lines of dots.\nburst_timestamps = [2, 11, 17, 26, 36, 47]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\ninter_burst_intervals = []\nfor i in range(1, len(burst_timestamps)):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i] - burst_timestamps[i-1]\n    inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# Display the calculation process\nintervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\nprint(f\"\\nCalculation of the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"Average = ({intervals_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n# Step 4: Present the final answer to two significant figures.\n# Using a format string to ensure two significant figures.\n# For a number like 9.0, '{:.2g}'.format(9.0) -> '9', which is not what we want.\n# We want to show the precision. '{:.1f}' will show one decimal place.\nfinal_answer = f\"{average_ibi:.1f}\"\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s.\")\n\n```\n<<<9.0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
