def solve_graphene_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes four graphene band structure simulations to match them with specific parameter conditions.

    The tight-binding energy bands for graphene, including nearest-neighbor overlap (s), can be modeled.
    The key parameters and their effects on the band structure are:
    - t (hopping parameter): Scales the overall bandwidth. A smaller t leads to a narrower total energy range.
    - s (overlap integral): Introduces asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands.
      - s = 0: Bands are symmetric around E=0.
      - s > 0: Valence band is wider than the conduction band.
      - s < 0: Conduction band is wider than the valence band.
      - |s|: Magnitude of asymmetry. Larger |s| means more asymmetry.
