    "Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image. The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy, spherical growth on the twig, which is a type of insect gall, likely a woolly oak gall.\n\nGalls are abnormal growths on plants induced by insects, in this case, a tiny cynipid wasp. The female wasp lays her egg inside the plant's tissue (the twig). Chemicals from the egg and the subsequently hatched larva stimulate the plant to grow this unique structure around the larva. The gall serves as both a protective home and a source of food for the developing insect.\n\nTherefore, the insect responsible for the most visible activity laid its egg inside the twig, and the gall itself is the structure that houses the developing larva. There is also secondary evidence of other insect activity, such as chewed leaves and a small egg mass on a leaf seen in one of the cropped images.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the insect activity visible in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    evidence = \"Yes, there is evidence of insect activity.\"\n    gall_description = \"The main evidence is the white, fuzzy, ball-like structure on the twig, which is an insect gall, specifically a type of oak gall.\"\n    insect_responsible = \"This gall is created by a small cynipid wasp.\"\n    egg_location_title = \"Where the egg is laid:\"\n    egg_location_explanation = \"The female wasp lays its egg by injecting it directly into the plant's tissue.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
