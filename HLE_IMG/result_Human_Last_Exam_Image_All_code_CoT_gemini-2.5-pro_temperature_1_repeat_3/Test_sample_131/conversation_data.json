    "This is a chemical identification task. The image displays the skeletal structure of an alkaloid compound. Based on its characteristic tetracyclic quinolizidine-derived structure containing a lactam (a cyclic amide, which can also be viewed as a ketone within a piperidine ring), the compound is identified as **Lupanine**.\n\nI will provide a Python script that prints this name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n    The structure is a well-known lupin alkaloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
