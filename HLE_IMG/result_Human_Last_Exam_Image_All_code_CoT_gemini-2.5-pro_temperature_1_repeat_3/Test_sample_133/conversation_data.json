    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided mass spectrum data.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the one with the highest relative intensity (100%). From the table, we can see the peak at **m/z = 225** has an intensity of 100%.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Isotopic Pattern of the Base Peak:** We look at the peaks immediately following the base peak.\n    *   m/z = 225, I = 100%\n    *   m/z = 227, I = 66.7%\n    The intensity ratio I(227)/I(225) is 66.7/100 ≈ 2/3. This is a very strong indication that this fragment contains **two chlorine atoms**. The theoretical intensity ratio for a species with two chlorines ([M]:[M+2]:[M+4]) is approximately 9:6:1, which normalizes to 100:66.7:11.1. Our data for the first two peaks is a perfect match.\n\n3.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Primary Fragmentation:** The molecular ion peak is the highest mass peak corresponding to the intact molecule. In this spectrum, the highest significant cluster of peaks is around m/z 260-266. Let's assume the peak at **m/z = 260** is the molecular ion corresponding to the isotopologue with the lightest isotopes (³⁵Cl).\n    The mass difference between this potential molecular ion and the base peak is:\n    260 - 225 = 35 u\n    A mass of 35 u corresponds to a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This means the primary fragmentation pathway is the loss of a chlorine atom from the parent molecule: M⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Since the base peak fragment [M-Cl]⁺ contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule M must have contained **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The mass of the molecular ion (with three ³⁵Cl atoms) is 260 u.\n    *   The mass of the three chlorine atoms is 3 * 35 = 105 u.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the non-chlorine part) is 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n    *   We now need to find a plausible chemical formula for a moiety with a mass of 155 u. A likely candidate composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is **C₁₀H₁₉O** (10*12 + 19*1 + 16*1 = 155).\n    *   Therefore, the full molecular formula is likely **C₁₀H₁₉OCl₃**. A quick check of the degree of unsaturation for this formula gives 0, indicating a saturated, acyclic molecule.\n\n5.  **Identify the Structure using Other Fragments:**\n    *   There is a significant peak cluster at m/z 47 and 49, with an intensity ratio of 18.4 : 6.24 ≈ 3:1. This corresponds to the **[CCl]⁺** fragment, which strongly suggests the presence of a trichloromethyl (-CCl₃) group in the molecule.\n    *   Combining this with the molecular formula, we can deduce that the compound is an isomer of **1,1,1-trichlorodecanol**.\n    *   While the exact position of the hydroxyl (-OH) group cannot be determined with certainty from the mass spectrum alone, a plausible and simple isomer is one where the -OH group is on the carbon adjacent to the -CCl₃ group.\n\n6.  **State the Final IUPAC Name:** The structure is identified as an isomer of 1,1,1-trichlorodecanol. A representative systematic IUPAC name for such a compound would be **1,1,1-trichlorodecan-2-ol**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    The logic follows the step-by-step derivation explained above.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key data points from the spectrum\n    base_peak_mz = 225\n    base_peak_intensity = 100.0\n    m_plus_2_of_base_peak_mz = 227\n    m_plus_2_of_base_peak_intensity = 66.7\n    molecular_ion_mz = 260  # Assumed lightest isotopologue\n    cl_mass = 35\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum:\")\n    print(f\"1.
