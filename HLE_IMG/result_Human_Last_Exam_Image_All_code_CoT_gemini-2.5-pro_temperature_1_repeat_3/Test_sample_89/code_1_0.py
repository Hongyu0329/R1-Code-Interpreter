# The proposed structures for products A, B, and C are derived by interpreting the
# (sometimes contradictory) descriptions of their formation pathways.

# Structure A: A primary amide derived from the cycloaddition pathway.
# A plausible structure is a tetrahydroindolizine system (fused 5- and 6-membered rings
# containing nitrogen) with a carboxamide group.
smiles_A = "NC(=O)C1=CC=CN2C1CCCC2"

# Structure B: A "tethered imide" from the Michael addition pathway.
# This structure represents the proline ring fused with a 7-membered ring that contains
# an imide group, formed by cyclizing with the added methyl propiolate chain.
smiles_B = "O=C1/C=C\\C(=O)N2C1CCC2"

# Structure C: A "tethered imide" from the Dakin-West type pathway.
# This represents the proline ring fused with a diketopiperazine-like structure,
# which is a type of imide. This structure is formed from the proline moiety and
# an acetyl fragment from the acetic anhydride solvent.
