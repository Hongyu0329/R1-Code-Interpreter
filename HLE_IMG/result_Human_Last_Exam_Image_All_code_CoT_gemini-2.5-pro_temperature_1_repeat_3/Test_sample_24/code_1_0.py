# To verify this, we can compute its first homology group, H_1(M), which should be trivial.
# We use the presentation matrix derived from the standard genus-2 Heegaard diagram of the Poincaré sphere.
# The abelianized relations are:
# 1*x_1 + 1*x_2 = 0

# This gives the following 2x2 presentation matrix A.
