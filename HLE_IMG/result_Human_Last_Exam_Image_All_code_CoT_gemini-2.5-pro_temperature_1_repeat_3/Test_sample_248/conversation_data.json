    "To identify the species that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast, we need to identify the organisms in the image and check their native ranges.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo shows a typical rocky intertidal community. We can clearly see:\n    *   Acorn barnacles (the volcano-shaped shells attached to the rock).\n    *   Two types of snails:\n        *   Two larger, light-colored snails, likely a species of whelk or large periwinkle.\n        *   Several smaller, dark, conical snails.\n\n2.  **Determine the indicator species:** We need to find a species that lives on the Atlantic coast of North America but not on the Pacific coast.\n    *   The small, dark snails are morphologically consistent with the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   Let's check the distribution of *Littorina littorea*. It is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and has become very common there, from Labrador to Maryland. Crucially, it is not established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n    *   The barnacles and the larger snails could belong to species found in both oceans or are harder to identify definitively from the photo alone. However, the presence of the Common Periwinkle is a very strong indicator.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, definitively places this photo on the Atlantic coast. The code below will print its scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the species that indicates the photo's location\n  and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The small, dark snails in the image are identifiable as the Common Periwinkle.\n  # This species is abundant on the North American Atlantic coast but is not found\n  # on the Pacific coast, making it a definitive indicator.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
