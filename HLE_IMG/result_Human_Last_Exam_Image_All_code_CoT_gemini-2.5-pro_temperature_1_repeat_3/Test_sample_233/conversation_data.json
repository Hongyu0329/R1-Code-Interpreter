    "This task requires identifying a specific runestone from an image fragment. The runestone is identified as an \"Ingvar runestone\", which is a critical clue.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image displays runic characters carved on stone within a distinct grid or panel layout. This style is a significant identifying feature.\n2.  **Transliterate the Runes:** I will transliterate some of the visible runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet into Latin characters. This will provide textual clues.\n    *   **Top Row:** Includes the sequence `...ᚦᚢᚱᚴᛁ...` which transliterates to `...þurki...`. This is part of a name like Þorgils or Þorketill.\n    *   **Middle Row:** Clearly shows `...ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ...` which is `...stain...`, the Old Norse word for \"stone\".\n    *   **Bottom Row:** Contains `...ᚼᛅᚾ : ᚢᛁᛋ...` which transliterates to `...han : uis...`, meaning \"he was\".\n3.  **Identify the Runestone:** I will use the combination of these clues—being an Ingvar runestone, the grid pattern, and the inscription fragments (`þurki`, `stain`, `han uis`)—to search through catalogs of Swedish runestones. This search points to a specific fragmented stone.\n4.  **Confirmation:** The visual style and inscription fragments are a match for the runestone fragment cataloged as **Sö 281**, which is located in the Strängnäs Cathedral. It is one of the well-known Ingvar runestones.\n5.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script to present the components of the runestone's ID and then the full ID itself.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image\n    and prints its official catalog ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ID consists of a code for the province and a number.\n    # Based on the analysis of the runic style (grid pattern) and inscription,\n    # the stone is identified as Sö 281 from Strängnäs Cathedral.\n    # 'Sö' stands for the province of Södermanland.\n    \n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    runestone_number = 281\n    \n    print(\"The runestone ID is composed of a province code and a number.\")\n    print(f\"Province Code: {province_code}\")\n    print(f\"Number: {runestone_number}\")\n    \n    full_id = f\"{province_code} {runestone_number}\"\n    print(f\"The full ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {full_id}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
