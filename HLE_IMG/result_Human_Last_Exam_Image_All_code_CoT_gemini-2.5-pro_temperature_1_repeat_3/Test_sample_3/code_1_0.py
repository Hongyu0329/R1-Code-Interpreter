# State names mapping for clarity in the output

# Transition Probability Matrix (P), where P[i, j] is the prob of moving from state i to j.

# We normalize these probabilities so they sum to 1.

# --- 2. Solving the Bellman Equation ---

# The Bellman equation in matrix form is: V = R + gamma * P * V
# We solve this system of linear equations: (I - gamma * P) * V = R
# V = (I - gamma * P)^-1 * R
I = np.identity(num_states)
V = np.linalg.inv(I - gamma * P) @ R


# --- 3. Displaying the Results ---
