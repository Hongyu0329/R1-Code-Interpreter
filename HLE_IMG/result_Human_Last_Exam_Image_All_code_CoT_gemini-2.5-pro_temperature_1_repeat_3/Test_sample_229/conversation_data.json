    "This is a handwritten lead sheet for a well-known jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing the melody and the chord progression.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Melody:** The piece is in the key of C Major. The melody in the first few bars starts with a pickup `G G`, then `E F G A | G F E D`. This melodic phrase is very distinctive.\n2.  **Chord Progression:** The chord progression for the first eight bars is approximately: `C | C | E7 | F | F C | C D- | G7 | C G7`. This progression, especially the move from C to E7, is a classic harmonic device.\n3.  **Identification:** The combination of this specific melody and chord progression strongly identifies the song as **\"After You've Gone\"**.\n4.  **Musical Style:** \"After You've Gone\" was written in 1918 by Turner Layton and Henry Creamer. It quickly became a jazz standard, popular in the **Dixieland** and **Swing** eras. The \"Medium\" tempo marking on the sheet music is consistent with a Swing interpretation.\n5.  **Country of Origin:** The composers were American, and the song originated from New York City's Tin Pan Alley publishing houses. Therefore, the country of origin is the **United States**.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the song identified from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"After You've Gone\"\n    musical_style = \"Jazz standard (Swing / Dixieland)\"\n    country_of_origin = \"United States\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: After You've Gone, Musical Style: Jazz standard (Swing / Dixieland), Country of Origin: United States>>>"
