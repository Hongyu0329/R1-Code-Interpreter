    This function encapsulates the logical deduction to identify the varied parameter for each plot.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Plots 5 and 9 show simple scaling, characteristic of cost parameters c_h (12) and c_l (7). Plot 9 (C_l) rises faster than Plot 5 (C_h). So, P5=12, P9=7.
    2.  Plot 8 shows almost no effect, fitting the very small baseline mortality rate μ (1). So, P8=1.
    3.  Plot 7 shows varying duration of a growth slowdown, matching the quarantine length q_l (14). So, P7=14.
    4.  Plot 6 shows a huge difference in outcomes, fitting the quarantine start time q_s (13). So, P6=13.
    5.  Plot 4 shows a sharp change in slope during quarantine, fitting the quarantine factor q_f (15). So, P4=15.
    6.  Plot 2 shows a time-shift and change in steepness of the epidemic, characteristic of the incubation period a_i (5). So, P2=5.
    7.  Plot 3 shows a small effect, fitting the mortality rate of the isolated hospitalized group, μ_h (8). So, P3=8.
    8.  Plot 1 shows a large effect without a strong quarantine signature, fitting the fundamental fraction of severe cases, f_s (6). So, P1=6.
