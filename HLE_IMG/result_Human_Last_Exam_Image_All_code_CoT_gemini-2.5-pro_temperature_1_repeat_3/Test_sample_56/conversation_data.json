    "Based on the surrealist style of the painting, which features impossible scenes such as an ocean flowing into a library and a wall of ice seen through a window, I can identify the artist. The distinct style is characteristic of a specific Polish surrealist painter. I will write a Python script to declare the artist's name and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist of the provided painting.\n    The painting's style and fantastical elements are characteristic of a specific artist.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Jacek Yerka\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the following painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
