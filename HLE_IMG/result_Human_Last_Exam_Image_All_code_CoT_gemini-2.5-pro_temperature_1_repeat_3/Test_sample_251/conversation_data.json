    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify ECG Parameters:** First, I will determine the standard parameters from the ECG strip, specifically the paper speed. The top left corner indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Grid Square:** Using the paper speed, I'll calculate the time duration corresponding to one small square on the ECG grid.\n    *   Paper speed = 25 mm/sec.\n    *   One small square = 1 mm.\n    *   Time for 1 small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   One large square = 5 mm = 5 * 0.04 seconds = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall spikes). The most significant pauses appear in the second, fourth, and fifth rows. I'll focus on the longest of these.\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** I will measure the longest interval by counting the number of large and small squares between the peaks of the two R-waves.\n    *   Upon careful inspection of the fourth row of the ECG (starting near the timestamp `0:06:08`), the pause after the fifth beat appears to be the longest.\n    *   The peak of the fifth R-wave is on a major vertical grid line.\n    *   The peak of the sixth R-wave is 8 full large squares and 2 additional small squares past that line.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Time:** I will use the number of squares and the time per square to calculate the total duration of the interval in seconds.\n    *   Total small squares = (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 2 small squares = 40 + 2 = 42 small squares.\n    *   Total time = 42 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the parameters from the ECG strip.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\nsmall_square_mm = 1\nlarge_square_mm = 5\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time duration for one small square.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = small_square_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Step 3: Visually identify and measure the longest R-R interval in grid squares.\n# The longest interval is found in the fourth row.\n# It spans 8 large squares and 2 small squares.\nnum_large_squares = 8\nnum_small_squares_extra = 2\n\n# Step 4: Convert the measurement to total small squares.\nsmall_squares_per_large_square = large_square_mm / small_square_mm\ntotal_small_squares = (num_large_squares * small_squares_per_large_square) + num_small_squares_extra\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final answer.\nprint(\"ECG Analysis for Longest R-R Interval\")\nprint(f\"Paper Speed: {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square: {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(\"\\nMeasurement of the longest interval:\")\nprint(f\"Number of large squares: {num_large_squares}\")\nprint(f\"Number of extra small squares: {num_small_squares_extra}\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculation:\")\nprint(f\"Total small squares = ({num_large_squares} * {int(small_squares_per_large_square)}) + {num_small_squares_extra} = {int(total_small_squares)}\")\nprint(f\"Longest R-R Interval (sec) = {int(total_small_squares)} small squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} sec/square\")\nprint(f\"Result: {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n\n```\n<<<1.68>>>"
