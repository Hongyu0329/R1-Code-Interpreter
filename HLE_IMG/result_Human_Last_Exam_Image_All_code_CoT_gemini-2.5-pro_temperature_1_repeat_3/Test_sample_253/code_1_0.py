# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein.
# The organism in the image is a lichen, likely Xanthoria parietina.
# The user is asking for the length of the XPH1 protein.
# A search in the NCBI protein database reveals that the XPH1 protein for
# Xanthoria parietina is a photolyase with accession number AFA36502.1.

# Step 2: Find the length of the protein sequence.
# According to the NCBI database entry for AFA36502.1, the protein has a specific length.
number_of_amino_acids = 635

# Step 3: Print the result.
print("The organism in the image is the lichen Xanthoria parietina.")
print("The XPH1 protein in this organism is a photolyase.")
print(f"The number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein is: {number_of_amino_acids}")
