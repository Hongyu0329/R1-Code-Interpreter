    "This image illustrates the **Continuity Illusion** (also known as the perceptual restoration of sound).\n\nIn this auditory illusion, a sound, such as a pure tone (represented by the initial sine wave and the single line in the spectrogram), is interrupted by a loud noise (the complex waveform and the vertical smear in the spectrogram). Although the original tone is physically absent during the noise burst, a listener's brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, creating the illusion that the tone continued uninterrupted behind the noise.\n\nThis is a powerful example of how the brain uses context and assumptions to construct a coherent perception of the world from incomplete sensory information.\n\nI will now provide a simple python script that prints the name of the phenomenon.\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  phenomenon_name = \"Continuity Illusion\"\n  print(f\"The name of the phenomenon is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Continuity Illusion>>>"
