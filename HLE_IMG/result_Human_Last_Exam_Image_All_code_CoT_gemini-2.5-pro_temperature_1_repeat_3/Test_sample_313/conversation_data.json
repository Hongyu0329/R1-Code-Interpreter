    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  First, I'll analyze the second clue: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points directly to the historical process of making felt hats. Mercuric nitrate was used to treat fur for felt, and the exposure led to mercury poisoning, famously known as \"Mad Hatter's disease.\" Therefore, the object \"X Y\" is a **Felt Hat**.\n2.  Next, I need to connect \"Felt Hat\" to the first clue and the image. The image is from the NHL Awards on June 20, 2019. The man on the left presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. The man on the right receiving the award is player Ryan O'Reilly.\n3.  The solution is a pun based on the scene:\n    *   **Felt**: Ryan O'Reilly, the recipient, certainly **felt** happy and proud.\n    *   **Hat**: Gary Bettman's name is sometimes punned as \"Hat Man\" (Bett-man).\n4.  Putting these two parts together, the scene pictured can be interpreted as \"Felt Hat\". This satisfies both parts of the riddle.\n5.  I will now generate a Python script to print the two words that make up the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by identifying the two words, X and Y.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From the clue about mercury salts, we deduce the object is a \"Felt Hat\".\n    # X Y = Felt Hat\n    # We confirm this with the first clue, which is a pun on the scene depicted.\n    # The recipient 'felt' happy, and the presenter, Gary Bettman, is the 'Hat' man.\n    \n    x = \"Felt\"\n    y = \"Hat\"\n    \n    print(f\"The X Y in the riddle is: {x} {y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
