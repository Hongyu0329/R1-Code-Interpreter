# My plan is to identify the components of the riddle and piece them together.
# 1. The image is of the Himeros crater on asteroid 433 Eros.
# 2. The etymological origin of the name "Himeros" is the Greek word for "desire" or "longing".
# 3. Carl Sagan's book, "Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space", provides the phrase "Vision of the Future" as a candidate for "X of Y".
# 4. The concept of "desire" (Himeros) is intrinsically linked to having a "Vision of the Future".
# 5. Therefore, if "X of Y" is "Vision of the Future", then Y is "Future".

Y = "Future"
