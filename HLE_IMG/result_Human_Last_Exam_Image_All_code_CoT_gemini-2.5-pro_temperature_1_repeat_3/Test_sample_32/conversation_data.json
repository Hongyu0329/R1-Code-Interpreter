    "To determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, we will look at the key morphological features described in botanical literature for these two moss species. The most obvious distinguishing feature relates to the structure that holds the capsule.\n\nHere is a Python script that outlines and prints the key difference.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the primary distinguishing characteristic\n    between the sporophytes of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n\n    # Define the key characteristic for each species' sporophyte\n    feature_montana = \"a short, straight seta (stalk)\"\n    feature_curviseta = \"a strongly curved or hooked seta\"\n\n    # Define the resulting appearance\n    appearance_montana = \"The capsule is held erect and immersed among the leaves.\"\n    appearance_curviseta = \"The capsule is bent over or nodding, often hidden beneath the leaves.\"\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(f\"The main difference in the sporophyte between {species1} and {species2} that helps distinguish them at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. {species1}: It has {feature_montana}.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
