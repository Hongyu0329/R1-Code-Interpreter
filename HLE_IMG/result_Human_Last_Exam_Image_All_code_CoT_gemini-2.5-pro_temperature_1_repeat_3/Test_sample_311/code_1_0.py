    # Step 1: Identify group and its properties.
    # The group is identified as the cyclic group C_10 based on the visualizations.
    # R1: Sum of character table entries for C10 is |G| = 10.
    # R2: Number of irreducible representations for abelian C10 is |G| = 10.
    # R3: Order of the group is 10.
    # R4: Exponent of C10 is 10.
    R_values = [10, 10, 10, 10]

    # Step 2: Compute coefficient C_i.
    # The contraharmonic mean is sum(R^2) / sum(R).
    mean = sum(r**2 for r in R_values) / sum(R_values)
    # C_i is the floor of the mean, constant for all i.
    C = sympy.floor(mean)

    # Step 3: Construct the polynomial P(x).
    P_x = sum(C * x**i for i in range(1, 10))

    # Step 4: Find Q(x) and S(x), the real and imaginary parts of P(ix).

    # Step 5: Construct the Bezout matrix M1 and find its trace.
    M1_matrix = Q_poly.bezout(S_poly)
    trace_M1 = M1_matrix.trace()

    # Step 6: Construct the Sylvester matrix M2 and find its trace.
    # The second polynomial is B(x) = x^10 + S(x).

    # As a check: since both Q(x) and B(x) have a constant term of 0,
    # the diagonal of the Sylvester matrix contains only zeros, so its trace must be 0.

    # Step 7: Calculate the final trace T.
    # T = Tr(M1 kron I2 + M2) = 2 * Tr(M1) + Tr(M2)
    T = 2 * trace_M1 + trace_M2
