# The task is to re-identify a giraffe from a set of images based on its unique coat pattern.
# Giraffe coat patterns are like fingerprints, unique to each individual.

    Identifies the matching giraffe by comparing spot patterns.

    Methodology:
    1.  Analyze the target image for distinctive spot patterns, particularly on the shoulder and flank area.
    2.  The target giraffe has a notable cluster of spots where the neck joins the body. Specifically, a vertically elongated spot next to a pattern resembling a distorted letter 'H'.
    3.  Compare this unique pattern with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    4.  Option A and C have different coloration and less defined spots.
    5.  Option D has much darker and more jagged spots.
    6.  Options E and F have different spot arrangements in the key shoulder area.
    7.  Option B shows an identical spot pattern in the key area, as well as on the flank. The shape, size, and arrangement of the spots are a clear match to the target.
    8.  Therefore, image B shows the same giraffe as the target image.
