    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire tiling, and have it look identical to its original state. The number of times this match occurs in a full 360-degree rotation is the order of the rotational symmetry.\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**: Let's examine the different shapes and their junctions. We can see squares, hexagons, and other polygons. The most symmetrical-looking points are often the centers of the most symmetrical shapes.\n2.  **Test the Centers**:\n    *   **Center of a square**: A square has 4-fold symmetry. If we rotate the tiling by 360/4 = 90 degrees around the center of a square, the pattern appears unchanged. So, there is at least 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Center of a hexagon**: The dark blue shapes are regular hexagons. A regular hexagon has 6-fold symmetry. Let's test this point as a center of rotation for the whole pattern.\n3.  **Calculate the Rotation Angle**: For a 6-fold symmetry, the angle of rotation would be 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.\n4.  **Verify the Symmetry**: If we rotate the entire tiling by 60 degrees around the center of any blue hexagon, the hexagon itself maps onto its original position. Furthermore, each surrounding shape (the light yellow pentagons, squares, and orange rhombi) moves into the position of an identical shape, preserving the overall appearance of the tiling.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the pattern has centers of 6-fold rotation, and this is the highest order of rotation present (as dictated by the crystallographic restriction theorem which limits wallpaper group symmetries to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold), the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6.\n\nThe following Python code explains and calculates this.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: To find the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we look for a point around which the pattern can be rotated and remain unchanged.\")\n    print(\"The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern looks the same during a 360-degree rotation.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: We identify the centers of the regular polygons in the pattern as potential centers of rotation.\")\n    print(\"The tiling contains dark blue regular hexagons.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: A regular hexagon has 6 sides of equal length.
