    "This problem asks to identify the two pericyclic reactions occurring in the given photochemical transformation between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n\nHere is my thinking process to solve this:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:** The reaction involves hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene (C₄H₄), an alkene. The reaction is driven by light (`hv`), indicating a photochemical process. This is a crucial clue, as the rules governing pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical conditions.\n2.  **Consider the \"Two Reactions\" Clue:** The problem explicitly states that two pericyclic reactions occur. This suggests a multi-step mechanism where the product of the first reaction becomes the reactant for the second.\n3.  **Propose the First Reaction:** Aromatic compounds like benzene are generally unreactive in pericyclic reactions because it would require disrupting their stable aromatic system. However, under photochemical conditions, benzene and its derivatives can absorb light and undergo valence isomerization to less stable, but more reactive, isomers. A well-known photoisomer of benzene is Dewar benzene. The conversion of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene is a 6π-electron **electrocyclic reaction**. This is a plausible first step.\n4.  **Propose the Second Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene), is highly strained and contains two reactive double bonds. This intermediate can then react with the cyclobutene molecule present. A common photochemical reaction between two molecules containing double bonds is a **[2+2] cycloaddition** to form a four-membered ring. This type of reaction is photochemically allowed.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The two pericyclic reactions involved are an **electrocyclic reaction** (the isomerization of hexafluorobenzene) followed by a **[2+2] cycloaddition** (the reaction of the isomer with cyclobutene). While the drawing of the final product in the image is ambiguous and likely a simplified or incorrect representation of the complex cage-like structure that actually forms, this two-step mechanism is the chemically accepted pathway for this transformation.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate a Python script to present the answer. The script will explicitly state the two reaction types and include the relevant electron counts (6π and [2+2]) to satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the two types of pericyclic reactions involved\n    in the photochemical reaction of hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The transformation is a known two-step photochemical process.\n    \n    # The first step is a valence isomerization of the aromatic ring.\n    # This is a type of electrocyclic reaction.\n    # In this case, it is a 6-pi electron system undergoing ring closure.\n    reaction_1 = {\n        \"type\": \"Electrocyclic reaction\",\n        \"pi_electrons\": 6\n    }\n\n    # The second step is a cycloaddition between the non-aromatic intermediate\n    # and the cyclobutene molecule.
