    # Step 1: Transcription of the word from the image.
    # The letters are identified sequentially as:
    # μ (mu)
    # ο (omicron)
    # θ (theta)
    # α (alpha) with an acute accent (oxia) -> ά
    # λ (lambda)
    # ω (omega), written in the cursive form resembling an infinity symbol (∞).
    # ν (nu)
    transcription = "μοθάλων"

    # Step 2: Identification of the common word it derives from.
    # The transcribed word is a Late Greek or Byzantine form.
    # The core "-θαλ-" strongly points to the common Greek word ὀφθαλμός (ophthalmos), meaning "eye".
    # The "-ων" ending is the standard genitive plural ending, meaning "of the...".
    # Therefore, the word is a form of ὀφθαλμῶν (ophthalmôn), "of the eyes".
    classical_form = "ὀφθαλμῶν"
    meaning = "of the eyes"

    # Step 3: Analysis of the changes from the classical to the manuscript form.
    # The transformation from ὀφθαλμῶν to μοθάλων shows several developments:
    # 1. The initial cluster 'ὀφ-' has become 'μο-'. This is likely a scribal error.
    # 2. The 'μ' in the original stem '-αλμ-' has been dropped. This simplification of consonant clusters (-αλμ- -> -αλ-) is common in later Greek.
    # 3. The accent has shifted from the final syllable (circumflex on -ῶν) to the third-to-last syllable (acute on -άλ-). This is called recessive accentuation and is a frequent feature of later Greek.

    # Step 4: Final Output
    print(f"The word transcribed from the manuscript is: {transcription}")
    print(f"It is a Byzantine form of the classical Greek word '{classical_form}', which means '{meaning}'.")
