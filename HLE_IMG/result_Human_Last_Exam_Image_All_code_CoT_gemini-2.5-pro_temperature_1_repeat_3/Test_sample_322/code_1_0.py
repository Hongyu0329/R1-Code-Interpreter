def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the vortex trajectory puzzle based on visual analysis.

    The logic for each plot is as follows:
    - B/b (Blue, twice/half strength)
    - G/g (Green, twice/half strength)
    - R/r (Red, twice/half strength)

    Uppercase: The vortex is stronger (twice strength) and acts as a central anchor.
    Lowercase: The vortex is weaker (half strength) and is pushed around by the other two.

    1. g: Green is weak, pushed by the Red/Blue pair.
    2. B: Blue is strong, acting as an anchor for Red/Green.
    3. R: Red is the strong anchor in a chaotic system.
    4. r: Red is weak, flung out by the Green/Blue pair.
    5. b: Blue is weak, pushed around by the Red/Green pair.
    6. g: Green is weak, pushed by the Red/Blue pair.
    7. G: Green is the strong anchor in a chaotic system.
    8. g: Green is weak, tossed around by the Red/Blue pair.
    9. g: Green is weak, confined by the large Red/Blue pair.
    10. r: Red is weak, confined by the Green/Blue pair.
    11. B: Blue is the strong anchor in a chaotic system.
    12. B: Blue is strong, acting as an anchor for Red/Green.
    13. g: Green is weak, making a small loop while Red/Blue trace large arcs.
    14. b: Blue is weak, pushed by the Red/Green pair.
    15. R: Red is the strong anchor in a chaotic system.
    16. B: Blue is strong, acting as an anchor for Red/Green.
