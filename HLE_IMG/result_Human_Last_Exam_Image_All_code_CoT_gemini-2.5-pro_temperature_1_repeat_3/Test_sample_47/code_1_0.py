V = 41  # Voltage in Volts
R14 = 14 # Resistance in Ohms
R29 = 29 # Resistance in Ohms

# The current I is the total current flowing into the parallel combination
# of the 14 Ohm and 29 Ohm resistors. This branch is connected directly
# across the 41V source.

# Calculate the current through the 14 Ohm resistor
I_14 = V / R14

I_29 = V / R29

# The total current I is the sum of the currents in the two parallel resistors
I = I_14 + I_29
