    "Of all the possible interpretations of the potentially ambiguous circuit diagram, the most self-consistent one that gives a well-defined value for the current `I` is as follows:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Circuit Diagram:** The circuit consists of a 41 V voltage source connected to two main parallel branches.\n    *   **Branch 1:** Contains the 14 Ω resistor and the 29 Ω resistor connected in parallel with each other. The current `I` shown in the diagram is the total current flowing into this branch.\n    *   **Branch 2:** Contains the 76 Ω resistor and the 8 Ω resistor in parallel. This combination is then connected in series with the 11 Ω resistor.\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to find the value of current `I`. Based on our interpretation, `I` is the sum of the currents flowing through the 14 Ω resistor (`I_14`) and the 29 Ω resistor (`I_29`).\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   Since Branch 1 is connected directly across the 41 V source, both the 14 Ω and 29 Ω resistors have 41 V across them.\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (V = IR), the current through each resistor can be calculated as I = V/R.\n    *   `I_14 = 41 V / 14 Ω`\n    *   `I_29 = 41 V / 29 Ω`\n    *   The total current `I` is `I = I_14 + I_29`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Use a Python script to perform the calculations and print the step-by-step process, including the final equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the given values from the circuit diagram\nV = 41  # Voltage in Volts\nR14 = 14 # Resistance in Ohms\nR29 = 29 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# The current I is the total current flowing into the parallel combination\n# of the 14 Ohm and 29 Ohm resistors. This branch is connected directly\n# across the 41V source.\n\n# Calculate the current through the 14 Ohm resistor\nI_14 = V / R14\n\n# Calculate the current through the 29 Ohm resistor\nI_29 = V / R29\n\n# The total current I is the sum of the currents in the two parallel resistors\nI = I_14 + I_29\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation with values\nprint(f\"To find the current I, we first identify the components it flows into.\")\nprint(f\"The current I supplies a branch with two parallel resistors: R1 = {R14} Ω and R2 = {R29} Ω.\")\nprint(f\"This branch is connected directly across the voltage source V = {V} V.\")\nprint(f\"Using Ohm's law (I = V/R), we calculate the current through each resistor:\")\nprint(f\"Current through R1 (I1) = {V} V / {R14} Ω = {I_14:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"Current through R2 (I2) = {V} V / {R29} Ω = {I_29:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"The total current I is the sum of I1 and I2.\")\nprint(f\"I = I1 + I2\")\n# Output the final equation with each number\nprint(f\"I = {V}/{R14} + {V}/{R29}\")\nprint(f\"I = {I_14:.4f} A + {I_29:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"I = {I:.4f} A\")\n\n# The final answer will be printed to stdout for the user, and also captured for the <<<>>> format.\n# The format requested is to have the final value in the special tags.\n# sys.stdout = open(os.devnull, 'w') # Suppress print to avoid duplication in final output if needed\nfinal_answer = I\n# sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__ # Restore stdout\n# print(f'<<<{final_answer:.4f}>>>') # This would print the answer in the desired format\n```\n<<<4.3424>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    find the value of the current I.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
