    "My analysis of the provided sheet music leads me to the following conclusion.\n\n1.  **Melody Analysis**: The opening melodic phrase, starting with a C pickup note followed by F, C, Ab, and G in the first full measure, is highly distinctive.\n2.  **Chord Progression Analysis**: The key is F minor, as indicated by the key signature (four flats) and the first chord (F-). The chord progression, while slightly simplified in this handwritten chart, follows a recognizable pattern: `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 | G7 | C7 ...`. This sequence of descending chromatic roots from F to Db, followed by a II-V progression (`G7` to `C7`) leading back to the tonic F minor, is characteristic of a specific tune.\n3.  **Identification**: Based on the unique melody and the underlying harmony, the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\".\n4.  **Composer**: This piece was famously composed by the pianist and composer Horace Silver.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this finding.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
