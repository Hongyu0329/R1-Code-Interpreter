    # Reasoning for the choice:
    # 1. The company's goal is to improve sales results using a structured sales process.
    # 2. The process involves creating knowledge assets from both data and human expertise.
    # 3. DIKW Model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom): This model is ideal for
    #    processing sales data into assets like 'VA Sales List' and 'VA Sales Script'.
    #    It helps transform raw data from the sales funnel into actionable knowledge.
    # 4. SECI Model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization): This model
    #    is perfect for capturing the tacit knowledge (skills, experience) of successful
    #    employees and converting it into explicit knowledge, such as 'VA Interview' guides
    #    and 'Work Manual/Template'.
    # 5. Bloom's Taxonomy: This is a model for individual learning and educational objectives,
    #    not a primary model for building an organizational KM system.
    # 6. Conclusion: A combination of DIKW and SECI is the most comprehensive solution
    #    as it addresses both the data-driven and human-expertise aspects of the sales process.
