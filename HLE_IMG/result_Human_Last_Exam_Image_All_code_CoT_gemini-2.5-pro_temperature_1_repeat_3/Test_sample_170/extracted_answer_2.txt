--- Calculation Results ---
Optimal reactive power injection from STATCOM (Q_opt):
Q_opt = 0.295 pu = 29.50 MVAR

System real power losses (including harmonic effects):
P_loss = 1.200 pu = 120.01 MW

--- Final Answer Equations ---
The optimal reactive power injection required is 29.50 MVAR.
Final Equation for Q_opt: Q_opt = Q_inj_final - Q_inj_initial = -1.510 - (-1.805) = 0.295 pu
The final system real power loss is 120.01 MW.
Final Equation for P_loss: |I|^2 * R * Factor = 57.697 * 0.02 * 1.04 = 1.200 pu
