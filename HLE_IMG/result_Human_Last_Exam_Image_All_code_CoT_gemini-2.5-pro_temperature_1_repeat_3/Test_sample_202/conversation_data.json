    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, vesicular texture, which is characteristic of scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of numerous, varied, rounded-to-sub-rounded rock fragments cemented together. This texture is known as clastic and is typical of conglomerate, a sedimentary rock.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular, and low-density rock. Its frothy appearance is the key identifier for pumice, an extrusive igneous rock that cooled very rapidly.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates slow cooling deep underground. The presence of light-colored minerals (likely quartz and feldspar) and some dark minerals suggests it is granite, an intrusive igneous rock.\n\nI will now write a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Conglomerate',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Granite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Conglomerate, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
