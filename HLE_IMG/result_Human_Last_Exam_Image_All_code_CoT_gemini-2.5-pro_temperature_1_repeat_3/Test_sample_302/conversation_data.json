    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the code to display the result.\n\n### Analysis of the Seal Characters\n\nThe characters on the seal are written in an ancient Chinese script style known as Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū). Seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left. Based on this, the characters are identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character:** This is **長** (cháng), which means \"long\" or \"everlasting\".\n2.  **Top-Left Character:** This is **樂** (lè), which means \"joy\" or \"happiness\".\n3.  **Bottom-Right Character:** This is **無** (wú), which means \"without\" or \"no\".\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character:** This is **極** (jí), which means \"limit\" or \"end\".\n\nWhen read together, the phrase is **長樂無極** (Cháng Lè Wú Jí). This is a common and auspicious idiom meaning \"Everlasting joy without limit\" or \"Boundless happiness.\"\n\nThe characters in simplified Chinese are **长乐无极**.\n\nHere is the Python code to print these simplified characters.\n\n```python\n# The four characters on the seal are identified as an ancient Chinese idiom.\n# The traditional characters are 長樂無極.\n# The simplified characters are 长乐无极.\n# This phrase means \"Everlasting joy without limit\".\n\nsimplified_chinese_characters = \"长乐无极\"\nprint(\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are:\")\nprint(simplified_chinese_characters)\n```\n<<<长乐无极>>>"
