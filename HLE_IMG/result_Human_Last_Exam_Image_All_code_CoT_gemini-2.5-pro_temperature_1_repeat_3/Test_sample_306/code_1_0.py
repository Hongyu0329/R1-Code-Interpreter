# Step 1: Define the relationship between plot number, n, and eccentricity.
# Based on visual analysis, we can rank the plots from most ordered (stable) to most chaotic.
# This order corresponds to increasing eccentricity 'e', and therefore increasing 'n' from 0 to 8.
# The ranking is as follows:
# n=0 -> Plot 3 (most ordered, large sphere)
# n=1 -> Plot 9 (smaller sphere)
# n=2 -> Plot 1 (stable cylinder)
# n=3 -> Plot 5 (smaller, distorted cube)
# n=4 -> Plot 2 (stable region breaking up)
# n=5 -> Plot 8 (complex layered structures)
# n=6 -> Plot 7 (more fragmented structures)
# n=7 -> Plot 4 (highly chaotic patterns)
# n=8 -> Plot 6 (most chaotic, 'dust cloud')

# This gives the mapping from n to plot number, and the sorted list of plot numbers.

    3: 0, 9: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 2: 4, 8: 5, 7: 6, 4: 7, 6: 8
}
sorted_plot_numbers = [3, 9, 1, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6]

# Step 2: Calculate and print the eccentricity for each plot.
