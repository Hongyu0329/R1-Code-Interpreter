    "My analysis of the image suggests that it is a 19th-century Romantic painting. The prominent features are a windmill, a stormy sky, and a fire in the background. Based on these visual cues, I have identified the painting.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the title of the artwork.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the title of the identified painting.\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_title = \"The Mill in the Suburbs of St. Petersburg\"\n    print(f\"The title of the painting is: {painting_title}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<The Mill in the Suburbs of St. Petersburg>>>"
