# The user wants me to identify the bird from the options that matches the target.
#
# 1. Analyze the distinctive features of the target bird.
#    - The primary feature is the scalloped pattern on the back and wings.
#    - The coloration is a cool-toned, greyish-brown.
#    - The posture shows the bird's head turned to its right.
#    - The edges of the wing feathers are crisply defined with a light color.
#
# 2. Compare these features with each of the provided options (A-I).
#    - A: Head turned wrong way.
#    - B: Color is too light/sandy.
#    - C: Posture, coloration, and feather pattern are an excellent match. The specific arrangement of the scallops on the mantle and the crisp edges of the wing feathers are identical.
#    - D: Color is too warm/brown.
#    - E: Pattern seems less distinct.
#    - F: Too dark to compare accurately.
#    - G: Pattern is slightly different, looks "fluffier".
#    - H: Color is much too brown/warm.
#    - I: Lighting is too bright, washing out the base color.
#
# 3. Conclude that image C is the correct match.
