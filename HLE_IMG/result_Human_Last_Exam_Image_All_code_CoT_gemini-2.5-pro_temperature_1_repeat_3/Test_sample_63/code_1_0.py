The CH3 groups (6H) are split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2 groups. The CH2 groups (4H) are split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3 groups. This corresponds to a diethylamino group, -N(C2H5)2.")

    print("- The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) indicates a methyl group (-CH3) with no adjacent protons, likely attached to the aromatic ring.")
