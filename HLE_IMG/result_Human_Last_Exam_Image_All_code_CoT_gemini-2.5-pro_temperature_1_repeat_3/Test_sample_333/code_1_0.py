def solve_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the airfoil matching puzzle.
    The logic is as follows:
    1. Airfoils are categorized by thickness (Thin: A,B,C,D; Thick: E,F,G,H) and camber.
    2. Pressure plots are categorized by lift (area between curves) and the shape of the suction peak (sharp for thin, rounded for thick).
    3. Matching is done by pairing airfoils with pressure plots that have corresponding lift and thickness characteristics.

    - A (Thin, Med-High Camber) -> 3 (High lift for thin)
    - B (Thin, Med Camber)      -> 5 (Med lift for thin)
    - C (Thin, Symmetrical)     -> 1 (Lowest positive lift)
    - D (Thin, Negative Camber) -> 8 (Small negative lift)
    - E (Thick, High Camber)    -> 6 (Highest lift)
    - F (Thick, Med Camber)     -> 7 (High lift)
    - G (Thick, Symmetrical)    -> 2 (Low positive lift for thick)
    - H (Thick, Negative Camber)-> 4 (Highest negative lift)

    The final sequence is formed by the plot numbers corresponding to airfoils A through H.
