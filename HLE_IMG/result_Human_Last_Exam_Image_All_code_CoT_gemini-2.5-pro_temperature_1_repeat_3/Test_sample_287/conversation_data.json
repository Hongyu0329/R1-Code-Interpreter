    "This is a knowledge-based task. I will identify the city by recognizing the landmarks in the image. The building with the wavy, curved facade on the left is a distinctive landmark. A reverse image search or knowledge of modern architecture identifies this as the GT Tower East in Seoul, South Korea. The surrounding buildings are also consistent with the skyline of the Gangnam district in Seoul. Therefore, the image was taken in Seoul.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city in the image.\n    The image features several skyscrapers, including the distinctive GT Tower East.\n    This building is a well-known landmark in Seoul, South Korea.\n    \"\"\"\n    city = \"Seoul\"\n    print(city)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"
