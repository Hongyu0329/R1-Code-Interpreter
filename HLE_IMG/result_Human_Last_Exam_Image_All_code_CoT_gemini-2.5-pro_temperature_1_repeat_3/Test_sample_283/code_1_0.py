1. The graph displays Google Trends data for three search terms (represented by red, yellow, and blue lines) from 2019 to 2023.
2. Each line shows distinct and recurring annual peaks, which strongly indicates that the search terms are annual events, such as national holidays or commemorations.
3. Analyzing the timing of the major peaks for each color reveals a specific pattern:
   - Red Line: A major peak every year in late January / early February. This timing corresponds precisely with the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival).
   - Yellow Line: A massive peak every year around October 1st. This corresponds to the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The smaller peak in June aligns with the Dragon Boat Festival.
   - Blue Line: A consistent peak every year in early April. This corresponds to the Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day).
4. The combination of these specific, culturally and historically significant events is unique to one country. The alignment is too perfect to be a coincidence.

Conclusion: The events tracked are major Chinese holidays.
