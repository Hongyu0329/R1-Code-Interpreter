    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the country from the Google Trends graph:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:** I first observed the key features of the chart. The x-axis represents time from late 2019 to mid-2023. The y-axis shows relative search interest. There are three data series (red, yellow, blue), each with distinct, recurring annual peaks. This pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, most likely national holidays or commemorations.\n\n2.  **Identify Peak Timings:** I carefully examined the timing of the major peaks for each color:\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows a very strong peak every year around late January or early February.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Has two distinct annual peaks. A smaller one around June, and a very large one (often hitting the maximum '100' value) around the beginning of October.\n    *   **Blue Line:** Displays smaller but consistent peaks around early April and another smaller one around mid-to-late May.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I began to hypothesize which country's national holidays would match this specific annual pattern. I considered several countries but found the best match with China.\n    *   The **red peak** in Jan/Feb aligns perfectly with **Chinese New Year (Spring Festival)**, China's most important traditional festival.\n    *   The largest **yellow peak** in early October is a clear match for the **National Day of the People's Republic of China** (October 1st), which kicks off a week-long holiday known as \"Golden Week.\" The smaller yellow peak in June corresponds with the **Dragon Boat Festival**.\n    *   The **blue peak** in early April corresponds to the **Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day)**, a traditional day for honoring ancestors.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Hypothesis:** The timing of these three major, historically significant events in China—Chinese New Year (Red), National Day (Yellow), and Qingming Festival (Blue)—provides a perfect match for the dominant peaks in the graph. The relative search interest also makes sense: National Day and Chinese New Year are massive, week-long events generating huge search traffic, while Qingming is also a significant public holiday. This combination of events is unique to China.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** To adhere to the instructions, I will encapsulate this reasoning into a Python script that prints the analysis and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    reasoning = \"\"\"\n1. The graph displays Google Trends data for three search terms (represented by red, yellow, and blue lines) from 2019 to 2023.\n2. Each line shows distinct and recurring annual peaks, which strongly indicates that the search terms are annual events, such as national holidays or commemorations.\n3. Analyzing the timing of the major peaks for each color reveals a specific pattern:\n   - Red Line: A major peak every year in late January / early February. This timing corresponds precisely with the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival).\n   - Yellow Line: A massive peak every year around October 1st. This corresponds to the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The smaller peak in June aligns with the Dragon Boat Festival.\n   - Blue Line: A consistent peak every year in early April. This corresponds to the Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day).\n4. The combination of these specific, culturally and historically significant events is unique to one country. The alignment is too perfect to be a coincidence.\n\nConclusion: The events tracked are major Chinese holidays.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    country = \"China\"\n    \n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(reasoning)\n    print(\"Therefore, the country is:\")\n    print(country)\n\nsolve_country_mystery()\n```\n<<<China>>>"
