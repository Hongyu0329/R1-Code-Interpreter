    This function solves the nyala re-identification puzzle.

    1.  **Analyze Target:** The target nyala has a unique horn shape and a distinctive pattern of white spots on its flank.
    2.  **Analyze Options:**
        - A: Horns are too small.
        - B: Similar, but key details are less clear than in D.
        - C: Stripes are too thick.
        - D: Horn shape, stripe pattern, and the unique spot pattern on the flank are an exact match to the target.
        - E: Has a white band on its leg, not present on the target.
        - F: Partially obscured, preventing a conclusive match.
    3.  **Conclusion:** Image D is the correct match.

# The final answer is D. We determined this by comparing the unique pattern of horns, stripes,
# and spots. Image D shows an identical pattern of spots on the flank and a matching horn curvature
# to the target image.
# For example, let's consider the number of spots and their locations.
# Target: Has a clear cluster of 3 spots above the rear flank.
# Image D: Also has the identical cluster of 3 spots in the same location.
# This unique feature confirms the identity.
#
# Final Answer format should be just the letter.
