    "Based on my analysis of the raster plot, I will perform the following steps to calculate the average inter-burst interval:\n\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the graph to identify the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are visible as dense vertical bands of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** I will estimate the center timestamp for each identified burst based on the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of bursts.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will calculate the mean of all the IBIs.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final result will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n\nHere are the estimated timestamps for the major bursts:\n*   Burst 1: ~4 s\n*   Burst 2: ~17 s\n*   Burst 3: ~36 s\n*   Burst 4: ~48 s\n\nNow, I will use Python to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the estimated timestamps of synchronized bursts in seconds.\n    burst_timestamps = [4, 17, 36, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals.\n    # An IBI is the difference between consecutive burst times.\n    inter_burst_intervals = []\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n        inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n\n    print(f\"Calculated Inter-Burst Intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average IBI.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Display the equation used for the average calculation\n    intervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(f\"Average IBI calculation: ({intervals_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n    print(f\"Result before rounding: {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Format the final result to two significant figures.\n    # Using the 'g' format specifier handles significant figures correctly.\n    average_ibi_formatted = '{:.2g}'.format(average_ibi)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {average_ibi_formatted} s (rounded to two significant figures).\")\n    \n    return average_ibi_formatted\n\n# Run the calculation and print the final answer in the specified format.\nfinal_answer = calculate_ibi()\n# The final answer is commented out to avoid execution in the user's environment,\n# but it shows the value that should be extracted.\n# print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<15>>>"
