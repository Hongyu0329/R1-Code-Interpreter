# The user wants to know the city where the provided image was taken in 2022.
#
# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the visual clues in the image:
#    - The scenery with evergreen trees and a large body of water is typical of the Pacific Northwest.
#    - A small bonfire is visible on the beach, which is only allowed in specific, designated parks.
#    - A chain-link fence is in the foreground, suggesting the photo was taken from an overlook or a fenced-off area.
# 2. Perform a reverse image search to find similar images and potential locations.
# 3. The search results point strongly to Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington.
# 4. Verify this by comparing features:
#    - Golden Gardens Park is on Puget Sound in Seattle.
#    - Beach fires are famously permitted in designated fire pits at this park.
#    - The park has overlooks with fences that match the one in the photo, looking down onto the beach.
# 5. Conclude that the city is Seattle.
# 6. Create a Python script to print the name of the city.
