    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will follow the reaction scheme step by step, calculating the change in the molecular formula at each stage.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the formula of the starting material:** We will count the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms in the initial bicyclic lactam. The starting molecule has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core, a trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group, a carbonyl (C=O) group, and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen atom.\n    *   Starting Material Formula: C₁₆H₁₆F₃NO₂\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction (PMB deprotection):** The reagent CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is used for the oxidative deprotection of the PMB group. This reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and replaces it with a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. We will adjust the atomic count accordingly to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    *   Change: -C₈H₉O + H = Net loss of C₈H₈O\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction (Hydrogenation):** The reagents Pd/C and H₂ are used for catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the ring, adding two hydrogen atoms. We will update the formula to get Intermediate 2.\n    *   Change: +H₂\n4.  **Analyze the third reaction (Lactam hydrolysis):** The reagent 4N HCl at 70°C hydrolyzes the lactam (the cyclic amide). This reaction involves the addition of one water molecule (H₂O) across the amide bond, breaking the ring and forming a carboxylic acid and an amine. We will perform this final calculation to get the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   Change: +H₂O\n5.  **Final Formula:** Summing up all the changes will give us the molecular formula of the final product.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the molecular formula of the product\n    by tracking the changes in atomic composition through the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the composition of the starting material.\n    # Starting Material Formula: C16H16F3NO2\n    atoms = {'C': 16, 'H': 16, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - PMB (C8H9O) deprotection with CAN.\n    # A hydrogen atom replaces the PMB group on the nitrogen.\n    # Net change: Lose C8H8O.\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 9\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    atoms['H'] += 1 # Add H to Nitrogen\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation of the C=C double bond.\n    # Adds two hydrogen atoms.\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide).\n    # Adds one molecule of water (H2O).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n\n    # Print the final counts for each element\n    print(\"The final product is composed of:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C) atoms: {atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H) atoms: {atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F) atoms: {atoms['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N) atoms: {atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O) atoms: {atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Format the final molecular formula string\n    final_formula = f\"C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe molecular formula of the product is: {final_formula}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C8H12F3NO2>>>"
