    This function calculates and prints the minimum number of steps for the chemical synthesis.
    
    Based on the analysis of the synthesis of dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene from the given precursors,
    a 4-step synthetic route is proposed as the most efficient pathway:
    1. Oxidation of 2-acetylnaphthalene to naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid.
    2. C-H activation/acylation of 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene with the carboxylic acid.
    3. McMurry coupling of the resulting ketone to form a tetrasubstituted ethene precursor.
    4. Scholl reaction (oxidative cyclization) to form the final product.
    
    Therefore, the minimum number of steps is 4.
