    # 1) The provided Hebrew verse uses וְלֹא, which is the ketiv (written) form. The qere (read) form is וְלוֹ.
    answer_1 = "k"

    # 2) The alternative variant is the qere.
    answer_2 = "וְלוֹ"

    # 3) Saadia Gaon's translation in the image for verse 16 reads "לא ואחד זאיד פיהא ולא נאקץ".
    # The negative particle "לא" (lā) translates the ketiv's negative "לֹא" (lō).
    answer_3 = "k"

    # 4) The decisive word in Saadia's phrase is the negative particle.
    answer_4 = "לא"

    # 5) Research on the Karaite commentator Yefet ben Eli shows he translates the ketiv
    # but also explicitly discusses the qere in his commentary. Therefore, he uses both.
    answer_5 = "b"

    # 6) In Yefet's Arabic translation, he renders the phrase with the negative particle "לא" (lā),
    # making it the decisive word for showing his reliance on the ketiv for the translation itself.
    answer_6 = "לא"

    # 7) According to the catalog of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, manuscript Hébreu 291
    # contains Psalms commentary for chapters 10-72 and 120-150. The first section is ps.010-072.
    answer_7 = "ps.010-072"

    # 8) The provided Aramaic Targum uses the phrase "ולית...ביניהון". The word "ולית" (wə-lēt)
    # is Aramaic for "and there is not," reflecting the ketiv's negative "לֹא".
    answer_8 = "k"

    # 9) The most decisive word in the Targum is the negative term "ולית".
    answer_9 = "ולית"
