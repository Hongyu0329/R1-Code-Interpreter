    "My plan is to analyze the sequence of images labeled L, M, and N to identify the biological process they depict. The images appear to show a time-lapse of a filamentous structure under a microscope.\n\n1.  **Image L:** This panel shows a straight, segmented filament, which appears to be a fungal hypha or a similar filamentous cell structure. A black arrowhead points to a septum (a cross-wall dividing cells in a filament).\n2.  **Image M:** This panel shows a later point in time. A bulge or swelling has formed on the side of the filament, near the septum that was indicated in panel L. The arrowhead now points to this new bulge.\n3.  **Image N:** This is the latest time point. The bulge seen in panel M has elongated and started to grow outwards, forming a new filament or branch. The arrowhead points to the base of this new branch.\n\nBased on this sequence, the images are showing the formation of a lateral branch from an existing filament. This process is a common mode of growth in filamentous organisms like fungi, allowing them to create a complex network (mycelium). Therefore, the process depicted is **hyphal branching**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the described image sequence and identifies the biological process.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"hyphal branching\"\n  description = \"The image sequence (L, M, N) shows the formation of a lateral branch from a filamentous cell. Panel L shows the initial state, panel M shows a bulge forming, and panel N shows the bulge elongating into a new branch. This process is known as hyphal branching.\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n  print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n  print(description)\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new branch from an existing fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
