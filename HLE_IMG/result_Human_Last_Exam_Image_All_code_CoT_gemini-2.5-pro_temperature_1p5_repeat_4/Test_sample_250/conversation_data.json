    "My plan is to identify the provided jazz standard by analyzing its musical characteristics, specifically the chord progression and melody. The first few bars contain a very distinctive descending chromatic chord pattern which is a hallmark of a famous tune. I will identify the tune and its composer based on this analysis and then present the information using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_music_piece():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a musical piece based on its known characteristics.\n    The provided sheet music is in the key of F minor.\n    The chord progression in the first four measures is:\n    F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |\n    This progression, especially the descending bass line (F, E, Eb, Db),\n    is the defining feature of the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n\n    print(\"Identification Results:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------\")\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------\")\n\nidentify_music_piece()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
