    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as color, texture, and the presence of crystals or fragments.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish and has a very porous, bubble-filled (vesicular) texture. This is characteristic of **Scoria**, a type of volcanic rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This clastic texture is typical of a **Volcanic Breccia** or a coarse **Tuff**, which are formed from consolidated volcanic debris.\n*   **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and extremely porous, with a frothy, glass-like appearance. Its high vesicularity suggests it was formed from a gas-charged, viscous lava. This is a classic example of **Pumice**.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly, deep underground. This type of very coarse-grained igneous rock is known as a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia / Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {rock_name}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<\nSpecimen H: Scoria\nSpecimen I: Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\nSpecimen J: Pumice\nSpecimen K: Pegmatite\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
