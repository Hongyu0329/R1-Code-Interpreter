# The user wants to identify the bird from the options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)
# that matches the target image.

# Step 1: Analyze the target image for distinctive features.
# - The target bird has a prominent scalloped (fish-scale like) pattern on its back.
# - The color is a greyish-brown.
# - There's a specific subtle irregularity/dark spot on the upper right side of its back.
# - The light creates strong white edges on the long wing feathers on its left wing (right side of the image).

# Step 2: Compare these features with each of the options.
# - Image A has a different posture and the pattern seems less defined.
# - Image B has a much lighter, sandier coloration.
# - Image D is at a different angle, and the pattern looks coarser.
# - Images E, F, G, H, I show birds with patterns or colorations that differ in subtle but important ways. For instance, the pattern in G is similar but doesn't have the specific irregularity, and H is much warmer in color.
# - Image C shows a bird in a nearly identical pose and lighting condition. The scalloped pattern is a perfect match. Most importantly, the unique small dark spot on the upper back is present in the same location.

# Step 3: Conclude the match.
# Based on the identical feather pattern and the presence of the unique identifying mark, image C is the correct match.

# Final answer is the letter 'C'.
