    "My plan is to analyze the provided ECG based on the key characteristics: Rhythm, Heart Rate, QRS duration, and QRS morphology. I will walk through these steps to arrive at the most likely diagnosis from the given options.\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: I will examine the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). If they are constant, the rhythm is regular. If they vary, it's irregular.\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation**: I will estimate the ventricular rate. A fast rate (>100 bpm) indicates tachycardia.\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: I will check the duration of the QRS complexes. A duration greater than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares on the ECG paper) is considered wide. I will also observe if the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes is consistent or if it changes from beat to beat.\n4.  **P-wave Analysis**: I will look for P waves preceding each QRS complex to determine if the rhythm originates from the atria in an organized fashion.\n5.  **Synthesize Findings**: I will combine these findings to evaluate the given answer choices and select the one that best fits the ECG pattern.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis will be presented in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    rhythm_analysis = \"The R-R intervals are not constant; they vary significantly from beat to beat.
