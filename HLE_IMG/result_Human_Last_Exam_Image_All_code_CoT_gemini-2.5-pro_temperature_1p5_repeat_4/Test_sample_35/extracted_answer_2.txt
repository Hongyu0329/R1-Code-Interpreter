The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). It can be used as a prognostic marker because its downstream pathway leads to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Thus, its concentration levels can be correlated with the severity and progression of neurological disorders, offering predictive information about the disease's course rather than solely being used as an adjunct marker for diagnosis.
