    Analyzes the provided options to find the most cost-effective solution for improving video processing recommendations.

    The core problem identified in the HMM is a severe class imbalance, where audio processing
    functions and sequences are heavily favored over video processing ones. This leads to
    poor recommendation accuracy for the underrepresented video functions.

    Let's evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each option:
    A. Add more training data for video processing: Effective, but collecting and labeling new data is often expensive and time-consuming.
    B. Use resampling: This technique works on the existing dataset to balance the class distribution (e.g., by oversampling video sequences). It is computationally cheap and requires no new data, making it very cost-effective.
    C. Train two separate models: This doubles the engineering and maintenance effort (training, deployment, etc.), making it a high-cost solution.
    D. Add specific states (model redesign): This requires significant architectural changes and re-training, which is more costly and complex than a simple data preprocessing step like resampling.
    E. Use a more complex model (LLM): Switching to a much larger model paradigm is extremely expensive in terms of data requirements, computation, and engineering effort.

    Conclusion: Resampling is the most cost-effective method as it directly tackles the data imbalance issue with minimal resource investment.
