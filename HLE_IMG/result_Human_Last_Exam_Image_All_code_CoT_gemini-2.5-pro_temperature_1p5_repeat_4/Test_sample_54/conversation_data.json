    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2 with reagent A):**\n    *   I look at the structure of the starting material, compound **1**. It is a planar, polycyclic aromatic cation. It features a central six-membered ring containing two C-O bonds, making it a pyrylium-like cation. This type of structure is known to be a strong electrophile.\n    *   I then examine the structure of the product, compound **2**. It is very similar to **1**, but one of the oxygen atoms in the central ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom is bonded to an amino group (-NH2), and it carries the positive charge (`-N+-NH2`).\n    *   This transformation, replacing a ring oxygen atom in a pyrylium salt with an N-amino group, is a characteristic reaction. The reagent needed to provide the `N-NH2` fragment is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). The hydrazine molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacks the ring, and after a ring-opening/ring-closing sequence, forms the N-amino pyridinium salt derivative **2**.\n    *   Therefore, I conclude that **Reagent A is hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3 with reagent B):**\n    *   I start with compound **2**, the N-amino pyridinium salt derivative formed in the first step.\n    *   I inspect the final product, compound **3**. This is a larger, more complex structure identified as a dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate. I notice two major changes from compound **2**:\n        1.  The second ring oxygen atom from the original structure has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n        2.  The N-amino group (`-N+-NH2`) from compound **2** has been converted into an imino group (`-NH-`).\n    *   My primary task is to identify reagent B. The most significant clue is the introduction of a new group: the N-propyl group. This means that reagent B must be the source of both a nitrogen atom and a propyl group. The simplest and most common chemical reagent that fits this description is **n-propylamine** (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).\n    *   The reaction mechanism would involve the n-propylamine acting as a nucleophile, attacking the remaining pyrylium-like part of compound **2**. This would lead to another ring-opening/ring-closing sequence, ultimately replacing the oxygen atom with the N-propyl group and forming the final quinacridinium skeleton.\n    *   The second change (from `-N+-NH2` to `-NH-`) is a deamination or reduction. While the exact mechanism might be complex and depend on reaction conditions like heat, it does not change the identity of the primary reagent needed to build the main skeleton of compound **3**. The essential reagent for introducing the N-propyl fragment is n-propylamine.\n    *   Therefore, I conclude that **Reagent B is n-propylamine**.\n\n3.  **Formulate the final answer:**\n    *   I have identified both reagents. Reagent A is hydrazine, and Reagent B is n-propylamine.\n    *   The user requests the answer as Python code that prints the result. I will create a simple Python script to state these findings clearly.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n\n    The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1.  Compound 1 reacts with Reagent A to form Compound 2.\n    2.  Compound 2 reacts with Reagent B to form Compound 3.\n\n    Analysis of Step 1 (1 -> 2):\n    - The transformation involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom (O) in a pyrylium-like cation with an N-amino group (-N+-NH2).\n    - This is a standard reaction with hydrazine (H2N-NH2).\n    - Therefore, Reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n    Analysis of Step 2 (2 -> 3):\n    - This transformation involves two changes:\n        a) A second ring oxygen atom is replaced by an N-propyl group.\n        b) The N-amino group (-N+-NH2) is converted to an imino group (-NH-).\n    - The introduction of the N-propyl group indicates that Reagent B must be propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n    - Therefore, Reagent B is n-propylamine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis leads to the following reagents:\")\n    print(\"=====================================================\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is required to convert compound 1 to 2.
