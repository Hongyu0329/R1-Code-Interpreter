    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.

    The reaction proceeds in two steps:
    1.  Compound 1 reacts with Reagent A to form Compound 2.
    2.  Compound 2 reacts with Reagent B to form Compound 3.

    Analysis of Step 1 (1 -> 2):
    - The transformation involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom (O) in a pyrylium-like cation with an N-amino group (-N+-NH2).
    - This is a standard reaction with hydrazine (H2N-NH2).
    - Therefore, Reagent A is hydrazine.

    Analysis of Step 2 (2 -> 3):
    - This transformation involves two changes:
        a) A second ring oxygen atom is replaced by an N-propyl group.
        b) The N-amino group (-N+-NH2) is converted to an imino group (-NH-).
    - The introduction of the N-propyl group indicates that Reagent B must be propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).
    - Therefore, Reagent B is n-propylamine.
