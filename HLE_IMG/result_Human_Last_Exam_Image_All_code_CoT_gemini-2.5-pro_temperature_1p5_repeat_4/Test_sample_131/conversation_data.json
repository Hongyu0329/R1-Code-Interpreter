    "My plan is to identify the provided chemical structure. This molecule is a tetracyclic alkaloid, meaning it has four rings and contains nitrogen atoms. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) within one of the rings is a key feature. I will use my knowledge of natural products chemistry to identify the specific name of this compound based on its unique ring system and stereochemistry. After identifying the name, I will write a simple Python script to print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the alkaloid\n    represented by the provided chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical structure provided is that of Matrine.\n    # Matrine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid found in plants\n    # from the genus Sophora.\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of this alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
