    print("Step 1: Understand the factors affecting LEC stability.")
    print("The operational stability of an LEC is largely influenced by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter complex.")
    print("Key molecular design strategies to improve stability include:")
    print("  - Steric Hindrance: Introducing bulky groups on the ligands to shield the central metal atom and reactive sites from degradation pathways.")
    print("  - Electrochemical Tuning: Using electron-withdrawing or -donating groups to strengthen bonds and improve resistance to irreversible oxidation or reduction.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze each complex based on these principles.")
    print("  - Complex 1: [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ is a standard, baseline emitter. Its ligands (ppy and bpy) are relatively small and do not offer significant steric protection. This makes it susceptible to degradation, leading to lower device stability.")
    print("  - Complex 2: This complex replaces the simple 'bpy' ligand with a much larger, rigid, and sterically demanding ligand. The bulky phenyl and tolyl groups provide significant steric hindrance, protecting the complex from intermolecular reactions. This design is expected to increase stability compared to Complex 1.")
    print("  - Complex 3: This complex employs two powerful strategies for enhancing stability. Firstly, it uses 'dtbbpy' as a ligand, which has very bulky tert-butyl groups that provide excellent steric protection. Secondly, it uses fluorinated 'dfppy' ligands. The electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms increase the complex's resistance to oxidative degradation.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclude the comparison.")
    print("Both Complex 2 and Complex 3 incorporate well-established design principles (primarily steric hindrance) to improve stability over the baseline Complex 1.")
    print("Therefore, LECs based on both Complex 2 and Complex 3 are expected to be more stable than those based on Complex 1.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most accurate answer is that LECs based on complex 2 and 3 are more stable.")
