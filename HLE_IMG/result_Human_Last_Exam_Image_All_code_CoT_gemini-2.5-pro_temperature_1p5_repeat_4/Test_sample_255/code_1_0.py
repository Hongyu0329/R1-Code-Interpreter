    1.  The image shows a woman holding a large, overflowing arrangement of items.
    2.  The items include fruits (like a pomegranate or orange) and flowers (a prominent red one and others).
    3.  The shape of the container holding these items is horn-like and overflowing, which is characteristic of a cornucopia.
    4.  Comparing with the choices:
        A. red roses - Incomplete.
        B. fruit and flowers - Correct but less specific.
        C. a cornucopia of fruit and flowers - Most accurate and descriptive.
        D. a teardrop - Only a small part of the whole arrangement.
        E. a moth under glass - Incorrect, the moth is on her face.
    5.  Therefore, the best answer is C.
