# Step 1: Determine the index for pair A.
# The left insect is a female cuckoo bee (pointed abdomen).
# The right insect is a male cuckoo bee (spined abdomen tip).
# This corresponds to (F, M), which is option 4.
index_A = 4

# Step 2: Determine the index for pair B.
# The left insect is a male paper wasp (curled antennae).
# The right insect is a female paper wasp (straight antennae).
# This corresponds to (M, F), which is option 3.
index_B = 3

# Step 3: Determine the index for pair C.
# The left insect is a male long-horned bee (long antennae, yellow face).
# The right insect is a female long-horned bee (short antennae, collecting pollen).
# This corresponds to (M, F), which is option 3.
index_C = 3

# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.
