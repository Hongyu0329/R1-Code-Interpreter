    "Based on the morphological characteristics of the insects shown, we can determine their sexes.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is characteristic of a female cuckoo bee (genus *Coelioxys*). She uses this to pierce the nest cell walls of her host bee. The insect on the right has a distinctly different abdomen tip with multiple spines, which is characteristic of a male of this genus. Therefore, pair A is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The insect on the left has antennae with curled tips, a common feature of male wasps. The insect on the right has straight antennae, characteristic of a female. Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The insect on the left displays very long antennae and a yellow marking on its face (clypeus), both classic features of a male long-horned bee. The insect on the right has much shorter antennae and is covered in pollen, indicating it's a female collecting food for her offspring. Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\nCombining these results gives us the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the index for pair A.\n# The left insect is a female cuckoo bee (pointed abdomen).\n# The right insect is a male cuckoo bee (spined abdomen tip).\n# This corresponds to (F, M), which is option 4.\nindex_A = 4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the index for pair B.\n# The left insect is a male paper wasp (curled antennae).\n# The right insect is a female paper wasp (straight antennae).\n# This corresponds to (M, F), which is option 3.\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Determine the index for pair C.\n# The left insect is a male long-horned bee (long antennae, yellow face).\n# The right insect is a female long-horned bee (short antennae, collecting pollen).\n# This corresponds to (M, F), which is option 3.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
