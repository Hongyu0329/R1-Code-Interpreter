    "Based on the distinct pattern of bony plates, known as scutes, visible in the image, the animal can be identified. This mosaic-like armor is a characteristic feature of sturgeons. These ancient fish are known for the rows of these protective plates along their bodies and heads instead of scales.\n\nTherefore, the animal in the image is a sturgeon. The scientific name for the family to which sturgeons belong is Acipenseridae.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal_and_print_scientific_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    animal_present = True\n    common_name = \"Sturgeon\"\n    scientific_name = \"Acipenseridae\"\n\n    if animal_present:\n        print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in the image.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
