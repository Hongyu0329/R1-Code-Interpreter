    "I will first identify the venue shown in the image by analyzing its architectural features. Then, I will search for the event calendar of that venue for the specific date mentioned, October 12, 2023, to find the name of the performing musical artist. Finally, I will write a Python script to output the artist's name.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_artist_from_venue_and_date(venue, date):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function is a placeholder to demonstrate the search process.\n  In a real-world scenario, this would involve web scraping or using a dedicated API.\n  For this task, the information was found through a manual web search.\n\n  1.
