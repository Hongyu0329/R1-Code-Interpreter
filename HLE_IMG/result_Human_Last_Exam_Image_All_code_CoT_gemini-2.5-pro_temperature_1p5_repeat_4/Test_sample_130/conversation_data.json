    "This image displays the emission spectrum of Iron (Fe).\n\nMy reasoning for this identification is as follows:\n1.  **Complexity of the Spectrum:** The image shows an extremely dense and complex line spectrum, with thousands of individual emission lines spread across the entire visible range (from violet/blue to red).\n2.  **Comparison with Known Elements:** Simple elements like Hydrogen and Helium have very simple spectra with only a few prominent lines. Other common elements like Mercury or Neon have more lines, but nowhere near the density shown in the image. Transition metals, due to their complex electron shell configurations, produce very rich and dense spectra.\n3.  **Signature of Iron:** The specific pattern and high density of lines shown in the image is a classic, well-known \"fingerprint\" of the element Iron (Fe). It's often used as an example of a complex emission spectrum.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the identified element.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the element based on its characteristic emission spectrum.\n\n    The provided spectrum is very complex and dense with lines across the entire\n    visible range. This is a classic \"fingerprint\" for the element Iron (Fe).\n    \"\"\"\n    element_name = \"Iron\"\n    element_symbol = \"Fe\"\n    \n    print(f\"The element with these spectral lines is: {element_name} ({element_symbol})\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Iron>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
