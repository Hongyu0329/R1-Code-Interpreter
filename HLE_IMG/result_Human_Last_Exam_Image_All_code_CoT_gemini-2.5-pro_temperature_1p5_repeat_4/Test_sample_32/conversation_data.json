    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the **seta (stalk)**.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very short, **straight seta**. This causes the capsule to be held upright and emergent, nestled among the upper leaves.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name suggests (*curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk), has a distinctly **curved or hooked (arcuate) seta**. This makes the capsule hang or nod downwards.\n\nTherefore, the orientation of the capsule, determined by the straight versus curved seta, is the key distinguishing feature. The moss in the image, with its upright capsules on seemingly short, straight setae, is likely *Grimmia montana*.\n\n<<<The key difference is the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule upright. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or hooked, causing the capsule to nod or hang downwards.>>>"
