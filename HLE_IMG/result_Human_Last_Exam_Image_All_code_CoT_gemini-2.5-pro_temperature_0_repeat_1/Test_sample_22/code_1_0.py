def find_unknots():
    """
    Analyzes the provided image of six knots and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - K1 is the 6_1 knot (non-trivial).
    - K2 is a complex diagram that simplifies to the unknot. The first two "clasps" cancel each other out,
      and the remaining clasp is also trivial.
    - K3 is the 3_1 knot (trefoil, non-trivial).
    - K4 is the 4_1 knot (figure-eight, non-trivial).
    - K5 is a complex diagram that simplifies to the 4_1 knot (non-trivial).
    - K6 is the 5_1 knot (cinquefoil, non-trivial).

    Therefore, only the knot with index 2 is the unknot.
