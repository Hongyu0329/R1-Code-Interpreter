    print("   - For exothermic reactions, a low Lewis number (Le) is destabilizing (heat is trapped relative to reactant supply), leading to oscillations or chaos.")
    print("   - A high Lewis number is stabilizing (heat dissipates quickly), leading to damped behavior.")
    print("   - The question asks for the set of plots with the larger Le. This corresponds to the more stable, damped plots in each pair.")
