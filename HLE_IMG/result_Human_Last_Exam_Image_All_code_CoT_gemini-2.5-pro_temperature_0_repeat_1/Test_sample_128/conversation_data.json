    "This is a multi-component reaction, specifically a three-component condensation reaction. The reactants are 2-aminopyridine (a primary amine), o-phthalaldehyde (a dialdehyde), and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN, a source of cyanide). This type of reaction is known to produce substituted isoindoline or isoindole derivatives.\n\nHere is the step-by-step mechanism that is most consistent with the literature for this reaction class:\n1.  **Hemiaminal and Iminium Ion Formation:** The primary amine (2-aminopyridine) reacts with the two aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde. It first attacks one aldehyde, and the resulting amino-alcohol intermediate then cyclizes by attacking the second aldehyde group. This forms a 1-hydroxy-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline intermediate. This hemiaminal exists in equilibrium with a cyclic iminium ion by losing a hydroxide ion.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack by Cyanide:** The TMSCN, activated by KF/Water, provides a cyanide ion (CN⁻). This cyanide ion is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon (C1) of the iminium ion.\n3.  **Final Product:** This attack forms the final, stable product, which is a 1-cyano-substituted isoindoline.\n\nBased on this mechanism, Compound A is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile**.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molecular formula and weight of the product and displays the atom counts for the main species involved in the reaction, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define atomic weights for calculation\natomic_weights = {\n    'C': 12.011,\n    'H': 1.008,\n    'N': 14.007,\n    'O': 15.999,\n}\n\n# Define molecular formulas for the main reactants and the product\nreactants_dict = {\n    \"2-aminopyridine\": {'C': 5, 'H': 6, 'N': 2},\n    \"o-phthalaldehyde\": {'C': 8, 'H': 6, 'O': 2},\n}\nproduct_A_formula = {'C': 14, 'H': 11, 'N': 3}\n\n# Function to calculate molecular weight\ndef calculate_mw(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular weight from a dictionary of atom counts.\"\"\"\n    mw = 0\n    for atom, count in formula.items():\n        mw += atomic_weights.get(atom, 0) * count\n    return mw\n\n# Identify Compound A\nproduct_A_name = \"2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile\"\n\nprint(f\"The product of the reaction, Compound A, is identified as {product_A_name}.\")\n\n# Calculate and print formula and molecular weight of Compound A\nformula_str_A = f\"C{product_A_formula['C']}H{product_A_formula['H']}N{product_A_formula['N']}\"\nmw_A = calculate_mw(product_A_formula)\nprint(f\"Molecular Formula: {formula_str_A}\")\nprint(f\"Molecular Weight: {mw_A:.3f} g/mol\")\n\n# Print the reaction scheme and the atom counts (\"numbers\") for each species\nprint(\"\\nThe reaction scheme is:\")\nr1_formula = f\"C{reactants_dict['2-aminopyridine']['C']}H{reactants_dict['2-aminopyridine']['H']}N{reactants_dict['2-aminopyridine']['N']}\"\nr2_formula = f\"C{reactants_dict['o-phthalaldehyde']['C']}H{reactants_dict['o-phthalaldehyde']['H']}O{reactants_dict['o-phthalaldehyde']['O']}\"\nprint(f\"{r1_formula} (2-aminopyridine) + {r2_formula} (o-phthalaldehyde) + TMSCN  ->  {formula_str_A} (Compound A)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers (atom counts) for each element in the main chemical species are:\")\n\nprint(\"\\nReactant: 2-aminopyridine\")\nfor atom, count in reactants_dict[\"2-aminopyridine\"].items():\n    print(f\"  Number of {atom} atoms: {count}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nReactant: o-phthalaldehyde\")\nfor atom, count in reactants_dict[\"o-phthalaldehyde\"].items():\n    print(f\"  Number of {atom} atoms: {count}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nProduct: Compound A\")\nfor atom, count in product_A_formula.items():\n    print(f\"  Number of {atom} atoms: {count}\")\n```\n<<<2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile>>>"
