    "This is a detail from the predella of the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* (also known as the *Tabernacle of Peretola*). The artist is a famous Florentine sculptor from the Renaissance, known for his work in glazed terracotta.\n\nTo identify the author, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Analyze the style of the artwork, which is a glazed terracotta relief, a hallmark of a specific Florentine workshop.\n2.  Read the inscription at the bottom, which appears to be \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" (Sacrament of the Altar).\n3.  Combine these clues to search for the artwork and its creator. This search points directly to the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* from Peretola.\n4.  Art historical sources confirm the author of this masterpiece.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the author.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the author of the altarpiece detail.\n    The artwork is a glazed terracotta relief from the Tabernacle of the Sacrament,\n    a well-documented piece from the Italian Renaissance.\n    \"\"\"\n    author = \"Luca della Robbia\"\n    print(f\"The author of this detail of the Altarpiece is {author}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
