    "To solve this Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares, we only need to focus on the clue related to those squares.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Squares:** The question asks for the two numbers in the top-most horizontal row of white squares.\n2.  **Find the Relevant Clue:** To the left of this row, there is a clue number `17`. In Kakuro, this means the sum of the numbers in the white squares to its right must equal 17.\n3.  **Apply Kakuro Rules:** The rules state that all numbers in a single sum (a \"run\") must be unique digits from 1 to 9.\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** Let the two numbers be `x` and `y`. The clue gives us the equation `x + y = 17`.\n5.  **Solve for the Digits:** We need to find two unique digits (1-9) that add up to 17. The only possible combination is 8 and 9. For example, if we try 9, the other number must be `17 - 9 = 8`. If we try 7, the other number would be `17 - 7 = 10`, which is not a valid digit.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the two numbers in the top white squares must be 8 and 9.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this logic to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_kakuro_top_row():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the two numbers in the top row of the given Kakuro puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The clue for the top horizontal run of two squares is 17.\n    target_sum = 17\n\n    # Kakuro rules require unique digits from 1 to 9.\n    # We need to find two unique digits that sum to 17.\n    num1 = 0\n    num2 = 0\n    for i in range(1, 10):\n        for j in range(1, 10):\n            # Check for uniqueness and if they sum to the target\n            if i != j and i + j == target_sum:\n                num1 = i\n                num2 = j\n                break\n        if num1 != 0:\n            break\n\n    print(f\"The clue for the top two squares is {target_sum}.\")\n    print(\"We need to find two unique digits from 1 to 9 that add up to this sum.\")\n    print(f\"The only pair that works is {num1} and {num2}.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {num1} + {num2} = {target_sum}\")\n\nsolve_kakuro_top_row()\n```\n<<<8,9>>>"
