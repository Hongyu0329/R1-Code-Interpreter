    "This is a tricky one! The image shows a flag with horizontal stripes of black, white, and red.\n\nNo current country officially uses this flag. However, this was the flag of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918.\n\nIt's more likely that the image is an upside-down version of a current flag. The flag of Yemen consists of three horizontal stripes: red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom. If you flip the flag of Yemen upside down, you get the exact pattern seen in the image: black, white, and red.\n\nTherefore, the country is most likely Yemen.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the country based on a snippet of its flag.\n    \n    1.  The flag snippet shows horizontal stripes in the order: Black, White, Red.\n    2.  No current national flag has this configuration.\n    3.  The flag of Yemen has horizontal stripes in the order: Red, White, Black.\n    4.  If the flag of Yemen is displayed upside down, the order becomes Black, White, Red.\n    5.  This matches the image provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"Yemen\"\n    print(f\"The flag shown is an inverted version of the flag of {country}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Yemen>>>"
