    This function determines the parameter change for each of the six plots.
    
    My reasoning is as follows:
    1. Plot 5 shows the system decaying to a fixed point, which is characteristic of reducing the driving Rayleigh number (R) below the chaotic threshold. So, Plot 5 is 'r'.
    2. Plot 2 shows a much larger and denser attractor, indicating more intense chaos. This is caused by increasing the Rayleigh number. So, Plot 2 is 'R'.
    3. Plot 4 is highly symmetric, with the blue and orange attractors perfectly overlapping. This suggests a symmetric system, which is a natural choice for a baseline simulation where the asymmetry parameter mu = 1. So, Plot 4 is the reference '0'.
    4. With Plot 4 (mu=1) as the reference, Plot 1 shows the blue system is dominant. Increasing mu makes the blue system's equations more strongly forced, leading to this dominance. So, Plot 1 is 'M'.
    5. Conversely, Plot 3 shows the orange system is dominant. This happens when the blue system is weakened by decreasing mu. So, Plot 3 is 'm'.
    6. Plot 6 shows a simpler chaotic attractor with wider loops and lower frequency oscillations compared to the baseline (Plot 4). This is characteristic of slowing down the velocity dynamics by halving the Prandtl number (P). So, Plot 6 is 'p'.
    
    Combining these in order for plots 1 through 6 gives the final answer.
