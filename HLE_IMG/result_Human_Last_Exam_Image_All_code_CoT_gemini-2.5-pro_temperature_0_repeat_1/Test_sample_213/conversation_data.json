    "Based on my analysis of the provided sheet music, I have identified the opera. The key indicators were the German language annotations such as \"(Vorhang)\" (Curtain) and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute), the specific instrumentation featuring a prominent English Horn solo, and the overall late-Romantic harmonic style. These elements are characteristic of the opening of Act II of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the name of the opera.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n    The sheet music is the orchestral score for the beginning of Act II of an opera.\n    Analysis of the score reveals several clues:\n    1.  Language: The performance directions are in German (e.g., \"Vorhang\" for \"Curtain\",\n        \"mit Dämpfer\" for \"with mute\", \"die übrigen\" for \"the rest\").\n    2.  Instrumentation: The score calls for a large orchestra, including \"engl. Horn\"\n        (English Horn), which has a prominent solo melody at the beginning.\n    3.  Musical Context: The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the curtain rises at this point.\n        The prompt states this is the opening of the second act.\n\n    These clues strongly point to the prelude of Act II of Richard Wagner's famous opera.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Tristan und Isolde\"\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the opera: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve_music_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
