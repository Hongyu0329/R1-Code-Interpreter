def solve_music_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the name of the opera from the provided sheet music.

    The sheet music is the orchestral score for the beginning of Act II of an opera.
    Analysis of the score reveals several clues:
    1.  Language: The performance directions are in German (e.g., "Vorhang" for "Curtain",
        "mit Dämpfer" for "with mute", "die übrigen" for "the rest").
    2.  Instrumentation: The score calls for a large orchestra, including "engl. Horn"
        (English Horn), which has a prominent solo melody at the beginning.
    3.  Musical Context: The marking "1 (Vorhang)" indicates the curtain rises at this point.
        The prompt states this is the opening of the second act.

    These clues strongly point to the prelude of Act II of Richard Wagner's famous opera.
