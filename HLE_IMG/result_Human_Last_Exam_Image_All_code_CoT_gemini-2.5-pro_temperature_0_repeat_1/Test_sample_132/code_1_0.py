# The conversation path is determined to be START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# 1. Probability of transition from START to Appreciation, from the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# 2. Probability of transition from Appreciation to Solution.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from 'Appreciation' must be 1.
# P(Appreciation -> END) is 0.83.
# The rest must go to the missing 'Solution' state.
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83
