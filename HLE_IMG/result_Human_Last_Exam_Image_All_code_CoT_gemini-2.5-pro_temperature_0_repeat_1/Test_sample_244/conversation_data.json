    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I can identify its genus. The organism displays a growth pattern of a dark, thin, highly-branched, ribbon-like thallus that forms a dense mat on the tree bark. This specific morphology is characteristic of a type of thalloid liverwort. I will write a Python script to print the name of this genus.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species based on its visual characteristics.\n    The species in the image is a liverwort with a distinctive forked, ribbon-like\n    thallus that forms a mat on tree bark.
