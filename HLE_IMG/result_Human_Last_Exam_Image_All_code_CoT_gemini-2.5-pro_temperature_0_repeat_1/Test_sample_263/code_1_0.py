Step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Identify Key Factors for LEC Stability:** The operational stability of a Light-emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC) is critically dependent on the properties of the emitter complex. Two main factors are:
    a)  **Electrochemical Stability:** The resistance of the complex to irreversible degradation under electrical bias (oxidation and reduction).
    b)  **Morphological Stability:** The ability of the thin film to resist aggregation and crystallization, which can cause emission quenching and device failure.

2.  **Compare the Molecular Structures:**

    *   **Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)₂(bpy)]⁺):** This is a standard benchmark emitter. Its planar ligands (ppy and bpy) make it susceptible to aggregation (π-π stacking), which can limit device lifetime.

    *   **Complex 2 ([Ir(ppy)₂(dppz-derivative)]⁺):** This complex features a very large, extended, and planar ancillary ligand. Such structures are known to cause strong π-π stacking and aggregation. This leads to poor film morphology, emission quenching, and consequently, very poor device stability.

    *   **Complex 3 ([Ir(dfppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺):** This complex incorporates two key design features to enhance stability:
        i.  **Fluorination:** The ppy ligands are replaced with difluorophenylpyridine (dfppy). The electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms make the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation, a common failure mode. This improves electrochemical stability.
        ii. **Bulky Groups:** The bpy ligand is substituted with bulky tert-butyl groups (dtbbpy). These groups act as steric hindrances, preventing the complexes from packing closely together. This suppresses aggregation, improves morphological stability, and reduces quenching.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    Complex 3 is strategically designed to overcome the main instability issues. The fluorination enhances its electrochemical robustness, while the bulky tert-butyl groups ensure morphological stability. In contrast, Complex 1 is a standard baseline, and Complex 2 is expected to be highly unstable due to severe aggregation. Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.
