# Step 1: Assign plot indices based on physical analysis
# n0: Base case, appears as the "average" plot.
n0 = 1
# n1: Reduction in annulus pressure gradient ΔP_a. Assigned to plot 6.
n1 = 6
# n6: Reduction in viscosity ratio μ, leading to higher tube velocity and a very cold tube.
# The wiggles in plot 3 suggest instability, possibly from high velocity.
n6 = 3

# Step 2: Determine the velocity ratio
# Based on the problem's structure, we assume the given condition simplifies the velocity ratio.
# The presence of ln(4) in the condition suggests the ratio itself is ln(4).
v_ratio = math.log(4)

# Step 3: Calculate the final expression
# The expression is (n1/n6)^n0 * exp(v_a_max/v_t_max)
result = (n1 / n6)**n0 * math.exp(v_ratio)

# Print the equation with the determined values
