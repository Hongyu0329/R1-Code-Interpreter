    "This is a classic example of a reaction involving a Münchnone, which is a type of mesoionic compound. The overall transformation from the reactants to the final pyrrole product proceeds via a two-step sequence of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:** The first reactant is a 3-methyl-2-phenyl-1,3-oxazolium-5-olate, commonly known as a Münchnone. The resonance structures show that it can act as a 1,3-dipole (specifically, a cyclic azomethine ylide). The second reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which is an electron-deficient alkyne and a good dipolarophile.\n\n2.  **First Pericyclic Reaction:** The 1,3-dipolar nature of the Münchnone and the dipolarophilic nature of DMAD suggest a **[3+2] cycloaddition** reaction. This is a thermally allowed pericyclic reaction where the 3-atom pi-system of the dipole reacts with the 2-atom pi-system of the dipolarophile to form a five-membered ring. In this case, it results in an unstable bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Second Pericyclic Reaction and Byproduct Identification:** The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is not isolated. It readily undergoes a second pericyclic reaction to form the stable aromatic pyrrole ring. To figure out what happens, we can perform an atom count:\n    *   Reactants: Münchnone (C₁₀H₉NO₂) + DMAD (C₆H₆O₄) = **C₁₆H₁₅NO₆**\n    *   Product: Pyrrole derivative (C₁₅H₁₅NO₄)\n    *   The difference between reactants and product is **CO₂** (carbon dioxide).\n    This means the bicyclic intermediate loses a molecule of CO₂. The elimination of a small, stable molecule like CO₂ from a cyclic system in a concerted fashion is known as a **cheletropic extrusion** (or a retro-cycloaddition). This is the second pericyclic reaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction involves a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by a cheletropic extrusion, with carbon dioxide as the stoichiometric byproduct.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the pericyclic reactions and the byproduct for the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the identified reaction types and byproduct\n    reaction_1_name = \"[3+2] Cycloaddition\"\n    reaction_2_name = \"Cheletropic extrusion\"\n    byproduct = \"Carbon dioxide (CO2)\"\n\n    # Extract numbers for the \"output each number\" requirement\n    num_3 = 3\n    num_2_first = 2\n    num_2_second = 2\n\n    # Print the solution\n    print(\"The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n    print(f\"1.
