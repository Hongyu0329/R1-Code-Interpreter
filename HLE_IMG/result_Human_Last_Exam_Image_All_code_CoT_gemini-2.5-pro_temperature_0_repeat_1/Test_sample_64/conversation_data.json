    "Based on the visual evidence in the images, I will identify the biological process being shown.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  I will analyze the sequence of images labeled L, M, and N, which appear to show a time-lapse of a cellular event.\n2.  I will observe the changes in the cell's structure across the three panels, paying close attention to the area indicated by the black arrowheads.\n3.  In panel L, the cell appears turgid and structurally sound.\n4.  In panel M, a distinct bulge forms on the side of the cell wall, indicating high internal pressure causing deformation.\n5.  In panel N, the cell appears to have ruptured at the location of the bulge, leading to a loss of internal contents and a collapse of the cell structure.\n6.  This specific sequence of swelling and bursting due to excessive internal osmotic pressure in a walled cell is known as plasmoptysis.\n7.  I will then create a Python script to print the name of this process as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the described cellular process and identifies it.\n  The image sequence shows:\n  1. A normal, turgid cell (L).\n  2. The cell wall bulging outwards at a weak point (M).\n  3. The cell rupturing or bursting at that point (N).\n  This process, where a cell bursts due to excessive internal osmotic pressure,\n  is called plasmoptysis.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Plasmoptysis\"\n  print(f\"The process depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Plasmoptysis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
