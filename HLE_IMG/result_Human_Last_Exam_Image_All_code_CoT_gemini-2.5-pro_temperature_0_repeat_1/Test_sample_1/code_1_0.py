# --- Step 1: Identify Rate-Determining Step and Energetic Span ---
# According to the Energetic Span Model, the rate is governed by the highest
# transition state in the cycle, which dictates the rate-determining step.
# From the provided energy diagram:
# The highest energy transition state (TDTS) is TS-eli.
# The rate-determining step is the one involving TS-eli, which is the fluoride elimination (P5 -> P).

# The energetic span (δE) is calculated as the effective energy barrier for the
# main chemical transformation, which is the energy difference between the
# highest transition state (TDTS) and the pre-reaction complex (R).

G_TS_eli = 18  # Gibbs energy of TS-eli in kJ/mol
G_R = -55      # Gibbs energy of the reactant complex R in kJ/mol

# Calculate the energetic span in kJ/mol
delta_E_kJ_mol = G_TS_eli - G_R

# --- Step 2: Calculate the Reaction Rate Constant (k) ---
# The rate constant is calculated using the Eyring equation:
# k = (k_B * T / h) * exp(-δE / (R * T))

# Define physical constants
k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K
h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s
R = 8.314462       # Ideal gas constant in J/(mol*K)

# Define given variables from the problem
T = 298  # Temperature in Kelvin
delta_E_J_mol = delta_E_kJ_mol * 1000  # Convert energetic span to J/mol

# Calculate the rate constant in s^-1
pre_exponential_factor = (k_B * T) / h
exponent = -delta_E_J_mol / (R * T)
k_in_seconds = pre_exponential_factor * math.exp(exponent)

# Convert the rate constant to hr^-1
k_in_hours = k_in_seconds * 3600

# Round the final answer to two significant figures
k_rounded_str = f"{k_in_hours:.1e}"
