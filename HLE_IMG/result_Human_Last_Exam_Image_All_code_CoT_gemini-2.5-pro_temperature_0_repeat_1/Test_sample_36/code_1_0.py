    This function analyzes the provided business scenario and knowledge management models
    to determine the most suitable approach for VVA Consulting Limited.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  The company's goal is to improve sales results through Knowledge Management (KM).
    2.  The sales process involves structured stages and specific knowledge assets (lists, scripts, templates).
    3.  The DIKW model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom) is ideal for structuring the flow of information through the sales pipeline, turning raw prospect data into actionable knowledge.
    4.  The SECI model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) is crucial for capturing the tacit knowledge (skills and experience) of successful salespeople and converting it into explicit, shareable assets (like better scripts and manuals) for the entire team.
    5.  Bloom's Taxonomy is an educational framework for individual learning, not an organizational KM model for achieving business goals.
    6.  Therefore, a combination of the DIKW and SECI models provides the most comprehensive solution, addressing both the process/data aspects and the human/expertise aspects of knowledge management in a sales context.
