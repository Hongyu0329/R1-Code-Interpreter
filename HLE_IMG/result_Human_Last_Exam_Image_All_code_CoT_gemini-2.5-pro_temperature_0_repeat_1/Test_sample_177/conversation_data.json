    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total relative VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we'll multiply the share of total trips by the total share of car trips (1-occupant + carpool) and the average distance for that category. Then, we'll sum these values across all distance categories.\n2.  **Calculate the total relative VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will perform the same calculation as in step 1, but using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The formula is `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a string buffer\nstring_buffer = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout to the string buffer\nsys.stdout = string_buffer\n\n# --- Data from the tables ---\n# These values are the same for both scenarios\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\navg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\ndistance_labels = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n# --- Baseline Data (Table 1) ---\nbaseline_car_1_occ_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\nbaseline_car_pool_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# --- Proposed Data (Table 2) ---\nproposed_car_1_occ_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\nproposed_car_pool_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT ---\ntotal_vmt_baseline = 0\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\")\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Formula: Sum(Share of Total Trips * Total Car Share * Avg Trip Distance)\")\n\n# Combine car shares for baseline\nbaseline_total_car_share = [(s1 + s2) for s1, s2 in zip(baseline_car_1_occ_share, baseline_car_pool_share)]\n\nfor i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n    vmt_segment = share_of_total_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n    total_vmt_baseline += vmt_segment\n    print(f\"VMT for {distance_labels[i]:<11}: {share_of_total_trips[i]:.2f} * ({baseline_car_1_occ_share[i]:.2f} + {baseline_car_pool_share[i]:.2f}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]:<4} = {vmt_segment:.4f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal Baseline Car VMT (relative value): {total_vmt_baseline:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT ---\ntotal_vmt_proposed = 0\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\")\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Formula: Sum(Share of Total Trips * Total Car Share * Avg Trip Distance)\")\n\n# Combine car shares for proposed\nproposed_total_car_share = [(s1 + s2) for s1, s2 in zip(proposed_car_1_occ_share, proposed_car_pool_share)]\n\nfor i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n    vmt_segment = share_of_total_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n    total_vmt_proposed += vmt_segment\n    print(f\"VMT for {distance_labels[i]:<11}: {share_of_total_trips[i]:.2f} * ({proposed_car_1_occ_share[i]:.2f} + {proposed_car_pool_share[i]:.2f}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]:<4} = {vmt_segment:.4f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal Proposed Car VMT (relative value): {total_vmt_proposed:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\nvmt_reduction = total_vmt_baseline - total_vmt_proposed\npercentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / total_vmt_baseline) * 100\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\")\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(f\"VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT\")\nprint(f\"              = {total_vmt_baseline:.4f} - {total_vmt_proposed:.4f} = {vmt_reduction:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nPercentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\nprint(f\"                     = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {total_vmt_baseline:.4f}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"                     = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nBy changing the mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by {percentage_reduction:.1f}%.\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = string_buffer.getvalue()\n# Print the output to the real console\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<52.2>>>"
