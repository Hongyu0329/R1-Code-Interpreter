    "My plan is to solve this problem by programmatically analyzing the provided image. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Load the Image**: I will write a Python script to download the image from its URL. I'll use the `requests` library for this and `Pillow` (PIL) to handle the image data.\n2.  **Divide into Sub-images**: The main image is a 3x3 grid. I will systematically crop the image into nine 200x200 pixel sub-images, corresponding to each of the Wigner 3-j symbol visualizations.\n3.  **Define a Metric for Infinity-Norm**: The infinity-norm of a matrix is the maximum absolute value of its elements. In the heatmap, this corresponds to the most intense color (either red or green). I will define a numerical metric to represent this intensity. A good metric is the color's Euclidean distance from pure white (RGB: 255, 255, 255) in the RGB color space. This measures how much \"color\" a pixel has.\n4.  **Calculate Norm for Each Sub-image**: For each of the nine sub-images, I will iterate through all its pixels. I will filter out the black borders, white background, and numbered labels. For the remaining data pixels, I'll calculate the \"distance from white\" metric. The maximum value found in a sub-image will be its infinity-norm.\n5.  **Find Max/Min and Ratio**: After calculating the nine infinity-norms, I will find the maximum and minimum values among them.\n6.  **Calculate and Output the Ratio**: Finally, I will compute the ratio of the maximum norm to the minimum norm and print the result, including the values used in the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nfrom io import BytesIO\nimport math\n\ndef solve_image_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Downloads, analyzes the image of Wigner 3-j symbols, and calculates\n    the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
