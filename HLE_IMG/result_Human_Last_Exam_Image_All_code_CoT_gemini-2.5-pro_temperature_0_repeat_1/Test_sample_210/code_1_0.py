def solve_animal_reidentification():
    """
    This function identifies the matching nyala based on visual analysis.

    The analysis focuses on unique identifying features:
    1. Horn Shape: The curvature and tips of the horns in the target image are compared.
    2. Stripe Pattern: The vertical stripes on the flank are compared for number and spacing.
    3. Spot Pattern: The unique arrangement of white spots on the hindquarters is the most critical feature.

    Comparison Results:
    - Target vs. A: Horns appear different; likely a younger animal.
    - Target vs. B: A close match, but the pose is different.
    - Target vs. C: Image quality is too low for a reliable match.
    - Target vs. D: An excellent match across all features: horn shape, stripe pattern, and the specific spot pattern on the rump are identical.
    - Target vs. E: Mismatch; this animal has a white band on its front leg.
    - Target vs. F: Partially obscured, preventing a full comparison.

    Conclusion: Image D shows the same individual as the target image.
