# Step 1: Analyze image pair A.
# The right image shows a dense monoculture, a hallmark of an invasive species.
# The left image shows a more diverse ecosystem.
# This indicates the right side is the invaded range.
index_A = 3

# Step 2: Analyze image pair B.
# The left image shows a dense, aggressive stand of lupine, typical of an invasion.
# The right image shows sparser plants, more typical of a native population.
# This indicates the left side is the invaded range.
index_B = 4

# Step 3: Analyze image pair C.
# The plant is papaya. Neither image shows signs of an aggressive invasion.
# Both environments are plausible native habitats for this pioneer species.
# This indicates both are in their native range.
index_C = 1

# Step 4: Print the results for A, B, and C in the requested format.
