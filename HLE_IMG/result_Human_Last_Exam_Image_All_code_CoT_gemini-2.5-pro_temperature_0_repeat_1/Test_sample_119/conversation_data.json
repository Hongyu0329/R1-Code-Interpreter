    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z 135. According to the Nitrogen Rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. A plausible combination of carbon and hydrogen for this mass is C₉H₁₃ (9 * 12 + 13 * 1 = 121). Therefore, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For a formula CₐHₙNₙ, the DBE = a - b/2 + c/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n    A DBE of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows absorptions for aromatic C-H stretching (>3000 cm⁻¹), aliphatic C-H stretching (<3000 cm⁻¹), and aromatic C=C stretching (~1600 and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹). This confirms the presence of both aromatic and aliphatic parts. The absence of a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out many functional groups. There are weak-to-medium peaks in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which could indicate an N-H bond, likely from a primary (-NH₂) or secondary (-NH-) amine.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **~7.25 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This is a classic signal for a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A 3H doublet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This gives the fragment: -CH-CH₃.\n    *   **~2.4 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This is the -CH- proton. Its multiplicity confirms it's coupled to multiple neighbors (the CH₃ group and others).\n    *   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   The total integrated protons from the aliphatic region are 3H + 1H + 2H = 6H. The phenyl group has 5H. The total is 11H. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, the remaining 2 protons are likely from an -NH₂ group, which are often broad and not integrated accurately.\n\n5.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the formula is C₉, there must be some symmetry (e.g., the ortho and meta carbons of the monosubstituted ring are equivalent).\n    *   **Aromatic region (4 signals):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 ipso-C, 1 para-CH, 1 meta-CH pair, 1 ortho-CH pair).\n    *   **Aliphatic region (3 signals):** 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n    *   **DEPT-135:** One negative signal (CH₂) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃). This means the signal at 43.5 ppm is the CH₂, while 49.6 ppm and 19.2 ppm are CH/CH₃. The three aromatic signals between 126-129 ppm are also CHs. The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary carbon, as it's absent in DEPT.\n\n6.  **Use HSQC to Correlate ¹H and ¹³C:**\n    *   The ¹H signal at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The ¹H signal at 2.4 ppm (CH) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   The ¹H signal at 2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates to the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   The fragments are: C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n    *   The ¹H NMR coupling shows a -CH₂-CH-CH₃ backbone.\n    *   Two constitutional isomers are possible:\n        1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n        2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   To distinguish them, we compare the assigned ¹³C chemical shifts.\n        *   In isomer 1, the CH₂ is benzylic (C-C₆H₅) and the CH is alpha to the amine (C-NH₂). We expect δ(C-N) > δ(C-C₆H₅). Our data shows δ(CH) = 49.6 ppm and δ(CH₂) = 43.5 ppm, which fits this pattern.\n        *   In isomer 2, the CH is benzylic and the CH₂ is alpha to the amine. We would expect δ(CH₂) > δ(CH). Our data contradicts this.\n    *   Therefore, the structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. The complex multiplet for the CH₂ protons is also explained by this structure, as they are diastereotopic due to the adjacent stereocenter.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes the analysis and derives the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script performs a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Provided Data ---\n    molecular_weight = 135\n    c13_shifts = [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2]\n    dept135_negative = 1\n    dept135_positive = 5\n    h1_shifts = {\n        'aromatic': {'ppm': '~7.25', 'integration': 5, 'multiplicity': 'm'},\n        'signal_A': {'ppm': '~2.8', 'integration': 2, 'multiplicity': 'm'},\n        'signal_B': {'ppm': '~2.4', 'integration': 1, 'multiplicity': 'm'},\n        'signal_C': {'ppm': '~1.2', 'integration': 3, 'multiplicity': 'd'}\n    }\n    hsqc_correlations = {\n        '1.2': 19.2,\n        '2.4': 49.6,\n        '2.8': 43.5,\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Structure Elucidation ---\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Molecular Formula from Mass Spectrometry ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Molecular Formula Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = {molecular_weight}.\")\n    print(\"An odd molecular weight suggests an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule).\")\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H13N\"\n    num_C = 9\n    num_H = 13\n    num_N = 1\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is determined to be {molecular_formula}.\")\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\")\n    dbe = num_C + 1 - (num_H / 2) + (num_N / 2)\n    print(f\"The DBE is calculated using the formula: C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\")\n    print(f\"DBE = {num_C} + 1 - ({num_H}/2) + ({num_N}/2) = {int(dbe)}\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 4 strongly suggests a benzene ring.\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: NMR and Fragment Analysis ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: NMR Analysis and Structure Assembly\")\n    print(\"1H NMR shows a monosubstituted phenyl group (5H at ~7.25 ppm) and an aliphatic chain.\")\n    print(\"The aliphatic signals are a 3H doublet, a 1H multiplet, and a 2H multiplet.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a -CH3, a -CH, and a -CH2 group, respectively.\")\n    print(\"The coupling pattern (-CH3 is a doublet) indicates a -CH-CH3 fragment.\")\n    print(\"The full aliphatic backbone is therefore -CH2-CH-CH3.\")\n    print(\"The remaining atoms (NH2) and the phenyl group must be attached to this backbone.\")\n    print(\"\\nTwo primary isomers are possible:\")\n    print(\"  1. 1-phenylpropan-2-amine: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3\")\n    print(\"  2. 2-phenylpropan-1-amine: C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Isomer Differentiation using 13C NMR ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Final Identification\")\n    c_ch = hsqc_correlations['2.4']\n    c_ch2 = hsqc_correlations['2.8']\n    print(f\"From HSQC, the CH carbon is at {c_ch} ppm and the CH2 carbon is at {c_ch2} ppm.\")\n    print(\"In isomer 1, the CH is alpha to the amine (more deshielded) and the CH2 is benzylic.\")\n    print(\"In isomer 2, the CH2 is alpha to the amine (more deshielded) and the CH is benzylic.\")\n    print(f\"The data shows C(CH) > C(CH2) ({c_ch} > {c_ch2}), which is consistent with isomer 1.\")\n    \n    # --- Final Answer ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    final_name = \"1-phenylpropan-2-amine\"\n    print(f\"The compound is identified as {final_name}.\")\n    print(f\"IUPAC Name: {final_name}\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nsolve_structure()\n```\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
