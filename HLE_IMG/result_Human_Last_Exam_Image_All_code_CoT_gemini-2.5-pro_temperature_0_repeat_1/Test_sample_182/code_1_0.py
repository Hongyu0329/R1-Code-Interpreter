    # Step 1: Analyze the reactants and products.
    reactant1 = "3,3-dideuterio-3-phenylprop-1-ene"
    reactant2 = "Maleic anhydride"
    product_description = "A bicyclic adduct containing a new six-membered ring."
    catalyst = "AlCl3 (a Lewis acid)"

    # Step 2: Analyze the overall transformation.
    # Two separate molecules combine to form a single, larger molecule with a new ring.
    # This is characteristic of a cycloaddition reaction.
    transformation = "Two molecules combine to form a six-membered ring."

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the transformation.
    # A. electrocyclization: Incorrect. This is an intramolecular reaction.
    # B. group transfer reaction: Plausible (e.g., ene reaction), but a simple ene reaction
    #    is typically intermolecular and produces an acyclic product. The cyclic product
    #    makes this less likely than a cycloaddition.
    # C. dyotropic rearrangement: Incorrect. This is an intramolecular rearrangement.
    # D. sigmatropic rearrangement: Incorrect. This is an intramolecular reaction.
    # E. cycloaddition: Correct. This is a general term for this type of reaction.
    # F. Diels-Alder reaction: Correct and more specific. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition
    #    that forms a six-membered ring. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile (2-electron
    #    system). The propene derivative, especially under Lewis acid catalysis, acts as the
    #    4-electron component.

    # Step 4: Conclusion.
    # The formation of a six-membered ring from two components is the defining feature of a
    # Diels-Alder reaction. While "cycloaddition" is also correct, "Diels-Alder reaction"
    # is the most specific and descriptive classification among the choices.
