    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is then given by the formula $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} \\cdot C)$.\n\nHere is my plan to find $R_{th}$:\n1.  To calculate the Thevenin resistance, we must turn off all independent sources. The input source `IN` at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so we replace it with a short circuit to ground. Therefore, node $c_0$ is grounded.\n2.  The Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n3.  The circuit is an infinite ladder network. I will use nodal analysis to solve for the resistance. Let's apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ at node $a_0$ (which is the same as $d_0$) and calculate the current $I_{test}$ flowing into it. Then, $R_{th} = V_{test} / I_{test}$.\n4.  Let $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$. The boundary conditions are $v_0 = 0$ (since $c_0$ is grounded) and $u_0 = V_{test}$.\n5.  By writing the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$, we obtain a system of coupled linear difference equations.\n6.  Solving these equations with the condition that the voltages must decay as $n \\to \\infty$, we find the voltage at any node. Specifically, we can find the voltage at node $d_1$, which is $u_1$.\n7.  The current $I_{test}$ flowing into node $a_0$ comes from the resistor connecting $a_0$ to $d_1$. Thus, $I_{test} = (u_0 - u_1) / r$.\n8.  By solving the system, we find that the Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$.\n9.  Finally, we substitute this resistance into the cutoff frequency formula to get $\\omega_c = 1 / (r \\cdot C \\cdot (1 + \\sqrt{3}))$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final formula for the cutoff frequency and its numerical components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script presents the derived formula for the cutoff frequency at node a_0.\n\n# The cutoff frequency (in radians per second) is given by omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C).\n# Through analysis of the infinite ladder network, the Thevenin resistance R_th\n# seen from node a_0 is found to be R_th = r * (1 + sqrt(3)).\n\n# Substituting this into the formula for omega_c gives:\n# omega_c = 1 / (r * C * (1 + sqrt(3)))\n\n# We will now print the equation and the numerical constants within it,\n# following the requested format.\n\nnumerator = 1\none_plus_sqrt_three_term_1 = 1\none_plus_sqrt_three_term_2 = 3\n\nprint(\"The formula for the angular cutoff frequency omega_c is of the form:\")\nprint(\"omega_c = A / (r * C * (B + sqrt(D)))\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere the numerical constants are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {numerator}\")\nprint(f\"B = {one_plus_sqrt_three_term_1}\")\nprint(f\"D = {one_plus_sqrt_three_term_2}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation is:\")\n# Using 'w_c' for omega_c\nprint(f\"w_c = {numerator} / (r * C * ({one_plus_sqrt_three_term_1} + sqrt({one_plus_sqrt_three_term_2})))\")\n\n```\n<<<1/(r*C*(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
