    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Grid:** The standard paper speed is provided as 25 mm/sec. The ECG paper is marked with a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm in width.\n    *   Each large square contains 5 small squares, making it 5 mm in width.\n\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square:**\n    *   The time for one small square (1 mm) is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   The time for one large square (5 mm) is 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we can find the longest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes). This occurs in the fourth strip, where there is a significant pause.\n\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** We will count the number of small squares within this longest interval.\n    *   The R-wave before the pause aligns with a major vertical grid line.\n    *   The R-wave after the pause is located after 8 large squares and 1 additional small square.\n    *   Total number of small squares = (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 1 small square = 40 + 1 = 41 small squares.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Duration:** We will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of a single small square to get the total interval time in seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval in seconds from an ECG strip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG paper speed in mm/sec\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n    # Time for one small 1mm square in seconds\n    time_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # Visually measured number of small squares for the longest R-R interval\n    num_small_squares = 41\n\n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = num_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n    # Print the calculation steps and the final result\n    print(f\"The ECG paper speed is {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec.\")\n    print(f\"The time for one small square is 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {num_small_squares} small squares.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_small_squares} small squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n\ncalculate_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.64>>>"
