# Step 1: Define the atomic composition of the molecules involved in the second reaction.
# The Intermediate's formula is derived from the first reaction:
# 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S) + ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3) -> Intermediate + HCl + H2O
# Intermediate = C(3+6) H(4+9-1-2) N(2) S(1) O(3-1) = C9H10N2O2S
intermediate = {'C': 9, 'H': 10, 'N': 2, 'O': 2, 'S': 1}
# Benzylamine is C6H5CH2NH2
benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1, 'O': 0, 'S': 0}
# The reaction is an amidation of an ethyl ester, producing ethanol (C2H5OH) as a byproduct.
ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'N': 0, 'O': 1, 'S': 0}

# Step 2: Calculate the atomic composition of the final product.
# The overall transformation is: Intermediate + Benzylamine -> Product + Ethanol

h_product = intermediate['H'] + benzylamine['H'] - ethanol['H']

o_product = intermediate['O'] + benzylamine['O'] - ethanol['O']
s_product = intermediate['S'] + benzylamine['S'] - ethanol['S']

# Step 3: Print the calculation steps and the final molecular formula.
