    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the reactants (hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene) and the product, along with the reaction condition (photochemical, indicated by `hv`).\n2.  The overall transformation is complex and the prompt states that two pericyclic reactions are involved. I will break down the reaction into a plausible two-step sequence.\n3.  The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its highly strained isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This type of reaction is an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n4.  The second step involves the reaction of the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, with cyclobutene. This is a classic intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, which is also photochemically allowed and consistent with the stereochemistry of the final product.\n5.  I will then write a Python script that clearly explains these two reactions. To fulfill the prompt's requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will explicitly print the numbers involved in the cycloaddition notation (i.e., 2 and 2 for a [2+2] reaction).\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The overall transformation occurs via two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*75 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # First Reaction\n    print(\"Reaction 1: Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The first reaction is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\")\n    print(\"This is classified as an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\")\n    print(\"The numbers in the reaction name refer to the number of pi electrons involved from each reacting component.\")\n    print(\"In this case, the equation representing the electron count is:\")\n    print(\"2 pi electrons + 2 pi electrons\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*75 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Second Reaction\n    print(\"Reaction 2: Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The second reaction is a cycloaddition between the intermediate (hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene) and cyclobutene.\")\n    print(\"This is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, where a double bond from each molecule reacts to form a new four-membered ring, leading to the final product.\")\n    print(\"The equation representing the electron count for this step is also:\")\n    print(\"2 pi electrons + 2 pi electrons\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*75)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition and intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
