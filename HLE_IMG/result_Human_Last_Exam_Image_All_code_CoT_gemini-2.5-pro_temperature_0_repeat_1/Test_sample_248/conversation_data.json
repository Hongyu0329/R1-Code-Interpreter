    "Based on my analysis of the organisms visible in the image and their known geographical distributions, the species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the common rock barnacle. This species, *Semibalanus balanoides*, is abundant in the North Atlantic intertidal zone but is not found on the Pacific coast of North America. While the common periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is also present and characteristic of the Atlantic, it has been introduced in some locations on the Pacific coast, making it a less definitive indicator. The barnacles, however, are a clear marker.\n\n```python\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates an Atlantic coast location\n    and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image shows a typical North Atlantic rocky shore community.\n    # Key species to consider are the barnacles and periwinkles.\n    # The common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, is present but has been introduced to the Pacific coast.\n    # The common rock barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, is abundant in the North Atlantic\n    # but is not found on the North American Pacific coast.\n    # Therefore, its presence is a definitive indicator of an Atlantic location.\n    scientific_name = \"Semibalanus balanoides\"\n    \n    print(f\"The scientific name of the species that definitively indicates an Atlantic coast location is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nsolve_biology_question()\n```\n<<<Semibalanus balanoides>>>"
