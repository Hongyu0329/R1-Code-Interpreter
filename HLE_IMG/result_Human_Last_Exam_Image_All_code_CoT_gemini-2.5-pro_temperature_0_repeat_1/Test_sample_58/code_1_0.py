# The problem is symbolic, so we will represent the relationship as a string.
# The variables are 'h' (height), 'r' (radius), and 'theta' (angle).
# 'pi' is the mathematical constant.

# The derived relationship is h = pi * r * tan(theta)
# We will print this formula.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# In our symbolic equation h = pi * r * tan(theta), there are no explicit numbers other than the implied '1'.
# We will print the formula in a clear format.

print("The height of the cylinder 'h' is related to the radius 'r' and the angle 'theta' by the following equation:")
print("h = pi * r * tan(theta)")
