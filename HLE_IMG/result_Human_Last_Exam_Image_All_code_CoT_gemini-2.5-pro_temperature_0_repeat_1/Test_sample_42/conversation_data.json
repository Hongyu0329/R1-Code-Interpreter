    "My plan to identify the person in the icon is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the visual elements of the icon. The subject is an elderly, bearded male saint, characteristic of an Eastern Orthodox ascetic or Desert Father. He holds a scroll with text in an old Cyrillic script.\n2.  The artistic style is very distinctive, with expressive features and dynamic brushwork. This style is characteristic of the famous iconographer Theophanes the Greek.\n3.  By searching for icons by Theophanes the Greek depicting saints with these features, I can identify the specific artwork.\n4.  The image is a well-documented fresco of Saint Macarius of Egypt, painted by Theophanes the Greek around 1378 for the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilin Street in Novgorod, Russia.\n5.  Based on this identification, I will select the corresponding answer from the provided choices.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_icon_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the saint depicted in the icon based on art historical knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the icon.\n    # The icon shows an elderly male saint with a long beard, monastic robes, and a scroll with Cyrillic text.\n    # The style is expressive and dynamic.\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the artist and artwork.\n    # The style is a hallmark of the Byzantine and Russian iconographer Theophanes the Greek.\n    # This specific fresco is widely recognized as his work.\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the subject of the artwork.\n    # Art historical sources confirm that this fresco, located in the Church of the Transfiguration in Novgorod (c. 1378),\n    # depicts Saint Macarius of Egypt.\n\n    # Step 4: Match the identification with the given options.\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Saint Anthony\",\n        \"B\": \"Saint Macarius\",\n        \"C\": \"Saint Seraphim of Sarov\",\n        \"D\": \"Moses the Prophet\",\n        \"E\": \"Saint Varlaam\",\n        \"F\": \"Saint Simeon Stylites\"\n    }\n    correct_saint = \"Saint Macarius\"\n\n    # Find the corresponding letter for the correct answer.\n    final_answer_letter = \"\"\n    for letter, name in answer_choices.items():\n        if name == correct_saint:\n            final_answer_letter = letter\n            break\n    \n    # Print the conclusion.\n    print(f\"The saint depicted in the icon is Saint Macarius of Egypt.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {final_answer_letter}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem.\n# The final answer will be enclosed in <<<>>> after the code block.\nsolve_icon_identity()\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
