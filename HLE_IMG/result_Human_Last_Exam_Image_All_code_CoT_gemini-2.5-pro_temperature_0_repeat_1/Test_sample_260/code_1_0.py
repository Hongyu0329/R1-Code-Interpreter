    # Step 1: Analyze the image
    print("1. The image shows a ghostly, fading figure described as a 'lost small deity'.")
    print("   - This points to the theme of forgotten or fading religious beliefs.")
    print("   - The aged, distressed look of the image suggests the passage of time, decay, and memory.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the poem
    print("\n2. The poem extract 'Velvet fades / like a photochromic lens' uses metaphor to describe impermanence.")
    print("   - 'Velvet fades' signifies the decay of physical things.")
    print("   - The comparison to a changing lens emphasizes the transient, non-static nature of existence.")

    # Step 3: Synthesize the themes
    print("\n3. Combining these elements, two main themes emerge:")
    print("   - Theme A: The fading of religious/spiritual beliefs (the lost deity).")
    print("   - Theme B: The transient, passing nature of all things (existence, objects, memories).")

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("\n4. Evaluating the choices, option B best encapsulates these two core ideas.")
    print("   - B: The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs.")
