    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The provided image is a diagram of the knot known in knot theory as **7₄**. It's an alternating knot with 7 crossings.\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** For any alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant can be calculated using a well-known formula that relates it to two other classical knot invariants: the knot signature (σ) and the Arf invariant (Arf). The formula is:\n    `s(K) = 2 * Arf(K) - σ(K)`\n3.  **Find Invariant Values:** We will use the known, tabulated values for the signature and Arf invariant of the 7₄ knot.\n    *   The signature, σ(7₄), is -4.\n    *   The Arf invariant, Arf(7₄), is 0.\n4.  **Calculate:** We will plug these values into the formula to compute the Rasmussen invariant.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define these values, perform the calculation, and print out each step of the formula along with the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the 7_4 knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n    \n    # The knot in the image is the 7_4 knot, which is an alternating knot.\n    # For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is calculated from the\n    # signature (sigma) and the Arf invariant.\n\n    # Step 2: Use the known invariant values for the 7_4 knot.\n    # These values are standard results in knot theory.\n    signature = -4\n    arf_invariant = 0\n\n    # Step 3: State the formula and the values being used.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = 2 * Arf(K) - sigma(K)\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"For the {knot_name} knot:\")\n    print(f\"The signature, sigma({knot_name}), is {signature}.\")\n    print(f\"The Arf invariant, Arf({knot_name}), is {arf_invariant}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant using the formula.\n    rasmussen_invariant = 2 * arf_invariant - signature\n\n    # Step 5: Display the calculation step-by-step.\n    print(\"Plugging these values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = 2 * {arf_invariant} - ({signature})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {2 * arf_invariant} - ({signature})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
