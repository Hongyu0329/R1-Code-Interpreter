def solve_revolution_velocity():
    """
    Calculates the initial velocity v0 required for a complete revolution.
    
    The problem involves a plastic collision followed by rotational motion under gravity.
    1. Conservation of angular momentum during collision:
       L_initial = L_final
       m2 * v0 * d = I * omega
       where I = m1*R^2 + m2*d^2 is the moment of inertia after collision.
    
    2. Conservation of energy during rotation:
       E_bottom = E_top
       (1/2)*I*omega^2 + U_bottom = K_top + U_top
       For a complete revolution with a rigid rod, K_top can be 0.
       The change in potential energy from bottom to top is 2 * (m1*g*R + m2*g*d).
       So, (1/2)*I*omega^2 = 2*g*(m1*R + m2*d).
       
    3. Combining the two and solving for v0:
       v0 = sqrt( (4 * g * (m1*R + m2*d) * (m1*R^2 + m2*d^2)) / (m2^2 * d^2) )
