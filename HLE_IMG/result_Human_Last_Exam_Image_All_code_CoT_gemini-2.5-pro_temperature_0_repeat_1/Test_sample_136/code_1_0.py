def solve_symmetry_group():
    """
    Determines the group of symmetries for the given necklace colorings.

    The problem shows colorings of a 6-bead necklace, where each row is an
    equivalence class under a group of symmetries.

    1.  Observe the transformations within a row:
        - The colorings in any given row can be obtained from one another by rotation.
        - For a 6-bead necklace, the fundamental rotation is by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.
        - This indicates that the group of symmetries contains the cyclic group of rotations, C6.

    2.  Observe the transformations between rows:
        - Consider the first coloring in the first row (C1): Blue at the top, Green to its right.
        - Its mirror image (reflection across the vertical axis) would be a coloring with Blue at the top and Green to its left (C1').
        - If reflection were a symmetry, C1 and C1' would be in the same equivalence class (the same row).
        - However, by inspecting the image, we see that C1 is in the first row, while colorings equivalent to C1' (by rotation) are in the second row.
        - Since a coloring and its reflection are in different equivalence classes, reflection is not a symmetry of the group.

    3.  Conclusion:
        - The group of symmetries consists only of rotations.
        - For a 6-sided figure, this is the cyclic group C6.
        - This group is generated by a single element: the smallest possible rotation.

    4.  Calculation:
        - Number of beads (n) = 6
        - Smallest rotation angle = 360 / n
    """
    n = 6
    angle = 360 / n

    # The group is the cyclic group C6. It has a single minimal generator.
    generator = f"rotation by {int(angle)} degrees"

    print("The group of symmetries is the cyclic group C6.")
    print("It is generated by a single minimal generator.")
    print(f"The minimal generator is: {generator}")
    # The final answer format requires a comma-separated list.
    # Since there is only one generator, it's just the string itself.
    print("\n<<<" + generator + ">>>")
