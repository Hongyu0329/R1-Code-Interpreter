    "This is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement in terpene chemistry, specifically the acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid. The reaction proceeds through a series of carbocation intermediates, with sequential [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts driving the formation of a thermodynamically stable alkene product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the final substituents:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The starting material is a polycyclic alcohol (friedelan-3Î²-ol). The conditions (catalytic acid, heat) and the products (alkene + water) indicate an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction involving carbocation rearrangements.\n2.  **Propose a mechanism:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group, followed by the loss of a water molecule to form a secondary carbocation at C-3. This unstable carbocation initiates a cascade of rearrangements.\n3.  **Trace the rearrangements:** The rearrangement proceeds via a series of [1,2]-shifts along the \"backbone\" of the molecule to form the oleanane skeleton. The sequence is as follows:\n    *   A hydride shifts from C-4 to C-3.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C-5 to C-4.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C-10 to C-5.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C-9 to C-10.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C-8 to C-9.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C-14 to C-8.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C-13 to C-14, forming a carbocation at C-13.\n4.  **Formation of the final product:** A proton is eliminated from C-12 to form the stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13, yielding the product (olean-12-ene).\n5.  **Determine the final substituents:** By tracking the initial positions of the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups and following their migrations according to the mechanism, we can determine which substituent ends up at each numbered position in the final product.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** The methyl group at C-4 does not participate in the rearrangement. **Result: CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** The original methyl group at C-10 migrates away, and this position is filled by a hydrogen atom from C-9. **Result: H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-8):** The original methyl group at C-8 migrates away, and this position is filled by the methyl group from C-14. **Result: CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-9):** The original hydrogen atom at C-9 migrates away, and this position is filled by the methyl group from C-8. **Result: CH3**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** The original methyl group at C-14 migrates away, and this position is filled by a hydrogen atom from C-13. **Result: H**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at the numbered positions\n    after the acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The substituents are determined by tracing the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism.\n    # 1: CH3 at C-4 is a spectator.\n    # 2: H from C-9 migrates to C-10.\n    # 3: CH3 from C-14 migrates to C-8.\n    # 4: CH3 from C-8 migrates to C-9.\n    # 5: H from C-13 migrates to C-14.\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as requested.\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n    \n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
