    "To determine the number of splice species, we will analyze the bands present in each RT-PCR panel (B through I). A new splice species is counted when a band appears that represents a unique RNA transcript, which can be identified by a unique size for a given primer pair or by the use of splice-junction-specific primers.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** Two bands are visible (190 bp and 159 bp). This indicates the presence of **2** distinct splice species.\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** Two bands are visible (584 bp and 553 bp). Since the primer pair shares the same forward primer as in B and the size difference between the bands is consistent (31 bp), these are considered the same two species, just amplified with a different reverse primer. Thus, **0** new species are found.\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** One band is visible (551 bp). The forward primer, E1F2, is specific to the 929^3465 splice junction. This confirms a new species that is structurally different from those in panels B and C. This adds **1** new species.\n4.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** One band is visible (1,005 bp). This is a longer amplification product of one of the species already identified in panel B/C. No new species are identified, so **0** new species.\n5.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** One band is visible (972 bp). This is a longer amplification product of the species identified in panel D. No new species are identified, so **0** new species.\n6.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** Two bands are visible (1,003 bp and 931 bp). The forward primer, E1F3, is specific to a different splice junction (929^3506). The presence of two distinct bands indicates **2** new splice species.\n7.  **Panel H (E1F1/L1R):** Two bands are visible (450 bp and 419 bp). The small product sizes from primers spanning a large genomic distance indicate a major splicing event joining the E1 region to the L1 region. These are fundamentally different from the previous species. This adds **2** new species.\n8.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** Four bands are visible (450, 419, 378, and 187 bp). This experiment uses the same primers as H but with more cycles, revealing less abundant transcripts. The 450 bp and 419 bp bands are the same as in H. The 378 bp and 187 bp bands are new, representing **2** additional splice species.\n\nSumming the new species from each step gives the total count.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    It analyzes each panel to identify unique splice variants.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of new species identified in each panel\n    species_from_B = 2  # Two initial species from bands 190 bp and 159 bp.\n    species_from_C = 0  # Same species as B, different primers.\n    species_from_D = 1  # New species from splice-specific primer E1F2 (551 bp).\n    species_from_E = 0  # Longer amplification of a known species.\n    species_from_F = 0  # Longer amplification of a known species.\n    species_from_G = 2  # Two new species from splice-specific primer E1F3 (1003 bp, 931 bp).\n    species_from_H = 2  # Two new species with major splice to L1 (450 bp, 419 bp).\n    species_from_I = 2  # Two additional species revealed with more cycles (378 bp, 187 bp).\n\n    # Summing up the new species from each step\n    total_species = (species_from_B + species_from_C + species_from_D +\n                     species_from_E + species_from_F + species_from_G +\n                     species_from_H + species_from_I)\n\n    print(\"The total number of splice species is the sum of new species found in each experiment:\")\n    print(f\"{species_from_B} (from B) + {species_from_C} (from C) + {species_from_D} (from D) + {species_from_E} (from E) + {species_from_F} (from F) + {species_from_G} (from G) + {species_from_H} (from H) + {species_from_I} (from I) = {total_species}\")\n\ncalculate_splice_species()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
