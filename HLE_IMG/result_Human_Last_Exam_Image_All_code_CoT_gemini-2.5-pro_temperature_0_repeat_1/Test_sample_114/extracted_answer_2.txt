The difference in regioselectivity is due to the symmetry of the münchnone intermediate. In Reactions 1 and 2, the acyclic starting material forms a symmetric münchnone with methyl groups at both C2 and C4, leading to a non-selective cycloaddition and a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers. In Reaction 3, the cyclic starting material (proline) forms an asymmetric münchnone with a methyl group at C2 and a hydrogen at C4. This asymmetry directs the cycloaddition, as the bulky ester group of the alkyne adds to the less hindered C4 position, resulting in the formation of a single, highly favored regioisomer (Product B). Reactions 1 and 2 serve as a control, proving that the selectivity in Reaction 3 arises from the intermediate's structure.
