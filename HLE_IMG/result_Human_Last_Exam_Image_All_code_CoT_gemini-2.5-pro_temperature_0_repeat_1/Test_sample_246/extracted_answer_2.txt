Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The most prominent sign is the large, white, fuzzy gall on the twig, known as a wool sower gall. It is created by a gall wasp. This wasp lays its eggs inside the tissue of the oak twig. The gall then grows around the developing larvae to provide food and shelter. There is also secondary evidence of a different insect's egg mass on the surface of one of the leaves.
