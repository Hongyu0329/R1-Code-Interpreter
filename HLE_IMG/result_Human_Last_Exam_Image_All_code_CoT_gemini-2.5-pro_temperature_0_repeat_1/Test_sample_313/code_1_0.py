    # Clue 1 Analysis: The image and date.
    # The event is the 2019 NHL Awards on June 20, 2019.
    # The person pictured is Nikita Kucherov, who won three major awards:
    # 1. Hart Memorial Trophy
    # 2. Ted Lindsay Award
    # 3. Art Ross Trophy
    # Winning three awards is a metaphorical "hat trick".
    # The Hart Trophy provides a pun on "hat".
    clue1_subject = "A 'hat trick' of awards"

    # Clue 2 Analysis: The riddle.
    # "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts."
    # This refers to the old method ('trick') of making felt hats using mercury,
    # which was toxic and is no longer practiced.
    clue2_subject = "An old 'trick' for making 'hats'"

    # Synthesis: The common term is "Hat Trick".
    X = "Hat"
    Y = "Trick"

    # The prompt mentions an equation, but none is present in the problem.
    # We will simply print the components of the answer.
    print(f"The first part of the answer, X, is '{X}'.")
    print(f"The second part of the answer, Y, is '{Y}'.")
    print(f"Therefore, the full answer is: {X} {Y}")
