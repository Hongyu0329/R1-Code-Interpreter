    "Here is my thinking process to solve this puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image and Date:** The first clue provides an image and a specific date: June 20, 2019. A quick search reveals this was the date of the 2019 NHL Awards. The man receiving the award is identifiable as hockey player Nikita Kucherov. On that night, he won a remarkable three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (top scorer). Winning three of something is famously called a \"hat trick\". The presence of the **Hart** Trophy is a key pun, suggesting the word \"**hat**\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The second clue is a riddle: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to the historical process of making felt hats. Hatmakers used a mercury nitrate solution to process fur, a method that caused mercury poisoning and led to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". This old method, or \"trick,\" for making hats has been discontinued due to its toxicity.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:** The two-word phrase \"Hat Trick\" is the only one that connects both clues.\n    *   **Clue 1:** Nikita Kucherov's achievement of winning three major awards is a metaphorical \"Hat Trick\". The Hart Trophy in the picture provides the pun for \"Hat\".\n    *   **Clue 2:** The riddle describes an old \"trick\" (i.e., a method or technique) for making \"hats\" that is no longer used because of mercury.\n\nTherefore, X Y is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the puzzle by analyzing the two provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Clue 1 Analysis: The image and date.\n    # The event is the 2019 NHL Awards on June 20, 2019.\n    # The person pictured is Nikita Kucherov, who won three major awards:\n    # 1.
