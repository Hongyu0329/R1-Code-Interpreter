    "This is a mate-in-2 chess puzzle. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Black King's Position:** The Black King is on `e4`. It is very exposed. I need to identify its current escape squares and the pieces controlling the squares around it.\n    *   The King can move to `d3`, `d4`, and `f5`.\n    *   The square `d5` is controlled by the White Queen on `a4`.\n    *   The square `e3` is controlled by the White Rook on `f3`.\n    *   The square `f3` is occupied by the White Rook.\n\n2.  **Search for White's First Move:** I'm looking for a move that forces a checkmate on the next turn. A check is a good candidate for the first move.\n    *   Let's consider moving the Knight from `e7` to `g6`. This is `1. Ng6+`.\n    *   This move puts the Black King in check. Now, let's see Black's possible responses.\n    *   The King cannot move to `f5` (controlled by the Rook on `h5`).\n    *   The King cannot move to `d4` (now controlled by the Knight on `g6`).\n    *   The King cannot stay on `e4` (in check).\n    *   The only legal move for Black is to move the King to `d3`. So, the move is `1... Kd3`.\n\n3.  **Find the Checkmating Second Move:** After `1. Ng6+ Kd3`, the board position has changed. The Black King is on `d3`. I need to find a move that is checkmate.\n    *   Let's move the White Queen from `a4` to `d1`. This is `2. Qd1#`.\n    *   Let's verify if this is checkmate. The King on `d3` is attacked by the Queen on `d1`.\n    *   Can the King escape?\n        *   `c2`, `d2`, `e2`: All controlled by the Queen on `d1` and the Bishop on `g1`.\n        *   `c3`: Controlled by the pawn on `b4`.\n        *   `c4`: Controlled by the Queen on `a4`'s original file (it still covers this diagonal).\n        *   `d4`: Controlled by the Bishop on `g1`.\n        *   `e3`: Controlled by the Rook on `f3`.\n        *   `e4`: Controlled by the Bishop on `g2`.\n    *   The King has no escape squares. The check cannot be blocked, and the Queen on `d1` cannot be captured. This is a checkmate.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The solution is `1. Ng6+ Kd3 2. Qd1#`. I will now write a Python script to print this solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_two():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution for the given chess puzzle.\n  The puzzle is a checkmate in 2 moves for White.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # White's first move, a check\n  white_move_1 = \"Ng6+\"\n  \n  # Black's forced response\n  black_move_1 = \"Kd3\"\n  \n  # White's second move, delivering checkmate\n  white_move_2 = \"Qd1#\"\n  \n  print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 is:\")\n  # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n  # I will print the move numbers and the moves in algebraic notation.\n  print(f\"1. {white_move_1} {black_move_1}\")\n  print(f\"2. {white_move_2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_mate_in_two()\n```\n<<<1. Ng6+ Kd3 2. Qd1#>>>"
