    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we need to understand what the projection of an FCC lattice looks like from that angle.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the FCC structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face.\n2.  **Understand the [110] projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the `[1, 1, 0]` vector.\n3.  **Determine the theoretical pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular lattice**. The unit cell of this 2D pattern is a rectangle with side lengths in the ratio of `1 : sqrt(2)`.\n4.  **Analyze the given images:**\n    *   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular lattice (atoms only at the corners), not a centered one.\n    *   **Image B** shows a centered square lattice. The side ratio is 1, which corresponds to an FCC [100] projection.\n    *   **Image C** shows a hexagonal pattern, which corresponds to an FCC [111] projection.\n    *   **Image D** shows a centered rectangular lattice. We need to check if the side ratio is close to `sqrt(2)`.\n5.  **Verify Image D:** We will write a Python script to calculate the side ratio of the unit rectangle in Image D and compare it to the theoretical value of `sqrt(2)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements step 5 to confirm that Image D matches the theoretical pattern.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided image patterns to identify the FCC [110] projection.\n    The theoretical pattern for an FCC [110] projection is a centered rectangle\n    with a side length ratio of sqrt(2).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the pattern in Image D.\")\n    print(\"Image D shows a centered rectangular pattern.
