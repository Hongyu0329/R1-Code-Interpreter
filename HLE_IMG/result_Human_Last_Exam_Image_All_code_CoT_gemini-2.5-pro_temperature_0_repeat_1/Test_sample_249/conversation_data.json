    "Based on the distinctive honeycomb-like pattern of fused, bony plates visible in the image, the animal is a boxfish, also known as a trunkfish. This pattern forms a rigid carapace that protects the fish. While identifying the exact species from this partial view is difficult, it belongs to the family Ostraciidae. A common and representative species with this feature is the Yellow Boxfish.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the animal in the image and provides its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    animal_name = \"Boxfish (Family: Ostraciidae)\"\n    scientific_name = \"Ostracion cubicus\"\n    \n    print(f\"Yes, the animal in the image is a {animal_name}.\")\n    print(f\"A representative scientific name for this type of fish is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Ostracion cubicus>>>"
