    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens, here are their likely identifications.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of gas bubbles/holes). This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**, an extrusive igneous rock formed from frothy lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various angular fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture indicates it is a **Volcanic Breccia**, a type of pyroclastic rock formed from explosive volcanic eruptions.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular rock. Its porous and lightweight appearance is a classic example of **Pumice**, an extrusive igneous rock so full of gas cavities that it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture is typical of an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly deep underground. The presence of very large crystals suggests it is a **Pegmatite**.\n\nThe following Python code will print these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<Specimen H: Scoria\nSpecimen I: Volcanic Breccia\nSpecimen J: Pumice\nSpecimen K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
