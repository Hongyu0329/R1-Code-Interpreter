    "This task requires determining the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), for four specific stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme. The reaction is an esterification between an acyl chloride and an alcohol. The stereochemistry at the chiral centers is not expected to change during this reaction (i.e., the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration), but the R/S *label* might change if the priority of the substituent groups changes according to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the configuration for each stereocenter:\n1.  **First Stereocenter (Acyl Chloride Reactant):**\n    *   Identify the four groups attached to the chiral carbon: -Cl, -OMe (methoxy), -CF₃ (trifluoromethyl), and -Ph (phenyl).\n    *   Assign priorities based on CIP rules (higher atomic number gets higher priority).\n    *   Determine the configuration (R or S) from the 3D representation.\n\n2.  **Second Stereocenter (Alcohol Reactant):**\n    *   Identify the four groups attached to the chiral carbon: -OH (hydroxyl), -H, -CH₂OMe, and -CH₂CH(Me)₂ (isobutyl).\n    *   Assign priorities using CIP rules.\n    *   Determine the configuration.\n\n3.  **Third Stereocenter (Product, from Alcohol):**\n    *   This center is formed from the alcohol reactant. Since the esterification reaction does not break any bonds at this chiral center, its configuration is retained from the alcohol reactant.\n\n4.  **Fourth Stereocenter (Product, from Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   This center is formed from the acyl chloride reactant. The -Cl group is replaced by the alcohol's oxygen. The 3D arrangement of the other three groups is retained.\n    *   We must re-evaluate the CIP priorities for the groups on the product's stereocenter and determine its R/S label.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these steps and print the resulting sequence of stereochemical assignments.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignment (R/S) for the four\n    stereocenters in the given esterification reaction, moving from left to right.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the stereocenters in the reaction scheme...\\n\")\n\n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant ---\n    center_1_name = \"Acyl Chloride (reactant)\"\n    # The chiral carbon is bonded to Cl, OMe, CF3, and Ph.\n    # CIP Priorities: 1: -Cl, 2: -OMe, 3: -CF3, 4: -Ph\n    # In the drawing, the -OMe group (priority 2) points away.\n    # The path from priority 1 -> 3 -> 4 is Cl -> CF3 -> Ph, which is clockwise.\n    # Since we are looking down an even-numbered priority group, a clockwise path indicates an (S) configuration.\n    config_1 = \"S\"\n    print(f\"1.
