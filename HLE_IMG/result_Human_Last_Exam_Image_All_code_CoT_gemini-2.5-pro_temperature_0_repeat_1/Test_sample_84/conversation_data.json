    "I will identify the city by analyzing the key elements of the provided coat of arms and searching for a real-world equivalent.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Shield:** The most important part of a coat of arms is the shield. This shield is divided horizontally. The top half is blue with a yellow crescent moon. The bottom half is yellow with a black crab.\n2.  **Search for Matches:** I will search for coats of arms featuring a combination of a crescent moon and a crab on a blue and yellow field.\n3.  **Identify the City:** This specific combination is characteristic of the coat of arms of the city of Ochakiv (Очаків) in Ukraine. The official coat of arms has a shield divided \"per fess azure and or, a crescent argent and a crab sable\". This translates to a shield divided horizontally, blue over gold, with a silver crescent and a black crab. The image uses a gold crescent, but the overall design is a clear match.\n4.  **Output the Answer:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the city\n  whose coat of arms is very similar to the one described.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The key elements in the image's shield are:\n  # - A shield divided horizontally (per fess).\n  # - Top field: Blue (azure) with a crescent moon.\n  # - Bottom field: Yellow/Gold (or) with a crab.\n  # This design is the coat of arms of the city of Ochakiv, Ukraine.\n  city_name = \"Ochakiv\"\n  print(f\"The city with a very similar coat of arms is: {city_name}\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Ochakiv>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which city has a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
