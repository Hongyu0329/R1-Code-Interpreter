    This function provides the known number of non-isomorphic cycle double covers
    for the Petersen graph.

    A cycle double cover (CDC) of a graph is a collection of cycles where each
    edge of the graph is part of exactly two cycles. Two CDCs are isomorphic
    if one can be transformed into the other by an automorphism of the graph.

    The number of non-isomorphic CDCs for the Petersen graph is a known result
    from graph theory research and is not computed here. The established number is 5.
