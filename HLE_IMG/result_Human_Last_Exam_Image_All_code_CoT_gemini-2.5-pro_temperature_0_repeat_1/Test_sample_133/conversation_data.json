    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the compound from the given mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Molecular Weight (MW):**\n    *   I'll look at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) cluster in the spectrum. This cluster appears to start at m/z 260 and extends to m/z 266.\n    *   The peaks are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   I will assume the peak at m/z 260 represents the molecular ion (M⁺) corresponding to the molecule made of the most abundant isotopes (e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl). Therefore, the nominal molecular weight is 260 u.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Base Peak and Key Fragmentation:**\n    *   The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n    *   The difference between the molecular ion peak and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 u.\n    *   A loss of 35 u is characteristic of the loss of a chlorine radical (³⁵Cl•). This is a very strong indication that the base peak is the [M - Cl]⁺ fragment.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Isotope Patterns to Determine the Number of Halogens:**\n    *   **Base Peak Cluster:** Let's examine the isotope pattern for the base peak at m/z 225. We see peaks at m/z 225 (I=100), m/z 227 (I=66.7), and m/z 229 (I=22.2).\n        *   The ratio of the peak at M to M+2 is 100 / 66.7 ≈ 1.5 or 3:2.\n        *   The theoretical isotope abundance for two chlorine atoms is M:(M+2):(M+4) ≈ (3:1)² = 9:6:1, which normalizes to 100:66:11.\n        *   The observed ratio of 100:66.7 is an excellent match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n    *   **Molecular Ion Conclusion:** If the base peak [M - Cl]⁺ contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule (M) must have contained **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We've established that the molecule contains 3 chlorine atoms. The molecular ion peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the isotopologue with three ³⁵Cl atoms.\n    *   Mass of 3 × ³⁵Cl = 3 × 35 = 105 u.\n    *   The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is MW - (mass of 3 Cl) = 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n    *   This part must be composed of carbon and hydrogen (CₓHᵧ). Let's find a combination with a mass of 155.\n        *   If we assume 12 carbons (C₁₂), the mass is 12 × 12 = 144 u.\n        *   The remaining mass for hydrogen is 155 - 144 = 11 u. This corresponds to 11 hydrogen atoms (H₁₁).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Other Fragments and Propose a Structure:**\n    *   Let's check for a fragment corresponding to the loss of the CCl₃ group. The mass of a •CCl₃ radical is 12 + (3 × 35) = 117 u.\n    *   The expected fragment [M - CCl₃]⁺ would have a mass of 260 - 117 = 143 u.\n    *   Looking at the data table, there is a significant peak at **m/z 143** with an intensity of 27.8%. This strongly supports a structure of the type R-CCl₃, where R is a C₁₁H₁₁ group.\n    *   This also explains the base peak at m/z 225, which would be the [R-CCl₂]⁺ fragment (mass of R + mass of CCl₂ = 143 + 82 = 225).\n    *   The fragmentation pathway is consistent:\n        *   C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃ (m/z 260) → [C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₂]⁺ (m/z 225) + Cl•\n        *   C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃ (m/z 260) → [C₁₁H₁₁]⁺ (m/z 143) + •CCl₃\n    *   The structure is a C₁₁H₁₁ group attached to a trichloromethyl (-CCl₃) group. A plausible and common C₁₁H₁₁ group is formed by two phenyl rings linked by a methylene bridge, where one phenyl ring has lost a hydrogen. This is not C11.\n    *   A very common class of compounds with this type of structure are DDT and its analogues. Let's consider a structure like 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane. The formula is C₁₄H₁₁Cl₃. This is not our compound.\n    *   Let's consider a structure that fits the C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ formula and the R-CCl₃ fragmentation. A plausible, though not definitively provable without a library match, structure is **1-(1-Naphthyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane**. Let's check its formula: Naphthyl is C₁₀H₇. The rest is -CH(H)-CCl₃. So the formula is C₁₀H₇-CH₂-CCl₃ -> C₁₁H₉Cl₃. This does not fit.\n    *   Let's try another structure: **1,1,1-trichloro-2-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-phenylethane**. This is too large.\n    *   Given the clear evidence for a C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃ structure, and the difficulty in unambiguously identifying the C₁₁H₁₁ isomer, I will propose a plausible name for one such isomer. A common C₁₁H₁₁⁺ fragment (m/z 143) in mass spectrometry is the methyl-indenyl cation or a rearranged ion. A plausible parent molecule could be **1,1,1-Trichloro-2-(2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl)ethane**. Let's check the formula: Indenyl group is C₉H₇. Dihydroindenyl is C₉H₉. The side chain is -CH₂-CCl₃. So the formula is C₉H₉-CH₂-CCl₃ -> C₁₀H₁₁Cl₃. Still not a match.\n    *   Let's reconsider the C₁₁H₁₁ group. It could be a biphenyl group where one ring is opened. This is getting too complex.\n    *   Let's assume a simpler structure: **1,1,1-trichloro-3-phenylpentane**. Phenyl is C₆H₅. The chain is -CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CCl₃. No, that's not right.\n    *   Let's try **1,1,1-trichloro-2-benzyl-butane**. Benzyl is C₇H₇. The rest is -CH(C₂H₅)-CCl₃. C₇H₇-C₃H₄-CCl₃ -> C₁₀H₁₁Cl₃. Still not C₁₂.\n    *   The analysis points strongly to C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. A known compound with a very similar mass spectrum (though different MW) is Perthane, which has two ethylphenyl groups. This suggests the C₁₂H₁₁ part might involve two aromatic rings. However, C₁₂H₁₁ cannot be two complete phenyl rings.\n    *   Let's assume the structure is **1,1,1-trichloro-2-phenyl-2-(4-tolyl)ethane**. No, that's C₁₅.\n    *   Let's go with the most plausible structure that fits the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and has a CCl₃ group: **1-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane**. Biphenyl is C₁₂H₁₀. Biphenyl-4-yl is C₁₂H₉. The side chain is -CH₂-CCl₃. The formula is C₁₂H₉-CH₂-CCl₃ -> C₁₃H₁₁Cl₃. Not a match.\n    *   This is a very tricky one. The most logical deduction leads to C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. Let's name a simple isomer: **1-(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)-2,2-dichloroethene**. No.\n    *   Let's go with a name that reflects the C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃ structure. A plausible C₁₁H₁₁ group is **1-phenylcyclopent-2-en-1-yl**. The compound would be **1-(1-phenylcyclopent-2-en-1-yl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane**. This is too complex.\n    *   Let's try a simpler name: **1,1,1-trichloro-2-(2-naphthyl)ethane**. Formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. Let's check: Naphthyl is C₁₀H₇. The side chain is -CH₂-CCl₃. Formula is C₁₀H₇-CH₂-CCl₃ -> C₁₁H₉Cl₃. Still wrong.\n    *   Let's try **1,1,1-trichloro-2-(acenaphthen-5-yl)ethane**. Acenaphthene is C₁₂H₁₀. Acenaphthenyl is C₁₂H₉. Side chain -CH₂-CCl₃. Formula C₁₂H₉-CH₂-CCl₃ -> C₁₃H₁₁Cl₃. Wrong.\n    *   There seems to be a contradiction in my analysis or the problem statement. However, sticking to the most robust evidence (fragments), the formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. A known pesticide with a similar structure is **Perthane-olefin**, which is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-ethylphenyl)ethylene, C₁₈H₁₈Cl₂. Not it.\n    *   Let's assume the compound is **1,1,1-trichloro-2-(4-vinylphenyl)-2-phenylethane**. No.\n    *   Given the ambiguity, I will provide the name of a compound whose spectrum is known to be very similar, even if the MW doesn't perfectly match the highest peak, suggesting the molecular ion is not observed. The spectrum strongly resembles that of **Perthane**.\n    *   Perthane: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-ethylphenyl)ethane. Formula C₁₈H₂₀Cl₂. MW=306. Base peak is 239. This is not it.\n    *   Let's go back to the book's answer: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane**. This is o,p'-DDT. Formula C₁₄H₉Cl₅. MW=352. This is definitively not the spectrum shown.\n    *   Let's trust the analysis C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. The IUPAC name for a plausible isomer is required. Let's name **1-(3,3,3-trichloroprop-1-en-1-yl)indane**. Formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. This fits the fragmentation C₉H₁₀⁺ + C₃HCl₃.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Deduce the molecular formula from the spectrum data.\n    # Highest m/z cluster starts at 260, suggesting MW = 260.\n    mw = 260\n    # Base peak is at m/z 225.\n    base_peak = 225\n    # The loss of (260 - 225) = 35 u corresponds to a Cl atom.\n    loss_from_mw = mw - base_peak\n    \n    # The isotope pattern of the base peak (m/z 225, 227, 229) with ratio ~100:66 indicates two Cl atoms.\n    # If [M-Cl]+ has 2 Cl atoms, the original molecule M must have 3 Cl atoms.\n    num_cl = 3\n    \n    # Mass of the non-halogen part = 260 - (3 * 35) = 155 u.\n    mass_of_cl = num_cl * 35\n    mass_of_hydrocarbon = mw - mass_of_cl\n    \n    # The hydrocarbon part C(x)H(y) has mass 155.
