    # Step 1: Determine the plot axes.
    # The vertical axes are labeled on the plots: x5 for f and g; x3 for h and i.
    # The horizontal axes are a permutation of x1, x2, x3, x4.
    # By comparing the horizontal axis range of plot f in Set 1 ([15, 18]) with the
    # vertical axis range of plots h and i ([15, 18]), which is x3, we deduce that
    # the horizontal axis of plot f is x3.
    # The plots h and i show a "butterfly" attractor, typical for Lorenz-like systems.
    # The (x1, x2, x3) equations form such a system. The butterfly shape is expected
    # in the (x1, x3) and (x2, x3) projections. Thus, the horizontal axes of h and i
    # are x1 and x2.
    # To distinguish between h and i, we look at Set 2, where the horizontal range of
    # plot h increases by a factor of 10 (from ~3 to ~30). The equation for x2' contains
    # the parameter b. Increasing b tenfold would cause the amplitude of x2 to increase
    # tenfold. This identifies the horizontal axis of h as x2 and the change in Set 2 as 'B'.
    # Consequently, the horizontal axis of i is x1.
    # By elimination, the horizontal axis of g is x4.
    # Assignment: x1 -> i, x2 -> h, x3 -> f, x4 -> g.
    axis_string = "ihfg"

    # Step 2: Determine the parameter k.
    # From the equation x3' = -5*x3 - c*x1*x2 + 50*k, we can average over time.
    # For a bounded attractor, <x3'> is 0, so 50*k ≈ 5*<x3> + c*<x1*x2>.
    # From Set 1 plots: <x3> ≈ 16.5. The product <x1*x2> is likely negative, estimated as -1.
    # The initial parameter c is either -1 or 10.
    # If c = 10, 50*k ≈ 5*16.5 + 10*(-1) = 72.5 => k ≈ 1.45.
    # If c = -1, 50*k ≈ 5*16.5 + (-1)*(-1) = 83.5 => k ≈ 1.67.
    # The closest integer is k=2, which is a plausible single-digit value.
    k = 2

    # Step 3: Determine the parameter changes for each simulation.
    # Set 1 is the baseline simulation.
    change1 = '0'
    # Set 2: As determined in Step 1, the change is an increase in b.
    change2 = 'B'
    # Set 3: The range of x3 shifts slightly upward. From the equation 50*k ≈ 5*<x3> + c*<x1*x2>,
    # if c is decreased (made less negative or smaller positive), <x3> must increase to compensate.
    # This matches the observation.
    change3 = 'c'
    # Set 4: The system's dynamics simplify to a limit cycle. This is likely due to
    # weakening one of the coupling terms. The remaining options are d or e. A decrease
    # in either parameter ('d' or 'e') would weaken the (x4, x5) coupling, which could
    # regularize the system. We choose 'd' as the most plausible remaining option.
    change4 = 'd'
