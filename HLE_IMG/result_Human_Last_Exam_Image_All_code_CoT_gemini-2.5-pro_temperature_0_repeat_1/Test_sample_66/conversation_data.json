    "To find the total area of the shaded regions, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Geometry:** The image shows a single contiguous shaded region, which is the area between a circular arc and two tangent lines. This area can be calculated by finding the area of a larger shape (a quadrilateral) and subtracting the area of a circular sector from it.\n\n2.  **Define the Quadrilateral:** The quadrilateral is formed by the center of the circle (let's call it O), the two points on the arc where the tangents start (A and C), and the point where the two tangent lines meet (P). This quadrilateral, OAPC, is composed of two identical right-angled triangles, OAP and OCP.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Area of the Triangles:**\n    *   Each triangle has a base equal to the radius of the circle (r = 34) and a height equal to the length of the tangent line (h = 17).\n    *   The area of one right-angled triangle is `(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 34 * 17 = 289`.\n    *   The total area of the quadrilateral OAPC is the sum of the areas of the two triangles: `2 * 289 = 578`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Circular Sector:**\n    *   We need to subtract the area of the circular sector OAC from the area of the quadrilateral.\n    *   The radius of the sector is `r = 34`.\n    *   The angle of the sector (`∠AOC`) is the sum of the two angles at the center of each triangle (`∠AOP` and `∠COP`).\n    *   For one triangle, we can find the angle `α = ∠AOP` using trigonometry: `tan(α) = opposite / adjacent = 17 / 34 = 0.5`. So, `α = arctan(0.5)`.\n    *   The total angle of the sector is `2 * α = 2 * arctan(0.5)`.\n    *   The area of a sector is given by the formula `(1/2) * r^2 * θ`, where `θ` is the angle in radians.\n    *   Area of sector OAC = `(1/2) * 34^2 * (2 * arctan(0.5)) = 1156 * arctan(0.5)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Shaded Area:**\n    *   Total Shaded Area = Area of Quadrilateral - Area of Sector\n    *   Total Shaded Area = `578 - 1156 * arctan(0.5)`.\n\nNow, we can use Python to compute the final numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values from the image\nradius = 34\ntangent_length = 17\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the area of the quadrilateral.\n# The quadrilateral is composed of two identical right-angled triangles.\n# The legs of each triangle are the radius and the tangent line.\narea_of_one_triangle = 0.5 * radius * tangent_length\narea_of_quadrilateral = 2 * area_of_one_triangle\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the area of the circular sector.\n# First, find the angle of the sector in radians.\n# The angle for one triangle is alpha = arctan(opposite/adjacent).\n# The total angle is 2 * alpha.\ntotal_angle_rad = 2 * math.atan(tangent_length / radius)\n\n# The area of the sector is 0.5 * r^2 * theta.\narea_of_sector = 0.5 * (radius**2) * total_angle_rad\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total shaded area.\ntotal_shaded_area = area_of_quadrilateral - area_of_sector\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The total shaded area is the area of the quadrilateral minus the area of the circular sector.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: Area = (2 * (1/2 * {radius} * {tangent_length})) - (1/2 * {radius}^2 * (2 * arctan({tangent_length}/{radius})))\")\nprint(f\"Area = {int(area_of_quadrilateral)} - {radius**2} * arctan({tangent_length/radius})\")\nprint(f\"Area = {int(area_of_quadrilateral)} - {area_of_sector:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Area = {total_shaded_area:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<42.0234>>>"
