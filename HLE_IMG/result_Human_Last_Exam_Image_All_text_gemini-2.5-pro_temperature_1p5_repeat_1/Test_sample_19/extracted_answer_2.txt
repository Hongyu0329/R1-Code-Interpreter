1. The music modulates to the key of E major. This modulation is prepared in measure 10 with the dominant of E (a B major chord) and resolves on the E major tonic chord in measure 12.
2. The home key is C# minor. The justification for modulating to E major is that it is the relative major of C# minor. They share the same key signature of four sharps, making it a very closely related and common modulation that provides a contrast in mode from minor to major.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is **I 6/4** in the new key of E major. The chord consists of a B in the bass (the dominant of E) with notes of the E major triad (E and G#) above it, forming the characteristic 6th and 4th intervals of a cadential 6/4 chord, which functions as part of the dominant harmony.
