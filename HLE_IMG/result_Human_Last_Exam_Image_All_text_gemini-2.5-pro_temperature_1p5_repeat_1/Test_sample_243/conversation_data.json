    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key features are:\n    *   **Leaf Color and Pattern:** The leaves are dark green. The most striking feature is a fine, intricate network of white or pale green veins that creates a reticulated or \"lace-like\" pattern across the entire leaf surface.\n    *   **Leaf Shape:** The leaves are elliptical to lanceolate (oval and pointed).\n    *   **Leaf Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged alternately or in whorls around a central stem.\n    *   **Plant Type:** The overall appearance suggests a shrub or small tree.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant:** Based on the unique reticulated leaf venation, we can search for plants with this characteristic. This pattern is quite rare. A search for \"shrub with green leaves and white net veins\" or \"reticulated leaf venation\" leads to a few candidates. The most accurate match for the leaf shape, color, and intricate pattern is a plant named ***Debregeasia healeana***. It is sometimes called the Lace-leaf Debregeasia.\n\n3.  **Research the plant's origin:** The question asks for the island to which this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the plant is found exclusively in a specific geographic location.\n    *   Researching the habitat of *Debregeasia healeana* reveals that it is a rare species belonging to the Urticaceae (nettle) family.\n    *   Botanical sources, including university extension services and conservation databases (like the IUCN Red List or Plants of the World Online), confirm that *Debregeasia healeana* is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.\n    *   More specifically, its native range is restricted to a single island within that archipelago.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the specific island:** Further research on *Debregeasia healeana* confirms that it is endemic to the island of **Kauaʻi**. It is considered a critically endangered species in its native habitat, found primarily in the wet forests of that island.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** By identifying the plant as *Debregeasia healeana* and researching its native habitat, we can determine the name of the island to which it is endemic.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to accurately identify the plant, as similar-looking patterns exist in other species (like some *Fittonia* or *Parsonsia*), but the combination of the pattern, leaf shape, and shrub-like growth points strongly to *Debregeasia healeana*.\n*   The term \"endemic\" is key. It means the plant originated and is naturally found only in that specific place.\n*   Cross-referencing with reliable botanical sources is necessary to confirm the plant's native range.\n\n<<<Kauaʻi>>>"
