    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis Framework**\n\nTo identify these rocks, we will observe their key characteristics, primarily **texture** (grain size, arrangement of grains, presence of holes) and **composition** (indicated by color). These features provide clues about the rock's formation process and help classify it as igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. All four specimens appear to be igneous rocks, which are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Specimen H**\n\n1.  **Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** Reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** This rock is full of small, visible holes or cavities. This texture is called **vesicular**. The underlying rock material appears to be very fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n2.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The vesicular texture indicates that gas bubbles were trapped within the lava as it cooled rapidly.\n    *   Rapid cooling occurs at or near the Earth's surface, so this is an **extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock**.\n    *   The reddish color suggests the presence of iron-bearing minerals that have been oxidized (rusted). This is common in mafic or intermediate lavas.\n3.  **Identification:** A highly vesicular, mafic, extrusive igneous rock is called **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder).\n\n**Specimen I**\n\n1.  **Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** A mixture of colors. The cementing material (matrix) is light grey, while the embedded pieces (clasts) are of various colors, including grey, white, and reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of numerous, distinct, and angular fragments of other rocks that are cemented together. This is a **clastic** or **fragmental** texture.\n2.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   This rock is not formed from interlocking crystals that grew from a melt, but rather from consolidated debris.\n    *   The angularity of the fragments and the volcanic appearance of the clasts suggest it was formed from a violent volcanic eruption.\n3.  **Identification:** A rock composed of angular volcanic fragments (like ash, lapilli, and bombs) cemented together is a pyroclastic rock. Specifically, it is a **Volcanic Breccia**.\n\n**Specimen J**\n\n1.  **Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** Very light, typically off-white or light grey.\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, this rock is highly vesicular and appears very porous and lightweight. The grain size is aphanitic (fine-grained).\n2.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The combination of a vesicular texture and a light (felsic) color is key. Felsic lavas are silica-rich and viscous, which allows them to trap a lot of gas, creating a frothy texture upon cooling.\n    *   This is also an **extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock**.\n3.  **Identification:** A lightweight, highly vesicular, felsic volcanic rock is known as **Pumice**. It is often so porous that it can float on water.\n\n**Specimen K**\n\n1.  **Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** A mix of light and dark minerals. There are large, prominent, light-colored (white, cream, pinkish) crystals and darker (greenish or black) minerals filling the gaps.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of very large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This texture is **coarse-grained (phaneritic)**. There are no vesicles.\n2.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The large crystal size indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, allowing the crystals ample time to grow.\n    *   Slow cooling happens deep beneath the Earth's surface, meaning this is an **intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock**.\n    *   The crystal size is exceptionally large (several millimeters to centimeters).\n3.  **Identification:** An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals is called a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are typically granitic in composition but are defined by their very coarse texture.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria (a vesicular, mafic volcanic rock)\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia (a rock made of cemented, angular volcanic fragments)\n*   **J:** Pumice (a lightweight, vesicular, felsic volcanic rock)\n*   **K:** Pegmatite (a very coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
