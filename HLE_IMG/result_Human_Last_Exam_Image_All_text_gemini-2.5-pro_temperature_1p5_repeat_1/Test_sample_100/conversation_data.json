    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-3-one system.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    1.  A PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group attached to the nitrogen atom (N). The formula of the PMB group is C8H9O.\n    2.  A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to the double bond.\n    3.  A carbonyl group (=O) as part of the lactam ring.\n*   Let's count the atoms to determine the molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** The bicyclic core without the N has 6 carbons. The CF3 group has 1 carbon. The PMB group has a benzene ring (6 C), a CH2 group (1 C), and a CH3 group (1 C), for a total of 8 carbons. Total C = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** On the bicyclic core: C1(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C7(2H) = 5 H. On the PMB group: aromatic ring(4H), CH2(2H), OCH3(3H) = 9 H. Total H = 5 + 9 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 from the CF3 group.\n    *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 in the lactam ring.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 from the carbonyl group and 1 from the methoxy group on PMB. Total O = 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Oxidative deprotection. CAN is a standard reagent used to remove the PMB protecting group from nitrogen atoms. The PMB group is oxidized and cleaved, leaving a secondary amine (N-H).\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. The by-product is p-methoxybenzaldehyde (C8H8O).\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Start with the starting material: C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O): C15-8 H14-9 F3 N O2-1 = C7H5F3NO.\n    *   Add one hydrogen atom to the nitrogen: C7H(5+1)F3NO = C7H6F3NO.\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   **Transformation:** The double bond in the bicycloheptene ring is hydrogenated. This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the C=C bond.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Add two hydrogen atoms (H2): C7H(6+2)F3NO = C7H8F3NO.\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   **Transformation:** Amide hydrolysis involves the cleavage of the carbonyl carbon-nitrogen bond (C-N) and the addition of a water molecule (H2O). The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) in the acidic conditions. However, the molecular formula is typically written for the neutral molecule. The overall transformation adds H2O to the molecule.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n    *   Add one molecule of water (H2O): C7H(8+2)F3N(O1+1) = C7H10F3NO2.\n*   To verify, the product is a cyclopentane ring substituted with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), an amino group (-NH2), and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3).\n    *   **C:** 5 (in the ring) + 1 (in COOH) + 1 (in CF3) = 7.\n    *   **H:** Let's count on the final structure (a substituted cyclopentane amino acid). There are 7 H on the ring, 1 H in COOH, and 2 H in NH2, for a total of 10 H.\n    *   **F:** 3.\n    *   **N:** 1.\n    *   **O:** 2 (in COOH).\n*   The count matches. The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n- Starting material: C15H14F3NO2\n- Step 1 (CAN): - C8H8O (loss of p-methoxybenzaldehyde) -> C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\n- Step 2 (Pd/C, H2): + H2 -> C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\n- Step 3 (HCl, H2O, heat): + H2O -> C7H10F3NO2 (Product)\n\nThe final molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
