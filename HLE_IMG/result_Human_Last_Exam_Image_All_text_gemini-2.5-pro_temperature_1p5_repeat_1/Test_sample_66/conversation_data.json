    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the figure and identify key components.**\nThe figure consists of a large circular sector with a radius R and a total angle of 4θ. The sector is centered at the bottom vertex, let's call it O. The sector is divided into four smaller sectors, each with an angle θ. Let the radii defining these sectors be r₀, r₁, r₂, r₃, and r₄ from left to right. Let P₀, P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄ be the corresponding points on the circular arc.\n\nThe total shaded area is the sum of four smaller shaded regions, which we can call R₁, R₂, R₃, and R₄, corresponding to the sectors OP₀P₁, OP₁P₂, OP₂P₃, and OP₃P₄, respectively. The problem provides numerical values R=34 for the radius and a length of 17, which are used to define the geometry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the angle θ.**\nOn the left side of the figure, a construction is shown with blue lines. A line segment representing a radius has length 34. Let this be the radius OP₀. So, R = 34. Another line segment of length 17 is shown. This appears to be a tangent to the circle at point P₀, as indicated by the right-angle symbol at P₀. Let's call the endpoint of this tangent segment T. So we have a right-angled triangle OP₀T, with the right angle at P₀.\nThe legs of the triangle are OA = R = 34 and P₀T = 17.\nThe angle at the center, ∠P₀OT, is given by the tangent function:\ntan(∠P₀OT) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) = P₀T / OP₀ = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\nThe diagram labels the angle of each of the four small sectors as θ. It is reasonable to assume that this construction is provided to define the value of θ. Thus, we have θ = arctan(1/2).\n\nFor calculations, we will also need sin(θ) and cos(θ). From tan(θ) = 1/2, we can construct a right triangle with opposite side 1, adjacent side 2, and hypotenuse √(1² + 2²) = √5.\nSo, sin(θ) = 1/√5 and cos(θ) = 2/√5.\nThis means sin(θ)cos(θ) = (1/√5)(2/√5) = 2/5.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the different types of shaded regions.**\nLooking closely at the diagram, the constructions for the shaded regions at the ends (R₁ and R₄) seem different from the ones in the middle (R₂ and R₃). This is hinted at by the blue and red polygons being distinct entities. Let's assume there are two types of shapes.\n\n*   **Type A (Tangent-based shape):** This corresponds to the leftmost region R₁ (and by symmetry, the rightmost region R₄). The shape is formed by the tangent construction described in Step 2. The shaded area is the area of the right triangle OP₀T minus the area of the circular sector OP₀P₁.\n    Area(R₁) = Area(Triangle OP₀T) - Area(Sector OP₀P₁).\n    Area(Triangle OP₀T) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OP₀ * P₀T = (1/2) * 34 * 17 = 289.\n    Area(Sector OP₀P₁) = (1/2) * R² * θ = (1/2) * 34² * θ = 578θ.\n    So, Area(R₁) = 289 - 578θ.\n    By symmetry, we assume R₄ is also a Type A region, so Area(R₄) = 289 - 578θ.\n\n*   **Type B (Perpendicular-based shape):** This corresponds to the inner regions R₂ and R₃. For region R₂, the diagram shows a line drawn from P₂ perpendicular to the radius r₁ (OP₁), meeting at a point H. The shaded area R₂ is the region bounded by the arc P₁P₂, the segment P₂H, and the segment HP₁. The area of this shape can be calculated as the area of the sector OP₁P₂ minus the area of the right-angled triangle OP₁H. No, this interpretation leads to issues.\n    Let's calculate the area of region R₂ bounded by arc P₁P₂, segment P₂H and segment HP₁. We can set up a coordinate system with O at the origin and P₁ on the x-axis. So P₁=(R,0). Then P₂=(Rcosθ, Rsinθ). The line r₁ is the x-axis. H is the projection of P₂ onto the x-axis, so H=(Rcosθ, 0).\n    The area is the area under the circular arc y=√(R²-x²) from x=Rcosθ to x=R.\n    Area(R₂) = ∫[Rcosθ, R] √(R²-x²) dx.\n    This integral evaluates to (R²/2)(θ - sinθcosθ).\n    Area(R₂) = (34²/2)(θ - sinθcosθ) = 578(θ - sinθcosθ).\n    Using sinθcosθ = 2/5 from Step 2, we have:\n    Area(R₂) = 578(θ - 2/5).\n    By symmetry, R₃ is also a Type B region, so Area(R₃) = 578(θ - 2/5).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total shaded area.**\nThe total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the four regions.\nTotal Area = Area(R₁) + Area(R₂) + Area(R₃) + Area(R₄).\nTotal Area = 2 * Area(Type A) + 2 * Area(Type B).\nTotal Area = 2 * (289 - 578θ) + 2 * [578(θ - 2/5)].\nNow, we substitute the expressions and simplify.\nTotal Area = (578 - 1156θ) + (1156θ - 1156 * (2/5)).\nThe terms with θ cancel out, which is a sign of an elegant problem design.\nTotal Area = 578 - 1156 * (2/5).\nTotal Area = 578 - 2312/5.\nTotal Area = 578 - 462.4.\nTotal Area = 115.6."
