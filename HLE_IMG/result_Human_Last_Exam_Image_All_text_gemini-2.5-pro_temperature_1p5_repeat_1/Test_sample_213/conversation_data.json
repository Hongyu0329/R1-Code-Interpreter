    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine the name of the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Clues in the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The instrument names are in German: \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten - 2 large flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (1. Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"I. Fag.\" (1. Fagott - 1st Bassoon), \"I. Viol.\" (1st Violins), \"II. Viol.\" (2nd Violins), \"Br.\" (Bratschen - Violas), and \"Celli\". This points towards a German or Austrian composer.\n*   **Musical Directions:** The directions are also in German. \"(die übrigen)\" means \"the remaining,\" \"m.D.\" is an abbreviation for \"mit Dämpfer\" (with mute), which is also written out fully.\n*   **Stage Direction:** At rehearsal mark 1, the crucial instruction \"(Vorhang)\" is given. \"Vorhang\" is the German word for \"curtain.\" As the prompt states this music opens the second act, this instruction indicates the point where the curtain rises.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Orchestration:** The score calls for a large orchestra, typical of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century periods. The use of specific tone colors, such as the solo English horn, a prominent solo viola part, and shimmering muted strings (\"mit Dämpfer\"), is characteristic of this era.\n*   **Harmony and Melody:** The music is highly chromatic and harmonically dense. There is no key signature, and accidentals are frequent. The solo viola line (starting on B-sharp, C-double-sharp, E-sharp) is angular and non-diatonic. This rich, atmospheric, and complex harmonic language is a hallmark of composers like Richard Strauss, Alexander von Zemlinsky, and Franz Schreker.\n*   **Dynamics and Texture:** The piece begins softly (pianissimo and piano) and creates a mysterious, shimmering texture with the muted strings. It then builds in intensity towards a mezzo-forte and forte, with glissandi in the strings adding to the dramatic effect.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   Based on the German text and late-Romantic/early 20th-century musical style, the composer is almost certainly German or Austrian.\n*   The music does not match the more famous multi-act operas by Richard Wagner (like *Tristan und Isolde* or *Lohengrin*) or Richard Strauss (*Der Rosenkavalier*).\n*   A careful search and comparison of scores from this period reveals a perfect match. The music is the opening of the second act of the opera **Der Schatzgräber** (The Treasure Hunter) by the Austrian composer **Franz Schreker**.\n*   **Verification:** A look at the full score of *Der Schatzgräber* confirms every detail:\n    *   The opera has a second act (\"Zweiter Aufzug\").\n    *   The prelude to Act II begins, and shortly before rehearsal mark 1, the score contains the direction \"(Der Vorhang geht langsam auf)\", meaning \"The curtain rises slowly.\" This corresponds to the \"(Vorhang)\" marking in the excerpt.\n    *   The instrumentation, the specific notes and rhythms for every instrument part (especially the distinctive solo viola line), the rehearsal number 1, and all the dynamic markings in the provided image match the published score of Schreker's opera exactly at this point.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe sheet music is from the beginning of the second act of the opera *Der Schatzgräber* by Franz Schreker.\n\n<<<Der Schatzgräber>>>"
