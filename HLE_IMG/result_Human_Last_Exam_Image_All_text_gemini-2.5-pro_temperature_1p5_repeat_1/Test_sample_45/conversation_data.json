    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the rotational symmetry of the given tiling pattern. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' (or n-fold rotational symmetry) means that the tiling looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point (the center of rotation). The question asks for the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling, which is typically taken to be the highest order of rotation found anywhere in the pattern.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:** The tiling is composed of three types of polygons (tiles), distinguished by color:\n    *   Dark blue polygons that appear to be hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow polygons that appear to be squares.\n    *   Orange polygons that are rhombi (or diamonds).\n\n3.  **Search for Centers of Rotation:** We need to find points in the tiling that can act as centers of rotation. We can test different types of points, such as the centers of the polygons or the vertices where several polygons meet.\n\n    *   **Center of a light yellow square:** Let's pick a square and consider its center. The square itself has 4-fold symmetry. The pattern immediately surrounding the square consists of four identical orange rhombi, one on each side. The arrangement of the entire tiling around the center of a square is symmetrical under a 90° (360°/4) rotation. Therefore, the center of each square is a center of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n    *   **Center of a dark blue hexagon:** Let's examine a blue hexagon and its center. It is surrounded by three yellow squares and three orange rhombi, arranged in an alternating fashion around its perimeter. If we rotate the pattern by 120° (360°/3) around the center of this hexagon, each square maps onto the position of another square, and each rhombus maps onto the position of another rhombus. The larger pattern also aligns perfectly. Therefore, the center of each blue hexagon is a center of **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem:** This is a fundamental principle for periodic patterns like this tiling. The theorem states that for any 2D discrete lattice (which is the basis of a periodic tiling), the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. Furthermore, if a tiling possesses both 3-fold and 4-fold rotational symmetry, its overall symmetry group must also include **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Identify the 6-fold Rotation Center:** Based on the theorem, we know a 6-fold rotation center must exist. Let's find it in the pattern.\n    *   Consider the vertices where two dark blue hexagons and two orange rhombi meet. Let's call such a vertex point 'P'.\n    *   Look at the arrangement of tiles around 'P'. There is a ring of six yellow squares arranged in a hexagonal shape centered on 'P'.\n    *   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° (360°/6) around point 'P', each square in this ring will move to the position of the next square in the ring. The whole pattern superimposes on itself.\n    *   Thus, these specific vertices are the centers of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The tiling exhibits multiple types of rotational symmetry (2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold) at different locations. The question \"what is the rotational symmetry of that tiling?\" asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry present, which characterizes the overall symmetry of the pattern. The highest order we have found is 6.\n\nTherefore, the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6>>>"
