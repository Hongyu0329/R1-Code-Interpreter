    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The electrophile, the propanoyl cation ([CH₃CH₂CO]⁺), is generated from the reaction between propanoyl chloride and AlCl₃. This electrophile then attacks the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product of this reaction is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination. We need to determine where the bromine atom will attach to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) will be directed to the *meta* position (position 3) relative to the acyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** 3-Br-C₆H₄-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a powerful reduction method. It can reduce multiple functional groups.\n        *   **Ketone Reduction:** The ketone group (C=O) will be reduced. In the context of Friedel-Crafts synthesis, this reduction often implies complete reduction of the ketone to a methylene group (CH₂). This is a standard method to create alkylbenzenes while avoiding rearrangements associated with Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n        *   **Dehalogenation:** The carbon-bromine bond on an aromatic ring (aryl halide) is susceptible to cleavage by catalytic hydrogenation (a process called hydrogenolysis). The bromine atom will be replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** Both the ketone and the bromo group are reduced. The overall transformation converts 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one into propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (*N*-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination at the most reactive position. For alkylbenzenes, the most reactive C-H bonds are at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring). This is because abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom leads to a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical.\n    *   **Selectivity:** In propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃), the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group adjacent to the ring. The radical formed at this position (C₆H₅-ĊH-CH₂-CH₃) is much more stable than radicals formed at other positions on the alkyl chain.\n    *   **Final Product:** The bromine atom from NBS will replace one of the hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position.\n    *   **Name of the Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** C₆H₅-CH(Br)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
