False. All the religious symbols depicted in the image, including the large anthropomorphic figures (shamans), the sun symbol, and the horned serpent, are characteristic motifs of the Pecos River Style rock art from ancient Southwest cultures. There are no discernible symbols from other unrelated cultures.
