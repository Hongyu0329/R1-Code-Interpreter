    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the expected pattern.**\nFirst, we need to know what the projection of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice looks like when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n*   **FCC Structure:** In an FCC lattice, atoms are located at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of its 6 faces.\n*   **[110] Viewing Direction:** This direction corresponds to looking along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell.\n*   **Projected Pattern:** When the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the resulting pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means there are atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and another atom exactly in the center of that rectangle.\n*   **Stacking:** This pattern is formed by a stacking of atomic planes. Planes of atoms that form the corners of the rectangles alternate with planes of atoms that form the centers. This is often referred to as an ABAB... stacking sequence.\n*   **Aspect Ratio:** For a cubic lattice, the rectangle formed in the [110] projection has side lengths proportional to `a` and `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant. The ratio of the side lengths is therefore `√2 : 1`, which is approximately `1.414`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each image against the expected pattern.**\nThe provided images show 3D arrangements of atoms within a defined volume. The XY plane of the graphs represents the viewing plane, and the depth shows the stacking of atoms along the viewing direction. We are looking for the image whose projection onto the XY plane matches the centered rectangular pattern with the correct properties.\n\n**Analysis of Image A:**\n*   **Pattern:** The atoms in the XY projection form a simple rectangular grid. For example, atoms at approximately (2,6), (5,6), (2,9), and (5,9) form a rectangle.\n*   **Centering:** There is no atom at the center of this rectangle (which would be at x=3.5, y=7.5).\n*   **Conclusion:** This pattern is a primitive rectangle, not a centered rectangle. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Image B:**\n*   **Pattern:** The atoms in the XY projection do not form a clear rectangular lattice. The arrangement appears more complex and irregular. It does not fit the centered rectangle description.\n*   **Conclusion:** B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Image C:**\n*   **Pattern:** We can identify a rectangle formed by atoms at approximately (2,7), (8,7), (2,14), and (8,14). The center of this rectangle is at (5, 10.5). There is an atom in a deeper plane located at (5,11) in the XY projection, which is very close to the center. This appears to be a centered rectangle.\n*   **Aspect Ratio:** The side lengths of the rectangle are `(8-2) = 6` units and `(14-7) = 7` units. The ratio of the sides is `7/6 ≈ 1.17`. This value is not close to the expected ratio of `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Although it shows a centered rectangle, the aspect ratio is wrong for an FCC lattice. Therefore, C is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of Image D:**\n*   **Pattern:** We can clearly identify a rectangle formed by atoms at (1,6), (5,6), (1,12), and (5,12). The center of this rectangle is at `( (1+5)/2, (6+12)/2 ) = (3, 9)`. There is an atom located exactly at this central position in the XY projection. This is a perfect centered rectangle. The pattern repeats throughout the depicted volume (e.g., another centered rectangle from y=8 to y=14).\n*   **Stacking:** The 3D drawing shows that the corner atoms are in one plane (at the same depth), while the centering atom is in a different plane (deeper), which correctly represents the AB stacking sequence.\n*   **Aspect Ratio:** The side lengths of the rectangle are `(5-1) = 4` units and `(12-6) = 6` units. The ratio of the sides is `6/4 = 1.5`. This value is very close to the theoretical ratio of `√2 ≈ 1.414`. The slight difference is acceptable for a schematic drawing.\n*   **Conclusion:** Image D matches all the key features of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction: a centered rectangular pattern, correct stacking, and the correct aspect ratio.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, image D is the correct representation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
