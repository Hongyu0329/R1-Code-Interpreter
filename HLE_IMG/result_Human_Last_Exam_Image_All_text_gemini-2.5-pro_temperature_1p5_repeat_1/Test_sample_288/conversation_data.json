    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical artist who played at the venue on the specified date.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe primary task is to identify the building in the background of the image. The building has several distinct architectural features:\n*   Red brick facade, with sections of herringbone brickwork.\n*   A curved, prominent roofline on the left side.\n*   A decorative, quatrefoil-shaped emblem on the beige stucco wall.\n*   An open-air section on the second floor with a white, crisscross lattice railing.\n*   The large semi-truck with a custom sleeper cab and trailer parked in front strongly suggests that this is a performance venue, such as a theater or concert hall, equipped to handle touring productions.\n\nA visual search based on these architectural details identifies the building as the **Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox**, located in Spokane, Washington.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Event Schedule**\nThe question asks for the name of the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the Performer**\nWith the venue name and date identified, the next step is to search for the official event calendar or past events list for the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox. A search for \"Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox events October 12 2023\" will provide the necessary information.\n\n**Step 4: Acquire the Final Answer**\nSearching the theater's past events schedule confirms that on Thursday, October 12, 2023, the featured musical performance was by **Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes**. The presence of the large tour truck in the photo is consistent with a major international touring act like the Gipsy Kings.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date the photo was taken (2024) is a piece of contextual information but is distinct from the date of the event in question (2023). The image is solely for identifying the location.\n*   It's important to correctly identify the venue first, as that is the key to finding the event schedule.\n*   The name of the artist should be as specific as listed by the venue. In this case, it was \"Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes\".\n\n<<<Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes>>>"
