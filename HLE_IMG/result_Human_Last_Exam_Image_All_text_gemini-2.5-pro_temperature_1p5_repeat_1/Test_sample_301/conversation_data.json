    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** The work depicts four cartoonish fish. This playful, modern, and graphic style using simple lines and color washes is a signature of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, a famous contemporary Chinese artist known for his animal motifs.\n    2.  **Artwork 2 (Top Middle):** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The vigorous brushwork, especially for the rock and stems, combined with the subject matter, is characteristic of **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**, a leading figure of the Shanghai School in the late Qing Dynasty.\n    3.  **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a realistic oil portrait of a woman from an ethnic minority. The classical, refined technique and profound character study are hallmarks of **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a master of Neoclassicism in Chinese oil painting. This work is one of his famous portraits from the 1980s.\n    4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly energetic and distinctive cursive script (草书, caoshu). This powerful, fluid, and unrestrained style is the well-known \"Mao style\" (毛体) calligraphy of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n    5.  **Artwork 5 (Center):** This painting combines modern abstract elements (large colored circles representing celestial bodies) with traditional Chinese ink wash techniques for the landscape at the bottom. This innovative synthesis is the signature style of **Liu Guosong (刘国松)**, a key pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n    6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** This is a piece of calligraphy featuring neat yet dynamic characters. Based on the content (discussing Tang dynasty steles, as partially visible in the OCR) and the distinct style of the running-cursive script (行草), this is identified as the work of **Huang Tingjian (黄庭坚)**, one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Song Dynasty. This specific piece is his famous \"Postscript to Biographies of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru\".\n    7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This is another example of cursive script calligraphy, but this one is exceptionally wild and expressive, with dramatic variations in ink wetness and brush speed. This \"crazy cursive\" style is the hallmark of the Ming Dynasty artist and calligrapher **Xu Wei (徐渭)**.\n    8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a highly realistic and famous oil portrait of a young woman against a dark, leafy background. The romantic, melancholic mood and delicate, smooth rendering are characteristic of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary realism. This painting is titled \"Youth\".\n    9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** This painting depicts a woman in stylized, elegant attire. The use of strong ink lines to define the form, combined with rich, flat planes of color, is the distinctive style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, who masterfully blended Chinese and Western art principles.\n\n*   **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **Style Recognition:** The primary method is to recognize the unique and famous style of each artist. This includes brushwork in painting and calligraphy, color palette, subject matter, and overall composition.\n    *   **Art Historical Context:** Knowing the period and school of each artist helps confirm the attribution. For example, distinguishing between the Song dynasty calligraphy of Huang Tingjian, the Ming dynasty calligraphy of Xu Wei, and the modern calligraphy of Mao Zedong. Similarly, recognizing the different movements in 20th-century Chinese oil painting represented by Jin Shangyi and Chen Yifei.\n    *   **Subject Matter:** Certain artists are famous for specific subjects (Han Meilin's animals, Wu Changshuo's flowers and plants, Lin Fengmian's ladies, Liu Guosong's space landscapes).\n    *   **Specific Famous Works:** Several of these are iconic masterpieces in Chinese art history (e.g., works by Jin Shangyi, Chen Yifei, Huang Tingjian), making them more easily identifiable for those familiar with the field.\n    *   **OCR and Signatures:** While OCR can be unreliable and signatures hard to read, they can provide supplementary clues. The OCR of image 6 hints at its content (discussing stone tablets), which aligns with the known work by Huang Tingjian.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    Following the analysis from left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\n    1.  Han Meilin\n    2.  Wu Changshuo\n    3.  Jin Shangyi\n    4.  Mao Zedong\n    5.  Liu Guosong\n    6.  Huang Tingjian\n    7.  Xu Wei\n    8.  Chen Yifei\n    9.  Lin Fengmian\n\n<<<Han Meilin, Wu Changshuo, Jin Shangyi, Mao Zedong, Liu Guosong, Huang Tingjian, Xu Wei, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian>>>"
