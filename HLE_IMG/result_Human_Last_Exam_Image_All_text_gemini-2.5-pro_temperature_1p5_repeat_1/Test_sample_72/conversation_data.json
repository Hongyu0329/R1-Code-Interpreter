    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:**\n    1.  **Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆):** A six-membered aromatic ring with a cyclic, conjugated 6π-electron system.\n    2.  **Cyclobutene (C₄H₆):** A four-membered ring containing one double bond (a 2π-electron system). The stereochemistry shown with two *cis* hydrogens on the saturated carbons is a detail of the specific reactant.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` (light). This means the rules for photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules for excited states) will apply.\n*   **Question Prompt:** We are explicitly told that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the First Pericyclic Reaction**\nA common photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is valence isomerization. One of the most well-known photo-induced valence isomers of benzene is Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation converts the aromatic six-membered ring into two fused four-membered rings.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n    *   C₆F₆ --(hν)--> bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (with F atoms on all 6 carbons).\n*   **Classification of Reaction 1:** Let's determine the type of pericyclic reaction. This transformation can be viewed as the closure of a 4π electron segment within the benzene ring. For instance, considering the C1-C2-C3-C4 portion of the ring as a 4π system, a bond is formed between C1 and C4.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for electrocyclic reactions, a 4π electron system undergoes a disrotatory ring closure under photochemical conditions. This stereochemical mode is feasible for the formation of the C1-C4 bond in Dewar benzene.\n    *   Therefore, the first reaction is a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction** (or more simply, an **electrocyclic reaction**).\n\n**Step 3: Propose the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\nThe intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is highly strained and reactive. It contains two isolated double bonds, each within a four-membered ring. This intermediate then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene → Final Product.\n    *   The reaction involves the π-bond of cyclobutene (a 2π system) and one of the π-bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (also a 2π system).\n    *   These two alkene systems react to form a new four-membered ring (a cyclobutane ring), linking the two molecules together.\n*   **Classification of Reaction 2:** This type of reaction, where two π systems combine to form a cyclic compound with two new sigma bonds, is a cycloaddition.\n    *   Specifically, it involves a 2π system reacting with another 2π system, making it a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for cycloadditions, a [2+2] cycloaddition (a 4-electron process) is allowed to proceed via a supra-suprafacial pathway under photochemical conditions. This is a common and favorable reaction mode for two alkenes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe overall transformation can be understood as a two-step sequence of pericyclic reactions:\n1.  First, hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical **electrocyclic reaction** to form its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n2.  Second, the highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene undergoes a photochemical **[2+2] cycloaddition** with cyclobutene to form the final tricyclic product.\n\n*Careful Point:* The structure of the final product as drawn in the image does not perfectly correspond to the expected product from a simple [2+2] cycloaddition between Dewar benzene and cyclobutene. The actual product of that reaction would be a more complex tetracyclic \"housane\" derivative. However, the drawing, showing a linear fusion of three four-membered rings (one of which has a double bond), is likely a schematic representation meant to suggest that the Dewar benzene structure (two fused 4-membered rings) has reacted with cyclobutene (a 4-membered ring). Given the context of identifying two pericyclic reactions, the proposed mechanism is the most logical and common pathway that fits the criteria. The key is to identify the *types* of reactions involved in the transformation.\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
