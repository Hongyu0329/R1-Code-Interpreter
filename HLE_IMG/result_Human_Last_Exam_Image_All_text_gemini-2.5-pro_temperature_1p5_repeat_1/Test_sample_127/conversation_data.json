    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principle**\nThe question asks about the free rotation of the peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L). The ability of a phenyl ring to rotate around the single C-C bond that connects it to the main molecular framework depends on the steric hindrance it experiences from nearby atoms or groups. If bulky groups are positioned close to the bond of rotation, they will clash and prevent or severely restrict free rotation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the environment of each peripheral phenyl ring.**\n\n*   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to carbon C2 of the central phenyl ring A. The adjacent carbon on ring A, C3, is attached to pyridine ring B. This means that ring K and ring B are attached to adjacent carbons of ring A (an *ortho* relationship). When ring K attempts to rotate, its hydrogen atoms (at positions 2 and 6 of ring K) will bump into the atoms of ring B. This creates a significant steric clash, which will severely hinder or prevent the free rotation of ring K.\n\n*   **Ring L:** The situation for ring L is identical to that of ring K. Ring L is attached to carbon C2 of the central phenyl ring C. The adjacent carbon C3 is attached to pyridine ring D. This *ortho* relationship between the bulky ring L and ring D will cause a severe steric clash upon rotation. Therefore, free rotation of ring L is also hindered.\n\n*   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of the central phenyl ring A. This position is *para* to the C1-C6 axis and *meta* to the C3 position (where ring B is attached) and the C5 position (which has a hydrogen atom). The groups adjacent to the point of attachment are further away compared to the *ortho* case of ring K. While there might be some minor interaction, there is no major steric barrier preventing rotation. Therefore, ring H can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of the central phenyl ring C. This arrangement is analogous to ring H. It is *meta* to the substituent ring D. The steric environment is not crowded enough to prevent rotation. Therefore, ring J can also rotate freely.\n\n*   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of the pyridine ring D. The adjacent positions on ring D are the nitrogen atom (N), which is coordinated to the iridium center, and carbon C5, which has a hydrogen atom. For ring G to rotate, its ortho-hydrogens must pass by the nitrogen atom and the hydrogen on C5. Although the coordinated iridium complex is large, the direct steric hindrance at the point of rotation is less severe than the ortho-disubstituted cases of rings K and L. The rotation around this bond is considered to be free.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the findings.**\n\n*   Rings with hindered rotation (not free): K, L. This is due to the severe steric clash with the adjacent pyridine rings (B and D, respectively).\n*   Rings with free rotation: G, H, J. The steric hindrance around their attachment points is minimal.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given answer choices.**\n\nThe set of rings that can rotate freely is {G, H, J}. This matches answer choice E.\n\n*   A. G, J, L, K, H (Incorrect, as K and L are hindered)\n*   B. G, J, L, H (Incorrect, as L is hindered)\n*   C. G, J, K, H (Incorrect, as K is hindered)\n*   D. L, K, J, H (Incorrect, as L and K are hindered)\n*   E. G, J, H (Correct)\n*   F. L, J, H (Incorrect, as L is hindered)\n*   G. K, J, H (Incorrect, as K is hindered)\n*   H. J, H (Incomplete, G can also rotate)\n*   I. J, G (Incomplete, H can also rotate)\n*   J. G, H (Incomplete, J can also rotate)\n*   K. G (Incomplete)\n*   L. J (Incomplete)\n*   M. H (Incomplete)\n*   N. none (Incorrect)\n\n<<<E>>>"
