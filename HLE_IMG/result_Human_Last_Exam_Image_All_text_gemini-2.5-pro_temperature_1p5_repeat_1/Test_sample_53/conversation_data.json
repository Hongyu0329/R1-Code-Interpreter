    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Scene**\nThe image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase, decorated in the red-figure style (where figures are left in the red color of the clay against a black-painted background, with details added in black). The scene is dynamic and depicts a chariot in motion. We can identify several key elements:\n*   A two-wheeled chariot pulled by at least one horse (partially visible on the left).\n*   A driver in the chariot, holding reins. This figure wears a patterned long-sleeved garment and an elaborate headdress, often associated with Eastern figures in Greek art.\n*   A passenger, robed, sitting next to the driver.\n*   A nude male figure on the ground, positioned directly under the chariot wheel. His body is contorted as if he has fallen and is about to be run over.\n*   A winged figure (likely a deity or personification like Nike, the goddess of victory) hovering above the driver.\n*   Decorative patterns, such as the wave motif at the bottom and the palmette designs on the right, are typical of Greek vase painting.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Action**\nThe question asks to identify the \"figure leaving the chariot.\" While the driver and passenger are *in* the chariot, the nude male figure on the ground is depicted in a state of violent departure. He is not dismounting; he is falling or has been thrown. His position under the wheel indicates a catastrophic event, like a chariot crash. Therefore, he is the figure who is most actively and consequentially \"leaving the chariot.\"\n\n**Step 3: Connecting the Scene to Greek Mythology**\nThis dramatic scene of a fatal chariot race is a well-known subject in Greek mythology. It illustrates the story of the race between Pelops and King Oenomaus of Pisa.\n*   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus would force any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to compete against him in a chariot race. The king had magical horses from the war god Ares and had always won, killing every suitor. Pelops, the new suitor, won the race by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot by replacing the bronze linchpins with ones made of wax.\n*   **The Depiction:** During the race, the wax linchpins melted, the wheels of Oenomaus's chariot flew off, and he was thrown to his death. This vase painting captures that climactic moment.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Figures based on the Myth**\nBased on the mythological context, we can identify each figure in the scene:\n*   **The Driver:** This is the hero **Pelops**, who is winning the race. His \"foreign\" attire is a common artistic convention for heroic figures in South Italian vase painting of this period.\n*   **The Passenger:** This is **Hippodamia**, the prize for winning the race, who now rides alongside her future husband, Pelops.\n*   **The Winged Figure:** This is **Nike** (Victory) or sometimes identified as **Eros** (Love), symbolizing either the victory of Pelops or the love that motivated his quest.\n*   **The Figure Leaving the Chariot:** This nude male figure, being thrown from his crashing chariot and trampled, is King **Oenomaus**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe figure leaving the chariot, depicted as falling and being run over, is the defeated King Oenomaus, at the moment of his death as described in the Greek myth of his race against Pelops.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
