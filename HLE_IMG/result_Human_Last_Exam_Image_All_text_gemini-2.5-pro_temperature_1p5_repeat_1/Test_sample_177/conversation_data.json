    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1).\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = [ (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline ] * 100%\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **VMT Calculation:** Vehicle Miles Traveled is calculated by multiplying the number of vehicle trips by the average distance of those trips. The data is provided in categories based on trip distance, so we must calculate the VMT for each category and then sum them to get the total VMT.\n2.  **Car Trips:** Car trips are divided into two modes: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". To find the total car VMT, we need to sum the VMT from both of these modes.\n3.  **Proportional Calculation:** We don't know the absolute total number of trips, but we can calculate a proportional VMT index. The \"share of total trips\" for each distance category acts as a weighting factor. The unknown total number of trips is a common factor that will cancel out when we calculate the percentage reduction.\n4.  **Irrelevant Information:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) relate to Person Miles Traveled (PMT), not Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). A carpool trip is a single vehicle trip regardless of the number of occupants. Therefore, this data is not needed for the calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the VMT Index for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nWe calculate the VMT index for each distance category and then sum them. The formula for each category is:\n`VMT_contribution = (Share of total trips) * (Total car mode share) * (Average trip distance)`\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index (VMT_Baseline):**\n    *   VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the VMT Index for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT_contribution = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index (VMT_Proposed):**\n    *   VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction (Absolute):**\n    *   Reduction = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction:**\n    *   % Reduction = (Absolute Reduction / VMT_Baseline) * 100\n    *   % Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
