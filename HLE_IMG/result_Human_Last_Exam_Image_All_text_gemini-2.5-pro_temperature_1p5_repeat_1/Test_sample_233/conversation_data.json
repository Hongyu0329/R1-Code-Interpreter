    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ID of the Ingvar runestone in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe most striking feature of the runes in the image is their arrangement. They are carved within a well-defined grid, separated by both horizontal and vertical lines. This \"book-style\" or \"codex-like\" layout is extremely rare among runestones and serves as a primary clue for identification. The runes themselves are of the Younger Futhark script, which is typical for the Viking Age.\n\n**Step 2: Contextualize the question.**\nThe question specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". The Ingvar runestones are a specific group of about 30 runestones erected in memory of those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland) led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled around 1041 AD. Knowing this narrows down the search considerably.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the visual clues and the context to form a hypothesis.**\nThe task is to find an Ingvar runestone that features a unique grid-like or \"book-style\" inscription. A search for runestones with this characteristic, particularly within the Ingvar group, leads to a prominent candidate: the runestone located at Svinnegarn Church in Uppland, Sweden.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific runestone and verify with the inscription.**\nThe runestone at Svinnegarn Church is catalogued as **U 778**. It is famous for its unique and highly ordered inscription, which matches the style seen in the photograph. To confirm the identity, we can transcribe the runes visible in the fragment and compare them to the known inscription on U 778.\n\nThe full inscription on U 778 includes the following passage:\n*Old Norse:* ... `austr stýrði í Ingvars liði. Guð hjalpi önd Banka.`\n*Runic transliteration:* ... `austr + sturþi + i + ikuars + liþi + kuþ + hialbi + ot + banka +`\n\nLet's examine the fragment's visible rows:\n*   **Top Row:** The right side of the fragment shows the runes `...ᚱᚦᛁ : ᛁ : ᛁᚴ...` which transliterates to `...rþi : i : ik...`. This perfectly matches the end of the word `stýrði` and the beginning of `í Ingvars` (`...stur**þi : i : ik**uars...`).\n*   **Middle Row:** This row shows the runes `...ᚢᛅᚱᛋ : ᛚᛁᚦ...` which transliterates to `...uars : liþ...`. This corresponds to the remainder of `Ingvars` and the beginning of `liði` (`...ik**uars : liþ**i...`). The cross-shaped symbols are word separators.\n*   **Bottom Row:** This row shows `...ᛁ : ᚴᚢᚦ : ᚼᛁᛅ...` which transliterates to `...i : kuþ : hia...`. This matches the end of `liði` followed by `Guð hjalpi...` (`...liþ**i : kuþ : hia**lbi...`).\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\nThe combination of the unique visual style (grid pattern) and the perfect match between the runes in the fragment and the known inscription of the Svinnegarn runestone confirms its identity. Therefore, the Ingvar runestone depicted is U 778.\n\n<<<U 778>>>"
