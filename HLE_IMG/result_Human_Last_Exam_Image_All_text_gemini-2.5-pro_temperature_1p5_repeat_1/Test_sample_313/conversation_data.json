    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **The Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **The Image:** The image shows a man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older man. This is clearly an awards ceremony.\n*   **Identification:** A search for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   **Identifying the Person:** The man receiving the award is identifiable as Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov. At that ceremony, he won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players). Winning three major awards in one night is often referred to as a \"hat trick\".\n\n**Step 2: Connect the person in the image to the term \"X Y\".**\n*   Given that Nikita Kucherov won a \"hat trick\" of awards, a fitting term to describe him in this context is \"Hatter\" (as in, one who achieves a hat trick).\n*   So, we can hypothesize that X Y = Hatter. The first clue can be rephrased as: \"A 'Hatter' (Nikita Kucherov, who won a hat trick of awards) is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" This fits the visual evidence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue using the hypothesis \"X Y = Hatter\".**\n*   **The Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Applying the hypothesis:** \"Another Hatter has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Verification:** This clue refers to the historical profession of a hatter, a person who makes hats. In the 18th and 19th centuries, hatters used mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) in a process called \"carroting\" to turn fur into felt for hats.\n*   **Toxicity:** Chronic exposure to the mercury vapor caused neurological damage, a condition known as erethism or \"mad hatter disease.\" This is the origin of the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   **Cessation of Use:** Due to the severe health risks and toxicity of mercury, its use in the felt-making industry was eventually banned and has almost entirely ceased.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\n*   Both clues work perfectly with the answer \"Hatter\".\n*   The first clue points to Nikita Kucherov, a figurative \"Hatter\" for his 2019 awards hat trick.\n*   The second clue points to the literal profession of a \"Hatter\", a practice that was discontinued because of mercury poisoning.\n\nTherefore, X Y is \"Hatter\".\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
