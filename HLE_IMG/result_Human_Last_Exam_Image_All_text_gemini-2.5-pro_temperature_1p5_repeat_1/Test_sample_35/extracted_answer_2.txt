The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the **RAGE receptor**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker**. This is because the diagram illustrates a direct causal pathway where S100B's interaction with its receptor initiates and drives the core pathological processes of the disease, including neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression would directly correlate with the activity and severity of the disease process, allowing a researcher or clinician to predict the future course and outcome of the neurological disorder, which is the function of a prognostic marker.
