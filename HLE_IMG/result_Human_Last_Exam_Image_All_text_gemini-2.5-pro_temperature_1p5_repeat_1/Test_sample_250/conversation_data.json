    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musical Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There is one flat (Bb) in the key signature. This indicates the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n    *   **First Chord:** The first chord written is F-, which represents an F minor chord. The presence of a tonic minor chord at the beginning strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n\n2.  **Melody Identification:**\n    *   The most crucial clue is the melody itself. Let's transcribe the first few bars:\n    *   **Bar 1 (over F-):** The notes are C, F, G, Ab. This melodic phrase, especially the G natural moving to an Ab over an F minor harmony, is highly distinctive.\n    *   **Bar 2 (over E-7b5):** The notes are Bb, A.\n    *   **Bar 3 (over Eb-6):** The main melodic note is G.\n    *   **Bar 4 (over Dbmaj7 and G7):** The main notes are Eb, followed by B natural and D.\n    *   This opening melodic sequence (C-F-G-Ab) is the main theme of the jazz standard **\"Tadd's Delight\"**.\n\n3.  **Chord Progression Verification:**\n    *   To confirm the identification, we compare the chord progression on the sheet music to the standard changes for \"Tadd's Delight\".\n    *   **Sheet Music Progression (A section):**\n        *   | F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |\n        *   | C7 | F- | ... (with a C7 turnaround)\n    *   **Standard \"Tadd's Delight\" Progression (A section):**\n        *   | Fm7 | Eø7 | Eb7 | Dbmaj7 G7alt |\n        *   | C7 | Fm7 | Gø7 C7 |\n    *   The progressions are very similar. The E-7b5 (E half-diminished) is the same as Eø7. The Eb-6 is a common substitution for Eb7. The overall harmonic movement is identical, confirming the tune.\n\n4.  **Bridge Analysis:**\n    *   **Sheet Music Progression (Bridge):**\n        *   | D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |\n        *   | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |\n    *   **Standard \"Tadd's Delight\" Progression (Bridge):**\n        *   | Dø7 | G7alt | Cmaj7 | Cmaj7 |\n        *   | Bbm7 | Eb7 | Abmaj7 | Gø7 C7alt |\n    *   Again, the progressions align. The D-7b5 is the same as Dø7. The subsequent C7 | F7 is a common bebop reharmonization leading into the Bbm7. The rest of the bridge (ii-V-I in Ab major) and the final turnaround chords match the function of the standard changes.\n\n5.  **Composer Identification:**\n    *   The jazz standard \"Tadd's Delight\" (sometimes known as \"Fay's Dilemma\") was composed by the influential bebop pianist and arranger **Tadd Dameron**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinctive melodic theme and the corresponding chord progression, the piece of music is unambiguously identified.\n\n*   **Title:** Tadd's Delight\n*   **Composer:** Tadd Dameron\n\n<<<Title: Tadd's Delight, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
