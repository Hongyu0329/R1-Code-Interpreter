    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the checkmate in 2 moves for White.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Black King's Position:**\n    *   The Black King is located on `e4`.\n    *   We must identify its available escape squares.\n    *   The squares around the king are: `d3, d4, d5, e5, f5, f4, f3, e3`.\n    *   Let's check which are controlled by White or occupied by Black:\n        *   `d3`: Attacked by the White Rook on `f3`.\n        *   `e3`: Attacked by the White Rook on `f3`.\n        *   `f3`: Occupied by the White Rook on `f3`.\n        *   `f5`: Attacked by the White King on `h4`.\n        *   `d5`: Occupied by the Black Queen.\n        *   `e5`: Occupied by the Black pawn.\n        *   `f4`: Occupied by the Black pawn.\n    *   This leaves only one square: `d4`. The Black King's only legal move is to `d4`.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy for White:**\n    *   Since Black's only initial escape is to `d4`, White's first move must address this. A strong approach is to deliver a check that forces the king to move, limiting Black's options to just one response. This creates a forced sequence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the First Move: 1. Nc5+**\n    *   White moves the Knight from `b7` to `c5`.\n    *   This move attacks the Black King on `e4`, so it is a check.\n    *   Black is forced to move the King. As determined in the first step, the only square the king can move to is `d4`.\n    *   Therefore, Black's only possible reply is `1... Kd4`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Position After Black's Forced Move:**\n    *   The Black King is now on `d4`. White needs to deliver a checkmating move.\n    *   Let's analyze the new escape squares for the king on `d4`:\n        *   `d3`: Attacked by the Rook on `f3` AND the Knight on `c5`.\n        *   `e3`: Attacked by the Rook on `f3`.\n        *   `c5`: Occupied by the White Knight.\n        *   `d5`: Attacked by the Knight on `c5`.\n        *   `e4`: Attacked by the Knight on `c5`.\n        *   `e5`: Occupied by the Black Pawn.\n        *   The only remaining squares for the King to potentially escape to are `c3` and `c4`.\n    *   White's second move must be a check that also covers `c3` and `c4`.\n\n5.  **Find the Checkmating Second Move: 2. Qa2#**\n    *   White moves the Queen from `a4` to `a2`.\n    *   This delivers a check to the king on `d4` along the `a2-d4` diagonal.\n    *   Let's verify that this is checkmate:\n        *   **King's Moves:** The Queen on `a2` attacks `c4` along the rank and `c3` along the diagonal. Since all other escape squares were already covered, the King has no legal moves.\n        *   **Blocking:** The check occurs on the diagonal from `a2` to `d4`. No black piece can move to `b3` or `c3` to block the check.\n        *   **Capturing:** No black piece can capture the White Queen on `a2`.\n    *   The move `2. Qa2#` is a conclusive checkmate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two-move checkmate sequence is:\n1.  White moves the Knight from `b7` to `c5`, delivering check (`Nc5+`).\n2.  Black is forced to move the King from `e4` to `d4` (`Kd4`).\n3.  White moves the Queen from `a4` to `a2`, delivering checkmate (`Qa2#`).\n\n<<<1. Nc5+ Kd4 2. Qa2#>>>"
