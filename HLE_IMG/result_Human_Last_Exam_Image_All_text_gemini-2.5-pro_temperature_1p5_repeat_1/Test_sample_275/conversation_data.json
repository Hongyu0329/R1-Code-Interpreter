    "**Analysis of the RT-PCR Results**\n\nThe goal is to identify all the unique mRNA splice species revealed by the different RT-PCR experiments shown in the gel images. A splice species refers to a unique mRNA molecule produced by a specific pattern of splicing. We can identify these by looking for unique PCR products.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Tools:**\n    *   **Genome Map (A):** This shows the location of genes (E1, E2, etc.) and the binding sites for the forward primers (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3) and reverse primers (E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R).\n    *   **Splice-Junction Primers:** The problem explicitly states that primer E1F2 spans the `929^3465` splice junction, and primer E1F3 spans the `929^3506` splice junction. This means these primers will only amplify transcripts that have already undergone these specific splicing events.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each PCR Experiment (Panel B to I):**\n\n    *   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):**\n        *   This experiment uses a general forward primer (E1F1) in the E1 gene.\n        *   It produces two distinct bands (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This indicates the existence of at least two different splice species in the region between primers E1F1 and E4R. Let's call them **Species 1** (giving the 190 bp product) and **Species 2** (giving the 159 bp product). The size difference is 31 bp, indicating an alternative splicing event where a 31 bp intron is removed in Species 2.\n\n    *   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):**\n        *   This uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a more downstream reverse primer (E5R).\n        *   It also produces two bands (band 1: 584 bp; band 2: 553 bp).\n        *   The size difference is again 31 bp (584 - 553 = 31).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the existence of Species 1 and Species 2.\n\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):**\n        *   This uses the splice-junction primer E1F2 (`929^3465`).\n        *   It produces a single band (551 bp).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This identifies a new, distinct splice species that specifically contains the `929^3465` splice. Let's call this **Species 3**.\n\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):**\n        *   This also uses the E1F2 (`929^3465`) primer but with a different reverse primer (L2R).\n        *   It produces a single band (972 bp).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a longer amplification product of the same **Species 3** identified in Panel D, confirming its existence.\n\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):**\n        *   This uses the splice-junction primer E1F3 (`929^3506`).\n        *   It produces two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp).\n        *   **Conclusion:** Both these products must contain the `929^3506` splice (because the E1F3 primer was used). The fact that there are two different sizes means there is an additional, alternative splicing event downstream of the `929^3506` site. These represent two new, distinct splice species. Let's call them **Species 4** (1,003 bp) and **Species 5** (931 bp).\n\n    *   **Panel H & I (E1F1/L1R):**\n        *   This primer pair amplifies a large region from the early to the late genes. Panel I is a more sensitive version (more cycles) of Panel H.\n        *   Panel I shows four distinct bands:\n            *   Band 1 (450 bp) and Band 2 (419 bp): These were also visible in Panel H. Their size difference is 31 bp, corresponding to **Species 1** and **Species 2** identified in panels B and C.\n            *   Band 3 (378 bp): This is a new product not seen before, representing a new splice variant. Let's call it **Species 6**.\n            *   Band 4 (187 bp): This is another new product, also not seen before, representing another new splice variant. Let's call it **Species 7**.\n\n**Summary of Identified Splice Species:**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each experiment, we have found evidence for the following unique splice species:\n1.  **Species 1:** Detected by E1F1 primer. Corresponds to band 1 in panels B, C, H, and I.\n2.  **Species 2:** Detected by E1F1 primer, with a 31 bp deletion compared to Species 1. Corresponds to band 2 in panels B, C, H, and I.\n3.  **Species 3:** Defined by the `929^3465` splice. Detected as the single band in panels D and F.\n4.  **Species 4:** Defined by the `929^3506` splice. Corresponds to the larger band (band 1) in panel G.\n5.  **Species 5:** Defined by the `929^3506` splice, but with an additional downstream splice compared to Species 4. Corresponds to the smaller band (band 2) in panel G.\n6.  **Species 6:** A distinct splice variant detected with E1F1/L1R primers. Corresponds to band 3 in panel I.\n7.  **Species 7:** Another distinct splice variant detected with E1F1/L1R primers. Corresponds to band 4 in panel I.\n\n**Final Count:**\n\nBased on the distinct PCR products identified across all experiments, there are a total of 7 different splice species.\n\n<<<7>>>"
