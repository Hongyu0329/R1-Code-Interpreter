    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the graph to determine the timestamps of synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image provided is a raster plot. The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), and the y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128). Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing (spike) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time. A \"synchronized burst\" is an event where many neurons fire at nearly the same time, which appears visually as a dense vertical band of dots spanning a large portion of the electrodes.\n\n2.  **Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts:** By visually inspecting the raster plot, we can identify five distinct synchronized bursts. We estimate the timestamp by finding the approximate center of each burst along the time axis.\n    *   **Burst 1:** A clear burst is centered at approximately **2 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The next burst is centered at approximately **13 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** Another burst occurs with its center at approximately **24 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** A very dense and slightly wider burst is centered at approximately **35 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** The final burst in the recording is centered at approximately **48 s**.\n    So, the identified timestamps are approximately 2 s, 13 s, 24 s, 35 s, and 48 s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of consecutive bursts. Since there are five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n    *   Interval 1 (between Burst 1 and 2): 13 s - 2 s = **11 s**\n    *   Interval 2 (between Burst 2 and 3): 24 s - 13 s = **11 s**\n    *   Interval 3 (between Burst 3 and 4): 35 s - 24 s = **11 s**\n    *   Interval 4 (between Burst 4 and 5): 48 s - 35 s = **13 s**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** The average IBI is the sum of the individual intervals divided by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of intervals = 11 s + 11 s + 11 s + 13 s = 46 s\n    *   Number of intervals = 4\n    *   Average IBI = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n5.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be reported to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated average is 11.5 s. This value has three significant figures (1, 1, and 5).\n    *   To round to two significant figures, we examine the third digit. Since it is 5, we round up the preceding digit (the second '1').\n    *   Rounding 11.5 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
