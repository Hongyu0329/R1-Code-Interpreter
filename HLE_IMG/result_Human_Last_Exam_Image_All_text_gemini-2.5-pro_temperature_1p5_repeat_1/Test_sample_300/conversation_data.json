    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork:\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top-left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a figure painting in the Chinese ink wash style. It depicts women from one of China's ethnic minorities, characterized by their detailed and vibrant clothing and headdresses. This subject matter and the dynamic, expressive brushwork, especially in rendering figures, are hallmarks of the artist **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**. His signature and seal are also visible in the upper right corner.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Huang Zhou.\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top-center)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a landscape painting done with ink on paper. The style is semi-abstract, using energetic black lines to outline the forms of houses and trees. This method of blending Western modernism (line and form) with traditional Chinese ink aesthetics is characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He is famous for his abstract landscapes that capture the spirit and rhythm of the scenery rather than a purely realistic depiction.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Wu Guanzhong.\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top-right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a highly fluid and powerful cursive script (草书). The style is very distinctive, with bold, connected, and unrestrained strokes. This specific calligraphic style is famously associated with **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**, whose calligraphy is known for its grandiose and commanding presence.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Mao Zedong.\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle-left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy. The script is elegant and well-structured, showing a scholarly refinement. The signature on the left can be identified as **Qi Gong (启功)**, a renowned 20th-century calligrapher, painter, and scholar. His calligraphy is celebrated for its grace and clarity, which is evident in this piece. The two red seals are also consistent with his work.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Qi Gong.\n\n**Artwork 5 (Middle-center)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a hyper-realistic oil painting of a young woman with short hair in a white shirt, holding a paintbrush. This is a very famous work of Chinese contemporary art titled \"Youth\" (or sometimes \"Me and My Classmate Xiao Tang\"). The artist is **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, a leading figure in the Chinese Neoclassical realism movement. His work is known for its meticulous detail, serene atmosphere, and classical composition.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Yang Feiyun.\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle-right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts a female figure with an elaborate headdress in a distinctive style that fuses Eastern and Western artistic elements. The use of bold ink outlines, flattened perspective, and a focus on graceful, elongated forms are the signature style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**. He was a pioneer of modern Chinese painting, known for his unique synthesis of Chinese ink wash techniques and Western movements like Fauvism and Expressionism.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Lin Fengmian.\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom-left)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a colorful and vibrant painting of a courtyard scene with hanging loofahs and laundry. The artist uses bright colors and strong geometric forms to create a lively, decorative composition. This style, which captures the beauty of everyday life by abstracting forms and using a bold color palette, is another signature of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. This piece exemplifies his mastery in blending oil painting colors with the spirit of Chinese ink painting.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Wu Guanzhong.\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom-center)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese landscape painting (山水画) depicting towering mountains and boats with red sails. The style is characterized by the use of heavy, layered ink to build up monumental, powerful forms, creating a strong contrast between light and shadow. This technique, and the frequent inclusion of a touch of red, are the unmistakable trademarks of **Li Keran (李可染)**, one of the most important masters of 20th-century Chinese landscape painting.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Li Keran.\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom-right)**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting features a lobster, rendered with exceptionally skillful and economical brushstrokes. The artist has captured the life, movement, and translucency of the creature with just ink and water on paper. Painting shrimps and other small creatures from nature with such vitality was the specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most beloved modern Chinese artists. This work displays his mastery of the brush and his deep observation of nature.\n*   **Conclusion:** The author is Qi Baishi.\n\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Qi Gong, Yang Feiyun, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
