    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the array is considered sorted, and the function does nothing. This prevents infinite recursion.\n    *   **Recursive Step (for `n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`). Let's assume this call correctly sorts that subarray.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of this sorted subarray (`a[n-2]`) with the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`).\n        3.  `swap(...)`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with the element at `n-2`. This swap might disrupt the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the potential disruption caused by the swap, it makes *another* recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements again.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` represent the time complexity of `sort(a, n)`.\n    *   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` contributes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. In the worst case, this call is always executed. This contributes another `T(n - 1)`.\n\n    Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n    The base case is `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n\n3.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true for every recursive step where `n > 1`.\n    Let's consider a reverse-sorted array, like `a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` for `n=5`.\n    *   `sort(a, 5)` calls `sort(a, 4)`.\n    *   Let's assume `sort(a, 4)` sorts `[5, 4, 3, 2]`, resulting in the array becoming `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.\n    *   Now, the `if` condition is checked: `a[4] < a[3]` -> `1 < 5`. This is true.\n    *   A swap occurs: the array becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`.\n    *   The second `sort(a, 4)` is called to re-sort the prefix `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n    This pattern, where the smallest element is at the end of the prefix being considered, triggers the swap and the second recursive call, propagating the worst-case scenario down the recursion. Thus, a reverse-sorted array is a worst-case input.\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`.\n    Let's expand it:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c` (mistake in calculation, should be `4c + 2c + c`) -> let's redo carefully:\n    *   `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2(2T(n-2) + c) + c = 4T(n-2) + 3c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4(2T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8T(n-3) + 7c`\n    *   `T(n) = 8(2T(n-4) + c) + 7c = 16T(n-4) + 15c`\n    The general form is `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`.\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, `T(n)` is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n    Therefore, `T(n)` is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points Summary\n\n*   **Recursion:** The algorithm's runtime is defined by a recurrence relation.\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm terminates because the problem size `n` decreases with each recursive call (`n-1`), eventually reaching the base case (`n <= 1`).\n*   **Worst-Case Condition:** The second recursive call is conditional. The worst case happens when this condition is always met.\n*   **Recurrence Formula:** The worst-case recurrence is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which is characteristic of exponential growth.\n*   **Distinction from other sorts:** Do not confuse this with `O(n^2)` sorts like Bubble Sort (which has `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)`) or `O(n log n)` sorts like Merge Sort (which has `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`). The structure `2T(n-1)` is key to its exponential complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which resolves to `O(2^n)`. This is an exponential time complexity.\n\nFinal Answer Choice: E\n\n<<<E>>>"
