    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the chemical structure.**\n    The provided image shows the skeletal structure of a complex organic molecule. We need to identify its key features to determine its name.\n    *   **Ring System:** The molecule is polycyclic, specifically containing four fused rings. All rings are six-membered.\n    *   **Heteroatoms:** The structure contains two nitrogen (N) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom, in addition to carbon and hydrogen. The presence of nitrogen atoms within the ring system is a defining feature of alkaloids.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring, forming a cyclic amide, which is called a lactam. The other nitrogen atom is a tertiary amine.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The use of wedges and dashes indicates specific stereocenters, meaning the molecule has a defined three-dimensional shape.\n\n*   **Step 2: Classify the compound based on its core structure.**\n    The tetracyclic framework containing two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a group of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids. Specifically, the core C15N2 skeleton is that of sparteine. The molecule in the question is an oxygenated derivative of sparteine.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the specific alkaloid.**\n    By comparing the given structure with known sparteine-type alkaloids, we can pinpoint its identity.\n    *   **Sparteine** is the parent compound without the oxygen atom.\n    *   The addition of a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C-2 position of the sparteine skeleton results in the formation of a lactam. This specific oxidized derivative is known by the common name **Lupanine**.\n    *   Lupanine (C15H24N2O) is a major alkaloid found in the seeds of plants from the Lupinus genus (lupins).\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the structure.**\n    A search for the chemical structure of \"Lupanine\" confirms that it matches the image provided, including the specific arrangement of the rings and the stereochemistry shown, which corresponds to the naturally occurring (-)-lupanine isomer.\n\nTherefore, the name of the alkaloid compound is Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
