    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ECG Paper Calibration**\nFirst, we must determine the time scale from the information provided on the ECG strip.\n*   **Paper Speed:** The top left corner indicates a speed of \"25 mm/sec\". This means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n*   **Grid Lines:** The ECG is printed on a grid.\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm wide.\n    *   Each large square consists of 5 small squares, so it is 5 mm wide.\n*   **Time Calculation:**\n    *   Time for 1 small square = 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Time for 1 large square = 5 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.2 seconds**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the R-waves and Scan for the Longest Interval**\nR-waves are the prominent, tall, upward deflections of the QRS complex. The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves. We need to scan the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves.\n*   Most of the rhythm strip shows a regular, fast heart rate. The typical R-R interval is approximately 3 large squares (15 small squares), which corresponds to 15 * 0.04s = 0.6 seconds.\n*   By visually scanning the strip, a significant pause is noticeable. This pause occurs between the last beat recorded on the fourth line of the tracing and the first beat on the fifth line. This is clearly the longest R-R interval on the strip.\n\n**Step 3: Measure the Longest R-R Interval**\nTo measure the duration of this pause, we will count the number of squares spanning the interval. Since the interval crosses two lines, we'll measure each part separately and add them together.\n*   **Part 1: End of the fourth line:**\n    *   Locate the peak of the last R-wave on the fourth line. It conveniently falls exactly on a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Count the number of squares from this R-wave peak to the end of the printed tracing on that line.\n    *   There are 8 full large squares and 1 additional small square.\n    *   In terms of small squares: (8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square) + 1 small square = 40 + 1 = **41 small squares**.\n\n*   **Part 2: Beginning of the fifth line:**\n    *   Locate the peak of the first R-wave on the fifth line.\n    *   Count the number of squares from the beginning of the printed tracing on this line to the R-wave peak.\n    *   The R-wave peak falls exactly on the second thick vertical grid line from the start.\n    *   This distance is 2 full large squares.\n    *   In terms of small squares: 2 large squares × 5 small squares/large square = **10 small squares**.\n\n*   **Total Distance:**\n    *   Add the two measurements: 41 small squares + 10 small squares = **51 small squares**.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Measured Distance to Time**\nNow, convert the total number of small squares into seconds using the calibration factor from Step 1.\n*   Longest R-R Interval (in seconds) = Total small squares × Time per small square\n*   Longest R-R Interval = 51 × 0.04 seconds\n*   Longest R-R Interval = **2.04 seconds**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip corresponds to the pause between the fourth and fifth lines of tracing. The duration of this interval is 2.04 seconds.\n\n<<<2.04>>>"
