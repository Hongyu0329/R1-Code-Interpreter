    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of a resistive ladder network and a capacitor $C$ connected from node $a_0$ to ground. This forms an RC low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency (angular frequency, $\\omega_c$) of a first-order low-pass filter is determined by the Thévenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) seen by the capacitor and the capacitance $C$ itself. The formula is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n(Note: The cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$). We will determine the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Thévenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance looking into the terminals where the capacitor is connected, which are node $a_0$ and ground (node $b_0$). To do this, we perform two steps:\n1.  Remove the capacitor $C$ from the circuit.\n2.  Set all independent sources to zero. The input voltage source \"IN\" at node $c_0$ is an independent voltage source. Setting it to zero means we connect node $c_0$ to ground.\n\nAfter these modifications, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Circuit for $R_{th}$**\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is an infinite resistive ladder. We need to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and node $c_0$, since $c_0$ is now connected to ground. Let's analyze the structure of the ladder from the provided diagram.\n\n*   The ladder consists of two horizontal rails, the top rail with nodes $c_0, c_1, c_2, ...$ and the bottom rail with nodes $a_0, d_1, d_2, ...$. Let's assume the node label $a_0$ corresponds to $d_0$ for a uniform ladder structure.\n*   The resistors connecting nodes on the same rail (e.g., $c_k$ to $c_{k+1}$, or $d_k$ to $d_{k+1}$) are series elements.\n*   The resistors connecting nodes between the two rails (e.g., $c_k$ to $d_k$) are the rungs or shunt elements.\n*   Based on a careful look at the schematic, the structure is a uniform infinite ladder where each segment consists of series resistors `r` on both rails and a shunt resistor `r` forming the rung. The most consistent interpretation is that the ladder is composed of repeating Pi-sections, with a shunt resistor `r` between $c_k$ and $d_k$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, the problem of finding $R_{th}$ is reduced to finding the equivalent resistance between the two input terminals ($c_0$ and $a_0=d_0$) of a semi-infinite, symmetric ladder network where all resistors have the same value `r`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Input Resistance of the Infinite Ladder**\nThis is a classic problem in network theory. The input resistance $R_{in}$ of this semi-infinite ladder between the two terminals can be found using a recurrence relation.\n\nLet $R_{in}$ be the resistance of the infinite ladder seen from terminals $(c_k, d_k)$. Since the ladder is infinite, the resistance looking into the next section $(c_{k+1}, d_{k+1})$ is also $R_{in}$.\nLooking into terminals $(c_k, d_k)$, we see a shunt resistor `r` in parallel with the rest of the network. The rest of the network consists of a series resistor `r` on the top rail and a series resistor `r` on the bottom rail, followed by the rest of the ladder which has an input resistance of $R_{in}$.\n\nThe resistance of the path through the next stage, when measuring between the rails, is equivalent to the two series resistors `r` (one on each rail) in series with the input resistance $R_{in}$ of the subsequent ladder section. This gives a total series path resistance of $2r + R_{in}$.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation for $R_{in}$ is:\n$R_{in} = r \\parallel (2r + R_{in})$\n$R_{in} = \\frac{r(2r + R_{in})}{r + (2r + R_{in})} = \\frac{2r^2 + rR_{in}}{3r + R_{in}}$\n\nNow, we solve for $R_{in}$:\n$R_{in}(3r + R_{in}) = 2r^2 + rR_{in}$\n$3rR_{in} + R_{in}^2 = 2r^2 + rR_{in}$\n$R_{in}^2 + 2rR_{in} - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $R_{in}$:\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2}$\n$R_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}r}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$R_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\nSo, the Thévenin resistance seen by the capacitor is $R_{th} = R_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)C}$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)C} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{r((\\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2)C} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{r(3 - 1)C} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2rC}$\n\nThe final expression for the cutoff angular frequency is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2rC}$.\n\nFinal check of the result. The analysis appears sound and the calculation of the infinite ladder impedance is a standard method that gives $R_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$. The substitution into the cutoff frequency formula is direct. The final form is algebraically correct.\n\n<<<Answer>>>\nThe cutoff angular frequency at node $a_0$ is given by $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\nThe Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ seen by the capacitor at node $a_0$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder between nodes $a_0$ and $c_0$ (with the input at $c_0$ grounded).\nBased on the analysis, this resistance is $R_{th} = r(\\sqrt{3}-1)$.\nTherefore, the cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}-1)C} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{2rC}$\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{4\\pi rC}$\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, typically denoted by $\\omega_c$ in electronics unless specified as $f_c$.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{2rC}$"
