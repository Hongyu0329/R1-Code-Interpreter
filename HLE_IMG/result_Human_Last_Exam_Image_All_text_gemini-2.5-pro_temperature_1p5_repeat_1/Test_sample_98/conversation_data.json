    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the medallion.**\n    *   **Object:** The image displays a round metal medallion with a flattened tab at the top for suspension or attachment. The technique appears to be repoussé, where the design is hammered from the reverse side to create a raised relief.\n    *   **Iconography:** The central scene depicts two busts in profile, facing each other in a \"confronted\" composition.\n        *   The figure on the left is male, identifiable by the beard and features. His most prominent attribute is a set of large, curved ram's horns, which form part of his crown or headdress. His hair is rendered in tight, stylized curls.\n        *   The figure on the right is female, likely a queen. She wears a draped garment and an elaborate hairstyle or headdress.\n    *   **Artistic Style:** The style is formal and stylized rather than naturalistic. The eyes of both figures are large and wide open. The rendering of hair, drapery, and facial features is done with patterned lines and shapes. This stylistic approach is distinct from the naturalism of Greco-Roman or most Hellenistic art.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the cultural and historical context.**\n    *   The combination of a royal couple portrait and the ram's horn symbolism points to a few possibilities. While ram's horns were associated with Alexander the Great (as son of Zeus-Ammon) and used by some of his Hellenistic successors like the Ptolemies, the artistic style of this medallion does not align with Hellenistic portraiture.\n    *   The highly stylized features, the formal composition, and the specific iconography are hallmarks of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 A.D.) of Persia (modern-day Iran). Sasanian art blended Near Eastern, Hellenistic, and Roman traditions into a unique imperial style.\n    *   In a Sasanian context, the ram is a potent symbol. It can represent the Zoroastrian concept of *khvarenah*, meaning divine glory or fortune, a key element of Sasanian royal ideology. It is also an avatar of Verethragna, the god of victory. Depicting a king with ram's horns thus signifies his divinely sanctioned power and military prowess.\n\n*   **Step 3: Narrow down the date within the Sasanian period.**\n    *   The Sasanian era spans several centuries. To determine a more precise date, art historians and archaeologists compare such objects to datable artifacts, primarily Sasanian coinage, which features portraits of the rulers.\n    *   The style of the portraits on this medallion, including the crown type and the rendering of the facial features, shows strong similarities to the coinage of the Sasanian king Shapur II, who reigned for a long period from 309 to 379 A.D.\n    *   This specific medallion is a well-known example of Sasanian metalwork and is consistently attributed by museums (such as the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, which holds a similar piece) and scholarly publications to the reign of Shapur II or generally to his time.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the century.**\n    *   Since the reign of Shapur II (309–379 A.D.) falls entirely within the 4th century A.D., archaeologists confidently ascribe this medallion to that century.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
