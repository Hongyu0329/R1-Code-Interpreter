    "Answering this question requires analyzing the chemical stability of the four iridium complexes, as operational lifetime in a light-emitting device is directly related to the molecule's resistance to degradation.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core structure:** All four complexes are cationic iridium(III) coordination compounds with the general formula [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻.\n    *   **Ir(III):** The central metal ion is iridium(III).\n    *   **N^N ligand:** The neutral bidentate ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This ligand is identical in all four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily serve to improve solubility and prevent aggregation, which can enhance stability, but since it's common to all, it's not the differentiating factor.\n    *   **C^N ligand:** The monoanionic, cyclometalating ligands are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The differences among these ligands are the key to determining the relative lifetimes of the complexes.\n    *   **Counter-ion:** The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻), which is a common, non-coordinating, and stable anion for such complexes.\n\n2.  **Determine the factor affecting lifetime:** The operational lifetime of such phosphorescent emitters in devices like LECs or OLEDs is often limited by the chemical stability of the complex. A primary degradation pathway is the cleavage of the coordinate bonds, particularly the cyclometalating Ir-C bond, which is often considered the weakest link in the coordination sphere.\n\n3.  **Analyze the effect of substituents on the C^N ligands:** The stability of the Ir-C bond can be significantly influenced by substituents on the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand.\n    *   **Fluorine atoms (F)** are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   When attached to the phenyl ring, fluorine atoms pull electron density away from the ring and the carbon atom bonded to the iridium.\n    *   This withdrawal of electron density strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond. A stronger bond is more resistant to cleavage under electrical and thermal stress during device operation.\n    *   Therefore, fluorination of the ppy ligand is a well-established strategy to enhance the stability and operational lifetime of iridium complexes.\n\n4.  **Evaluate each complex based on fluorination:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Both ligands are heavily fluorinated. This is expected to result in very strong Ir-C bonds, leading to high chemical stability and a **long operational lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligands are unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine. There is no fluorine stabilization. The Ir-C bonds are relatively weaker compared to their fluorinated counterparts. This complex is expected to be the least stable and exhibit a **shorter operational lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 3:** This is a heteroleptic complex containing one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand. The presence of the unsubstituted ppy ligand acts as a \"weak link\" for degradation. The overall stability of the complex is limited by its least stable component. Therefore, it is also expected to have a **shorter operational lifetime** compared to fully fluorinated complexes like 1 and 4.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. Both ligands are mono-fluorinated. This fluorination will strengthen the Ir-C bonds compared to the non-fluorinated Complex 2. Its stability should be high, likely between that of Complex 1 and Complex 2, but significantly better than complexes containing a non-fluorinated ppy. It is expected to have a **long operational lifetime**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe complexes that lack the stabilizing effect of fluorine on all of their C^N ligands will be the most susceptible to degradation and thus will have shorter lifetimes.\n\n*   **Complex 2** has two non-fluorinated C^N ligands.\n*   **Complex 3** has one non-fluorinated C^N ligand.\n\nBoth Complex 2 and Complex 3 contain the less stable, non-fluorinated ppy ligand, making them the candidates with the shortest lifetimes among the set. Complexes 1 and 4, where all C^N ligands are fluorinated, are expected to be significantly more stable.\n\nTherefore, complexes [2] and [3] are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\nFinal Answer is [2, 3].\n\n<<<H>>>"
