The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformational rigidity of the bicyclic münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetyl-proline. This rigidity prevents the scrambling of substituents between the C2 and C4 positions of the münchnone core. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish the context for this rationale: they show that while the cycloaddition step itself is regioselective (Reaction 1), the analogous münchnone derived from the flexible, acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine undergoes a rapid equilibration that scrambles its C2 and C4 substituents (as proven by the 1:1 isotope distribution in Reaction 2). Because the rigid intermediate in Reaction 3 cannot scramble, its inherent structural differences are maintained, and the regioselective cycloaddition leads to a single, well-defined product (Product B).
