    "This problem describes the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a triterpenoid alcohol. This type of reaction is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, involving a cascade of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts. Our goal is to determine the identity of the substituents (either H or CH3) at five specific positions in the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) by the catalytic acid (HCl). This converts the poor leaving group -OH into a very good leaving group, H2O.\n2.  **Carbocation Formation:** The water molecule departs, generating a secondary carbocation at the carbon atom where the alcohol was attached (C-3 in standard terpenoid numbering). Secondary carbocations are unstable and prone to rearrangement to form more stable tertiary carbocations.\n3.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The question explicitly states that the reaction involves a number of [1,2] shifts. This initiates a \"backbone rearrangement\" common in triterpenoid and steroid chemistry. The positive charge migrates across the carbon skeleton through a series of shifts, ultimately leading to a more stable carbocation from which the final product is formed. The final product has a double bond between carbons C-13 and C-18 (standard numbering). This indicates that the cascade of shifts must proceed until the carbocation is formed at C-13. The sequence of shifts is well-established for the friedelane skeleton:\n    *   **Shift 1:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-4 to C-3. The positive charge moves to C-4 (now a tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 2:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-5 to C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5.\n    *   **Shift 3:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-10 to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-9 to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-8 to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** A [1,2]-methyl shift from C-14 to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** A [1,2]-hydride shift from C-13 to C-14. The positive charge finally arrives at C-13.\n4.  **Elimination:** The final step is the elimination of a proton from an adjacent carbon to form a stable alkene. Removal of a proton from C-18 leads to the formation of the observed C13=C18 double bond, yielding the product.\n\n**Careful Points & Substituent Tracking:**\n\nWe need to track the substituents at the numbered positions throughout this cascade. Note that the product diagram appears to show two methyl groups at C-4, which contradicts the first step of the established mechanism. In such cases, the known chemical mechanism takes precedence over a potentially flawed illustration, especially when the problem asks to apply the principles of reaction mechanisms. The problem is designed to test the understanding of the backbone rearrangement.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):** C-4 initially has two methyl groups. In Shift 1, one methyl group migrates away. In Shift 2, a hydrogen atom migrates to C-4. Therefore, C-4 in the product has one methyl group and one hydrogen atom. The label '1' points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):** C-10 starts with a methyl group. In Shift 3, this methyl group migrates to C-5. In Shift 4, a hydrogen atom migrates to C-10. Thus, C-10 in the product has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3 (on C-5):** C-5 starts with a hydrogen atom. In Shift 2, this hydrogen atom migrates to C-4. In Shift 3, a methyl group from C-10 migrates to C-5. So, C-5 in the product has a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4 (on C-8):** C-8 starts with a methyl group. In Shift 5, this methyl group migrates away to C-9. In Shift 6, a different methyl group migrates in from C-14. The net result is that C-8 in the product still has a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n*   **Position 5 (on C-14):** C-14 starts with a methyl group. In Shift 6, this methyl group migrates to C-8. In Shift 7, a hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to C-14. Consequently, C-14 in the product has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nCombining these results, we can determine the identity of each substituent.\n\nFinal determination:\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = CH3\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
