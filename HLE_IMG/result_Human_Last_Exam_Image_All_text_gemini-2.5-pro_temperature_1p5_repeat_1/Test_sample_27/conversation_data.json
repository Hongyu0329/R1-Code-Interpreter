    "*   **Step 1: Identify the objective.**\n    The main goal is to find the full name of the artist who created the watercolor painting provided in the image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Locate clues within the image.**\n    The most direct way to identify an artist is to look for a signature on the artwork. By examining the full image, a signature is visible in the bottom right corner. The provided cropped images help to see this area more clearly.\n\n*   **Step 3: Decipher the signature.**\n    Looking closely at the signature in the bottom right corner (especially with the help of the last crop), it is possible to read the name. The first name appears to be \"Joaquim\". The last name is \"Fialho\". Following the name, there are two digits, \"39\", which most likely represent the year the painting was created, 1939.\n\n*   **Step 4: Research the artist's name.**\n    A search for the artist \"Joaquim Fialho\" confirms the existence of a Portuguese painter with this name. Further research reveals his full name is Joaquim Fialho Pereira.\n\n*   **Step 5: Corroborate the findings.**\n    Joaquim Fialho Pereira (1903â€“1959) was a Portuguese modernist painter. The style of the watercolor landscape is consistent with his known work, and the year 1939 falls squarely within his active period as an artist. This confirms the identification.\n\n*   **Step 6: State the final answer.**\n    Based on the signature and subsequent research, the full name of the artist who created this painting is Joaquim Fialho Pereira.\n\n<<<Joaquim Fialho Pereira>>>"
