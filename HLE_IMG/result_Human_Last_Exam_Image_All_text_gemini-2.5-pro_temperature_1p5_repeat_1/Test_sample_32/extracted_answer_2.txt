The main difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* is the shape of the seta (the stalk). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta which holds the capsule in an erect, upright position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta*, as its name implies, has a short but distinctly curved or arcuate seta, which causes its capsule to be nodding or bent over.
