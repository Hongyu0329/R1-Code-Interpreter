    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are two flats (B♭ and E♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key of G minor or its relative major, B♭ major. The first chords played are strongly rooted in G minor, making it the most likely key.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking of quarter note = 80 is given, which is a moderate tempo (Andante or Moderato).\n\n2.  **Structural and Stylistic Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano). The right hand plays a simple, ascending melodic line (G-A-B♭-C-D), while the left hand plays soft, broken chords. The \"8\" with a dotted line under the bass clef indicates the left hand should be played an octave lower than written, giving it a deep, resonant quality. This section is calm and lyrical.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is an abrupt and dramatic change. The dynamic shifts to *f* (forte). The musical texture becomes dense and powerful. The right hand plays rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios, while the left hand plays strong, punctuating chords and octaves. This creates a powerful, march-like rhythm.\n    *   **Measures 3-10:** This powerful, rhythmic character continues. The music is characterized by thick, full chords in both hands, rapid passagework, and a relentless forward drive. The harmony is rich and uses chromaticism (notice the frequent use of F♯ and C♯), which is a hallmark of the Romantic era.\n    *   **Measure 11:** The intensity builds further with a glissando-like flourish in the right hand, leading into another forceful chordal passage.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Composer and Piece:**\n    *   The combination of a lyrical section with an explosive, virtuosic, and rhythmically powerful section is highly characteristic of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n    *   The specific piano writing—with its thick chords, wide-ranging arpeggios, and dramatic intensity—is a signature of his style.\n    *   The march-like theme that begins in measure 3 is one of Rachmaninoff's most famous creations. It is the main theme (the \"A\" section) of his **Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5**.\n    *   The first two quiet measures are not the famous opening of the prelude. Instead, they correspond to the transitional passage at the end of the lyrical middle section (the \"B\" section), which leads back into the recapitulation of the main march theme.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sheet music excerpt displays the transition from the end of the lyrical middle section into the famous and powerful \"Alla marcia\" main theme of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G minor.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to analyze all aspects of the score: key, tempo, dynamics, and texture.\n*   Recognizing the distinct stylistic fingerprint of a composer like Rachmaninoff is key.\n*   One must be aware that a musical excerpt might not start at the beginning of the piece but can show a transition between two different sections. The dramatic change at measure 3 is the most significant clue.\n*   Verifying the distinctive march-like theme that starts at measure 3 firmly identifies the piece as the famous Prelude in G minor.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5>>>"
