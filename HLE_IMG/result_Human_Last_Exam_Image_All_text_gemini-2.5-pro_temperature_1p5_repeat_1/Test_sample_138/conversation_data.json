    "Step-by-step analysis of the question:\n1.  **Deconstruct the prompt:** The core task is to determine the sex (Male or Female) for the left and right individuals in each of the three pairs of insects (A, B, C). The prompt provides a critical piece of information: the images are of \"pollinators from taxa without scopae on their legs\". Scopae are specialized pollen-carrying hairs, and their absence on the legs is a key taxonomic clue. This constraint points towards groups like:\n    *   Wasps (which don't collect pollen for larvae).\n    *   Cleptoparasitic bees (cuckoo bees), whose females don't provision nests and thus lack scopae.\n    *   Bees in the family Hylaeidae, which carry pollen internally in their crop.\n    *   Bees in the family Megachilidae (leafcutters, masons), whose females have a scopa on the ventral (underside) of the abdomen, not on the legs.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair A:**\n    *   **Insects:** These are cuckoo bees, which are cleptoparasites. Their taxa correctly lack scopae.\n    *   **Left Insect (A-left):** This bee has a very elongated and sharply pointed abdomen. This is a classic feature of a female *Coelioxys* (a genus of cuckoo bees), which uses this pointed abdomen to insert eggs into the nests of host bees. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (A-right):** This is another cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. To determine its sex, we can look at the face. Males in this genus typically have yellow markings on their clypeus (facial plate above the mouthparts). This individual's face is all black. The robust body shape is also consistent with a female. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is (Female, Female). This matches option **2**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair B:**\n    *   **Insects:** These are paper wasps (*Polistes* sp.). Wasps are a taxon without scopae, fitting the prompt.\n    *   **Left Insect (B-left):** Observe the antennae. They are distinctly hooked or curled at the tip. This is a definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp. The largely yellow face is another common male trait. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (B-right):** Observe the antennae. They are straight, lacking the curl seen in the male. The abdomen is more pointed at the tip, as it contains the stinger. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is (Male, Female). This matches option **3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Pair C:**\n    *   **Insects:** These are bees. To fit the \"no leg scopae\" rule, we should consider a group like Megachilidae (which use an abdominal scopa).\n    *   **Left Insect (C-left):** This bee has several distinct male features. It has very long antennae and a prominent pale yellow patch on its clypeus. Furthermore, its front legs (specifically the tarsi) are widened and conspicuously hairy, a modification used by some male leafcutter bees (*Megachile*) for grasping the female during mating. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee is shown from above. Its antennae are short and simple, contrasting with the male on the left. Its robust, fuzzy body is characteristic of a female. As it belongs to a taxon without leg scopae, it's likely a female megachilid, which would carry pollen on her abdomen (not visible from this angle). This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is (Male, Female). This matches option **3**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Answer:**\n    *   Pair A: (F, F) -> Index 2\n    *   Pair B: (M, F) -> Index 3\n    *   Pair C: (M, F) -> Index 3\n    *   The sequence of indices is 2, 3, 3.\n\n<<<2,3,3>>>"
