    "*   **Step 1: Identify the main subject of the image.** The image features a single insect in the center, resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting more of the same foliage.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the key characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has a body shape characteristic of a \"true bug\" (Order Hemiptera). It has long antennae and a piercing-sucking mouthpart (proboscis), though the latter is not clearly visible. The wings appear to be partially hardened and partially membranous (hemelytra), which is typical for this order.\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is primarily black and bright orange-red.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section immediately behind the head (the pronotum) is mostly orange-red with black markings in the center. There is a clear orange-red band across the \"shoulders.\"\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings are mostly black.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and antennae are black.\n\n*   **Step 3: Observe the characteristics of the plant.** The insect is on a spiky inflorescence of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and autumn wildflower in North America.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the observed characteristics to identify the insect.** The combination of the red/orange and black aposematic (warning) coloration, the specific pattern on the pronotum, and the insect's presence on goldenrod helps to narrow down the possibilities.\n    *   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug has a different pattern, typically with two black spots on an orange pronotum and a broad black band across the middle of the orange wings. This does not match the insect in the image.\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** This bug is black with red or orange lines outlining the wings and thorax. The insect in the image has solid patches of orange, not just lines. This is not a match.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This species is a very close match. It has a black head, a red/orange pronotum with a central black marking (sometimes described as heart-shaped), and typically a red \"X\" pattern on its wings (formed by the red borders of the corium). While the \"X\" isn't perfectly clear from this angle, the head and pronotum markings are a perfect match for *Lygaeus kalmii*. Also, despite their name, Small Milkweed Bugs are often found feeding on the seeds of other plants, such as goldenrod, especially in the late season.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the identification.** Based on the strong correspondence of the visual features—especially the pattern on the head and pronotum—the insect is the Small Milkweed Bug. The question asks for the scientific name.\n\n*   **Step 6: State the scientific name.** The scientific name for the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
