**Product A:** A structure containing a tetrasubstituted pyrrole ring. The pyrrole is formed via the [3+2] cycloaddition of the m√ºnchnone (derived from the SM) and methyl propiolate, followed by a series of rearrangements and subsequent Michael addition of the pyrrolidine moiety that was cleaved off. The structure is methyl 5-((3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propyl)amino)-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate with an acetyl group on one of the nitrogens. Given the data, a more fitting structure is methyl 2-((1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)methyl)-1-(2-cyanoethyl)-1H-pyrrole-4-carboxylate. The spectral data provided in the prompt however, points to a simpler structure which is likely **methyl 3-(N-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydropyrrol-2-yl)butanamido)propanoate.** After re-examining the NMR of A, it has two -CH2CH2CH2- fragments, suggesting the two 5-membered rings are still largely present. A likely structure for A is **methyl 4-(acetyl(3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propyl)amino)b
