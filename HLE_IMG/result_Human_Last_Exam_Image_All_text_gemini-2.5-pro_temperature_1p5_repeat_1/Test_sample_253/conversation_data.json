    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange, leafy organism growing on a rock. This organism is a lichen. Key features include its foliose (leaf-like) structure and the presence of small, disc-shaped structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). Given its appearance and the location specified (Acadia National Park, a coastal area), the lichen can be identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in a specific protein, named \"XPH1\", which is encoded by the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a plan to find the information.**\nTo find the number of amino acids in a specific protein from a known organism, we must consult a biological database. The most reliable and widely used database for this purpose is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein database.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the search and retrieve the data.**\n1.  We will search the NCBI Protein database for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n2.  The search query would be \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\".\n3.  This search leads to a specific protein entry named \"xanthoria photolyase 1 [Xanthoria parietina]\". The protein is commonly abbreviated as XPH1.\n4.  The accession number for this protein entry is CAB40562.1.\n5.  By examining the details of this official entry, we can find the length of the protein. The database record explicitly states the length of the amino acid sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer from the database entry.**\nThe NCBI entry for *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase 1 (XPH1), accession CAB40562.1, specifies that the protein is composed of 531 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The initial step of accurately identifying the lichen is crucial. The visual cues (color, form, apothecia) and the geographical context (Acadia National Park) strongly support the identification as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Name Specificity:** The question is very specific about the protein \"XPH1\". It is important to ensure the database entry corresponds to this exact protein. The search confirms that XPH1 is the standard name for Xanthoria photolyase 1.\n*   **Reliability of the Source:** Using an authoritative scientific database like NCBI ensures the accuracy and validity of the information.\n*   **Finding the Correct Data Point:** Within the database record, the target information is the \"length\" of the protein, which is measured in the number of amino acid residues. This needs to be located and read correctly.\n\n<<<531>>>"
