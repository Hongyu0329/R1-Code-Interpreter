    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the molecular structure.**\n\n1.  First, let's understand the connectivity of the atoms to determine the main carbon chain and the location of the chiral centers. The molecule can be written as:\n    `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2`\n2.  Identify the principal functional group, which is the amine (-NH2). Therefore, this is a substituted alkan-1-amine.\n3.  Identify the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon attached to the amine group (C1).\n    *   Let the carbon in `-CH2NH2` be C1.\n    *   The adjacent carbon with the methyl group is C2.\n    *   The next carbon with the ethyl group is C3.\n    *   The next carbon with the hydroxyl group is C4.\n    *   The final carbon in this chain is a methyl group, C5.\n    *   This gives a 5-carbon chain (a pentane derivative). An alternative 5-carbon chain goes through the ethyl group, but the chosen chain has more substituents, which is preferred by IUPAC rules.\n4.  The IUPAC name is **4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n5.  There are three chiral centers in this molecule, at positions C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of them.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.**\n\n*   **Chiral Center C2 (the rightmost chiral center in the drawing):**\n    1.  **Groups attached:** -H, -CH3 (methyl), -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl), and the rest of the chain (-C3...).\n    2.  **Assign priorities:**\n        a. We compare the atoms directly attached to C2. These are C (in CH3), C (in CH2NH2), C (in C3), and H.\n        b. To rank the three carbon groups, we look at the atoms they are bonded to:\n            *   -CH2NH2: This carbon is bonded to (N, H, H).\n            *   -C3... : This carbon (C3) is bonded to (C, C, H).\n            *   -CH3: This carbon is bonded to (H, H, H).\n        c. Comparing the highest atomic number in each set: N (Z=7) > C (Z=6) > H (Z=1).\n        d. Therefore, the priority order is: -CH2NH2 > -C3... > -CH3 > -H.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2\n        *   Priority 2: -C3... (the rest of the chain to the left)\n        *   Priority 3: -CH3\n        *   Priority 4: -H (hydrogen, implied)\n    3.  **Determine R/S:**\n        *   In the drawing, the -CH2NH2 group (1) is on a wedge (out of the page), and the -CH3 group (3) is on a dash (into the page). The C2-C3 bond (2) and the C2-H bond (4) are in the plane of the paper.\n        *   To determine the configuration, we can use the \"swap\" method. We want the lowest priority group (H, #4) to be on a dash. Let's swap it with the -CH3 group (#3).\n        *   After the swap, H is on a dash. We now trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   The path goes from -CH2NH2 (1, wedge) to -C3... (2, plane, up-left) to the new position of -CH3 (3, plane, where H was). This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n        *   A CCW path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n        *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C2 is (R)**.\n\n*   **Chiral Center C3 (the middle chiral center):**\n    1.  **Groups attached:** -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -C2..., and -C4...\n    2.  **Assign priorities:**\n        a. We compare the groups attached to C3.\n        b. -C4...: The C4 carbon is bonded to (O, C, H).\n        c. -C2...: The C2 carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n        d. -CH2CH3: The ethyl carbon is bonded to (C, H, H).\n        e. The highest atomic number attached to C4 is O (Z=8). This outranks the carbons in the other groups.\n        f. Comparing -C2... and ethyl, -C2... is attached to {C,C,H} while ethyl is attached to {C,H,H}. So -C2... > ethyl.\n        g. The priority order is: -C4... > -C2... > -CH2CH3 > -H.\n        *   Priority 1: -C4... (the -CH(OH)CH3 group)\n        *   Priority 2: -C2... (the -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 group)\n        *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n    3.  **Determine R/S:**\n        *   The ethyl group (3) is on a wedge. The bonds to C2 (2) and C4 (1) are in the plane. This implies the implied H atom (4) must be on a dash.\n        *   With the lowest priority group (H, #4) pointing into the page (dashed), we trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   The path from C4 (1, left) to C2 (2, right) to ethyl (3, up/out) is clockwise (CW).\n        *   A CW path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(R)** configuration. Therefore, **C3 is (R)**.\n\n*   **Chiral Center C4 (the leftmost chiral center):**\n    1.  **Groups attached:** -H, -OH (hydroxyl), -CH3 (methyl), and -C3...\n    2.  **Assign priorities:**\n        *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        *   Priority 2: -C3... (Carbon bonded to other carbons)\n        *   Priority 3: -CH3 (Carbon bonded only to hydrogens)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n    3.  **Determine R/S:**\n        *   The drawing for this center is unconventional, showing both the -OH group (1) and the -CH3 group (3) on dashes. In a standard tetrahedral representation, if the C4-C3 bond is in the plane, this forces the C4-H bond to be on a wedge (pointing out of the page).\n        *   We have the lowest priority group (H, #4) on a wedge.\n        *   We trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   The path goes from -OH (1, back) -> -C3 (2, plane, right) -> -CH3 (3, back). This traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n        *   Because the lowest priority group (H, #4) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer), we must reverse the result.\n        *   CW would normally mean R, but since H is out, the configuration is **(S)**. Therefore, **C4 is (S)**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are:\n*   C2 is (R)\n*   C3 is (R)\n*   C4 is (S)\n\nThe full absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<< (2R, 3R, 4S) >>>"
