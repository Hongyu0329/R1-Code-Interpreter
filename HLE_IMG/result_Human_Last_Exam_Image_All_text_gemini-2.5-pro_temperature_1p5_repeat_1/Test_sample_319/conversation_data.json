    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image consists of two plots, both representing a sound over time.\n    *   The top plot is a **spectrogram**. It visualizes the frequency content of the sound. We can see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone at a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this band is interrupted by a vertical blur. This blur represents a sound that has energy across a wide range of frequencies, such as a burst of white noise. Crucially, in a spectrogram representing *perception*, the horizontal band often appears to be continuous *through* the noise burst, implying the tone is heard without interruption.\n    *   The bottom plot is a **waveform**. It shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, we see a regular, repeating pattern characteristic of a pure sine wave (the tone). This pattern is then interrupted. In its place, we see a more complex and irregular waveform (the noise). After this interruption, the pure sine wave pattern resumes. This plot represents the *physical* stimulus, where the tone is actually removed and replaced by noise for a short duration.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"illusion\"**: The prompt clearly states we are looking for the name of an illusion. The discrepancy between the physical sound (tone stops) and the typical perception (tone continues) confirms this.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D line drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives. The brain can switch between these two stable perceptions. This is analogous to the auditory phenomenon: one can perceive the sound as either (a) a tone that stops, is replaced by noise, and then restarts, or (b) a continuous tone that is temporarily masked by a louder noise. The brain strongly prefers the second, more plausible interpretation.\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This refers to the brain's ability to \"fill in\" missing sensory information to create a coherent and continuous perception of the world. We do this constantly to understand speech in noisy environments, often without ever realizing that parts of the speech signal were missing entirely.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information and Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   The core of the phenomenon is the perceptual \"filling-in\" or \"restoration\" of a sound that is physically absent but is masked by another sound.\n    *   The brain assumes that it is more likely for a continuous sound to be temporarily obscured by another sound than for the first sound to coincidentally stop at the exact moment the obscuring sound begins and restart at the exact moment it ends.\n    *   This effect was famously researched by Richard M. Warren. When he replaced a phoneme (a basic unit of sound in speech) from a recorded sentence with a cough or a burst of static, listeners reported not only hearing the missing phoneme but also being unable to identify where the cough had occurred.\n    *   This specific effect with speech is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. The more general principle, which applies to non-speech sounds like the tone in the image, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Perceptual Restoration of Sound**. However, \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\" is the most well-known and frequently cited name for this entire class of auditory illusions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe image and description point directly to the brain's ability to perceptually restore an interrupted sound when the gap is filled with noise. This auditory illusion is most famously known as the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
