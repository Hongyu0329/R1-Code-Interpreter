    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image's Content and Style:**\n    *   **Subject Matter:** The image depicts a religious scene, specifically a priest administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This is a representation of one of the Catholic sacraments.\n    *   **Medium and Technique:** This is not a painting but a three-dimensional relief sculpture. The smooth, slightly glossy surface and the high-relief figures are characteristic of glazed terracotta, a technique famously developed and perfected in Renaissance Florence.\n    *   **Composition:** The central scene is contained within a circular frame, known as a *tondo*. This tondo is set within a larger, ornately decorated square panel featuring garlands of leaves and fruit, a common framing device for this type of art.\n    *   **Artistic Style:** The figures are rendered in a naturalistic yet idealized manner. The drapery is handled with grace, and the figures convey a sense of piety and serenity. This style is quintessentially that of the Florentine High Renaissance.\n\n2.  **Examine the Inscription:**\n    *   At the bottom of the tondo, within a cartouche, there is an inscription. The cropped images help to read it more clearly.\n    *   The text reads: `SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL`.\n    *   This is an older form of Italian/Latin which translates to \"Sacraments of the Altar,\" directly confirming the subject matter as the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues to a Specific Artist or Workshop:**\n    *   The combination of the medium (glazed terracotta relief), the style (Florentine Renaissance), the format (tondo with garland frame), and the religious subject matter points very strongly to the workshop of the **Della Robbia family**.\n    *   Luca della Robbia (c. 1399-1482) invented and popularized this technique. His nephew, **Andrea della Robbia** (1435-1525), inherited the workshop and continued its legacy, creating many famous works. Andrea's son, Giovanni della Robbia, also continued the family business.\n    *   The style of this particular piece, with its complex grouping of figures and gentle, pious expressions, is highly characteristic of **Andrea della Robbia**. His work is known for its sweetness and grace, which is evident in the faces of the figures.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Artwork and Confirm the Author:**\n    *   A search for \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Sacramenti de l'avtel\" leads to a well-known artwork: the **Altarpiece of the Sacraments**.\n    *   This altarpiece is located in the Cathedral of Arezzo (Cattedrale dei Santi Pietro e Donato), Italy.\n    *   Art historians universally attribute this altarpiece to **Andrea della Robbia** and his workshop, created around the year 1486. The tondo depicting the Eucharist is a central element of this larger work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the medium (glazed terracotta), the artistic style (Florentine Renaissance), the specific inscription (\"Sacramenti de l'avtel\"), and the identification of the work as the Altarpiece of the Sacraments in Arezzo Cathedral, the author of this relief is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Medium Identification:** Recognizing the work as a glazed terracotta relief, not a marble sculpture or a painting, is the most crucial first step.\n*   **Artist vs. Workshop:** While Andrea della Robbia is the master credited with the design and execution, large altarpieces like this were often produced with the help of assistants in his workshop. However, he is considered the \"author.\"\n*   **Inscription:** Correctly deciphering the old Italian inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" provides definitive confirmation of the subject matter.\n*   **Distinguishing Della Robbias:** The serene and graceful style is more typical of Andrea than the sometimes more colorful and dramatic work of his son Giovanni, or the more classical and monumental style of his uncle Luca.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
