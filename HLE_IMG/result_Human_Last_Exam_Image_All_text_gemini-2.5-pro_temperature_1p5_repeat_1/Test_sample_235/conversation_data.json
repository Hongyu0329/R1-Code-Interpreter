    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the complete text of the poem.**\nIn collage or erasure poetry, the poem can be constructed from various elements on the page, not just the most obvious pasted words. We need to consider all textual elements that the artist may have intended to be part of the final piece.\nThe visible textual elements are:\n1.  The title at the top: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n2.  The page number: \"35\"\n3.  The pasted words: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\"\n4.  Another page indicator: \"Pi. 4\" (likely \"Plate 4\")\n5.  Faint text at the bottom from the original page (which seems to be background, not part of the constructed poem).\n\nTo determine the metric pattern, we first need to form a coherent line or sentence from these elements and count the syllables.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the text and count the syllables.**\nA common form in modern poetry, particularly influenced by Allen Ginsberg, is the \"American Sentence,\" which is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Let's test if the elements on the page can form such a sentence. We will arrange the most prominent elements in a logical reading order (top to bottom, incorporating the collage elements).\n\nLet's assemble the sentence using the title, the main collage words, and the page number:\n\"The first step, rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work, thirty-five.\"\n\nNow, let's count the syllables for each part of this sentence:\n*   \"The first step\" = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 syllables\n*   \"rules\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"and\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"lines\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"an\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"in-tri-cate\" = 3 syllables\n*   \"spi-der's\" = 2 syllables\n*   \"web\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"work\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"thir-ty-five\" = 3 syllables\n\nLet's sum the total number of syllables:\n3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17 syllables.\n\nThe total comes to exactly 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the answer choices against the findings.**\n*   A. free verse: This would be the answer if no regular pattern could be found. However, we have found a very specific syllabic pattern.\n*   B. iambic pentameter: This form has 10 syllables per line. Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   C. alexandrine: This form has 12 syllables per line. Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   D. sapphic: This is a complex stanza form. Our poem is a single sentence. This is incorrect.\n*   E. loose iambic trimeter: This form has about 6 syllables per line (three iambs). Our poem has 17. This is incorrect.\n*   F. american sentence: This form is defined as a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our analysis shows the poem fits this definition perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy interpreting the poem as a single sentence composed of the title, the collaged words, and the page number, we find that it consists of exactly 17 syllables. This matches the definition of an American Sentence. The poem's content, which references \"rules,\" \"lines,\" and \"an intricate... web,\" also hints at the presence of an underlying formal structure or rule, which in this case is the 17-syllable constraint of the American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
