**Product A:** Methyl 1-methyl-5-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7-carboxylate. This is a pyrrolidine ring fused to a pyrrole ring. The pyrrole ring has a methyl group at position 1 and a methoxycarbonyl group at position 7. Position 5 is substituted with a pyrrolidin-2-yl group.
**Product B:** The bicyclic anhydride product formed from the Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by intramolecular condensation with elimination of methanol. The structure contains the original proline ring fused to a new 6-membered anhydride ring. It retains the original pyrrolinyl substituent.
**Product C:** N-acetyl-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. This is the starting material with an acetyl group on the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring.
