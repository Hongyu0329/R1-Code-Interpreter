    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature and Key**\n*   The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   The title of the piece is \"Fantasy in D minor,\" and the consistent use of C♯ as the leading tone confirms that the piece is in the key of **D minor**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in the Circled Passage**\n*   The circle encompasses the notes on beats 3 and 4 of measure 8.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are C♯ and D (sixteenth notes on beat 3), followed by E (eighth note on beat 4).\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** A B♭ from the previous beat is held. On beat 3, the notes are E and F♯ (sixteenth notes). On beat 4, the note is G (eighth note).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmony on Beat 4**\n*   Roman numeral analysis often focuses on the stable harmony that occurs on the beat. The flurry of sixteenth notes on beat 3 leads to a clearer, more stable chord on beat 4.\n*   The notes sounding on beat 4 are:\n    *   Left Hand: **E**\n    *   Right Hand: **G** and the held **B♭**\n*   Together, these notes—E, G, and B♭—form an **E diminished triad**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral**\n*   Now we relate this chord to our key of D minor.\n*   The root of the chord is **E**.\n*   In the key of D minor, the note E is the second scale degree, also known as the **supertonic**.\n*   In a minor key, the triad built on the supertonic is naturally a diminished triad (E-G-B♭).\n*   The Roman numeral for a supertonic chord is **ii**. The symbol for a diminished chord is **°**.\n*   Therefore, the Roman numeral for the E diminished triad in the key of D minor is **ii°**.\n\n**Careful Points & Confirmation:**\n*   **Function of the chord:** The ii° chord is a pre-dominant chord, which means it naturally leads to the dominant (V) chord. Looking ahead to measure 9, the harmony is an A major seventh chord (A-C♯-E-G), which is the V⁷ chord in D minor. The progression from ii° in measure 8 to V⁷ in measure 9 is a very common and logical harmonic movement, confirming our analysis.\n*   **Notes on Beat 3:** The notes C♯, D, and F♯ on beat 3 function as non-chord tones (chromatic passing tones and approach notes) that create tension and lead smoothly into the ii° chord on beat 4. The rising bass line C♯-D-E propels the music forward to the dominant chord in the next measure.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the stable harmony formed on beat 4 and its function within the key of D minor, the most accurate Roman numeral for the circled passage is ii°.\n\n<<<ii°>>>"
