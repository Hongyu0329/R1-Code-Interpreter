    "The process depicted in the sequential images L, M, and N is **septal lysis**, also known as **septal schizolysis**, which is the enzymatic breakdown and splitting of a septum in a fungal hypha. This ultimately leads to the separation of hyphal compartments or the formation of individual cells called arthroconidia.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the process as seen in the images:\n*   **Image L:** This image shows a filament, which is a fungal hypha. The arrowhead points to a complete cross-wall, or septum, that separates two adjacent cells in the hypha.\n*   **Image M:** This panel shows the beginning of the lytic process. The septum indicated by the arrowhead is beginning to bulge and break down. This is caused by lytic enzymes that digest the septal wall.\n*   **Image N:** In the final stage shown, the enzymatic breakdown is more advanced. The bulging is more pronounced, and the cross-wall has begun to split, causing the hyphal filament to bend and leading to the eventual separation of the cells.\n\nThis process is a form of asexual reproduction or cell separation in some fungi. The septa provide structural support but also contain pores that can be plugged to prevent the loss of cytoplasm if the hypha is damaged. The controlled enzymatic degradation of these septa is a mechanism for cell separation and propagation."
