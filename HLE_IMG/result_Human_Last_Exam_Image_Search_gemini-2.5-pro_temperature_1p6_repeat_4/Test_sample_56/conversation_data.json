    "The artist of the painting is Jacek Yerka, and the title of the piece is \"Between Heaven and Hell\".\n\nJacek Yerka, born in 1952 in Toru≈Ñ, Poland, is a surrealist painter known for his fantastical and dreamlike landscapes. His work often features imaginative worlds and architectural structures, drawing inspiration from his childhood memories and the Polish countryside. \"Between Heaven and Hell\" is a quintessential example of his style, depicting a room that simultaneously opens up to a serene, idyllic landscape on one side and a turbulent, ominous sea on the other. This juxtaposition of contrasting worlds within a single, domestic space is a recurring theme in Yerka's art. The painting was created in 1989.\n\nYerka's art has been exhibited internationally and he was awarded the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist in 1995. His unique vision and meticulous technique have garnered him a significant following among fans of surreal and fantasy art.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
