    "On October 12, 2023, there was no musical performance held at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington.\n\nThe Spokane Symphony, which operates the theater, hosted an event called \"Barrister Chamber Soir√©es\" on that date, but it was held at the Barrister Winery, not at the Fox Theater itself. The theater's schedule for that month included \"Masterworks 2: Symphonic Graffiti\" on October 7-8 and \"Masterworks 3: Morihiko\" on October 21-22, both taking place at the Fox Theater.\n\n<<<No musical artist performed at the venue on that date.>>>"
