    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, here are the identified timestamps and calculations:\n\n**1. Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts:**\nSynchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands of firing activity across a large number of electrodes. The approximate centers of these bursts are:\n*   Burst 1: ~4 s\n*   Burst 2: ~17 s\n*   Burst 3: ~35 s\n*   Burst 4: ~48 s\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):**\nThe time intervals between consecutive bursts are calculated as:\n*   IBI 1 (between Burst 1 and 2): 17 s - 4 s = 13 s\n*   IBI 2 (between Burst 2 and 3): 35 s - 17 s = 18 s\n*   IBI 3 (between Burst 3 and 4): 48 s - 35 s = 13 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval:**\nThe average of these intervals is:\n*   Average IBI = (13 s + 18 s + 13 s) / 3 = 44 s / 3 â‰ˆ 14.67 s\n\nRounding this value to two significant figures gives **15 s**.\n\n<<<15>>>"
