    "The book that features the presented fragment on its cover is **Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal**, which is the Spanish edition of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.\n\nThe cover art was created by the Argentine illustrator Dolores Avendaño for the Spanish-language publisher, Ediciones Salamandra. In an interview, Avendaño mentioned that for the first book she introduced \"very magical elements like the unicorn, the castle, the three-headed dog and the apprentice wizard flying on his broom\".
