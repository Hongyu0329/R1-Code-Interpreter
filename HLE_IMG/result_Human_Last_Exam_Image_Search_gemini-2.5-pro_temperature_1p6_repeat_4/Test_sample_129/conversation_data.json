    "This image displays the crystal structure of the **human Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme CDC34**. It is also known as UBE2R1.\n\nThe protein is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID **2OB4**. This structure represents a single chain from *Homo sapiens* and was determined using X-ray diffraction.\n\nUbiquitin-conjugating enzymes are crucial in the process of ubiquitination, where ubiquitin is attached to a substrate protein. This process can mark the protein for degradation or alter its function. Specifically, CDC34 is involved in the degradation of cell cycle regulators and plays a role in the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle.\n\n<<<Human Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme CDC34 (PDB ID: 2OB4)>>>"
