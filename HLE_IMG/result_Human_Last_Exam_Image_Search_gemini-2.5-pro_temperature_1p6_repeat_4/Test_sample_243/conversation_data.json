    "The plant in the image is most likely *Ficus parietalis*. Key characteristics matching the image are the dark green leaves with a distinct, lighter-colored network of veins, and its growth habit as a shrub or climbing plant.\n\nThis plant is not endemic to a single island but has a broader native range. It is found in regions of Southeast Asia and Malesia. Specifically, its range includes Indo-China, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. While it's common in Borneo, it is not exclusively found there.\n\nTherefore, the plant is native to a wide region, not a specific island.\n\nThere is another plant called *Dorstenia gigas*, which is a famous endemic of Socotra and belongs to the same family (Moraceae), but it is a succulent \"bottle tree\" and looks very different. The unique flora of Socotra includes many endemic species like the Dragon's Blood Tree (*Dracaena cinnabari*), the Cucumber Tree (*Dendrosicyos socotranus*), and a unique pomegranate (*Punica protopunica*), but *Ficus parietalis* is not listed among them.\n\n<<<*Ficus parietalis* is not endemic to a single island but is native to a wider region of Southeast Asia and Malesia.>>>"
