    "The bryophyte shown in the image belongs to the genus *Ptychomnion*.\n\nThis identification is based on the highly characteristic appearance of the plant. The leaves are strongly folded or pleated (a feature known as being plicate or rugose) and curve in the same direction, which gives the stems a distinct, finely braided or plaited look. The genus name *Ptychomnion* itself comes from the Greek words *ptychios* (meaning 'folded') and *mnion* (meaning 'moss'), directly referencing these folded leaves.\n\nPlants in this genus are typically robust, forming mats on the forest floor, fallen logs, or sometimes as epiphytes on trees in wet forests of the Southern Hemisphere. A well-known species is *Ptychomnion aciculare*, which is colloquially called 'pipe-cleaner moss' due to its appearance, especially when dry. The plant is generally bright green when moist and can become more yellow-brown as it dries out.\n\n<<<Ptychomnion>>>"
