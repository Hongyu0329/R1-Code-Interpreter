    "The provided image displays a prominent pattern of spectral lines across the visible spectrum, including lines in the blue, green, yellow, and red regions. This complex pattern suggests a heavier element, as lighter elements typically have simpler spectra.\n\nIron (Fe) is known for its rich and complex emission spectrum, with a large number of lines spread across the visible range. The visual representation in the image, with its dense collection of lines, strongly corresponds to the known emission spectrum of iron. Specifically, iron's spectrum is characterized by numerous lines in the blue, green, and yellow-to-red portions of the spectrum, which is consistent with the image provided.\n\n<<<Iron (Fe)>>>"
