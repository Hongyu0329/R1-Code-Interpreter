    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, one must understand the atomic arrangement of an FCC lattice when projected onto the (110) plane.\n\nAn FCC unit cell has atoms at each of the eight corners and in the center of each of the six faces. The direction in a cubic system corresponds to a vector along a face diagonal.\n\nWhen viewing the FCC structure along this direction, the atoms project onto the viewing plane in a characteristic pattern. The projection reveals a rectangular arrangement. The atoms forming the corners of the conventional unit cell and the centers of the faces perpendicular to the viewing direction will form a rectangular pattern. Crucially, there will be an additional atom in the center of this rectangle. This central atom comes from the face-centers of the top and bottom faces of the unit cell (relative to the standard orientation).\n\nThis results in a repeating unit that is a centered rectangle. Let's analyze the given options:\n*   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular pattern of atoms. There are no atoms in the center of the rectangles.\n*   **Image B:** Shows a hexagonal or distorted hexagonal arrangement, which is characteristic of the FCC structure viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image C:** Displays a pattern of centered rectangles. There are atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an atom in the center of that rectangle. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image D:** Shows a more complex pattern that does not correspond to a simple projection of a standard crystal structure like the ones depicted.\n\nTherefore, the crystal lattice pattern in image C correctly indicates a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
