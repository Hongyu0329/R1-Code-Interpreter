    "The runestone fragment in the image is identified as **Sö 287**.\n\nThis determination is based on the visible rune sequences and their comparison with known Ingvar runestones. The search results confirm that Sö 287 is an Ingvar runestone. Although now lost, its inscription was recorded. The inscription of Sö 287 contains rune sequences that match the visible fragments in the image provided.\n\nThe Ingvar runestones are a group of about 26 runestones raised in memory of those who died during a Swedish Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. This expedition, which took place between 1036 and 1041, was a significant event in Swedish Viking history and is mentioned on more runestones than any other single event.<<<Sö 287>>>"
