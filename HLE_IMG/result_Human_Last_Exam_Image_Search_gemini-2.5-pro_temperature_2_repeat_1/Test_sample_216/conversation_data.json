    "The town in the image is Milford.\n\nRecent estimates place Milford's population at 2,251 in 2025 and 2,656 in 2023. The 2020 census recorded the population at 2,155. Living in Milford offers a dense suburban feel, and the public schools are considered above average.\n\nThe town is home to several grain elevators, including a Cargill facility and one operated by Farmers Cooperative. In fact, a downtown revitalization plan for Milford includes transforming the grain elevator north of City Hall into a regional landmark with potential enhancements like lighting or a mural.\n\n<<<Milford>>>"
