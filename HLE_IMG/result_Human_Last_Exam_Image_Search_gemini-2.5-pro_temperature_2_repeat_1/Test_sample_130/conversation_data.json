    "This image displays the emission spectrum for the element **Thorium (Th)**.\n\nThe image provided shows a very complex line spectrum, characterized by a high density of emission lines distributed across the entire visible range, from blue to red. This \"picket fence\" appearance is characteristic of heavy elements with complex electronic structures.\n\nA visual comparison with known reference spectra confirms this identification. Specifically, the visible emission spectrum of thorium is known to be extremely rich in lines. Spectrographs are often calibrated using thorium-argon lamps precisely because thorium offers a dense and well-documented set of reference lines throughout the visible spectrum. An identical image of the thorium visible spectrum is available on Wikipedia Commons.\n\n<<<Thorium>>>"
