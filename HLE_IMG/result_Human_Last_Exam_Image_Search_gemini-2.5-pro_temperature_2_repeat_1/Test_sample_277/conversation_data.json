    "The image provided is completely black and does not show any molecules. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the specific isomeric relationship between non-existent structures. All the options (a, b, c, d) describe a relationship between two or more actual chemical compounds based on their formula and the arrangement of their atoms.\n\n*   **Constitutional isomers** have the same molecular formula but a different bonding sequence.\n*   **Stereoisomers** have the same molecular formula and bonding sequence but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Conformers** (or conformational isomers) are a type of stereoisomer that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds.\n*   **Identical** molecules are superimposable on each other.\n\nSince no molecules are provided to compare, none of these classifications can be applied. The question is unanswerable as presented. Consequently, the correct choice is the one that accounts for the fact that none of the specific classifications of isomerism are applicable.\n\n<<<E>>>"
