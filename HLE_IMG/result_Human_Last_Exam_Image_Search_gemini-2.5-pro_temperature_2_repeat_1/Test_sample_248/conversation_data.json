    "Based on the visual evidence and distribution information, the species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast is the common periwinkle.\n\nThe large, light-colored snail with brownish spiral bands prominently featured in the center of the image is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It is now abundant and one of the most common marine snails on the rocky shores of the North Atlantic, with an established range from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware (or New Jersey in some sources) in the United States.\n\nWhile *Littorina littorea* has been found on the Pacific Coast on several occasions, these introductions have not resulted in established, reproducing populations. Reports from the Pacific coast describe findings of scattered individuals or small groups of adult snails, many of which have died out or been eradicated. Studies suggest that these individuals likely arrived as part of commercial shipments (e.g., with bait worms or lobsters) or were released from seafood markets and have failed to establish lasting populations. Therefore, finding a thriving community like the one pictured, with multiple organisms including *Littorina littorea*, strongly points to a location on the Atlantic coast where it is a dominant species.\n\nOther organisms in the photo, like the acorn barnacles, are likely *Semibalanus balanoides*. However, this species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and therefore cannot be used as the sole indicator.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
