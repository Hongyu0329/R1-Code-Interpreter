    "The correct answer is a Felt Hat. Here's why:\n\nThe man pictured in the image is Russian football player Fedor Chalov, who is receiving an award at the Russian Premier League closing ceremony on June 20, 2019. His first name, Fedor, is a homophone for \"Fedora,\" which is a well-known type of felt hat.\n\nThis connects to the second clue. The manufacturing of felt hats historically involved using mercuric nitrate to treat animal furs. This process, known as \"carroting,\" exposed hat makers to mercury vapors, leading to a neurological disorder called \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism. This hazardous use of mercury in hat-making has been discontinued due to its toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the pun on the name \"Fedor\" points to a \"Fedora,\" a type of \"Felt Hat,\" which has a history linked to the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
