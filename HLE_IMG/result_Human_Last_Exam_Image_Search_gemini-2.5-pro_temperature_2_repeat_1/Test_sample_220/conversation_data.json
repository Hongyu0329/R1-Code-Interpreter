    "A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure is characterized by having atoms at each corner of the cube and in the center of each of the six faces.\n\nWhen this structure is viewed along the crystallographic direction, the atoms project onto the viewing plane in a specific pattern. This projection reveals a rectangular arrangement of atoms. Specifically, the pattern consists of repeating rectangles with an atom at each corner and another atom in the very center of the rectangle.\n\nExamining the options provided:\n*   **Image A** shows atoms at the corners of a rectangle, but the two atoms inside are not centered, making this pattern incorrect.\n*   **Image B** and **Image C** do not display a clear, repeating rectangular lattice structure.\n*   **Image D** clearly shows a repeating pattern of centered rectangles. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles and one atom in the middle of each. This arrangement is the characteristic projection of the FCC lattice when viewed along the direction.\n\nTherefore, image D correctly represents the face-centered cubic structure as viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
