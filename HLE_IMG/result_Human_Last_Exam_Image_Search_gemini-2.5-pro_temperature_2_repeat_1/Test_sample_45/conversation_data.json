    "The tiling in the image exhibits **10-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of pattern is a form of quasicrystalline tiling, often related to Penrose tilings. These tilings are aperiodic, meaning they do not have translational symmetry; you cannot shift the entire pattern to match itself perfectly. However, they can possess rotational symmetry.\n\nVisually, the center of the image features a decagon (a ten-sided polygon) from which the pattern emanates. The arrangement of tiles, including the star-shaped motifs, repeats ten times around this central point. A full 360-degree rotation contains ten identical configurations, meaning the tiling maps onto itself every 36 degrees (360/10).\n\nWhile Penrose tilings are famously associated with 5-fold symmetry, certain variations and other quasicrystalline structures can display 10-fold rotational symmetry. The tiling shown, which includes decagons, hexagons, and other shapes, is a known example of a pattern with decagonal symmetry.\n\n<<<10-fold>>>"
