    "The checkmating sequence for black, without moving the queens, is:\n\n**1... Rf2**\n**2... Ng3#**\n\nThis sequence results in a checkmate regardless of White's move.\n\nAfter Black's first move, **Rf2**, the rook covers the g2 square, which is a potential escape square for the white king. White has two possible responses:\n\n*   **If White plays ...Bxc2:** Black responds with **Ng3+**. The white king is forced to move to h1. This square is attacked by the black knight on g3, and the king's escape squares are blocked: g2 is covered by the rook on f2, h2 is covered by the knight on g3, and g1 is occupied by the knight. This results in checkmate.\n*   **If White plays ...c4:** Black again plays **Ng3+**. The white king must move to h1. In this position, the king is in a double check from the knight on g3 and the queen on b1. The escape squares remain covered as before (g2 by the rook, h2 and g1 by the knight), leading to checkmate.\n\n<<<1... Rf2 2... Ng3#>>>"
