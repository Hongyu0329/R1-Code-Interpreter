    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, key morphological differences between males and females of these groups were used.\n\n**Pair A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n\n*   The individual on the left has a distinctly pointed abdomen, which is a characteristic of female *Coelioxys* bees. They use this sharp, cone-shaped abdomen to lay eggs in the nests of their host bees.\n*   The individual on the right has a blunter abdomen, which is typical for males of this genus.\n*   Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n\n**Pair B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n\n*   The individual on the left has relatively straight, shorter antennae, characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   The individual on the right exhibits antennae that are curled at the tips, a key feature of male paper wasps. In many species, males also have more yellow facial markings.\n*   Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n\n**Pair C: *Melissodes* (Long-horned Bees)**\n\n*   The insect on the left has exceptionally long antennae that curl backward, a defining characteristic of male bees in the tribe Eucerini, known as long-horned bees. Males in many *Melissodes* species also have a pale yellow marking on their clypeus (face), as seen here.\n*   The insect on the right has much shorter antennae, typical of a female long-horned bee. Females of this group possess dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on their hind legs to provision their nests.\n*   Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct indices are:\n\n**A: 4** (F, M)\n**B: 4** (F, M)\n**C: 3** (M, F)\n\n4, 4, 3\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
