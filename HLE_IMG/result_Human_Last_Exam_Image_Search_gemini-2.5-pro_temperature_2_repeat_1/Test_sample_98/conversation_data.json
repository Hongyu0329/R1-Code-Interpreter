    "This medallion is a gold octadrachm from the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. The coin features the jugate (overlapping) busts of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his sister-wife, Queen Arsinoe II. Such coins were part of a \"dynastic issue\" initiated in the 260s BCE to promote the royal family.\n\nOn one side, the medallion depicts Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II with the Greek inscription \"ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ\" (ADELPHON), meaning \"of the siblings.\" The other side typically shows the deified parents, Ptolemy I and Berenice I, with the inscription \"ΘΕΩΝ\" (THEON), meaning \"of the gods.\" The image provided shows the \"siblings\" side. These gold coins, known as *mnaieia* or octodrachms, were minted in Alexandria.\n\nThe production of this type of coin began during the reign of Ptolemy II, which lasted from 285 BCE to 246 BCE. Therefore, archaeologists attribute this medallion to the **3rd century B.C.**.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
