    "Based on the recurring annual spikes in the Google Trends data, the country in question is the United States. The three historical events represented by the trend lines are Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and the September 11th attacks.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n*   **The Red Line** shows a consistent spike in early December each year. This corresponds to National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, which is observed annually in the United States on December 7. This day commemorates the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, which led to the United States' entry into World War II. Congress designated December 7 as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994.\n*   **The Blue Line** displays a smaller, yet regular, spike in early June. This aligns with the anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 1944. This event marked the successful Allied invasion of Normandy, France, a major turning point in World War II. It is commemorated annually in the U.S. and abroad.\n*   **The Yellow Line** has annual peaks in early September, consistent with the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The notable, irregular spikes outside of the anniversary period can be attributed to significant news events, documentaries, or political discussions related to 9/11 that generate renewed public interest. The 20th anniversary in 2021, for instance, saw heightened media coverage and commemorative events.\n\nThese three events are cornerstones of modern American history, and their anniversaries consistently generate national reflection and discussion, as reflected in the search interest data.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
