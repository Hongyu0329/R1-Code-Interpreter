    "This piece of sheet music is the orchestral introduction to the second act of the opera *Wozzeck* by the Austrian composer Alban Berg.\n\nThe score is for a large orchestra and is written in an atonal style, characteristic of the Second Viennese School, to which Berg belonged. The German instruction \"(Vorhang)\" above rehearsal mark 1, which translates to \"(Curtain)\", indicates that this music is played just before the curtain rises on the first scene of the act. Analyses of *Wozzeck* confirm that the second act begins with a brief orchestral introduction before the stage action is revealed. A visual comparison with the published score of *Wozzeck* confirms that this is the opening of Act II.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
