    "The epiphytic species in the image displays a characteristic black, net-like growth pattern that strongly resembles fungal rhizomorphs. These structures are aggregations of hyphae, which look like roots and are also known as \"shoestrings.\"\n\nBased on these distinctive features, the genus of the organism is ***Armillaria***.\n\n*Armillaria*, commonly known as honey fungus or shoestring root rot, is a genus of parasitic fungi that can be pathogenic to trees. A key diagnostic sign of this fungus is the presence of dark brown to black rhizomorphs that can grow on or under the bark of infected trees, forming a net-like pattern. These rhizomorphs allow the fungus to spread from tree to tree through root contact or by growing through the soil. While the fungus can cause decay and harm to the host tree, its visible rhizomorphs are a prominent sign of its presence.\n\n<<<Armillaria>>>"
