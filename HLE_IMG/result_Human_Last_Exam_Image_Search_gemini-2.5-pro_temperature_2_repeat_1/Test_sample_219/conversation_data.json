    "Based on a visual inspection of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts, which appear as dense vertical bands of firing activity, occur at the following approximate timestamps:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** 2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 17 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 36 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 49 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval (the time between consecutive bursts), we first find the duration of each interval:\n\n*   **Interval 1:** 17 s - 2 s = 15 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nNext, we calculate the average of these intervals:\n\n*   **Average Inter-Burst Interval** = (15 s + 19 s + 13 s) / 3 = 47 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.67 s\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives an average inter-burst interval of 16 seconds.\n\n<<<16 s>>>"
