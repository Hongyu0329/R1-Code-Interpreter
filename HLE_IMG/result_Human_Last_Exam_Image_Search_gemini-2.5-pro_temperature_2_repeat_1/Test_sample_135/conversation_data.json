    "The author of this detail of the Altarpiece, which depicts the \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" is the Italian Renaissance artist Giacomo Cozzarelli. This terracotta relief is part of a larger altarpiece known as \"La Piet√†.\"\n\nThe altarpiece is housed in the Church of the Osservanza in Siena, Italy. Giacomo Cozzarelli was a Sienese artist who lived from 1453 to 1515. His work is characteristic of the High Renaissance and Renaissance-Baroque styles. This particular piece is noted for its intricate details and the emotive quality of the figures, which is a hallmark of Cozzarelli's style. The photograph of the altarpiece detail was taken around 1890 by Alinari Fratelli.\n\n<<<Giacomo Cozzarelli>>>"
