    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is not definitively available in the search results.\n\nBased on the visible signature in the bottom right corner of the artwork, the artist's last name is **Morandini**, and the painting is dated **1938**.\n\nSearches for Italian painters with this last name did not yield a conclusive match for the style and period of this specific watercolor. The work does not correspond to that of the well-known artist Marcello Morandini, who was born in 1940 and is famous for his Op Art, nor to other painters named Morandini whose works and timelines were reviewed.\n\nTherefore, while the surname of the artist is Morandini, the full name cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Morandini>>>"
