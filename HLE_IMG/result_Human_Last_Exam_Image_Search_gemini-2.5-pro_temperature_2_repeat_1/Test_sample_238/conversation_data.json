    "The black organism in the photo appears to be a type of parasitic fungus, commonly known as a pin mold, growing on the larger shelf fungus.\n\nThese tiny, black, hair-like structures with heads are the reproductive parts of the mold, called sporangiophores. Several types of fungi exhibit this growth pattern when parasitizing other fungi. For example, *Spinellus fusiger* is a common pin mold that grows on certain types of mushrooms, creating a fuzzy, pin-cushion appearance. Another possibility could be a species in the *Phaeocalicium* genus, which is known for growing on polypore fungi, though its hosts are somewhat specific. There are also non-lichenized \"pin\" fungi like *Chaenothecopsis caespitosa* that colonize old polypores.\n\nThe larger shelf fungus itself is a type of bracket fungus, which often grows on trees. These fungi can be saprophytic (feeding on dead wood) or parasitic (feeding on living trees). It's common to find molds and other fungi, known as mycoparasites, living on them.\n\nWithout microscopic examination, a definitive species identification of the pin mold is difficult, but it is a parasitic fungus.\n\n<<<Parasitic fungus (Pin mold)>>>"
