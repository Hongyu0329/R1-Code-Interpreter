    "The figure leaving the chariot is **Hippodamia**.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure vase illustrates the conclusion of the Greek myth about the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus of Pisa. The scene depicts the triumph of Pelops after he wins both the race and the hand of Oenomaus's daughter, Hippodamia.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the figures depicted on the vase:\n*   **Hippodamia**: The woman in the chariot, who appears to be ascending or being carried away in victory alongside her new husband, Pelops.\n*   **Pelops**: The charioteer, identifiable by the Phrygian cap he wears, which indicates his origin from Lydia in Asia Minor. He is the hero who challenged King Oenomaus for Hippodamia's hand.\n*   **Oenomaus**: The nude figure lying defeated on the ground beneath the chariot is the former king of Pisa and Hippodamia's father. According to the myth, Oenomaus would race all of his daughter's suitors, killing each one he defeated to prevent a prophecy that he would be killed by his son-in-law.\n*   **Nike**: The winged figure flying above the chariot is Nike, the goddess of Victory, symbolizing Pelops's divinely-aided success.\n\nPelops won the race through a combination of divine help from Poseidon, who gave him a divine chariot and sometimes-winged horses, and sabotage. In most versions of the myth, Pelops (or Hippodamia herself) bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the chariot's bronze linchpins with wax ones, causing the king to crash.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
