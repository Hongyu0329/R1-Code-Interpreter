    "Based on the transformations shown in the reaction scheme, the reagents A and B are as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nIn the first step, compound **1**, a tetramethoxy-triphenodioxazinium salt, is converted to compound **2**. This transformation involves the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms in the central heterocyclic ring system with a nitrogen atom that is also bonded to an amino (-NH₂) group. This specific transformation to an N-amino phenazinium derivative is achieved by reaction with hydrazine. Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, leading to a ring-opening and subsequent ring-closing sequence to form the new heterocyclic core of compound **2**.\n\n**Reagent B: Formaldehyde (CH₂O) and n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**\n\nThe second step converts compound **2** to compound **3**, a dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate. This reaction is a complex domino-type cyclization.\n*   **n-Propylamine** is required to introduce the propyl group onto one of the nitrogen atoms.\n*   **Formaldehyde** provides the single carbon atom needed to form the new five-membered ring that links the two lower phenyl rings, a key feature of the quinacridinium structure.\n\nThis type of reaction, where an N-amino-azinium salt reacts with an aldehyde and a primary amine to form a new fused ring system, is a known method for synthesizing quinacridinium dyes. The reaction is also accompanied by the elimination of a methoxy group to yield the final product **3**.\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄). Reagent B is a mixture of formaldehyde (CH₂O) and n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
