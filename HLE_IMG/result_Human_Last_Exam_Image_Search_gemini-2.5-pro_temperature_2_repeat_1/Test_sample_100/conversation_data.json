    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must analyze the reaction sequence step by step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material to Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of certain protecting groups, most notably the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. This reaction cleaves the PMB group from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:**\n        *   First, we determine the formula of the starting material. The bicyclic structure with the trifluoromethyl group and the ketone is C₈H₅F₃NO. The PMB group (p-methoxybenzyl, -CH₂C₆H₄OCH₃) has the formula C₈H₉O. Therefore, the starting material's formula is C₁₆H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n        *   The reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and adds a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   Change in atoms: -C₈, -H₉, -O, +H = -C₈H₈O.\n        *   The formula of **Intermediate 1** is C(16-8)H(14-8)F₃N(1)O(2-1) = **C₈H₆F₃NO**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The catalyst facilitates the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the carbon-carbon double bond, converting it into a single bond.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:**\n        *   The reaction adds one molecule of H₂.\n        *   The formula of **Intermediate 2** is C₈H(6+2)F₃NO = **C₈H₈F₃NO**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate 2 to Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is heated in the presence of strong aqueous acid (4 N HCl at 70 °C). Intermediate 2 is a cyclic amide, also known as a lactam. Under these conditions, the lactam undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:**\n        *   The hydrolysis of an amide bond consumes one molecule of water (H₂O). The C-N bond of the amide is cleaved, with the carbonyl group becoming a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the nitrogen atom becoming an amino group (-NH₂, protonated to -NH₃⁺ in acid).\n        *   The reaction adds one molecule of H₂O.\n        *   The formula of the **Product** is C₈H(8+2)F₃NO(1+1) = **C₈H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nFollowing the sequence of chemical transformations, the molecular formula of the final product is determined.\n\n<<<C₈H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
