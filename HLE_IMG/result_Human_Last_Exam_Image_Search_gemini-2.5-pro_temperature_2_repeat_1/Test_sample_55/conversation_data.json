    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397, form a G-sharp fully-diminished seventh chord.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The notes circled in measure 8 are G♯ and B♭ in the left hand (bass clef) and D and F♮ in the right hand (treble clef).\n*   **Chord Identification:** When arranged in thirds, these notes (G♯, B♭, D, F) form a G-sharp diminished seventh chord (G♯°⁷). The proper spelling of a G♯°⁷ chord is G♯-B-D-F. The use of B♭ instead of the enharmonically equivalent B is common for notational convenience.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This chord functions as a secondary leading-tone chord. The root, G♯, is the leading tone to A. In the key of D minor, the 'A' chord is the dominant (V). Therefore, the G♯°⁷ is the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant. This creates a strong pull towards the dominant chord, which appears in the following measures.\n\nThe correct Roman numeral for this chord is **vii°⁷/V**.\n\n<<<vii°⁷/V>>>"
