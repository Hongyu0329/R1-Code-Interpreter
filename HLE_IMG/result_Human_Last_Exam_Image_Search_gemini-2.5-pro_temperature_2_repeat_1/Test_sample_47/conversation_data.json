    "To determine the value of the current I, a method known as nodal analysis is employed, which focuses on finding the voltage at the key connection points (nodes) in the circuit.\n\n### Circuit Interpretation\n\nThe provided diagram shows a 41-volt DC power source connected across a network of resistors. The top line of the circuit is at a potential of +41 V, and the bottom line is connected to ground, representing a potential of 0 V. The current designated as 'I' flows through the 14 Ω resistor.\n\n### Nodal Analysis Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Nodes:** There are two primary unknown nodes in this circuit.\n    *   **Node V1:** The junction connecting the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors.\n    *   **Node V2:** The junction connecting the 14 Ω, 11 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors.\n\n2.  **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving it. We apply this law to both Node V1 and Node V2.\n\n    *   **At Node V1:** The currents flowing out of this node are through the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors. This gives the equation:\n        (V1 - 41) / 76 + (V1 - 41) / 8 + (V1 - V2) / 14 = 0\n\n    *   **At Node V2:** The currents flowing out of this node are through the 14 Ω, 11 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors. This yields the second equation:\n        (V2 - V1) / 14 + (V2 - 41) / 11 + (V2 - 0) / 29 = 0\n\n3.  **Solve the Equations:** These two linear equations are then solved for the unknown voltages, V1 and V2. Simplifying the equations leads to:\n    *   446 * V1 - 152 * V2 = 12054\n    *   -319 * V1 + 879 * V2 = 16646\n\n    Solving this system of equations gives the following node voltages:\n    *   V1 ≈ 38.205 V\n    *   V2 ≈ 32.800 V\n\n4.  **Calculate the Current I:** The current I is the current flowing through the 14 Ω resistor from Node V1 to Node V2. Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R):\n    *   I = (V1 - V2) / 14\n    *   I = (38.205 V - 32.800 V) / 14 Ω\n    *   I = 5.405 V / 14 Ω\n    *   I ≈ 0.386 A\n\nTherefore, the value of the current I is approximately 0.386 Amperes.\n<<<0.386>>>"
