    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Based on the structures of the reactants and the product, the sequence of events can be determined. The reactants are hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, and the reaction is initiated by light (hv).\n\nThe two reactions involved are:\n1.  **A photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening:** The first step is the ring-opening of cyclobutene to form 1,3-butadiene. Electrocyclic reactions involve the conversion of a pi bond to a sigma bond or vice versa within a conjugated system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the photochemical ring-opening of cyclobutene, a 4π-electron system, proceeds in a disrotatory fashion. This creates the diene necessary for the subsequent step.\n\n2.  **A photochemical [4+6] cycloaddition:** The 1,3-butadiene generated in the first step (a 4π-electron system) then reacts with hexafluorobenzene (a 6π-electron system). This reaction is a cycloaddition, where two molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct. Specifically, it is a [4+6] cycloaddition, resulting in the formation of the depicted product. While thermal [4+2] cycloadditions (Diels-Alder reactions) are common, photochemical cycloadditions involving benzene derivatives are also well-documented and can occur through various modes, including [2+2], [2+3], and [2+4] additions. The formation of the product in the image is consistent with a 1,4-addition across the benzene ring, which corresponds to a [4+6] cycloaddition. Such reactions are photochemically allowed. It is also known that hexafluorobenzene can undergo photochemical isomerizations itself, such as forming Dewar-hexafluorobenzene through a 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation is a sequence of a photochemical electrocyclic reaction followed by a photochemical cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, Cycloaddition]>>>"
