    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis species is a type of seed bug found throughout Central and North America. It is recognized by its distinct orange or red and black markings, which include a reddish-orange \"X\" on its back and a band of the same color across the section just behind its head, known as the pronotum.\n\nAlthough commonly named for the milkweed plant, the Small Milkweed Bug is known to feed on a variety of plants, including the goldenrod (*Solidago*) shown in the image. Its bright coloration serves as a warning to predators, indicating that it contains toxic substances absorbed from the plants it consumes.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus*, the eastern small milkweed bug, and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii*, the western small milkweed bug.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
