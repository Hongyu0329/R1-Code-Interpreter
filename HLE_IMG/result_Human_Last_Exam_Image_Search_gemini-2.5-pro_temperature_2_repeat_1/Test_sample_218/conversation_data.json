    "The reaction shown is a two-step deoxygenation of an alcohol.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of a thionocarbonate**\nGeraniol, a primary allylic alcohol, reacts with O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate in the presence of pyridine. The alcohol's oxygen atom acts as a nucleophile, attacking the thiocarbonyl carbon of the chlorothionoformate. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction and neutralize the HCl byproduct. This forms an O-geranyl O-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Reduction with LiAlH₄**\nThe intermediate is then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). This reaction typically cleaves the carbon-oxygen bond of the original alcohol, replacing the entire functional group with a hydrogen atom. For allylic systems like this, the hydride from LiAlH₄ can attack in two ways:\n\n*   **Sₙ2 pathway:** The hydride attacks the carbon atom that was originally bonded to the oxygen (the α-carbon). This leads to a direct replacement without rearrangement of the double bonds.\n*   **Sₙ2' pathway:** The hydride attacks the carbon at the other end of the double bond (the γ-carbon), causing the double bond to shift.\n\nIn the geranyl system, the α-carbon is a primary carbon (–CH₂–), which is sterically accessible for an Sₙ2 attack. The γ-carbon is a more sterically hindered tertiary carbon, making the Sₙ2' attack less favorable. Therefore, the major product, Compound A, is the one formed via the Sₙ2 pathway.\n\nStarting material (Geraniol): (2*E*)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-ol\n(CH₃)₂C=CH−CH₂−CH₂−C(CH₃)=CH−CH₂OH\n\nProduct A (from Sₙ2 reduction): The –CH₂OH group is replaced by a –CH₃ group.\n(CH₃)₂C=CH−CH₂−CH₂−C(CH₃)=CH−CH₃\n\nThe IUPAC name of Compound A is **(6*E*)-2,6-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**.\n\nThe structure of Compound A is:\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/2%2C6-Dimethylocta-2%2C6-diene.svg/200px-2%2C6-Dimethylocta-2%2C6-diene.svg.png\" alt=\"(6E)-2,6-Dimethylocta-2,6-diene\">\n\n<<<The product, Compound A, is (6E)-2,6-dimethylocta-2,6-diene, formed by the deoxygenation of geraniol.
