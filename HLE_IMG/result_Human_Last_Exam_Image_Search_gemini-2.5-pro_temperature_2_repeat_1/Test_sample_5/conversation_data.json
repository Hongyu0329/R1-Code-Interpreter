    "The provided sheet music is a piano arrangement of \"Last Remote,\" the extra stage theme from the Touhou Project video game \"Touhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism.\" The original music was composed by ZUN.\n\nThe distinctive opening, which starts gently and features a prominent G major scale in the right hand before erupting into a loud and complex passage, is a key identifier. Many fan-made arrangements of this piece exist, showcasing its popularity. The style is characteristic of many Touhou Project musical arrangements, known for their melodic appeal and virtuosic piano transcriptions.\n\n<<<Last Remote>>>"
