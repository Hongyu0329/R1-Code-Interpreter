    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₈ knot. Its Rasmussen s-invariant is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is an integer invariant of knots that arises from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the signature of the knot. The 8₁₈ knot is a non-alternating knot, but its Rasmussen s-invariant has been computed to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
