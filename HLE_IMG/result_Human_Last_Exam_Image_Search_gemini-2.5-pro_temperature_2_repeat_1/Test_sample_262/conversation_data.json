    "Based on a review of the provided chemical structures and relevant scientific literature, we can determine which complexes are likely to exhibit shorter lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Structures\n\nAll four molecules are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a general structure of `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where:\n*   Two `(C^N)` ligands are cyclometalated phenylpyridines (ppy).\n*   One `(N^N)` ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, which is the same for all four complexes.\n*   One of the phenylpyridine ligands is unsubstituted (ppy).\n*   The second phenylpyridine ligand is substituted with fluorine atoms.\n\nThe key difference for determining relative stability lies in the fluorination of the second ppy ligand:\n*   **Complexes 1 and 2** possess a **di-fluorinated** phenylpyridine ligand (two fluorine atoms).\n*   **Complexes 3 and 4** possess a **mono-fluorinated** phenylpyridine ligand (one fluorine atom).\n\nComplexes 1 and 2 are isomers of each other, as are complexes 3 and 4. The difference within each pair is the geometric arrangement of the ligands around the central iridium atom.\n\n### Impact of Fluorination on LEC Lifetime\n\nIn the context of emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), fluorination is often employed to increase the stability and volatility of the complexes. The high strength of the carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond can enhance the overall robustness of the molecule.\n\nHowever, for **cationic iridium complexes used in LECs**, a different trend is frequently observed. The operational stability and device lifetime are intrinsically linked to the chemical stability of the emitter under bias. Several studies have shown that increasing the fluorine content in these specific types of complexes can lead to decreased device stability and shorter lifetimes.\n\nA key study on a series of similar iridium(III) complexes demonstrated a clear correlation: a shorter device lifetime was obtained upon increasing the fluorine content of the emitter. The lifetime was reported to decrease significantly as the number of fluorine atoms per complex increased from zero to two, and then to four. This has been attributed to degradation pathways involving defluorination (loss of fluorine) under the high-energy and ionic conditions present during LEC operation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing this established trend for cationic iridium emitters in LECs:\n*   Complexes 1 and 2, which contain two fluorine atoms, are expected to be less stable.\n*   Complexes 3 and 4, which contain only one fluorine atom, are expected to be more stable.\n\nTherefore, the complexes with the higher fluorine content, ** and**, are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n<<<E>>>"
