    "This coin, a 9 Deniers of King Louis XV, does not originate from a single specific French colony. Instead, it was minted in France for general circulation throughout its colonies in the Americas.\n\nThe inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" indicates its intended use overseas. These copper coins, struck in 1721 and 1722 at the mints of La Rochelle (mint mark H) and Rouen (mint mark B), were authorized for use in French North American territories, including New France (which encompassed Louisiana, Acadia, and Canada) and the French West Indies.\n\nThe obverse of the coin features the crowned, interlaced \"L\" monogram of King Louis XV, with the Latin motto \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM,\" meaning \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" The reverse displays the words \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" above the date and mint mark.\n\nThese coins were introduced by a private trading company, the Company of the Indies. However, they were not well received by the colonists, who preferred billon (low-grade silver) coins, and a large quantity was returned to France in 1726.\n\n<<<New France (including Louisiana and Canada) and the French West Indies>>>"
