    "Yes, the animal in the image is a species of longhorn beetle. Its scientific name is ***Stictoleptura rubra***.\n\nThis beetle is commonly known as the red-brown longhorn beetle or simply the red longhorn beetle. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, meaning the males and females have different appearances. The beetle in the picture is a male, identified by its black head and pronotum (the segment behind the head) and reddish-brown elytra (wing cases) with black tips. Females of the species are typically a more uniform reddish-brown color.\n\n*Stictoleptura rubra* can be found throughout Europe, Russia, and North Africa. The larvae develop in the deadwood of coniferous trees, and the adults, which are active in the summer, feed on nectar and pollen from flowers. This particular beetle belongs to the family Cerambycidae, known for their characteristically long antennae. It is also sometimes referred to by its synonym, *Anoplodera rubra*.\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
