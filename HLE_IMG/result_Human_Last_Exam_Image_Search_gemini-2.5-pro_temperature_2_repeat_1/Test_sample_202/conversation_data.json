    "This is an identification of four different rock specimens. Based on their visual characteristics, here is a detailed identification:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is a type of volcanic rock characterized by its reddish-brown color and high porosity, with many visible, bubble-like cavities known as vesicles. Scoria is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano and cools rapidly. Its color is often due to the oxidation of iron.\n\n*   **Specimen I is Concrete.** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments of different sizes cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. While it resembles a sedimentary rock called breccia, the heterogeneous mix of aggregates in a light-colored cement is more characteristic of man-made concrete.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This is a light-colored, porous volcanic rock. Like scoria, pumice is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions from gas-filled lava. However, pumice has a higher silica content, which gives it a lighter color, typically white to gray, and a lower density, sometimes allowing it to float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K is Pegmatite.** This igneous rock is distinguished by its very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture, known as phaneritic, indicates that the magma from which it formed cooled very slowly, deep within the Earth's crust, which allowed ample time for large crystals to grow. Pegmatites can contain large crystals of minerals such as feldspar, quartz, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Concrete, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
