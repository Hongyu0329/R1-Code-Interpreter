    "The key to distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance lies in the structure of their sporophytes, specifically the seta.\n\nThe main difference is:\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has capsules on a **straight, erect seta**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a capsule on an **arcuate, or curved, seta**.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to tell these two moss species apart when they have sporophytes is by observing whether the stalk holding the capsule is straight or curved.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte at a glance is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
