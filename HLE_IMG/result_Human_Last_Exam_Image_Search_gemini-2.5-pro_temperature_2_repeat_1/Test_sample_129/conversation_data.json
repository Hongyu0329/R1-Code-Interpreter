    "This image displays the molecular structure of a protein complex. Specifically, it is the **complex between the H-Ras protein and the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the Raf-1 kinase**.\n\nThe larger protein shown in dark blue is H-Ras, a small GTPase that acts as a molecular switch in cells. The smaller light-blue segment is the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1, one of the key downstream effector proteins that H-Ras interacts with to transmit signals. This interaction is a critical step in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which controls fundamental cellular processes like cell growth and differentiation.\n\nThe specific crystal structure shown in the image is often identified by its Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, such as 4G0N or 7JHP, which represent slightly different experimental structures of the human H-Ras and C-Raf complex. The interaction primarily involves an antiparallel beta-sheet formed between the two proteins. Understanding this structural interaction is crucial for developing therapies against cancers driven by mutations in Ras and Raf genes.\n\n<<<H-Ras in complex with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 kinase>>>"
