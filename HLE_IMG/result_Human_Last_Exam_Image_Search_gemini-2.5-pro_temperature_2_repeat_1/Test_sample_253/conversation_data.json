    "### Identifying the Organism\n\nThe image provided shows a vibrant yellow lichen growing on a rock, noted as being taken in Acadia National Park. This park is known for its rich and diverse lichen population, with over 400 species identified. The lichen in the photograph is a foliose (leafy) lichen with distinct, cup-like structures known as apothecia. Based on its appearance and location, the lichen is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common sunburst lichen. This species is documented as being present in Acadia National Park, often found on granite outcrops near the shoreline.\n\n### The XPH1 Protein in *Xanthoria parietina*\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a type of protein known as a class I hydrophobin, which is found in the fungal component of the lichen *Xanthoria parietina*. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that are secreted by filamentous fungi. They play a crucial role in the symbiotic relationship that forms the lichen by creating a water-repellent surface on the fungal hyphae. This hydrophobic layer is essential for preventing the lichen from becoming waterlogged, which allows for the necessary gas exchange for the algal partner to perform photosynthesis. The production of XPH1 is dependent on the symbiotic relationship; when the fungal partner is grown in a lab without the alga, it does not produce the protein.\n\n### Amino Acid Count of XPH1\n\nResearch papers detailing the cloning and sequencing of the XPH1 gene in *Xanthoria parietina* provide the number of amino acids in the resulting protein. According to one study, the deduced amino acid sequence of the XPH1 protein indicates it is composed of **83 amino acids**. Another study describes the encoded protein as containing 110 amino acids, which includes a secretion signal that is later cleaved off to form the mature, functional protein. The study focusing on the mature protein isolated from the symbiotic phenotype specifies the 83 amino acid count.\n\n<<<83>>>"
