    "The chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397, contains the notes A, C-sharp, E, and G-sharp. This combination of notes forms an A major seventh chord. In the key of D minor, the dominant chord is built on the fifth scale degree, which is A.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key:** D minor\n*   **Dominant Note:** A (the fifth note of the D minor scale)\n*   **Chord Notes:** The left hand plays A and C-sharp, while the right hand plays a broken chord with C-sharp, E, and G-sharp. Combined, the notes are A-C#-E-G#.\n*   **Chord Quality:** This spelling creates a major triad (A-C#) with a major seventh (G#).\n*   **Function:** This chord serves a dominant function, leading toward the tonic key of D minor. The standard dominant seventh chord in D minor would be A7 (A-C#-E-G). The use of a G-sharp instead of a G-natural is a chromatic alteration. The G-sharp acts as a leading tone to the root of the chord, A, heightening the tension before the cadenza that follows.\n\nThe correct Roman numeral for a major seventh chord built on the dominant is **Vmaj7**. While a V7 is far more common in classical period music to establish the dominant, this Vmaj7 is used for dramatic and coloristic effect within the improvisatory \"fantasia\" style.\n\n<<<Vmaj7>>>"
