    "The epiphytic species in the image is a leafy liverwort, and its genus is *Frullania*.\n\nThis identification is based on the distinct appearance of the organism, which forms dark, lacy or scaly-looking patches that grow tightly pressed against the tree bark. *Frullania* is a large and diverse genus of leafy liverworts known for this characteristic appearance. Species in this genus are common epiphytes on tree bark, where they can thrive in relatively dry and exposed conditions.\n\nThe organism in the photo displays a dark, reddish-brown to almost black coloration and a finely branched, intricate pattern, which are typical for *Frullania* species. These liverworts are often described as forming dark purple or brown circular patches on tree trunks. The fine, overlapping, leaf-like structures create the scaly or web-like texture visible in the image.\n\nWhile other organisms like sooty mold or other genera of liverworts can be found on tree bark, the visual evidence is most consistent with *Frullania*. Sooty mold, a type of fungus, typically appears as a more superficial, powdery black layer without the organized, plant-like branching structure seen here. Other epiphytic liverworts, like *Radula*, are usually a paler green color.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
