    "The alkaloid compound shown is **Sophocarpine**.\n\nSophocarpine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid with the chemical formula C₁₅H₂₂N₂O. It is naturally found in plants of the *Sophora* genus, such as *Sophora flavescens* and *Sophora alopecuroides*, which are used in traditional medicine.\n\nThe structure features a complex, fused four-ring system containing two nitrogen atoms and a ketone functional group. A key characteristic that distinguishes it from the related alkaloid, matrine, is the presence of a double bond in the ring adjacent to the carbonyl group, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nAlso known by synonyms like 13,14-Didehydromatridin-15-one, sophocarpine has been studied for a variety of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antiviral properties. Research indicates it acts on several biological pathways, including as a PTEN activator and an inhibitor of signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and NF-κB.\n\n<<<Sophocarpine>>>"
