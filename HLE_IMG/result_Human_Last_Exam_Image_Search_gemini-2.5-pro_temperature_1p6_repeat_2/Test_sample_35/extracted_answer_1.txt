Based on the visual evidence, S100B binds to the extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains of the RAGE receptor. The information provided suggests that S100B is a prognostic marker, as its overexpression is directly linked to the activation of pathways causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, indicating that its levels can predict the severity and progression of neurological disorders.
