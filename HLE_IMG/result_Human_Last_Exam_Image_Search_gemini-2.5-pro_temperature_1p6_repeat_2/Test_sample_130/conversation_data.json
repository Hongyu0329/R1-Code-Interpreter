    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element Iron (Fe).\n\nA reverse image search reveals that the provided image is part of a larger graphic from the HubbleSite, which displays the emission spectra for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and iron. An emission spectrum is created when a gas glows, emitting light at specific wavelengths, resulting in a unique pattern of bright lines that acts as a \"spectral signature\" for each element.\n\nBy comparing the provided image to the four spectra in the HubbleSite graphic, the complex pattern of numerous lines across the entire visible spectrum—from blue and green to orange and red—is a clear match for the emission spectrum of iron. The other elements shown (carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) have far fewer and more distinct lines.\n\n<<<Iron>>>"
