    "A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, when viewed along the direction, exhibits a characteristic centered rectangular pattern.\n\nIn an FCC lattice, atoms are positioned at each corner of the cube and in the center of each face. The view along the direction, which is the direction of a face diagonal, creates a projection where atoms form a rectangular grid. Critically, the atoms at the center of the faces of the unit cell project to the center of these rectangles. This results in a repeating pattern of a rectangle with an atom at its center.\n\nObserving the provided images:\n*   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular lattice without any atoms in the center of the rectangles.\n*   **Image B** displays a hexagonal arrangement, which is characteristic of the FCC lattice viewed along the direction (the close-packed plane).\n*   **Image C** clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern, matching the expected projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image D** presents a body-centered rectangular pattern.\n\nTherefore, image C correctly represents a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
