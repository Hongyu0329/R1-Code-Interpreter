    "The process depicted in the sequential images L, M, and N is the **formation of a clamp connection** in a fungal hypha.\n\nThis distinctive feature is primarily found in fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. The images show the development of this structure:\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a segment of a fungal hypha, which is a long, branching, filamentous structure. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that divides the hypha into separate cells.\n*   **Panel M:** A small, hook-like bulge, which is the initial stage of the clamp connection, begins to form near the septum. This process is initiated in the terminal cell of a dikaryotic hypha (a hypha containing two distinct nuclei per cell).\n*   **Panel N:** The hook-like structure continues to grow and curves backward toward the parent hypha.\n\nThis entire process is a sophisticated mechanism to ensure that when a dikaryotic cell divides, each of the resulting daughter cells receives one of each type of nucleus. Following the stage shown in panel N, the clamp connection will fuse with the sub-apical cell, allowing one of the newly divided nuclei to bypass the newly formed septum and restore the dikaryotic state in that cell. The presence of clamp connections is a key characteristic used in the identification and classification of many basidiomycete fungi.\n\n<<<clamp connection formation>>>"
