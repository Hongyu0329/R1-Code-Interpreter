    "The operational lifetime of iridium(III) complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is critically dependent on their chemical stability under electrical bias. A key factor influencing this stability is the substitution pattern on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands.\n\n**Key Principles of Stability:**\n\n*   **Degradation Pathway:** A primary degradation mechanism for these types of complexes involves reactions at the C-H bonds located on the phenyl ring in the positions *ortho* to the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond. The bonds at these positions are activated by the metal center and can be susceptible to attack or undesirable reactions during device operation.\n*   **Fluorine Protection:** Replacing these vulnerable *ortho* C-H bonds with much stronger and more inert C-F bonds is a common and effective strategy to block this degradation pathway. This substitution enhances the complex's stability and is expected to lead to longer device lifetimes. Conversely, complexes that retain C-H bonds at these ortho positions are considered more susceptible to degradation and are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Analysis of the Complexes:**\n\nLet's examine the number of unprotected C-H bonds *ortho* (adjacent) to the Ir-C bond for each complex:\n\n*   **Complex 1:** Both positions *ortho* to the Ir-C bond on each phenyl ring are occupied by hydrogen atoms. This means each of the two cyclometalating ligands has two vulnerable C-H bonds, for a total of four in the complex. This structure is the most susceptible to the known degradation pathway.\n*   **Complex 2:** One of the two *ortho* positions on each phenyl ring is protected by a fluorine atom, while the other remains a C-H bond. This complex is more stable than Complex 1 but still possesses vulnerable sites.\n*   **Complex 3:** Similar to Complex 2, one *ortho* position on each phenyl ring is protected by a fluorine atom, leaving one C-H bond per ligand as a potential degradation site. This complex should have comparable stability to Complex 2.\n*   **Complex 4:** Both positions *ortho* to the Ir-C bond on each phenyl ring are protected by fluorine atoms. This complex lacks the vulnerable *ortho* C-H bonds and is therefore expected to be the most stable and exhibit the longest lifetime.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on this analysis, the stability of the complexes is expected to increase in the following order: Complex 1 < (Complex 2 â‰ˆ Complex 3) < Complex 4.\n\nThe question asks which complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes. Complexes 1, 2, and 3 all contain the vulnerable *ortho* C-H bonds that make them less stable than the fully protected Complex 4. Therefore, they are all expected to have shorter lifetimes relative to Complex 4.\n\n<<<K>>>"
