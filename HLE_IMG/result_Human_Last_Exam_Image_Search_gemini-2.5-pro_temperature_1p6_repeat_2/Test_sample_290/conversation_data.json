    "Based on the visual evidence and search results, this image was taken in **Seattle, Washington**.\n\nThe key features in the image are a beach scene at sunset with people around a bonfire, calm waters consistent with the Puget Sound, and a forested shoreline in the background. A distinctive chain-link fence is also visible in the foreground.\n\nSeveral parks in Seattle fit this description. Search results confirm that bonfires are a popular activity at specific parks in Seattle, particularly Golden Gardens Park and Alki Beach. Both locations offer views of the Puget Sound and have designated fire pits for public use. In 2022, the year the photo was taken, beach fires were permitted at both Golden Gardens and Alki Beach from late May through early September. Events featuring bonfires were also hosted at Golden Gardens during the summer of 2022.\n\nThe combination of the sandy beach, the bonfire, the sunset over the water, and the surrounding natural environment are all characteristic of Golden Gardens Park. This park is well-known for its \"California-style sand beach,\" forest trails, and some of the best sunset views in Seattle, making it a popular spot for locals. The view from the beach includes the water of the Puget Sound and the Shilshole Bay Marina.\n\nWhile other Seattle beaches also have beautiful views, Golden Gardens is particularly noted for the combination of a large sandy beach, fire pits, and adjacent natural, forested areas, which align with all the elements seen in the photo.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
