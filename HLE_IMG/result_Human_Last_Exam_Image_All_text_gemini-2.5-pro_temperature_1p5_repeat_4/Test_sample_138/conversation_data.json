    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the question's premises.**\n    *   The question concerns pollinators from taxa where females lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. This means we are likely looking at wasps, cleptoparasitic bees (which don't collect pollen), or bees that carry pollen internally (in their crop) or on an abdominal scopa.\n    *   We need to determine the sex (Male or Female) for each of the two insects in the three pairs labeled A, B, and C.\n    *   The answer format requires the index of the correct option for each pair (A, B, C) separated by commas. The options are: 1) M, M; 2) F, F; 3) M, F; 4) F, M.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Pair A.**\n    *   These appear to be cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are kleptoparasites and females do not have scopae, fitting the question's description.\n    *   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is distinctly tapered to a sharp point. This is a characteristic feature of a female *Coelioxys*, whose modified abdomen (ovipositor) is used to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Insect A (Right):** The tip of the abdomen is blunt and possesses multiple spines or prongs. This morphology is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Pair B.**\n    *   These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, so they fit the question's description.\n    *   **Insect B (Left):** Observe the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a reliable characteristic of male wasps in many families, including Vespidae. The face also appears to have more extensive yellow markings, another common trait for males of this genus. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight, not curled at the tips. The facial markings are darker with less yellow than the individual on the left. These features are characteristic of a female paper wasp. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze Pair C.**\n    *   These are bees. The premise about the lack of leg scopae can be confusing here, but the sexual characteristics are very distinct. We should prioritize these clear morphological traits.\n    *   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, much longer than its head is wide. This is the defining feature of a male \"long-horned bee\" from the tribe Eucerini. Additionally, its clypeus (the facial plate above the mandibles) is bright yellow, a common secondary sexual characteristic of male bees. Males do not have scopae. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has short antennae, typical for a female bee in this group or related groups. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow clypeus of the male. Even if this bee belongs to a species where females have leg scopae (which would contradict the prompt's premise), these two features (short antennae, dark face) are strong indicators of female sex in this type of bee. The prompt likely selected a male (which never has a scopa) and a female from a taxon that fits the rule (e.g., a Megachilid with an abdominal scopa) or contains an error in its premise. Regardless, based on morphology, this individual is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consolidate the answer.**\n    *   Pair A is (F, M), which is option **4**.\n    *   Pair B is (M, F), which is option **3**.\n    *   Pair C is (M, F), which is option **3**.\n    *   The final answer, in the format \"A, B, C\", is \"4, 3, 3\".\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
