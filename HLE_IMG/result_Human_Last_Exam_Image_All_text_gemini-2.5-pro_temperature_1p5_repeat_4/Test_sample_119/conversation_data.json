    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule).\n*   Let's assume one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14). The remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   Using the Rule of 13 for the remaining mass: 121 ÷ 13 = 9 with a remainder of 4. This suggests a base formula of C₉H₄₊₉ = C₉H₁₃.\n*   Combining this with the nitrogen, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   The MS also shows a significant fragment ion at m/z = 91, which is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C₇H₇⁺), formed from a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks present, indicating C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks present, indicating C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chains).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹, ~1450 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   There are no other prominent peaks for other functional groups like carbonyl (C=O, ~1700 cm⁻¹) or nitrile (C≡N, ~2250 cm⁻¹).\n*   There might be a weak, broad absorption around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, which could correspond to an N-H stretch of an amine.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon environments. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, there must be some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This pattern (4 signals for 6 carbons) is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 70 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   \"one negative and five positive signals\" -> Total of 6 signals.\n    *   Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals, one carbon must be a quaternary carbon (which is invisible in DEPT spectra). The signal at **145.1 ppm** is the only one not accounted for and is in a typical range for a substituted aromatic carbon (ipso-carbon).\n    *   Negative signal: one CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals: five signals from CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n*   Combining the information:\n    *   The 3 aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be CH groups (positive).\n    *   The 3 aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) must consist of one CH₂ (negative), and two CH/CH₃ groups (positive).\n    *   The signal at **19.2 ppm** is typical for a CH₃ group (positive).\n    *   Therefore, the signals at **49.6 ppm** and **43.5 ppm** must be one CH (positive) and one CH₂ (negative).\n\n**4. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **~δ 7.2 ppm (multiplet):** The integration value (visually summing the two parts, ~2.0+3.0) is 5H. This confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   The remaining part of the molecule must be C₃H₈N. The total protons in this group are 13 - 5 = 8.\n*   **Aliphatic region:**\n    *   **~δ 2.85 ppm (multiplet, integration ~2H):** A CH₂ group.\n    *   **~δ 2.75 ppm (multiplet, integration ~1H):** A CH group.\n    *   **~δ 1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ~3H):** A CH₃ group next to a CH group.\n*   The total number of protons on the side chain carbons is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6H.\n*   Since the side chain has a formula of C₃H₈N, the remaining 8 - 6 = 2 protons must be attached to the nitrogen atom, indicating a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   Let's assemble the C₃H₆-NH₂ side chain:\n    *   The 3H doublet at 1.2 ppm and the 1H multiplet at 2.75 ppm indicate a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n    *   The 2H multiplet at 2.85 ppm is a -CH₂- group.\n    *   This gives a C₃ alkyl chain: -CH₂-CH(CH₃)-.\n    *   Combining with the phenyl group and the amine group, we have two possible isomers:\n        1.  `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`\n        2.  `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`\n\n**5. Analysis of the HSQC Spectrum**\n*   HSQC correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n*   **Correlation 1:** Protons at δ ~1.2 ppm (the CH₃ doublet) correlate with the carbon at **δ 19.2 ppm**.\n*   **Correlation 2:** Protons at δ ~2.75 ppm (the CH multiplet) correlate with the carbon at **δ 49.6 ppm**.\n*   **Correlation 3:** Protons at δ ~2.85 ppm (the CH₂ multiplet) correlate with the carbon at **δ 43.5 ppm**.\n*   **Let's evaluate the isomers based on these correlations:**\n    1.  `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`:\n        *   CH₂ is attached to the phenyl group. Expected ¹³C shift ~40-45 ppm.\n        *   CH is attached to the amine group. Expected ¹³C shift ~50 ppm.\n        *   Our HSQC shows the CH₂ carbon is at 43.5 ppm and the CH carbon is at 49.6 ppm. This is a **perfect match**.\n    2.  `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`:\n        *   CH is attached to the phenyl group. Expected ¹³C shift ~40-45 ppm.\n        *   CH₂ is attached to the amine group. Expected ¹³C shift ~50 ppm.\n        *   This contradicts our HSQC data, which shows the CH carbon is downfield of the CH₂ carbon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectroscopic data, particularly the HSQC and MS fragmentation (m/z=91), consistently point to the structure being 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**IUPAC Naming**\n*   The parent chain is the three-carbon propane chain.\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂). Numbering the chain to give the amine the lowest number, it is on carbon 2 (propan-2-amine).\n*   A phenyl group (-C₆H₅) is a substituent on carbon 1.\n*   The full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
