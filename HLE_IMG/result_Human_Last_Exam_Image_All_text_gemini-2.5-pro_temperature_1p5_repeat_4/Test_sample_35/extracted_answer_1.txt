Based on the provided diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V and C1 domains** of the **RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products)** receptor.

S100B would serve as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. An adjunct marker primarily aids in diagnosis, but the pathway shows that S100B is not just present during the disease—it actively drives the pathology. The binding of S100B to RAGE initiates signaling cascades (JNK/JUN, NFκβ) that directly lead to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since higher levels of S100B would intensify these pathological processes, its concentration can be used to predict the severity and rate of progression of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
