    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, a common way to visualize neuronal activity.\n*   **Y-axis (Electrode Number):** Represents 128 different electrodes, each recording the activity of one or more nearby neurons. The recordings are stacked vertically.\n*   **X-axis (Time (s)):** Represents time in seconds, from 0 to just over 50 seconds.\n*   **Black Dots:** Each dot represents a spike or \"firing\" of a neuron detected by a particular electrode at a specific point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons (and thus many electrodes) fire at a very high rate nearly simultaneously. In the raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands of black dots, indicating high activity across a large portion of the electrode array within a short time window.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph, we can identify five major synchronized bursts. We need to estimate the timestamp for each burst. A common method is to identify the center of the burst along the time axis.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Timestamps of the Bursts**\nLet's estimate the time at the center of each prominent vertical band:\n*   **Burst 1:** The first burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 1 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 13 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and last major burst in this window is centered at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 1 s, 13 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the midpoints of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, so there will be four inter-burst intervals.\n*   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and 2):**  t₂ - t₁ = 13 s - 1 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and 3):**  t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 13 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and 4):**  t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₄ (between Burst 4 and 5):**  t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 12 s + 11 s + 12 s + 12 s = 47 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 47 s / 4 = 11.75 s\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.75 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1.\n*   The third digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the second digit.\n*   Rounding 11.75 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 seconds.\n\n<<<12>>>"
