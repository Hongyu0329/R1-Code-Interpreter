    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song's title, musical style, and country of origin from the provided sheet music.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music's Characteristics:**\n    *   **Notation Type:** The music is written as a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the core melody, basic chord structure (e.g., C, E7, F, G7), and lyrics (though none are included here). This format is common in jazz, pop, and folk music, allowing for improvisation and arrangement by the performers.\n    *   **Key and Time Signature:** The music is in the key of C Major (or its relative minor, A minor) as indicated by the absence of sharps or flats in the key signature. The time signature is 4/4, also known as \"common time\".\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking at the top left says \"MOD. [illegible] = 128,\" indicating a moderate tempo with approximately 128 beats per minute.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The chord progression includes standard chords like C, F, G7, but also more colorful chords like E7, C-, and A-. The progression `C | E7 | F | C/G7` is a key feature. This harmonic movement is characteristic of many popular songs from the mid-20th century, particularly from the Tin Pan Alley and jazz standard repertoires.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is syncopated and features a swing-like feel, with many eighth notes and melodic contours that are highly lyrical.\n\n2.  **Identify the Melody:**\n    *   By reading the first few bars of the melody, we can identify the song.\n    *   The song begins with two pickup notes: G and A.\n    *   The first full measure contains the notes C, C, B, C over a C major chord.\n    *   The next measure has the notes D, C#, C, B over an E7 chord.\n    *   This melodic sequence is the iconic opening of the verse of the song **\"La Vie en Rose\"**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Musical Style:**\n    *   \"La Vie en Rose\" is the signature song of French singer **Édith Piaf**.\n    *   Its primary genre is **Chanson française** (or simply **Chanson**), a style of lyric-driven song originating in France.\n    *   Due to its immense popularity, harmonic structure, and adoption by artists like Louis Armstrong, it is also widely considered a **traditional pop** ballad and a **jazz standard**. The lead sheet format itself is strongly associated with jazz performance practice.\n\n4.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The song's title, \"La Vie en Rose,\" is French for \"Life in Pink.\"\n    *   The lyrics were written by Édith Piaf (French) and the music was composed by Louiguy (a French composer of Italian origin) in 1945.\n    *   The song is one of the most famous symbols of French popular music worldwide.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin is **France**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   The handwriting on the lead sheet is informal, but the musical information (notes, chords, structure signs like the Segno and Coda) is clear enough for identification.\n*   While the melody is the primary clue, the chord progression `C -> E7 -> F` is also a very strong indicator of this specific song. The E7 acts as a secondary dominant, leading to the F chord, which is a common and recognizable harmonic device.\n*   The term \"musical style\" can be broad. \"Chanson\" is the most specific and historically accurate style for this piece's origin, while \"traditional pop\" and \"jazz standard\" describe how it has been adopted and performed globally. All are valid descriptions.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody and chord progression in the provided lead sheet, the song is identified as \"La Vie en Rose\". This classic piece is a French *Chanson* that has also become a traditional pop and jazz standard.\n\n<<<**Title:** La Vie en Rose\n**Musical Style:** Chanson / Traditional Pop / Jazz Standard\n**Country of Origin:** France>>>"
