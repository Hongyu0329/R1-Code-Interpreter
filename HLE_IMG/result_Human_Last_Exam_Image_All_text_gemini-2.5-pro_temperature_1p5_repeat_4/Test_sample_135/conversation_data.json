    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\n*   **Medium and Style:** The image shows a high-relief sculpture, a circular panel (a roundel or tondo) set within a larger decorative frame. The glossy, reflective surface and the color palette (though it's a black and white photo, the values suggest white and blue, typical of this style) are characteristic of glazed terracotta, a technique famously pioneered and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in 15th-century Florence. The style of the figures—with their graceful poses, classical features, and flowing drapery—is quintessentially that of the Italian Renaissance.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion or the Sacrament of the Altar. A priest is distributing the communion wafer to kneeling figures, including children.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with an inscription: \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This appears to be a mix of Latin and Old Italian/French, meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar\".\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the initial analysis.**\nThe combination of the glazed terracotta medium, the Renaissance style, and the religious subject strongly points to the circle of the Della Robbia workshop in Florence. Key artists from this circle include Luca della Robbia, Andrea della Robbia, Giovanni della Robbia, and followers like Benedetto Buglioni.\n\n**Step 3: Use the specific details to identify the exact artwork and artist.**\n*   The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a unique identifier. Searching for this inscription along with terms like \"Della Robbia,\" \"glazed terracotta,\" or \"altarpiece\" is an effective strategy.\n*   This search leads to the identification of the work as a detail from the predella (the lower support section) of a large altarpiece.\n*   The specific altarpiece is the *Altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints Cosmas, Damian, Sebastian, and Roch*.\n*   This altarpiece is located in the Pieve di San Pietro a Gropina, in the municipality of Loro Ciuffenna, Italy.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the author of the identified altarpiece.**\n*   Art historical sources attribute this specific altarpiece, including its predella with the five roundels, to **Benedetto Buglioni** (1461–1521).\n*   Buglioni was an Italian sculptor who worked extensively with glazed terracotta and was heavily influenced by Andrea della Robbia, with whom he may have trained. His style is so similar that his works are sometimes confused with those of the Della Robbia family.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the style, medium, subject, and inscription, the artwork is identified as a roundel from the predella of the Gropina Altarpiece. This work is attributed to the Florentine Renaissance sculptor Benedetto Buglioni.\n\n<<<Benedetto Buglioni>>>"
