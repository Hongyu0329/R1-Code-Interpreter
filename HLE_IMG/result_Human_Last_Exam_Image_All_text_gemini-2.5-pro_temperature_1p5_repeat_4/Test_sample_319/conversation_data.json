    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided information to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image Content**\nThe image consists of two plots, which are common representations of sound.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows the frequency content of a sound over time. It starts with a single, stable horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is then interrupted by a wide vertical bar, which signifies a burst of sound containing a broad range of frequencies, characteristic of noise. After the interruption, the plot continues, in this stylized version showing two horizontal lines.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It begins as a smooth, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone in the spectrogram. During the interruption, the waveform becomes highly complex and irregular, consistent with noise. After the interruption, the waveform becomes periodic again, but more complex than the initial sine wave.\n\nThe key event depicted is a continuous tone being interrupted by a burst of noise.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clues**\nThe text provides crucial context to interpret the image.\n*   **\"elements related to an illusion\":** This tells us we are looking for a name of a perceptual illusion, where perception does not match the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a famous optical illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives. \"Bistable ambiguity\" means our perception can switch between two stable interpretations. This suggests the auditory phenomenon in question also involves some form of perceptual choice or ambiguity. In this case, the ambiguity is whether the tone actually stops during the noise or continues \"behind\" it.\n*   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This points to a fundamental mechanism of the brain. The brain often \"fills in\" missing sensory information based on context to create a coherent and continuous experience of the world. We are typically not aware that this is happening.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Phenomenon**\nCombining the visual and textual information:\n1.  The phenomenon is an **auditory illusion**.\n2.  It involves a sound (a tone) that is physically interrupted by another sound (noise).\n3.  The illusion is that the listener perceives the original sound as **continuous**, as if it were never interrupted. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone through the noise.\n4.  This \"filling in\" is an unconscious perceptual ability that resolves the ambiguity of the situation (Is the sound broken or continuous?) in favor of continuity.\n\nThis specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuing through an interruption that could plausibly mask it, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is a primary example of \"perceptual restoration\" of sound.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
