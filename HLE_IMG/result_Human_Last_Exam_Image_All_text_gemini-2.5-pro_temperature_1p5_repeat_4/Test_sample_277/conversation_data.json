    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Question and Provided Information:** The user has provided a multiple-choice question asking to identify the type of isomerism between \"the molecules mentioned above\". The options are (a) conformers isomers, (b) constitutional isomers, (c) Identical, (d) stereoisomers, and (e) None of these. The critical piece of information, the image of the molecules, is a blank black square.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The central issue is that the molecules in question are not shown. The image that should display them is empty. Without the structures of the molecules, it is impossible to perform any chemical analysis.\n\n3.  **Define the Terminology (Careful Points):** To answer the question correctly, we would need to compare the molecules based on the following definitions:\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The types and numbers of atoms in a molecule (e.g., C₂H₆O).\n    *   **Connectivity:** The sequence in which atoms are bonded together.\n    *   **Spatial Arrangement:** The three-dimensional orientation of the atoms.\n\n    Now, let's relate these to the given options:\n    *   **(b) Constitutional Isomers:** Have the *same molecular formula* but *different connectivity*. We would need to see the structures to determine and compare these two properties.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** Have the *same molecular formula* and the *same connectivity*, but differ in their *spatial arrangement*. These cannot be interconverted by simple bond rotation. We need to see 3D representations to check this.\n    *   **(a) Conformers:** Are different spatial arrangements of the *same molecule* (identical formula and connectivity) that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. They are a specific type of stereoisomer but are often treated separately.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** The structures represent the very same molecule, possibly drawn from a different perspective. They would have the same formula, same connectivity, and would be superimposable.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Conclusion Based on the Missing Information:**\n    *   Since the molecules are not visible, we cannot determine their molecular formulas.\n    *   We cannot determine their atomic connectivity.\n    *   We cannot determine their spatial arrangement.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot classify their relationship as constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, conformers, or identical. None of the conditions for options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be verified.\n\n5.  **Select the Best Answer:** Given that it is impossible to choose any of the specific classifications from (a) to (d), the only logical choice is (e) \"None of these\". This option is appropriate when the provided choices are incorrect or, as in this case, when the question is unanswerable due to missing information, meaning none of the specific classifications can be applied.\n\n<<<e>>>"
