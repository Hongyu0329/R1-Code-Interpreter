    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musical Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab Major or F Minor.\n    *   **Chord Progression Start:** The first chord is F minor (F-), which confirms that the piece is in the key of F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written with numbers, the grouping of notes per measure indicates a 4/4 time signature, which is typical for jazz standards.\n    *   **Form:** The piece follows a clear 32-bar AABA structure. There is an 8-bar \"A\" section which is repeated (with first and second endings), followed by an 8-bar \"B\" section (the bridge), and then a final 8-bar \"A\" section.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the \"A\" Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   **Melody:** The melody begins on the note C (the 5th of F minor) and descends. The first measure contains the notes C, C, Bb, Ab. The second measure has G and F. The third has Eb and Db. This descending melodic contour starting on the 5th is a very strong characteristic.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression for the A section is:\n        `||: F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | C7 :||`\n        (Note: Eø7 is E half-diminished 7, also written as E-7b5).\n    *   **Identification:** The combination of this specific descending melody and the chromatic descending nature of the root movement in the chords (F -> E -> Eb -> Db) is the most defining characteristic of the song **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the \"B\" Section (The Bridge):**\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression for the bridge is:\n        `|| Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 ||`\n    *   **Comparison:** This bridge is different from the original bridge written by the composer of \"Yesterdays\". The original bridge has a different, less dense harmonic movement. The bridge in this chart uses a \"cycle of dominants\" (G7 is the V of C; C7 is the V of F; F7 is the V of Bb; the ii-V of Bb-7 to Eb7 leads to Ab). This type of reharmonization, substituting a more complex bridge, is a very common practice in jazz performance and improvisation, particularly from the bebop era onward.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Composer Identification:**\n    *   Despite the substituted bridge, the identity of the song is overwhelmingly established by its highly recognizable \"A\" section melody and core harmonic structure. In the jazz world, such a piece is still referred to by its original title.\n    *   The song \"Yesterdays\" was composed by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, for the 1933 musical *Roberta*. It has since become a major jazz standard.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Handwritten Chart:** The sheet music is a handwritten \"lead sheet,\" which often contains personal annotations, simplifications, or common reharmonizations rather than the original published version.\n*   **Reharmonization:** The key to identifying this standard is recognizing that jazz musicians frequently alter or substitute chords. The substituted \"bebop\" bridge does not change the fundamental title of the song, which is defined by its famous \"A\" section.\n*   **Chord Voicings:** The notation `Eb-6` might be a slight inaccuracy or a specific arranger's choice. Given the melody note (Db) over that chord, an `Eb-7` chord would be a more conventional fit, but the chart is analyzed as written.\n*   **Melody is Key:** In cases of reharmonization, the melody is often the strongest clue for identification, and the melody here is unmistakably from \"Yesterdays\".\n\nThe title of this jazz standard is \"Yesterdays\" and the composer is Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Yesterdays, Jerome Kern>>>"
