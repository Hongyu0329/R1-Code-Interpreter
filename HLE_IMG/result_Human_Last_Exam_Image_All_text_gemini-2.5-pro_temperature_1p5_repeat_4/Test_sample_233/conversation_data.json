    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe image provided shows a close-up of a runestone inscription. Key visual features are:\n*   **Layout:** The runes are carved within well-defined horizontal bands separated by straight, carved lines. This is a specific style, different from the more common style where runes follow the outline of a serpent or dragon.\n*   **Runic Script:** The script is the Younger Futhark, typical of the Viking Age.\n*   **Separators:** Small crosses (`x`) are used as word or punctuation separators between sequences of runes.\n*   **Rune Forms:** The runes are clearly carved. Some have distinctive shapes which can be helpful for identification.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the visible runes.**\nTo identify the specific stone, we can attempt to read the inscription. Let's transcribe the runes in the most complete rows.\n\n*   **Second row from the top:** This line is very clear. Starting from the left, after a separator cross (`x`), we see the following runes:\n    *   `ᛋ` (s-rune, Sól)\n    *   `ᛏ` (t-rune, Týr)\n    *   `ᛅ` (a-rune, Ár) - this is a \"short-twig\" version.\n    *   `ᛁ` (i-rune, Íss)\n    *   `ᚾ` (n-rune, Nauðr)\n    This sequence transliterates to **s-t-a-i-n**, which spells the Old Norse word `stain`, meaning \"stone.\" This is a very common word on runestones.\n\n*   **Top row:** This row shows the end of a word. The runes visible are:\n    *   `ᚱ` (r-rune, Reið)\n    *   `ᛅ` (a-rune, Ár) - this one is a \"long-branch\" variant with two swooping lines.\n    *   `ᛁ` (i-rune, Íss)\n    *   `ᛋ` (s-rune, Sól)\n    *   `ᚦ` (th-rune, Þurs) - this rune has a very distinct shape, resembling a Latin 'P'. This is a known stylistic variant.\n    This sequence reads **r-a-i-s-þ**, which is the core of the word `raisþi`, meaning \"raised.\"\n\n*   **Third row from the top:** This row begins with a separator cross (`x`), followed by:\n    *   `ᛅ` (a-rune, Ár) - short-twig version.\n    *   `ᚠ` (f-rune, Fé)\n    *   `ᛏ` (t-rune, Týr)\n    *   `ᛁ` (i-rune, Íss)\n    *   `ᚱ` (r-rune, Reið)\n    This sequence spells **a-f-t-i-R**, which is the word `aftiR`, meaning \"in memory of\" or \"after.\"\n\n**Step 3: Combine the transcribed text and search for the specific Ingvar runestone.**\nThe question specifies this is an \"Ingvar runestone,\" a group of about 26 runestones commemorating those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition. We now have a significant portion of the text: `...raisþi...stain...aftiR...` (\"...raised...stone...in memory of...\"). We need to find an Ingvar runestone with this text, carved in horizontal bands, and with a `þ`-rune shaped like a 'P'.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the runestone from a known catalog.**\nConsulting a database or list of Ingvar runestones, we look for a match.\n*   The runestone **Sö 131**, located at Gåsinge-Dillnäs Church in Södermanland, Sweden, is a known Ingvar stone.\n*   Its inscription is carved in horizontal bands.\n*   The full inscription reads: `* þura : raisþi : stain * þansi * aftiR * sua(i)n * sun * sin * ...` which translates to \"Þóra raised this stone in memory of Sveinn, her son...\"\n*   This inscription contains the exact sequence we transcribed: `...raisþi : stain...aftiR...`.\n*   Photographs of the actual Sö 131 stone confirm the details seen in the fragment, including the horizontal bands and the unique 'P'-shaped `þ`-rune.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe inscription fragments `...raisþi...`, `stain`, and `aftiR`, combined with the horizontal banded style and the specific shape of the `þ` rune, definitively match the Ingvar runestone cataloged as Sö 131.\n\n<<<Sö 131>>>"
