    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Second Clue**\nThe second clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This is a very specific piece of information. The most famous historical use of mercury salts that led to toxicity was in the felt-hat-making industry. Hat makers used mercuric nitrate in a process called \"carroting\" to separate fur from the skin and mat the fibers together. The resulting mercury vapor exposure often led to neurological damage, known as \"mad hatter disease.\" This is the origin of the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\" Therefore, \"X Y\" is very likely related to the word **Hatter**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Clue and the Image**\nThe first clue provides an image and a date: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Identify the event and people:** The image shows an awards ceremony. A search for major awards on or around June 20, 2019, points to the NHL Awards, which were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   **Identify the individuals:** The younger man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The older man presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n*   **Identify the achievement:** At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov won three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (league's top point scorer). Winning three significant accolades like this is commonly referred to as a **\"hat trick\"** of awards.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Clues**\nNow we must connect the \"Hatter\" from Step 1 with the hockey \"hat trick\" from Step 2.\n*   The term \"hat trick\" in sports originates from cricket, where a bowler taking three wickets with three consecutive balls was awarded a new hat. The term was later adopted by hockey and other sports.\n*   A person who makes hats is a **Hatter**.\n*   The riddle creates a play on words: a person who achieves a \"hat trick\" (like Nikita Kucherov with his awards) can be metaphorically referred to as a \"Hatter.\"\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n*   The **\"X Y\"** pictured is Nikita Kucherov, who can be described as a **\"Hatter\"** in this context because he achieved a \"hat trick\" of awards at the event shown.\n*   The **\"Another X Y\"** that has ceased to be used is the traditional **Hatter** (the profession), whose methods involving mercury salts were highly toxic.\n\nThus, the word that satisfies both clues is \"Hatter\".\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
