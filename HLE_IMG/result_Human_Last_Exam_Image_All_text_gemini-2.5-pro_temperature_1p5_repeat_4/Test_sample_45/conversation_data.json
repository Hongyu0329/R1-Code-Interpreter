    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling. This means we need to find the largest number 'n' such that rotating the entire pattern by 360/n degrees around some point leaves the pattern unchanged. This is also called 'n-fold' rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we look for points in the pattern that could serve as centers of rotation. Good candidates are the centers of the geometric shapes or the vertices where multiple shapes meet. In the given tiling, we can identify several distinct points:\n*   The center of the dark blue hexagons.\n*   The center of the light yellow squares.\n*   The center of the star-like motifs formed by six orange rhombi.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each potential center of rotation**\n\n*   **Center of the star motif:**\n    Let's examine the point where six orange rhombi meet at their tips, forming a star shape.\n    *   This point is surrounded by these six identical rhombi in a circular arrangement.\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around this central point, each rhombus moves to occupy the exact position and orientation of its neighbor.\n    *   Looking further out, this rotation also moves each of the surrounding yellow squares to the position of the next square, and each of the more distant blue hexagons to the position of its corresponding neighbor.\n    *   The entire pattern, including all shapes and colors, appears identical after a 60-degree rotation.\n    *   This means the center of the star motif is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Center of a blue hexagon:**\n    *   A blue hexagon is surrounded by six yellow squares (one on each side) and six orange rhombi (one at each vertex).\n    *   If we try to rotate the pattern by 60 degrees (for 6-fold symmetry) around the hexagon's center, the square on the top side would be mapped to a position where there is an orange rhombus at a vertex.\n    *   Since a square and a rhombus are different shapes, the pattern is not unchanged. Therefore, the center of a hexagon is **not** a center of 6-fold symmetry.\n    *   (Note: A 120-degree rotation, or 3-fold symmetry, does work for this point, as it maps squares to squares and rhombi to rhombi).\n\n*   **Center of a yellow square:**\n    *   A yellow square is surrounded by four blue hexagons, one on each of its sides.\n    *   To test for 4-fold symmetry, we rotate by 360/4 = 90 degrees. This would map the hexagon on the top side of the square to the position of the hexagon on the right side.\n    *   However, upon close inspection, these hexagons have different orientations. The hexagon above the square rests on a horizontal side, while the hexagon to the right rests on a vertical side. Since their orientations are different, a 90-degree rotation of the entire pattern does not leave it looking the same.\n    *   Therefore, the center of a square is **not** a center of 4-fold symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the overall symmetry**\nThe rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the highest order of rotational symmetry found anywhere in the pattern.\n*   We found points of 6-fold symmetry.\n*   We ruled out any higher order symmetries, and we demonstrated that not all points have this high level of symmetry.\n*   Since 6-fold symmetry exists in the pattern, this is the rotational symmetry of the tiling. The existence of 6-fold symmetry implies the existence of 3-fold and 2-fold symmetries as well (a 120째 rotation is just two 60째 rotations, and a 180째 rotation is three 60째 rotations).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Highest Order:** The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which conventionally means the highest order present.\n2.  **Orientation Matters:** When checking for symmetry, it's not enough that a shape of the same type moves to a new position; it must also have the correct orientation. This was key to disproving 4-fold symmetry.\n3.  **Local vs. Global:** We need to ensure that the rotation works for the entire pattern, not just the immediate neighbors of the center point. Because this tiling is periodic, checking the first few layers of surrounding tiles is sufficient.\n4.  **Most Symmetric Point:** Often, the point with the highest visual complexity or order (like the meeting point of the six rhombi) is the center of the highest rotational symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
