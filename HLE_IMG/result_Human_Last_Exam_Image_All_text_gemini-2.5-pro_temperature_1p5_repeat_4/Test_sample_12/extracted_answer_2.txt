No, based on the provided framework, the salience of diagnostic stimuli does not depend on the learner's individual differences. The framework defines salience through four specific properties of the simulation itself: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity. These are all described as design features of the simulation and the information presented, rather than characteristics of the learner. The diagram and the text focus exclusively on these objective components and do not include any element representing the learner's individual traits as a factor influencing salience.
