1. In measure 11, the music modulates to A minor. At the beginning of measure 12, it briefly tonicizes F# minor.
2. The overall passage is a dominant preparation for the new key of E major. The brief modulations to A minor and F# minor are justified as a harmonic journey through the subdominant (iv) and supertonic (ii) of the target key (E major), creating a more sophisticated and dynamic transition.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is viiÂ°6/iv (the first-inversion leading-tone chord of the subdominant, analyzed in the context of the target key, E major).
