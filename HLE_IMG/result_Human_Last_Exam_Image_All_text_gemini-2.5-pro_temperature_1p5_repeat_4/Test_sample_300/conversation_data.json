    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine the author.\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1.  **Artwork 1 (Top-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese ink and color painting depicting women from an ethnic minority, likely at a market. The style features realistic figure drawing combined with expressive brushwork, particularly in the clothing. This subject matter and style are hallmarks of the contemporary artist **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**, who is renowned for his figure paintings of Tibetan people and other ethnic groups. The painting is titled \"Market Day\" (赶集).\n    *   **Author:** Shi Guoliang\n\n2.  **Artwork 2 (Top-Center):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an ink wash landscape painting. The style is highly abstract, reducing mountains and buildings to a series of energetic lines, dots, and ink washes. This unique method of blending traditional Chinese ink aesthetics with Western abstract principles is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, one of the most important figures in 20th-century Chinese art.\n    *   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n3.  **Artwork 3 (Top-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly dynamic and powerful cursive script (草書). The flowing, unrestrained, and highly personal style is immediately recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. His calligraphy is one of the most famous of the 20th century.\n    *   **Author:** Mao Zedong\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy. The brushwork is thick, dense, and has a \"clumsy\" or archaic quality (拙, zhuō), which is a highly valued aesthetic in literati art. The signature on the left can be identified as \"宾虹\" (Bīnhóng). This is the unmistakable style of the great modern master **Huang Binhong (黄宾虹)**, who was as celebrated for his calligraphy as for his landscape paintings.\n    *   **Author:** Huang Binhong\n\n5.  **Artwork 5 (Center):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a realist oil painting depicting a young woman in a white shirt holding a sketchbook and pencil. The style is marked by meticulous detail, soft lighting, and a classical, serene mood. This is an iconic work of the Chinese \"Neoclassicism\" movement of the 1980s. The painting is titled \"Youth\" (青春) and is a masterpiece by **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**. The model is his wife.\n    *   **Author:** Yang Feiyun\n\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a color ink painting of a lady with an elaborate headdress, large earrings, and birds around her. The characteristic features—the square format, the gracefully elongated face and eyes of the woman, and the fusion of Eastern ink techniques with Western modernist composition and color—are the signature style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n    *   **Author:** Lin Fengmian\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom-Left):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This painting shows a vibrant courtyard scene with hanging loofah gourds, laundry, and a rooster. The style is characterized by strong, rhythmic black outlines filled with bright, flat patches of color, reminiscent of both folk art and Western Fauvism. This distinctive visual language is another well-known style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, often used for depicting rural scenery and hometown memories.\n    *   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom-Center):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a traditional-style landscape painting (shanshui) of a dramatic river gorge. The majestic, imposing mountains rendered with rich ink tones and the fleet of boats with distinct red sails are characteristic of the Lingnan School of painting. Specifically, this grand and powerful style is the work of **Guan Shanyue (关山月)**, a leading figure of the school known for his landscapes that often captured the spirit of a new China.\n    *   **Author:** Guan Shanyue\n\n9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom-Right):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster against a light blue-green wash. The ability to capture the essence, translucency, and vitality of creatures like shrimp and lobsters with minimal, expert brushstrokes is the most famous skill of the modern master **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. This subject and its execution are quintessentially his.\n    *   **Author:** Qi Baishi\n\n**Final List of Authors:**\n\nFrom left to right, from top to bottom:\n1.  Shi Guoliang\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Mao Zedong\n4.  Huang Binhong\n5.  Yang Feiyun\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Guan Shanyue\n9.
