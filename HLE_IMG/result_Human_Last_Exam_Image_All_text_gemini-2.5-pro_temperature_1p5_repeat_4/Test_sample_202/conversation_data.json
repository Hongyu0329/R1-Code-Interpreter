    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n\n*   **Careful Points & Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock has a reddish-brown, almost rusty color.\n    *   **Texture:** The most prominent feature is the presence of numerous holes or cavities, known as vesicles. This gives the rock a bubbly, cindery, or spongy appearance. The texture is highly vesicular.\n    *   **Grain Size:** The rock material between the vesicles is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Interpretation & Identification:**\n    *   The vesicular texture is a clear indicator of an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed from lava cooling at the Earth's surface. The vesicles are bubbles of gas that were trapped as the lava solidified.\n    *   The reddish color suggests a mafic to intermediate composition (rich in iron and magnesium), where the iron has oxidized (rusted).\n    *   A highly vesicular, mafic, extrusive rock is identified as **Scoria**. It is often referred to as \"lava rock.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n\n*   **Careful Points & Observations:**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of smaller rock fragments (clasts) that are cemented together in a finer-grained material (matrix). This is a fragmental or pyroclastic texture.\n    *   **Composition:** The clasts are angular and appear to be of various volcanic rock types. The matrix is light-colored and looks like consolidated ash.\n    *   **Grain Size:** There is a mixture of grain sizes, from the ash-sized matrix to pebble-sized fragments (lapilli).\n*   **Interpretation & Identification:**\n    *   This rock is formed from the accumulation and consolidation of materials ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption.\n    *   A rock made of consolidated volcanic ash is known as **Tuff**. When it contains larger fragments like those seen here, it can be called a lapilli tuff or a volcanic breccia. \"Tuff\" is the correct general classification.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n\n*   **Careful Points & Observations:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light in color, ranging from white to light gray.\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, it is extremely vesicular. It appears very frothy and lightweight. The structure might even look glassy or fibrous between the vesicles.\n    *   **Density (Inferred):** The extreme porosity (high volume of holes) suggests a very low density.\n*   **Interpretation & Identification:**\n    *   This is another extrusive igneous rock formed from a gas-rich lava.\n    *   However, its light color indicates a felsic composition (rich in silica, like rhyolite). Felsic lavas are very viscous, which traps gas very effectively during explosive eruptions.\n    *   A light-colored, extremely vesicular, low-density volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**. It is famous for being the only rock that can float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n\n*   **Careful Points & Observations:**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is made of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n    *   **Color & Mineralogy:** The rock is predominantly light-colored. We can distinguish different minerals: glassy, gray crystals (likely **Quartz**), opaque white-to-pinkish crystals (likely **Feldspar**), and some dark, flaky or blocky minerals (likely **Biotite** or **Hornblende**).\n*   **Interpretation & Identification:**\n    *   The phaneritic texture indicates that the rock is intrusive, meaning it cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, which allowed large crystals time to grow.\n    *   The mineral composition (quartz and feldspar dominant) points to a felsic composition.\n    *   An intrusive, phaneritic, felsic rock is called **Granite**. Because the crystals are exceptionally large, the more specific and accurate identification is **Granite Pegmatite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite Pegmatite\n>>>"
