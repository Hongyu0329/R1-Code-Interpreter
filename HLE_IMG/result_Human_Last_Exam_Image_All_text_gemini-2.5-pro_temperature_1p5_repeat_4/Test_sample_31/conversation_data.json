    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\nFirst, we analyze the provided knot diagram.\n1.  **Crossing Number:** We count the number of crossings in the diagram. There are 8 crossings.\n2.  **Alternating Property:** We trace the knot's strand and observe the crossings. The strand consistently passes over, then under, then over, and so on. This means the diagram is an **alternating diagram**. A knot that has an alternating diagram is called an **alternating knot**.\n3.  **Knot Table Identification:** We compare the diagram with standard knot tables. This specific diagram is a well-known projection of the knot **8_18** from the Rolfsen knot table. The 8 indicates the crossing number, and 18 is its index in the table.\n\n**Step 2: Recall properties of the knot 8_18**\nNow that we have identified the knot as 8_18, we can use its known properties from knot theory literature and databases.\n1.  **Amphichirality:** The knot 8_18 is known to be **amphichiral** (or amphicheiral). An amphichiral knot is one that is isotopic to its own mirror image.\n2.  **Knot Signature:** The signature of a knot, denoted `\\sigma(K)`, is an important integer invariant. A fundamental theorem in knot theory states that any amphichiral knot must have a signature of zero.\n    Therefore, for our knot K = 8_18, we have **`\\sigma(8_18) = 0`**.\n\n**Step 3: Define and apply the Rasmussen invariant formula**\nThe question asks for the **Rasmussen invariant**, denoted `s(K)`. This is a modern knot invariant derived from a structure called Khovanov homology.\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** Calculating `s(K)` directly from its definition is a highly complex process, especially for a knot with 8 crossings.\n2.  **Formula for Alternating Knots:** Fortunately, a major theorem by Jacob Rasmussen provides a simple way to calculate the s-invariant for any alternating knot. The theorem states that for an alternating knot `K`, its Rasmussen invariant is directly related to its signature by the formula:\n    **`s(K) = -\\sigma(K)`**\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final answer**\nWe now have all the necessary components to find the answer.\n*   The knot is 8_18, which is an alternating knot.\n*   The signature of 8_18 is `\\sigma(8_18) = 0`.\n*   We apply the formula `s(K) = -\\sigma(K)`.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n`s(8_18) = -\\sigma(8_18) = -(0) = 0`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Knot Identification:** The primary step is correctly identifying the knot. The visual evidence that the diagram represents 8_18 is very strong, as it matches standard representations in knot theory literature (e.g., the Knot Atlas).\n*   **Alternating Property:** The validity of the formula `s(K) = -\\sigma(K)` hinges on the knot being alternating. The provided diagram is indeed alternating.\n*   **Signature Property:** Using the property that `\\sigma(K)=0` for an amphichiral knot is a reliable shortcut. The alternative would be to compute the signature from the diagram using methods like the Goeritz matrix, which is a significantly more complex and error-prone calculation. The amphichirality of 8_18 is a standard, well-documented fact.\n*   **Correct Formula:** It is essential to use the correct formula `s(K) = -\\sigma(K)`, paying attention to the minus sign. This relation is a cornerstone result in modern knot theory.\n\nConclusion: Based on the identification of the knot as 8_18 and the application of established theorems relating its properties, the Rasmussen invariant is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
