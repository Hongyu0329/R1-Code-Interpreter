    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core structure of the molecule.**\n    The molecule is a polycyclic compound, meaning it consists of multiple fused rings. It contains two nitrogen atoms, which are incorporated into the ring system. This class of naturally occurring, nitrogen-containing compounds are known as alkaloids. Specifically, this structure is based on a tetracyclic (four-ring) framework. This framework is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids, particularly those of the sparteine type. The parent hydrocarbon skeleton, if the C=O were a CH₂, would be sparteine.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the functional groups.**\n    The most prominent functional group, besides the two tertiary amine nitrogens, is the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is part of a six-membered ring that also contains a nitrogen atom. A cyclic amide is called a lactam. Since the ring is a six-membered ring, it is specifically a δ-lactam (or a piperid-2-one derivative). The presence of this lactam group is a key feature for identifying the compound.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate the structure to known alkaloids.**\n    The compound is an oxo-derivative of sparteine. The specific alkaloid with a carbonyl group at the C-2 position (standard numbering for this class of compounds) of the sparteine skeleton is a well-known natural product. This compound belongs to the family of Lupin alkaloids, which are found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific stereochemistry.**\n    The drawing uses wedges and dashes to indicate the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms (stereochemistry).\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the junction of the two leftmost rings is shown with a dash (pointing into the page).\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the bottom-most bridgehead is shown with a dash.\n    *   The hydrogen atom at the rightmost bridgehead is also shown with a dash.\n    This specific relative stereochemistry corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer of this alkaloid.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the name.**\n    Based on the tetracyclic sparteine core, the presence of a lactam at the C-2 position, and the specific stereochemistry, the compound is identified as **Lupanine**. Lupanine is a major alkaloid found in lupin seeds.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
