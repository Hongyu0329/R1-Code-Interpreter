    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Crystal Structure:** The question asks about a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. An FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction:** The viewing direction is [110]. This means we are looking along the vector that connects the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a, a, 0), where 'a' is the lattice parameter. This vector lies along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. When we view a 3D structure along a certain direction, we are essentially creating a 2D projection of the atom positions onto a plane that is perpendicular to that viewing direction. The plane perpendicular to the [110] direction is the (110) plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Expected Projection Pattern:** We need to figure out what the 2D pattern of atoms looks like when an FCC lattice is projected onto the (110) plane.\n    *   The axes of the projection plane can be chosen along the crystal's [001] direction (the vertical axis of the cube) and the [-110] direction (the other face diagonal on the bottom face, perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction).\n    *   The unit cell of this projected 2D lattice will be a rectangle. The side lengths of this rectangle correspond to the periodic repeat distances along the [001] and [-110] directions, which are `a` and `a*âˆš2`, respectively.\n    *   Now, let's consider the positions of the atoms within this projected rectangular cell.\n        *   The corner atoms of the FCC lattice will project onto the corners of the rectangle. For example, atoms at (0,0,0) and (0,0,a) will define one vertical edge of the rectangle.\n        *   Face-centered atoms must also be considered. For example, the atom at the center of the top face (a/2, a/2, a) and the atom at the center of the bottom face (a/2, a/2, 0) lie directly on the [110] line of sight passing through the center of the projected rectangle's vertical axis. However, they are at different depths. More importantly, atoms like those at the centers of the side faces (e.g., at (a/2, 0, a/2) and (0, a/2, a/2)) will be projected to positions *inside* the rectangle.\n    *   A detailed mathematical projection of all the atoms in the FCC unit cell reveals that the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This means there are atoms at the four corners of the rectangle and one atom exactly in the center of the rectangle. This fundamental shape then repeats to tile the entire plane.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Images:** Now we examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. The images are 3D perspective views, where the X-Y plane of the plot represents the projection plane.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular pattern. We can identify rectangles formed by atoms at the corners, but there are no atoms in the centers of these rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along [110] or a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along [100]. It is not the FCC [110] pattern.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The arrangement of atoms does not form a clear rectangular grid. The pattern has a somewhat hexagonal appearance, which is typical of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the space diagonal of the cube). It does not match the centered rectangle pattern.\n\n    *   **Image C:** The pattern is complex and not immediately obvious. While one might try to construct a centered rectangle, the atom positions do not form a regular, repeating pattern of this type as clearly as in other images.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly and repeatedly shows a **centered rectangle** pattern. We can easily identify unit cells with atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and another atom situated in the middle. For example, consider the atoms at approximate (x,y) coordinates (0.5, 6.5), (5.5, 6.5), (0.5, 12.5), and (5.5, 12.5). These form a rectangle. There is an atom located at the center of this rectangle, at approximately (3, 9.5). This matches the expected projection pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a centered rectangular pattern. Image D is the only one that clearly exhibits this specific arrangement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
