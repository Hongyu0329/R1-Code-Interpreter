[{"img_alt": "Structure of Product A, which is a complex polycyclic molecule. A pyrrolizidine ring system is formed from the cycloaddition. This core structure has a methyl ester group and a double bond on one of the rings. The bridgehead nitrogen of this pyrrolizidine system is attached to a 5-acetyl-1-pyrroline ring.", "img_url": "https://i.imgur.com/vHq9PUn.png"}, {"img_alt": "Structure of Product B, which is a fused aromatic heterocyclic system. It consists of a pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core fused with a pyrrole ring at the nitrogen atom. One of the nitrogens in the pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core is shown as an N-oxide. A methyl ester group is attached to the pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core.", "img_url": "https://i.imgur.com/e2oO7C3.png"}, {"img_alt": "Structure of Product C.
