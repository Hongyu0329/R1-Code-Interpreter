    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:** The sheet music is for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs). The time signature is 4/4 (common time). The initial key signature is C major / A minor (no sharps or flats), but the presence of numerous accidentals (flats and sharps) throughout the piece suggests that this is just a convention and the actual key is different or the piece is highly chromatic. The tempo is marked at quarter note = 80.\n\n2.  **Harmonic and Melodic Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano) in the key of C minor. The left hand plays a C minor triad (C-Eb-G). The right hand plays a somber melody: C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-G-F. This opening has a distinct Russian feel to it.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden, dramatic shift. The dynamic changes to *f* (forte), and the texture becomes a torrent of fast sixteenth notes. Both hands play thick chords and broken octaves in parallel motion, creating a very powerful and virtuosic sound. This kind of writing is characteristic of the late Romantic period.\n    *   **Measure 4 onwards:** The music continues with relentless sixteenth-note motion. The harmony is complex and chromatic. For instance, in measure 4, we see a C# minor triad in the left hand and a pattern based on a G# diminished 7th chord in the right hand. This dense, chordal, and technically demanding writing is a strong stylistic indicator.\n    *   **Overall Style:** The combination of a melancholic melody, sudden explosive sections, thick chordal textures, extensive use of the keyboard's range, and extreme technical demands points strongly towards the work of a Russian composer from the late Romantic or early 20th century, with Sergei Rachmaninoff being the most likely candidate.\n\n3.  **Composer and Piece Identification:**\n    *   The stylistic elements are hallmarks of Rachmaninoff's piano compositions. Let's consider his famous works. The piece has the character of an *étude* (a study) due to its focus on a specific technical challenge (in this case, fast, heavy chords and endurance).\n    *   Comparing this excerpt to Rachmaninoff's works, it perfectly matches the beginning of his **Étude-Tableau Op. 39, No. 1 in C minor**.\n    *   The quiet, bell-like opening followed by the furious *Allegro agitato* section is the defining feature of this particular étude. The specific notes, chords, and rhythmic patterns in the provided sheet music correspond exactly to the original score.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Signature vs. Actual Key:** Don't be misled by the lack of sharps or flats in the initial key signature. The piece is clearly in C minor, established by the chords and accidentals from the very first measure. Writing in C minor with a \"blank\" key signature was a common practice for some composers, including Rachmaninoff.\n*   **Tempo:** While the sheet says quarter note = 80, the original score is marked *Allegro agitato* (fast and agitated), which would typically be faster. This tempo might be a suggestion for practice or a particular editor's interpretation. The core identity of the piece lies in its notes and structure, not just the tempo marking.\n*   **Thematic Contrast:** The most significant clue is the extreme contrast between the quiet, somber two-bar introduction and the loud, agitated main theme that begins in measure 3. This is a very memorable and identifiable moment in the piano repertoire.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of its key, melodic and harmonic structure, texture, and overall dramatic and virtuosic style, the musical piece is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<Étude-Tableau Op. 39, No. 1 by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
