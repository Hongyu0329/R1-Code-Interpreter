    "Step-by-step analysis of the seal characters:\n\n1.  **Seal Type and Reading Order:** This is a Chinese seal (印章, yìnzhāng). The characters are carved in an ancient script, specifically Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū). For a four-character seal arranged in a 2x2 grid, the standard reading order is from top to bottom, and from right to left. So, we will read the characters in this sequence:\n    1.  Top-right character\n    2.  Bottom-right character\n    3.  Top-left character\n    4.  Bottom-left character\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in reading order):**\n\n    *   **Character 1 (Top-right):** This character is the seal script form of **長 (cháng)**. It depicts a person with long hair. In simplified Chinese, this is written as **长**.\n\n    *   **Character 2 (Bottom-right):** This character is the seal script form of **樂 (lè)**. The script graphically represents a musical instrument (like a zither) on a wooden stand. In simplified Chinese, this is written as **乐**.\n\n    *   **Character 3 (Top-left):** This character is the seal script form of **無 (wú)**. It originally depicted a person dancing with sleeves. In simplified Chinese, this is written as **无**.\n\n    *   **Character 4 (Bottom-left):** This character is the seal script form of **憂 (yōu)**. It's a complex character showing a head (top part) and a heart (bottom part), representing a person bent over with worry. In simplified Chinese, this is written as **忧**.\n\n3.  **Combining the Characters and Meaning:**\n    *   Reading the characters in order gives us the phrase: **長樂無憂 (cháng lè wú yōu)**.\n    *   Converting this to simplified Chinese, we get: **长乐无忧**.\n    *   This is a common and auspicious Chinese idiom that means \"eternal happiness and no worries\" or \"long-lasting joy without any sorrow.\"\n\nCareful Points:\n*   **Reading Direction:** It is crucial to follow the traditional right-to-left, top-to-bottom reading order. Reading in any other direction (e.g., left-to-right) would result in a different, likely nonsensical, phrase.\n*   **Script Style:** The characters are in Seal Script, an ancient style. One must be familiar with its forms to correctly identify the modern equivalents.\n*   **Traditional to Simplified Conversion:** The question specifically asks for the content in *simplified Chinese*. Therefore, each traditional character identified from the seal script must be converted to its modern simplified form (e.g., 長 to 长, 樂 to 乐, etc.).\n*   **Mirror Image:** Seals are carved in reverse so that the impression is correct. We are analyzing the seal face itself, but the characters are still identifiable.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the step-by-step analysis is that the four characters are 长乐无忧.\n\n<<<长乐无忧>>>"
