    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four given iridium complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Shorter lifetime correlates with lower chemical stability under operational conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n    *   The central metal ion (Ir(III)), the counter-ion (PF6-), and the neutral bidentate N^N ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) are the same for all four complexes.\n    *   The difference lies in the two cyclometalating C^N ligands, which are variations of 2-phenylpyridine.\n        *   **Complex 1:** Has two 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy) ligands.\n        *   **Complex 2:** Has one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy) ligand.\n        *   **Complex 3:** Has two 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (Fppy) ligands.\n        *   **Complex 4:** Has one 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (Fppy) ligand and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy) ligand.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability (Lifetime):** The operational stability of these iridium complexes is heavily influenced by the strength of the Ir-C bond and the complex's resistance to oxidation.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Attaching fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand has two major stabilizing effects:\n        a.  **Strengthening the Ir-C bond:** The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of fluorine makes the cyclometalated carbon atom more electrophilic, leading to a stronger and more stable Ir-C sigma bond. This makes the ligand less likely to dissociate.\n        b.  **Increasing Oxidation Potential:** The electron-withdrawing groups lower the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which has significant metal d-orbital and C^N ligand character. A lower HOMO energy means the complex is harder to oxidize, which is a common degradation pathway.\n    *   **Comparing Ligands:** The stabilizing effect increases with the number of fluorine substituents. Therefore, the stability imparted by the ligands follows the order:\n        2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dFppy) > 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (Fppy) > 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n\n4.  **Rank the Complexes by Stability:** We can now rank the four complexes based on the stability of their C^N ligands. The overall stability of the complex will be limited by its weakest component and also influenced by its overall electronic properties.\n    *   **Complex 1 ([Ir(dFppy)2...]):** Contains two of the most stabilizing dFppy ligands. It has the strongest Ir-C bonds and the lowest HOMO energy. This complex is expected to be the **most stable** and have the **longest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 2 ([Ir(ppy)(dFppy)...]):** Contains one unsubstituted ppy ligand. The ppy ligand forms the weakest Ir-C bond and is electron-donating compared to its fluorinated analogues, leading to a high-energy HOMO. This makes Complex 2 the **least stable** and gives it the **shortest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 3 ([Ir(Fppy)2...]):** Contains two monofluorinated Fppy ligands. These provide moderate stabilization. Its stability is expected to be lower than Complex 1 but higher than Complex 2.\n    *   **Complex 4 ([Ir(Fppy)(dFppy)...]):** Contains one Fppy and one dFppy ligand. To compare it with Complex 3, we consider the overall electronic effect. Replacing one Fppy ligand in Complex 3 with a more electron-withdrawing dFppy ligand (to get Complex 4) will further lower the HOMO energy of the complex, making it more resistant to oxidation. Thus, Complex 4 is expected to be more stable than Complex 3.\n\n5.  **Final Stability and Lifetime Ranking:** Based on the analysis above, the expected order of stability is:\n    **Stability:** Complex 1 > Complex 4 > Complex 3 > Complex 2\n    This translates to the following order for lifetimes:\n    **Lifetime:** Lifetime(1) > Lifetime(4) > Lifetime(3) > Lifetime(2)\n\n6.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". According to our ranking, the two complexes with the shortest lifetimes are **Complex 2** and **Complex 3**.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:** The pair [2, 3] corresponds to option H.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that the core structure is similar across all four complexes, and the key difference is the fluorination pattern on the phenylpyridine ligands.\n*   Understand the fundamental principle that fluorination enhances the stability of Ir(III) phosphorescent emitters.\n*   More fluorine atoms lead to greater stability. Thus, the ligand stability is dFppy > Fppy > ppy.\n*   A complex's stability is often determined by its weakest link (the least stable ligand).\n*   The overall electronic environment of the complex also matters. A more electron-poor metal center (due to more electron-withdrawing ligands) is generally more stable against oxidation.\n*   Use these principles to establish a relative ranking of the four complexes.\n*   Interpret the term \"shorter lifetimes\" as referring to the least stable complexes in the set. Based on the derived ranking, Complexes 2 and 3 are the least stable.\n\n<<<H>>>"
