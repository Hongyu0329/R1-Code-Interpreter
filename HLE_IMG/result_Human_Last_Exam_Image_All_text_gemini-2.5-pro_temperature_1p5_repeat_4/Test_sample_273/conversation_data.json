    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chiral Centers:**\n    A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule in the picture has three such centers. We will analyze them from left to right as they appear in the drawing. Let's label them C_L (Left), C_M (Middle), and C_R (Right).\n\n2.  **Establish IUPAC Naming and Numbering (for rigorous analysis):**\n    To assign priorities correctly, we must identify the groups attached to each chiral center. The best way is to determine the IUPAC name.\n    *   **Principal Functional Group:** According to IUPAC rules, an alcohol (-OH) group has higher priority than an amine (-NH2) group. Therefore, the molecule is named as an alcohol.\n    *   **Longest Carbon Chain:** The longest continuous carbon chain that contains the carbon atom bearing the -OH group must be found. Tracing the possible paths reveals the longest chain has 6 carbons. This chain starts from the methyl group on the far left, includes the carbon with the -OH, the carbon with the ethyl group, and then continues through the ethyl group itself.\n        *   Chain: CH3(left)-CH(OH)-CH(substituent)-CH2-CH2-CH3. This is not correct.\n        *   Let's re-trace: The longest chain containing C(OH) is the one starting from the methyl of the ethyl group, going through C_M and C_L to the methyl at the far left. Chain: CH3(from ethyl)-CH2(from ethyl)-CH(C_M)-CH(C_L)-CH3(far left). This is a 5-carbon chain (pentane).\n        *   There's another 6-carbon chain: from the terminal methyl of the ethyl group, through the central carbons, to the C of the aminomethyl group. Let's try naming that one. Me(Et)-CH2(Et)-C(M)-C(R)-CH2(amino)-N... This is not a hexane amine.\n    *   Let's assume the most plausible structure that fits the drawing: a linear chain represented by the zig-zag. The structure is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**. Although alcohol has higher priority for naming, let's determine the configurations which are independent of the name. If we use the correct alcohol name, the numbering would be different, but the final R/S assignment for each specific carbon atom will be the same. Let's stick with the amine numbering as it follows the chain from right-to-left, which can be less confusing.\n    *   Numbering (as a pentan-1-amine, right to left):\n        *   C1: -CH2NH2\n        *   C2: The rightmost chiral center (C_R).\n        *   C3: The middle chiral center (C_M).\n        *   C4: The leftmost chiral center (C_L).\n        *   C5: The terminal methyl group on the left.\n    *   The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n3.  **Determine the Absolute Configuration of each Chiral Center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:**\n\n    **A. Leftmost Chiral Center (C_L, which is C4 in our amine numbering)**\n    *   **Attached Groups:** -OH, -H, -CH3 (C5), and the rest of the chain (-C3).\n    *   **Assign Priorities:**\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  -C3 (The C is attached to other carbons)\n        3.  -CH3 (The C is attached only to hydrogens)\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n    *   **Orientation and Determination:** The -OH group (priority 1) is shown on a dashed bond (pointing away). Therefore, the implied -H (priority 4) is on a wedged bond (pointing towards the viewer). Since the lowest priority group points towards us, we determine the direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from 1 (-OH, back) -> 2 (-C3, right) -> 3 (-CH3, left) is **clockwise (R)**.\n    *   Reversing the result gives **S**.\n    *   So, the configuration of C_L (C4) is **S**.\n\n    **B. Middle Chiral Center (C_M, which is C3)**\n    *   **Attached Groups:** -H, Ethyl (-CH2CH3), Left part (-C4...), and Right part (-C2...).\n    *   **Assign Priorities:** We compare the groups attached to C3.\n        1.  -C4 group: The C is attached to an Oxygen.\n        2.  -C2 group: The C is attached to a C(methyl), C(from C1), and H. C1 is attached to a Nitrogen. So this branch is higher than ethyl.\n        3.  Ethyl group: The C is attached to another C and H's.\n        4.  -H.\n        The priority order is: -C4 > -C2 > -Ethyl > -H.\n    *   **Orientation and Determination:** The Ethyl group (priority 3) is shown on a wedged bond. This implies the -H group (priority 4) is on a dashed bond (pointing away). Since the lowest priority group points away, we can read the result directly.\n    *   The path from 1 (-C4, left) -> 2 (-C2, right) -> 3 (Ethyl, front) is **clockwise (R)**.\n    *   So, the configuration of C_M (C3) is **R**.\n\n    **C. Rightmost Chiral Center (C_R, which is C2)**\n    *   **Attached Groups:** -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2 (part of C1), and the rest of the chain (-C3...).\n    *   **Assign Priorities:**\n        1.  -CH2NH2: The C is attached to a Nitrogen (Z=7).\n        2.  -C3...: The C is attached to other carbons (Z=6).\n        3.  -CH3: The C is attached to hydrogens (Z=1).\n        4.  -H.\n    *   **Orientation and Determination:** The -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) is on a wedge, and the -CH3 group (priority 3) is on a dash. This means the C-H bond (priority 4) and the C-C3 bond (priority 2) are in the plane of the paper.\n    *   To determine the configuration, we can mentally view the molecule by looking down the C-H bond (priority 4). From this viewpoint (looking from the bottom-right towards the center), the remaining groups are arranged as follows: 1 (-CH2NH2) is to the left, 2 (-C3) is ahead/up, and 3 (-CH3) is to the right.\n    *   The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 traces a **clockwise (R)** circle.\n    *   So, the configuration of C_R (C2) is **R**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n    Combining the configurations for the chiral centers from left to right as depicted in the image (C_L, C_M, C_R), we get S, R, and R. This corresponds to the IUPAC designation of (4S, 3R, 2R).\n\nThe absolute configuration is (4S, 3R, 2R).\n\n<<< (4S, 3R, 2R) >>>"
