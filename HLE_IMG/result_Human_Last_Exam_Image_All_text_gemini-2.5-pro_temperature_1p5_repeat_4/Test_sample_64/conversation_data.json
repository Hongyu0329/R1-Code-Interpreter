    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted:\n\n1.  **Observe the subject:** The image displays three panels (L, M, N) showing a microscopic view of a filamentous organism. This structure consists of elongated cells arranged end-to-end, separated by cross-walls (septa). This morphology is typical of certain types of algae or fungi.\n\n2.  **Analyze the changes across the panels:** The three panels appear to show a progression of a single process over time.\n    *   **Panel L:** This panel shows a relatively normal-looking filament. The cells are cylindrical and appear turgid (filled with water, pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall). An arrowhead points to a septum between two cells.\n    *   **Panel M:** In this panel, a noticeable change has occurred at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. A distinct bulge has formed where the cell content (the protoplast) seems to be pulling away from the rigid cell wall. The cell itself looks slightly less turgid than in panel L.\n    *   **Panel N:** The change is even more dramatic here. The bulge at the septum is much larger. The lower portion of the cell above the bulge appears to have lost significant volume, and the protoplast has visibly shrunk. The filament is now bent at this point of constriction and bulging.\n\n3.  **Interpret the observed changes:** The key event is the shrinkage of the protoplast (the living part of the cell, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and vacuole, all enclosed by the plasma membrane) and its detachment from the cell wall.\n    *   This process occurs when a plant, algal, or fungal cell is placed in a hypertonic solution. A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration (and therefore lower water potential) than the cell's cytoplasm.\n    *   Due to osmosis, water moves from an area of higher water potential (inside the cell) to an area of lower water potential (outside the cell).\n    *   As the cell loses water, its volume decreases. The flexible plasma membrane pulls away from the rigid cell wall, which largely maintains its shape.\n\n4.  **Identify the process:** The scientific term for the process of a walled cell's protoplast shrinking and pulling away from the cell wall due to water loss in a hypertonic solution is **plasmolysis**. The images clearly illustrate different stages of plasmolysis. The bulging at the septum represents a specific pattern of protoplast retraction, likely occurring at a point of weaker adhesion between the plasma membrane and the cell wall or at a natural point of cleavage during the process.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the visual evidence of the protoplast shrinking and detaching from the cell wall due to water loss, the process depicted is plasmolysis.\n\n<<<plasmolysis>>>"
