    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. In an RC circuit, the cutoff frequency is determined by the pole of the circuit's transfer function. For the low-pass filter formed by the capacitor $C$ and the equivalent resistance it sees, the cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$ at node $a_0$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to:\n*   Remove the capacitor $C$.\n*   Set all independent sources to zero. The input `IN` is a voltage source, so we ground the input terminal `g_0`.\n*   Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n\nLooking at the circuit diagram, the resistance seen from node $a_0$ is the resistor $r$ between $a_0$ and $d_1$ in series with the equivalent resistance of the rest of the network as seen from node $d_1$.\nLet's call the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($g_0$, which we label $c_0$) as $R_{d_1}$.\nSo, $R_{th} = r + R_{d_1}$.\n\nOur main task is to calculate $R_{d_1}$, the resistance of the infinite ladder between nodes $d_1$ and $c_0$.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder with Difference Equations**\nWe can model the infinite ladder using Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at each node $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$. Let $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at these nodes.\nFor any node $c_n$ ($n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{dn}}{r} = 0$\n$3V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1} - V_{c,n+1} - V_{dn} = 0$  (1)\n\nFor any node $d_n$ ($n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{cn}}{r} = 0$\n$3V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1} - V_{d,n+1} - V_{cn} = 0$  (2)\n\nTo solve this system, we introduce sum and difference variables: $S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$ and $D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$.\nAdding (1) and (2): $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$.\nSubtracting (2) from (1): $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$.\n\nThe general solutions for these recurrence relations are:\nFor $S_n$: The characteristic equation is $k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0 \\implies (k-1)^2 = 0$, so $S_n = A + Bn$.\nFor $D_n$: The characteristic equation is $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, with roots $k = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor an infinite passive ladder, the voltages must remain bounded as $n \\to \\infty$. This requires $B=0$ and that we choose the root $|k|<1$, which is $k_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\nSo, for $n \\ge 1$, the solutions are:\n$S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn} = A$\n$D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn} = C \\cdot (2 - \\sqrt{3})^n = C k_1^n$\n\nFrom these, we find the individual node voltages:\n$V_{cn} = \\frac{1}{2}(A + C k_1^n)$\n$V_{dn} = \\frac{1}{2}(A - C k_1^n)$\n\n**4. Applying Boundary Conditions to find $R_{d_1}$**\nTo find $R_{d_1}$, we imagine injecting a current $I_{in}$ into node $d_1$ and grounding node $c_0$. Then $R_{d_1} = V_{d_1} / I_{in}$. The boundary conditions are:\n1.  Node $c_0$ is grounded: $V_{c0} = 0$.\n2.  KCL at node $c_1$: $\\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{d1}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{c1} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$.\n3.  KCL at node $d_1$: The current that would come from $d_0$, $(V_{d1}-V_{d0})/r$, is replaced by our injected current, $-I_{in}$. So, $-I_{in} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} = 0 \\implies I_{in}r = 2V_{d1} - V_{d2} - V_{c1}$.\n\nSubstitute the general solutions for $V_n$ into the boundary condition at $c_1$:\n$3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(A + Ck_1) - \\frac{1}{2}(A + Ck_1^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck_1) = 0$\n$A + C(4k_1 - k_1^2) = 0$\nSince $k_1$ is a root of $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, we have $4k_1 - k_1^2 = 1$.\nSo, $A + C = 0 \\implies A = -C$.\n\nNow, use this relation and the KCL at $d_1$:\n$I_{in}r = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck_1) - \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck_1^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(A + Ck_1)$\n$I_{in}r = \\frac{1}{2} [ 2(A - Ck_1) - (A - Ck_1^2) - (A + Ck_1) ] = \\frac{C}{2}(k_1^2 - 3k_1)$\nUsing $k_1^2 = 4k_1 - 1$, this simplifies to $I_{in}r = \\frac{C}{2}(k_1 - 1)$. So, $I_{in} = \\frac{C(k_1-1)}{2r}$.\n\nNext, find $V_{d_1}$:\n$V_{d_1} = \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-C - Ck_1) = -\\frac{C}{2}(1+k_1)$.\n\nFinally, calculate $R_{d_1}$:\n$R_{d_1} = \\frac{V_{d_1}}{I_{in}} = \\frac{-\\frac{C}{2}(1+k_1)}{\\frac{C(k_1-1)}{2r}} = -r \\frac{1+k_1}{k_1-1} = r \\frac{1+k_1}{1-k_1}$.\n\nSubstitute $k_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{d_1} = r \\frac{1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = r \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we have the resistance $R_{d_1}$. We can find the total Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d_1} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$.\n\nIf the frequency in Hertz ($f_c$) is desired, it is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$.\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of r and C. Usually, this refers to the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\nFinal Answer: The cutoff frequency (angular frequency) at node $a_0$ is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
