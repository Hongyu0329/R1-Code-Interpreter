    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant**\nThe first step is to identify the plant shown in the image. The most striking characteristic of this plant is its leaves.\n*   **Leaf Appearance:** The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have an elliptical or lanceolate shape.\n*   **Venation:** The most distinctive feature is the prominent, intricate network of veins (reticulate venation) that is a much lighter color (creamy white to pale green) than the rest of the leaf blade. This creates a beautiful net-like pattern.\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged in whorls at the ends of the branches.\nThese features are characteristic of a specific variety of Pittosporum, namely *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* var. *reticulatum*. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Plant's Native Range and Endemism**\nThe question asks for the specific island to which this plant was endemic. An endemic species is one that is native to and found only within a defined geographic area.\n*   **Research:** We need to look up the native distribution of *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* var. *reticulatum*.\n*   **Distribution of the Species:** The parent species, *Pittosporum daphniphylloides*, is found in mainland China and Taiwan.\n*   **Distribution of the Variety:** However, the specific variety, *reticulatum* (noted for its distinct net-veins), is documented in botanical records (such as the Flora of Taiwan) as being endemic to the island of Taiwan. The botanist Bunz≈ç Hayata, who did extensive work on the flora of Taiwan, first described this form from the island.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Answer**\nBased on the identification and geographical research, the plant *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* var. *reticulatum* is endemic to a single island.\n*   **Plant:** *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* var. *reticulatum*\n*   **Endemic Location:** The island of Taiwan.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to identify the plant correctly, focusing on the unique reticulate venation which is the key feature.\n*   One must distinguish between the broader native range of the parent species (*Pittosporum daphniphylloides*) and the more restricted endemic range of the specific variety shown (*reticulatum*).\n*   The term \"endemic\" is crucial; it means the plant's natural origin is exclusively from that one location, even if it's now cultivated elsewhere.\n\nFinal answer based on the analysis is the name of the island.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
