    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Transcribe the Poem's Text**\nFirst, we need to read the words that constitute the poem. Following a natural reading order suggested by the placement of the word fragments, we get the following phrase:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the Syllables**\nNext, we determine the total number of syllables in this phrase.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on Syllable Count**\nNow, let's compare our syllable count to the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. free verse**: Has no regular meter or syllable count. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: Consists of 10 syllables per line. Our phrase has 11. While an 11-syllable line can sometimes be iambic pentameter with a \"feminine ending,\" this is a specific case. 10 is the standard.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: A line with 12 syllables. Our phrase has 11, so this is not a match.\n*   **D. sapphic**: The primary line in a Sapphic stanza, the \"hendecasyllable,\" has exactly **11 syllables**. This is a perfect match for our syllable count.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: A line with three iambic feet, typically 6 syllables. This is not a match.\n*   **F. american sentence**: A form with exactly 17 syllables. This is not a match.\n\nBased on the syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most likely answer.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Metrical Stress Pattern (Scansion)**\nTo confirm, we need to check if the stress pattern of the phrase matches the required pattern for a Sapphic line. A Sapphic hendecasyllable line follows a specific rhythm:\nTrochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee (or Trochee)\n(Stressed-Unstressed | Stressed-Unstressed | Stressed-Unstressed-Unstressed | Stressed-Unstressed | Stressed-Stressed)\nUsing `/` for a stressed syllable and `x` for an unstressed syllable, the pattern is:\n`/ x | / x | / x x | / x | / /`\n\nLet's apply this pattern to our phrase, considering the natural pronunciation:\n**\"rules and | lines, an | in-tri-cate | spi-der's | web work\"**\n\n*   **rules and**: `/ x` (Stressed-Unstressed) -> This is a trochee. **Match.**\n*   **lines, an**: `/ x` (Stressed-Unstressed) -> This is a trochee. **Match.**\n*   **in-tri-cate**: `/ x x` (Stressed-Unstressed-Unstressed) -> This is a dactyl. **Match.**\n*   **spi-der's**: `/ x` (Stressed-Unstressed) -> This is a trochee. **Match.**\n*   **web work**: `/ /` (Stressed-Stressed) -> This is a spondee, a common variation for the final foot. **Match.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe phrase extracted from the erasure poem has 11 syllables and its stress pattern perfectly aligns with the metrical structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. Therefore, the words in the poem follow a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
