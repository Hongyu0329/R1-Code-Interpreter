The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long and distinctly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or bend to one side.
