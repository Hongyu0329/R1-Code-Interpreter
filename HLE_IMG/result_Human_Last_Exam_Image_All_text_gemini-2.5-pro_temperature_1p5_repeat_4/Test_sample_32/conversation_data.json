    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Identify the Key Structures**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily observable (\"at a glance\") difference in the **sporophyte** of two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The moss sporophyte is the spore-producing generation and typically consists of three main parts:\n*   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte (the leafy part).\n*   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule.\n*   **Capsule (or sporangium):** The structure that contains and releases the spores. The image provided shows mature, empty capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sporophyte Characteristics of *Grimmia montana***\n*   Based on botanical knowledge, *Grimmia montana* has a sporophyte with a **very short, straight seta**.\n*   Because the seta is so short, the capsule is described as **immersed** or **emergent**, meaning it sits nestled among the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem) and does not protrude much, if at all.\n*   The capsule is held **erect** and is symmetrical.\n*   The image provided, showing cup-like capsules sitting low within the leafy mat with no visible stalk, is very characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sporophyte Characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   The species name *curviseta* is a direct clue. *Curvi-* means \"curved,\" and *-seta* refers to the stalk.\n*   Therefore, the defining feature of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its **distinctly curved or bent seta**. The seta is often described as arcuate or cygneous (swan-necked).\n*   This curved seta causes the capsule to be **cernuous** (nodding) or bent to one side, rather than being held erect.\n*   The seta in *G. curviseta* is also typically longer than in *G. montana*, making the capsule **exserted** (protruding well beyond the leaves), which makes the curvature even more apparent.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two Species and Identify the Main Difference**\n*   **Position and Orientation:** In *Grimmia montana*, the capsule is immersed and erect due to a short, straight seta. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the capsule is exserted and curved or nodding due to a longer, distinctly curved seta.\n*   **Seta:** This is the root cause of the difference. *G. montana* has a short, straight seta. *G. curviseta* has a longer, curved seta.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most significant difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta**. The seta of *Grimmia montana* is short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves, while the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is longer and characteristically curved, causing its capsule to be exserted and bent to one side.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long and distinctly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or bend to one side."
