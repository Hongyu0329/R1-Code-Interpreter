The final compound C is a neutral molecule derived from a triarylmethane core. It possesses a quinone methide structure. The central carbon atom is bonded to three distinct ring systems: 
1) a 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl ring, 
2) a 4-amino-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl ring, and 
3) a 2,6-dihydroxy-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene ring, which is attached to the central carbon via a double bond.
The chemical structure can be represented as (4-H₂N-2,6-(HO)₂C₆H₂) - C(2,4,6-(HO)₃C₆H₂) = C₆H₂(2,6-(HO)₂) = O.
