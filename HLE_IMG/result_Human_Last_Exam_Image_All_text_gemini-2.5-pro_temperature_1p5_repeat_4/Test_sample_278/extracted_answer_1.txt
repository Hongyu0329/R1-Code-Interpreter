The image shows a fungus, likely a species of *Candida*, visualized with a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The morphology is dimorphic, exhibiting both oval, budding yeast cells and filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae (chains of elongated, non-detaching yeast cells with constrictions at the septations).
