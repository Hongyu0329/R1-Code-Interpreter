    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm:**\n    The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`.\n    - `a`: The array to be sorted.\n    - `n`: The number of elements from the beginning of the array to consider for sorting.\n\n    The logic inside the function for `n > 1` is as follows:\n    - **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** A recursive call is made to sort the first `n - 1` elements of the array.\n    - **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`:** The last element of the current sub-problem (`a[n-1]`) is compared with the second to last element (`a[n-2]`).\n    - **`swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`:** If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped.\n    - **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** Another recursive call is made to sort the first `n - 1` elements again.\n\n    The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing and returns.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    To analyze the time complexity, we need to express the running time `T(n)` for an input of size `n` as a function of the running time for smaller inputs.\n\n    - The `if n > 1:` check is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    - The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    - The comparison and potential swap (`if a[n-1] < a[n-2]: swap(...)`) takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    - The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n\n    Combining these costs, the recurrence relation for `T(n)` is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`, which we can represent as a constant `d`.\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` using the expansion method:\n    - `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    - Substitute `T(n - 1) = 2 * T(n - 2) + c`:\n      `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    - Substitute `T(n - 2) = 2 * T(n - 3) + c`:\n      `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n\n    We can see a pattern emerging. After `k` steps of expansion:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum in the parentheses is a geometric series `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i = (2^k - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^k - 1`.\n    So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting this into our formula:\n    `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * d + c * 2^{n-1} - c`\n    `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^{n-1} - c`\n\n4.  **Determine the Asymptotic Complexity (Big-O):**\n    The running time `T(n)` is dominated by the `2^{n-1}` term. In Big-O notation, we ignore constant factors (`d+c`) and lower-order terms (`-c`).\n    `T(n) = O(2^{n-1})`\n    Since `2^{n-1} = (1/2) * 2^n`, and we ignore constant multipliers, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Worst Case:** The analysis above is for the worst case. However, in this specific algorithm, the two recursive calls `sort(a, n - 1)` are *always* made, regardless of the input data or the outcome of the `if` condition. Therefore, the best-case, average-case, and worst-case time complexities are all `O(2^n)`.\n*   **Termination:** The recursive calls are on a smaller problem size (`n-1`). Since `n` decreases by 1 at each level of recursion, it will eventually reach the base case (`n <= 1`), guaranteeing that the algorithm terminates. Option F is incorrect.\n*   **Comparison to other algorithms:** This recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` is classic and is also found in problems like the Tower of Hanoi, which famously has an exponential `O(2^n)` complexity. It differs significantly from efficient sorting algorithms like Mergesort (`T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + O(n)` -> `O(n log n)`) or simple ones like Insertion Sort (`T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)` -> `O(n^2)`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe time complexity is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
