    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Medallion**\nThe image provided is a black and white photograph of a metal medallion. It is circular with a tab at the top for suspension or attachment. The medallion features two figures in high relief, shown as busts in profile, facing each other.\n\n**Step 2: Iconographic Analysis of the Figures**\n*   **Figure on the left:** This is a male figure. The most distinct feature is the prominent, curled ram's horn around his ear. This is a classic iconographic attribute of the syncretic deity Zeus-Ammon. This deity combines the Greek king of the gods, Zeus, with the Egyptian ram-headed god, Amun. This cult became particularly popular in the Hellenistic world after Alexander the Great was proclaimed the son of Ammon-Zeus at the Siwa Oasis oracle.\n*   **Figure on the right:** This is a female figure. She has an elaborate hairstyle and wears drapery. Given that she is paired with Zeus-Ammon, she is most likely identified as his consort, the goddess Hera.\n\n**Step 3: Stylistic Analysis**\nThe artistic style is characteristic of Hellenistic art (c. 323 B.C. - 31 B.C.). Key features supporting this are:\n*   **Naturalism and Idealism:** The faces are rendered with a high degree of naturalism but are also idealized, which is typical for depictions of deities from this period.\n*   **High Relief:** The figures are deeply sculpted, creating strong shadows and a sense of three-dimensionality.\n*   **Detailed Craftsmanship:** The intricate work on the hair and the subtle modeling of the facial features indicate a high level of skill, typical of luxury items from major Hellenistic artistic centers.\n\n**Step 4: Identification and Contextualization**\nA search for \"medallion Zeus-Ammon Hera\" reveals that this specific object is well-known. It is often referred to as the **Tarentum Medallion** because it was discovered in a tomb near Taranto (ancient Greek *Taras*, Latin *Tarentum*), a wealthy Greek city in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy).\n\n**Step 5: Dating the Medallion**\nArchaeologists and art historians have dated the Tarentum Medallion based on its style and the archaeological context of where it was found.\n*   The Hellenistic style places it firmly after the conquests of Alexander the Great (d. 323 B.C.).\n*   The specific stylistic features are most consistent with the art of the early Hellenistic period.\n*   Scholarly consensus dates the medallion to the **early 3rd century B.C.** (approximately 300-275 B.C.). This period corresponds to the height of Tarentum's power and artistic production, just before its conquest by Rome.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the iconographic identification of the figures as Zeus-Ammon and Hera, the distinct Hellenistic artistic style, and the established scholarly consensus for this specific artifact (the Tarentum Medallion), it is ascribed to the 3rd century B.C.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
