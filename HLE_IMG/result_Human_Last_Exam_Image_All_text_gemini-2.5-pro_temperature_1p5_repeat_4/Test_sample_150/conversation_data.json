    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (an aromatic ring) and propanoyl chloride (an acyl chloride).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, leading to the generation of a propanoyl acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanoyl group (-C(=O)CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ (bromine) and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br⁺, generated from Br₂ and FeBr₃) will add to the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom substituted at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n*   **Careful Point:** The reaction \"H₂/Pd\" can have different outcomes depending on the conditions.\n    *   Mild conditions typically reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   More forcing conditions (e.g., high pressure/temperature, sometimes with acid) can fully reduce the ketone to an alkane (C=O → CH₂). This is known as hydrogenolysis of the carbonyl group.\n    *   The aryl bromide (C-Br) bond can also be reduced (hydrogenolysis), but this often requires specific conditions (e.g., presence of a base).\n*   **Analysis:** To determine the most likely product, we should consider the subsequent reaction step. If Intermediate-3 were the alcohol, the next step with NBS would likely re-oxidize it back to the ketone (Intermediate-2), which would be a redundant step in a synthesis. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the reaction is a full reduction of the ketone to an alkane, a transformation for which H₂/Pd can be used under certain conditions. We assume the aryl C-Br bond remains intact, as its reduction often requires different catalytic systems or conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: The carbonyl group of Intermediate-2 is reduced to a methylene (-CH₂-) group, resulting in a propyl chain.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide): A reagent that provides a low concentration of Br₂ for radical substitution.\n    *   (PhCO₂)₂ (Benzoyl peroxide): A radical initiator.\n    *   CCl₄: An inert solvent suitable for radical reactions.\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are classic for free-radical bromination at the most stable radical position. In an alkylbenzene, the most reactive C-H bonds are at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring). The abstraction of a hydrogen atom from this position creates a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical. This radical then reacts with bromine to yield the final product.\n*   **Product:** The hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure: (m-Br-C₆H₄)-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   **Name:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Propiophenone\n2.  **Meta-Bromination:** Propiophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n3.  **Ketone Reduction to Alkane:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one → 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n4.  **Benzylic Bromination:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene → 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\nThe final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
