    "*   **Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, J, L, K, H) can rotate freely in solution.\n2.  **Key Concept: Free Rotation:** Free rotation can occur around a single bond (like a C-C bond connecting two phenyl rings) unless there is a significant energy barrier. This barrier is usually due to steric hindrance, which is the repulsion between bulky groups that are too close to each other. In this molecule, the central iridium atom and its bulky ligands form a sterically crowded core. Phenyl rings attached close to this core will have their rotation restricted, while those attached further away will be able to rotate freely.\n3.  **Molecular Structure Interpretation:** The central atom is Iridium (Ir) in an octahedral coordination environment. It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands:\n    *   **Ligand 1 (C^N type):** Composed of phenyl ring A and pyridine ring B. This is a cyclometalated ligand where the nitrogen of pyridine (B) and a carbon atom (C6) of the phenyl ring (A) coordinate to the Iridium. The dotted line from Ir to ring A indicates this C-Ir bond.\n    *   **Ligand 2 (C^N type):** Composed of phenyl ring C and pyridine ring D. This is another cyclometalated ligand, with nitrogen from pyridine (D) and carbon C6 from phenyl ring (C) coordinating to the Iridium. The wedged bond from C6(C) to Ir clearly shows this C-Ir bond.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (N^N type):** Although not explicitly shown as connected, rings E and F are positioned to act as a bidentate ligand like 2,2'-bipyridine, coordinating through their respective nitrogen atoms. This is a standard and stable arrangement for such complexes.\n\n4.  **Analysis of each Phenyl Ring's Rotation:** We need to examine the local environment of the single bond that connects each substituent phenyl ring to the main ligand framework.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A. This position is *para* to the C1 position (where the ring is conceptually substituted) and *meta* to the coordinating C6 atom. It is on the \"outside\" of the complex, far from the central Iridium and other ligands. There is no significant steric barrier to prevent rotation around the C(A)-C(H) single bond. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C. Its situation is analogous to that of ring H. It's on the outer part of its ligand, far from the sterically congested metal center. The bond connecting J to C is a single bond with low rotational barrier. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to another phenyl ring (let's call it the G-scaffold). This G-scaffold ring is, in turn, attached to position C6 of pyridine ring D. Position C6 of pyridine is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. This is a very crowded location, meaning the G-scaffold ring itself likely cannot rotate freely. However, the question is about the rotation of ring G itself. Ring G is attached at the *para* position (C4) of the G-scaffold ring. The C-C bond connecting G to its scaffold is far removed from the congested area around the metal. Therefore, **ring G can rotate freely** around its bond to the G-scaffold ring.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** The drawing shows ring K attached to position C6 of phenyl ring A. This is the very carbon atom that is involved in bonding/interaction with the Iridium center. A substituent at this position would be in the most sterically hindered environment possible, right next to the metal and the other ligands. Its rotation would be severely restricted. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** This ring is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring C. The adjacent carbon, C6, is directly bonded to the Iridium atom. Being in an *ortho* position to the coordinating carbon places ring L extremely close to the Iridium and its other ligands. The ortho-hydrogens of ring L would clash with the adjacent ligand (E/F) during rotation. This significant steric hindrance will prevent free rotation. Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, the phenyl rings that are positioned far from the central iridium core can rotate freely. These are rings G, J, and H. The rings positioned close to the coordinating atoms (K and L) will have their rotation restricted.\n\n6.  **Matching with Answer Choices:** The set of freely rotating rings is {G, J, H}. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
