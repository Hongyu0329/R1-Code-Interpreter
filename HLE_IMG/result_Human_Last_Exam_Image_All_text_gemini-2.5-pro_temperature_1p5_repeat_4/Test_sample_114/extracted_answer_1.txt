The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the inherent asymmetry of the bicyclic münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetyl-proline. In this intermediate, the C2 position (bearing a methyl group) and the C4 position (a bridgehead carbon of the fused proline ring) are sterically and electronically non-equivalent. This asymmetry directs the incoming unsymmetrical dipolarophile (methyl propiolate) to add in a specific orientation, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial as they establish the principle that the symmetry of the intermediate is the controlling factor. The labeling experiment in Reaction 2 proves that the symmetric münchnone derived from N-acetyl-alanine has equivalent C2 and C4 positions, which explains why a lack of inherent regiocontrol exists in that system. Therefore, the contrast between the asymmetric proline-derived intermediate and the symmetric alanine-derived intermediate explains the difference in regioselectivity.
