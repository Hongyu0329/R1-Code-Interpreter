    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction:**\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, specifically Friedelan-3β-ol. Its molecular formula is C₃₀H₅₂O.\n*   **Conditions:** The reaction is treated with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 °C. These are acidic and heating conditions, which favor dehydration (elimination of water) and carbocation rearrangements.\n*   **Product:** The product has the chemical formula C₃₀H₅₀, which confirms the loss of one molecule of water (H₂O). The product has a new double bond and a rearranged carbon skeleton. The question states that this rearrangement involves a number of [1,2] shifts. This points towards a Wagner-Meerwein type backbone rearrangement, which is very common for triterpenoids under acidic conditions.\n\n**2. Propose the Reaction Mechanism:**\nThe reaction proceeds through the following key stages:\n*   **Stage A: Carbocation Formation**\n    1.  The acid (H⁺ from HCl) protonates the hydroxyl (-OH) group at carbon C-3, turning it into a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺).\n    2.  The water molecule departs, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n*   **Stage B: The Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement Cascade**\n    The initially formed secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a cascade of [1,2] shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations. This cascade propagates through the fused ring system. We will track the movements of the methyl (CH₃) groups and hydrogen (H) atoms. Let's denote the original positions for clarity.\n\n    1.  **[1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The carbocation is at C-3. An adjacent carbon, C-4, is a quaternary center with two methyl groups. One of these methyl groups shifts from C-4 to C-3. This moves the positive charge to C-4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n        *   *Result:* C-4 now has only one methyl group, and C-3 has gained a methyl group.\n\n    2.  **[1,2]-Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom on C-5 shifts to the adjacent carbocation at C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The substituent at C-4 is now a hydrogen. C-5 is now positively charged.\n\n    3.  **[1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group on C-10 shifts to the carbocation at C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The substituent at C-10 is gone (moved to C-5). **The substituent at position 2 is now a hydrogen** (which was already part of the C-10 backbone before it became a cation). More precisely, C-10 will gain a H in the next step.\n\n    4.  **[1,2]-Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom on C-9 shifts to the carbocation at C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The original hydrogen at C-9 is gone. The substituent at C-10 is now a hydrogen.\n\n    5.  **[1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group on C-8 shifts to the carbocation at C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The substituent at C-9 is now a methyl group (the one that came from C-8).\n\n    6.  **[1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group on C-14 shifts to the carbocation at C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The substituent at C-8 is now a methyl group (the one that came from C-14).\n\n    7.  **[1,2]-Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom on C-13 shifts to the carbocation at C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13 (tertiary carbocation).\n        *   *Result:* The substituent at C-14 is now a hydrogen atom (the one that came from C-13).\n\n*   **Stage C: Elimination**\n    1.  The rearrangement cascade stops, leaving a carbocation at C-13.\n    2.  A proton (H⁺) is eliminated from an adjacent carbon (e.g., C-12 or C-18) to form a stable double bond. The exact position of the double bond (which forms the specific final product isomer) does not affect the identity of the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as their fates were sealed during the rearrangement cascade.\n\n**3. Determine the Substituents at Positions 1-5:**\nBased on the tracking of groups during the rearrangement:\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** Started with two CH₃ groups. One migrated to C-3. The other CH₃ group remained. So, the substituent at position 1 is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-5. Later, an H from C-9 migrated to C-10. So, the substituent at position 2 is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-9):** Started with an H atom, which migrated to C-10. A CH₃ group from C-8 migrated to C-9. So, the substituent at position 3 is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-9. A CH₃ group from C-14 migrated to C-8. So, the substituent at position 4 is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C-8. An H from C-13 migrated to C-14. So, the substituent at position 5 is **H**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH₃\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
