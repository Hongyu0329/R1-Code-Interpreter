    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's break it down into its components to determine its molecular formula.\n*   The core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. Let's count the atoms in this core structure:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7)\n    *   Hydrogens: 5 (one each at C1, C4, C6, and two at C7)\n    *   Nitrogen: 1 (at position 2)\n    *   Oxygen: 1 (carbonyl at position 3)\n    *   Formula of the core: C6H5NO\n*   There are two substituents attached to this core:\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) at position C5. This adds 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms.\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) attached to the nitrogen (N2). A PMB group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. This adds 8 carbons (1 from CH2, 6 from the benzene ring, 1 from OCH3), 9 hydrogens (2 from CH2, 4 on the ring, 3 from OCH3), and 1 oxygen. Formula of PMB group: C8H9O.\n*   Now, we sum the atoms from all parts to get the molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n    *   Hydrogens: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n    *   Fluorines: 3\n    *   Nitrogens: 1\n    *   Oxygens: 1 (core) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n*   **Molecular formula of Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   The reaction is with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of the PMB group from nitrogen or oxygen atoms.\n*   The reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group. The PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   The net change in the molecule is the loss of the PMB group (C8H9O) and the gain of one hydrogen atom. This corresponds to a net loss of a C8H8O fragment.\n*   Calculate the formula of Intermediate 1:\n    *   Carbons: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   Hydrogens: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   Fluorines: 3\n    *   Nitrogens: 1\n    *   Oxygens: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   The reaction is with Pd/C and H2 in methanol. This is a catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   Catalytic hydrogenation reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Intermediate 1 has one C=C bond in its bicyclic ring system.\n*   The reaction adds one molecule of hydrogen (H2) across the double bond.\n*   Calculate the formula of Intermediate 2:\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n    *   Add H2: C7H(6+2)F3NO\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n*   The reaction is with 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C. These are strong acidic hydrolysis conditions.\n*   Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). Amides undergo hydrolysis in the presence of strong acid and water to yield a carboxylic acid and an amine.\n*   Since the amide is in a ring (lactam), the ring opens, and the product is a single molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions, the amino group will exist as its ammonium salt (-NH3+), but for calculating the formula of the neutral molecule, we consider it as -NH2.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The C=O group becomes -COOH (gain of an OH), and the N-H group becomes -NH2 (gain of an H).\n*   Calculate the formula of the final Product:\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n    *   Add H2O: C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1)\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product: C7H10F3NO2**\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n1.  Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n2.  Intermediate 1 (PMB deprotection): C7H6F3NO\n3.  Intermediate 2 (Hydrogenation): C7H8F3NO\n4.  Final Product (Hydrolysis): C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
