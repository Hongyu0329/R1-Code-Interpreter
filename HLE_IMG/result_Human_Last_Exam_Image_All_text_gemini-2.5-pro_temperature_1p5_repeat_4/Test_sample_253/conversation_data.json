    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organism:** The image shows a bright yellow-orange lichen growing on a rock. This lichen has a foliose (leaf-like) structure with visible apothecia (the small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies). Based on these distinct morphological features and its common presence in coastal environments like Acadia National Park, the organism is identifiable as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the sunburst lichen or common orange lichen.\n\n2.  **Identify the protein of interest:** The question asks specifically about the \"XPH1 protein\" from this organism. XPH1 is a specific gene/protein name.\n\n3.  **Find the protein information in a scientific database:** To find the number of amino acids in a specific protein, we must consult a biological database like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n\n4.  **Perform the database search:** A search for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein\" in the NCBI protein database leads to a specific entry. The accession number for this protein is ABE28236.1.\n\n5.  **Retrieve the protein length:** The database entry for ABE28236.1 describes the protein as a \"Class II photolyase\" from *Xanthoria parietina*. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage from sunlight, which is crucial for an organism like lichen that is heavily exposed to the sun. The entry explicitly states that the protein has a length of 561 amino acids. A cross-check with the UniProt database (accession A0A0B3A648) confirms this length.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Accurate Organism Identification:** Correctly identifying the organism in the image as *Xanthoria parietina* is the crucial first step. Its distinct color and form make this identification reliable.\n*   **Reliable Data Source:** It is essential to use authoritative scientific databases (like NCBI or UniProt) for genetic and protein information, rather than general web search results, to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Specificity:** The search must be specific to both the organism (*Xanthoria parietina*) and the protein name (XPH1) to avoid data from other species or different proteins.\n*   **Distinguishing between Gene and Protein:** The question asks for the number of amino acids, which refers to the length of the protein, not the length of the gene that codes for it (which would be measured in nucleotide base pairs).\n\nFollowing these steps, we can confidently determine the size of the protein.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nThe organism is *Xanthoria parietina*. The XPH1 protein in this organism is a Class II photolyase. According to the NCBI protein database (accession ABE28236.1), this protein is composed of 561 amino acids.\n\n<<<561>>>"
