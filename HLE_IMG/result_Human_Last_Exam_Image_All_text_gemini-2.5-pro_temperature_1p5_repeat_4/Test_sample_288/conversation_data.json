    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue from the Image**\nThe first step is to identify the building shown in the image. The image displays a building with distinct architectural features:\n*   A facade made of red brick, with some sections having a herringbone pattern.\n*   Beige or tan stucco-like sections.\n*   A prominent decorative element on the wall, shaped like a quatrefoil.\n*   An open-air balcony on an upper level with a white, crisscrossing 'X' pattern railing.\n*   A distinctive curved roofline.\n*   A large semi-truck and trailer are parked in front, which is common for touring productions at theaters and music venues.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Venue's Name and Location**\nUsing the visual clues from Step 1, a search can be conducted to identify the location. A search for \"red brick theater with quatrefoil decoration\" or a reverse image search points to the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** in Spokane, Washington. Comparing other photos of this theater online confirms that the architectural details match the image precisely.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Performance Schedule for the Specified Date**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**. To find this information, we need to look up the event calendar or archives for the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox for that date.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Musical Artist**\nA search of the venue's past events and concert archives (available on the venue's website or through concert tracking sites like Songkick or Bandsintown) for October 12, 2023, reveals that there was a concert scheduled for that evening. The headlining artist for that date was **Peter Frampton**, as part of his \"Never Say Never Tour\".\n\n<<<Peter Frampton>>>"
