    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = ( (Total VMT_Baseline - Total VMT_Proposed) / Total VMT_Baseline ) * 100\n\n**Careful Points & Methodology:**\n1.  **VMT Definition:** We are calculating Vehicle Miles Traveled, which focuses on the miles covered by vehicles. The occupancy of the car (e.g., `car, 1 occupant` vs. `car, with more than 2 occupants` or the `Average Carpool Occupancy` values) does not change the miles traveled by the vehicle itself. Therefore, for each distance category, we must sum the mode shares of both car types to get the total car mode share.\n2.  **Relative Calculation:** Since we don't have the absolute total number of trips, we can calculate a weighted VMT \"index\" for both scenarios. This index will be proportional to the actual VMT. The weighting factors are the \"share of total trips\" for each distance category. The calculation will be valid because the total number of trips would be a common factor that cancels out in the percentage reduction formula.\n3.  **Calculation per Distance Category:** For each distance category, the VMT contribution is calculated as:\n    (Share of Total Trips) × (Mode Share for Cars) × (Average Trip Distance)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)\n\nWe will calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category and sum them up.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = **0.2544**\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = **0.7128**\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = **0.8925**\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)\n\nWe will repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = **0.0144**\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = **0.2376**\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = **0.4305**\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT\n\nNow we use the VMT indices calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed\n    *   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100\n    *   Percentage Reduction = 0.52195 × 100 ≈ **52.2%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
