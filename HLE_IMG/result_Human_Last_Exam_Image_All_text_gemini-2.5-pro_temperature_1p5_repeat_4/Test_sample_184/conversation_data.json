    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** A substituted cyclobutene, specifically (3R,4S)-3-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclobut-1-ene (or its enantiomer). Let's analyze the stereochemistry as drawn: At carbon 4, the methyl (Me) group is pointing out (wedge), and the methoxy (OMe) group is pointing in (dash). At carbon 3, the methoxy (OMe) group is pointing out (wedge).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCO2Et), which will act as the dienophile in the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Condition:** Heat (Δ), which indicates thermal pericyclic reactions.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** The problem specifies a two-step sequence: (1) a 4π electrocyclic ring opening, followed by (2) a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 2: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n*   **Rule:** This is a 4π electron system (one π bond and the breaking σ bond) under thermal conditions. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the ring opening must be **conrotatory**. This means the two groups at the termini of the breaking σ bond (C3 and C4) rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n*   **Two Modes of Conrotation:** Since the starting material is chiral, the two modes of conrotatory opening will produce two different diastereomeric diene intermediates.\n    *   **Mode A (e.g., both clockwise rotation):**\n        *   At C4: The \"up\" Me group rotates inward. The \"down\" OMe group rotates outward.\n        *   At C3: The \"up\" OMe group rotates outward. The \"down\" H atom rotates inward.\n        *   This results in **Diene 1**, which has (1E, 3Z) geometry. In its s-cis conformation for the Diels-Alder reaction, the H from C1 and the Me from C4 are the \"inner\" groups. The OMe from C1 and the OMe from C4 are the \"outer\" groups.\n    *   **Mode B (e.g., both counter-clockwise rotation):**\n        *   At C4: The \"up\" Me group rotates outward. The \"down\" OMe group rotates inward.\n        *   At C3: The \"up\" OMe group rotates inward. The \"down\" H atom rotates outward.\n        *   This results in **Diene 2**, which has (1Z, 3E) geometry. In its s-cis conformation, the OMe from C1 and the OMe from C4 are the \"inner\" groups. The H from C1 and the Me from C4 are the \"outer\" groups.\n\n**Step 3: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n*   **Reactants:** Each diene intermediate (Diene 1 and Diene 2) reacts with ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** All the product options (A-H) show the same connectivity. The reaction forms the \"para\" adduct, where the quaternary carbon of the diene is attached to the carbon bearing the CO2Et group, and the CH(OMe) end of the diene is attached to the CH2 of the acrylate. We will proceed with this given regiochemistry.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The problem specifies an **endo** approach. This means the electron-withdrawing group (CO2Et) on the dienophile is positioned on the same face as the \"inner\" groups of the diene in the transition state.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene 1 (inner groups: H and Me):**\n    *   The \"inner\" groups (H at C1, Me at C4) and the \"endo\" substituent (CO2Et) will all end up on the same side of the newly formed cyclohexene ring (e.g., all wedged).\n    *   The \"outer\" groups (OMe at C1, OMe at C4) will be on the opposite side (e.g., all dashed).\n    *   Let's construct the product:\n        *   Quaternary center (from C4 of diene): Me is wedged, OMe is dashed.\n        *   CO2Et center: CO2Et is wedged.\n        *   OMe center (from C1 of diene): H is wedged, OMe is dashed.\n    *   This stereochemical pattern matches **product E**. In E, the Me group on the quaternary center and the CO2Et group are both wedged (cis). The OMe on the other stereocenter is dashed, which means the H on that carbon is wedged, maintaining the cis relationship with the other \"inner\" and \"endo\" groups.\n\n*   **Reaction of Diene 2 (inner groups: OMe and OMe):**\n    *   The \"inner\" groups (OMe at C1, OMe at C4) and the \"endo\" substituent (CO2Et) will all end up on the same side of the ring (e.g., all wedged).\n    *   The \"outer\" groups (H at C1, Me at C4) will be on the opposite side (e.g., all dashed).\n    *   Let's construct the product:\n        *   Quaternary center (from C4 of diene): OMe is wedged, Me is dashed.\n        *   CO2Et center: CO2Et is wedged.\n        *   OMe center (from C1 of diene): OMe is wedged.\n    *   This stereochemical pattern matches **product F**. In F, the OMe group on the quaternary center, the CO2Et group, and the OMe group on the other stereocenter are all wedged (cis). The Me group on the quaternary center is dashed, consistent with it being an \"outer\" group.\n\nTherefore, the two products formed from the endo Diels-Alder reaction are E and F.\n\n<<<E and F>>>"
