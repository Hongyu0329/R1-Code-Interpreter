    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. An emission spectrum is produced when the electrons of an atom are excited to higher energy levels and then fall back to lower levels, emitting photons of light at specific wavelengths (colors) in the process. Each element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts as its \"fingerprint.\" The image shows a series of bright, vertical colored lines against a dark background, arranged from shorter wavelengths (violet/blue) on the left to longer wavelengths (red) on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we need to carefully observe the pattern of the spectral lines – their color (wavelength), position, and relative intensity.\n*   **Red Region:** There is a very prominent, bright red line on the far right. There are also a few other, fainter lines in the red and deep red areas.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct, bright yellow-orange line.\n*   **Green Region:** There are several lines in the green part of the spectrum, including at least one that is quite bright.\n*   **Blue-Green (Cyan) Region:** There is a very strong, bright line in the blue-green part of the spectrum.\n*   **Blue and Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet regions on the left side of the spectrum.\n\nThe overall spectrum is quite complex, with many lines distributed across all colors of the visible spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Spectra of Common Elements**\nNow, we compare the observed pattern with the known emission spectra of some common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is relatively simple, with four prominent lines: a red line (656 nm), a blue-green line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is far more complex than this, containing many more lines (e.g., the bright yellow line is absent in hydrogen). Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n\n*   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium's spectrum is famous for its extremely dominant feature: a pair of very close, bright yellow lines (a doublet) at 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. While the given spectrum has a yellow line, it is not overwhelmingly dominant, and there are many other strong lines in red, green, and blue. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Neon is known for its bright red-orange glow in signs. Its emission spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of lines in the red, orange, and yellow parts of the spectrum. The spectrum in the image has strong lines across the entire visible range, including prominent green and blue lines, which is not characteristic of neon.\n\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium has a more complex spectrum with several strong, distinct lines distributed across the visible range. Its characteristic lines include:\n    *   A strong red line (~668 nm)\n    *   A strong yellow line (~587 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~502 nm)\n    *   A blue-green (cyan) line (~492 nm)\n    *   A blue-violet line (~447 nm)\nThis pattern of multiple strong lines in the red, yellow, green, and blue regions is a very close match to the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the distinct pattern of numerous lines across the full visible spectrum—specifically the prominent lines in the red, yellow, green, and blue regions—with the known fingerprints of different elements, we can confidently identify the element. The spectrum shown is a classic representation of the emission spectrum of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
