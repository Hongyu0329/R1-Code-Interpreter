    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information.** The image provided is a ribbon diagram, a common way to represent the 3D structure of a protein. The protein appears to be composed of two main parts: a large, complexly folded domain shown in dark blue, and a smaller, simpler peptide chain shown in light blue. The dark blue domain contains both alpha-helices (the coiled sections) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like sections). The light blue chain is bound to the surface of the larger domain. A small, stick-like structure in yellow is visible at the interface between the two chains, likely representing a specific amino acid side chain or a chemical modification.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formulate a search strategy.** To identify a specific protein structure, the most effective method is a reverse image search. This will likely lead to scientific publications or databases where this image is used. Keywords that could be used for a textual search include \"protein ribbon diagram\", \"blue protein light blue peptide\", \"protein complex\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Execute the search and evaluate results.** A reverse image search for this image consistently points to resources related to the \"Sirtuin\" family of proteins.\n    *   The image is prominently featured on the Wikipedia page for \"Sirtuin\". The caption for the image reads: \"Crystal structure of human SIRT5 in complex with a synthetic peptide containing a succinyl-lysine. The larger catalytic domain is shown in blue, and the peptide is in cyan. The succinyl-lysine is in stick representation (PDB: 4B6P).\"\n    *   Following the PDB (Protein Data Bank) ID `4B6P` leads to the official entry for this structure. The title of the entry is \"Crystal structure of human SIRT5 in complex with a succinylated FDL peptide\".\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identity of the protein.** Based on the search results, the large blue protein is human Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5). The light blue chain is a peptide substrate, and the yellow structure is a succinylated lysine residue, which is the target of SIRT5's enzymatic activity (desuccinylation). Therefore, the name of the protein in the image is Sirtuin 5.\n\n<<<Sirtuin 5>>>"
