    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Sheet Music**\n\n*   **Clef and Key:** The music is written in the treble clef. There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, and the piece frequently uses a C major chord as its tonal center, indicating the key is C major.\n*   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time. A tempo marking at the top appears to be \"Medium J=128\", indicating a moderately fast and lively tempo.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is characterized by fast-moving passages, including many sixteenth notes, and significant syncopation (rhythms that emphasize the off-beats). This rhythmic complexity gives the music a driving and energetic quality.\n*   **Harmony:** Chord symbols are written above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-). This format is typical for a \"lead sheet,\" used in jazz, pop, and various folk traditions to outline the harmonic structure for accompaniment and improvisation.\n*   **Structure:** The piece includes standard musical notation for navigation, such as \"D.S. al Coda\" (Dal Segno al Coda, meaning \"from the sign to the Coda\") and a Coda section at the end. This suggests a structured composition with repeated sections.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Key Musical Features**\n\n*   **Opening Chord Progression:** The song begins with a very distinctive chord progression in the first eight bars: C major for two bars, followed by E7 for two bars, F major for two bars, and then G7 resolving back to C major. The progression C -> E7 -> F is a particularly strong clue.\n*   **Opening Melody:** The melody in the first few measures is also very recognizable. Over the initial C chord, the melody plays notes around E, F, and G. Crucially, when the chord changes to E7, the melody incorporates a G# (the major third of the E7 chord), creating a strong pull towards the key of A. However, the progression resolves deceptively to F major.\n*   **Combining Clues:** The combination of the upbeat, highly syncopated rhythm, the specific C -> E7 -> F -> G7 chord progression, and the melodic shape strongly points towards a famous piece from a specific genre.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Song Title, Style, and Origin**\n\n*   **Identification:** The musical elements identified above are the signature characteristics of the song **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**.\n    *   The title translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal\".\n*   **Musical Style:** This song is a prime example of the **Choro** musical style. Choro (often called \"the New Orleans jazz of Brazil\") is a Brazilian instrumental genre that originated in the 19th century. It is known for its fast tempos, virtuosic melodies, syncopation, and improvisation over a set harmonic structure.\n*   **Country of Origin:** The song was composed in 1917 by Zequinha de Abreu, a composer from **Brazil**. It is one of the most famous and widely recognized Choro compositions in the world.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the key signature, chord progression, melodic contour, and rhythmic feel, the piece of music can be definitively identified.\n\n*   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n*   **Musical Style:** Choro\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<**Title**: Tico-Tico no Fubá\n**Musical Style**: Choro\n**Country of Origin**: Brazil>>>"
