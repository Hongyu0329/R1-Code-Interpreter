    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the seal's characters:\n\n**1. Reading Order:**\nChinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left. So, the order of characters is:\n1. Top right\n2. Bottom right\n3. Top left\n4. Bottom left\n\n**2. Character Identification:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Top Right Character**\n    *   **Analysis:** This character has a complex structure at the top and the character \"寸\" (cùn) at the bottom. This is a very common character in seal script, representing longevity.\n    *   **Traditional Chinese:** 壽 (shòu)\n    *   **Simplified Chinese:** 寿\n\n*   **Step 2: Bottom Right Character**\n    *   **Analysis:** This character has a large outer box \"囗\" (wéi). Inside, there is the component \"或\" (huò). The combination of 囗 and 或 forms this character, which means \"country\" or \"state\".\n    *   **Traditional Chinese:** 國 (guó)\n    *   **Simplified Chinese:** 国\n\n*   **Step 3: Top Left Character**\n    *   **Analysis:** This character clearly shows the \"山\" (shān, mountain) radical at the top. Below it is a complex component \"嚴\" (yán). This character means \"cliff\" or \"rock\".\n    *   **Traditional Chinese:** 巖 (yán)\n    *   **Simplified Chinese:** 岩\n\n*   **Step 4: Bottom Left Character**\n    *   **Analysis:** This character's upper part shows \"聿\" (yù), representing a brush. The lower part is \"田\" (tián), representing a field, enclosed within a boundary. This composition depicts the act of drawing or a picture.\n    *   **Traditional Chinese:** 畫 (huà)\n    *   **Simplified Chinese:** 画\n\n**3. Assembling the Characters:**\n\nFollowing the traditional reading order (top-to-bottom, right-to-left), the characters are:\n*   Traditional: 壽國巖畫\n*   Simplified: 寿国岩画\n\nThis phrase \"Shòu Guó Yán Huà\" likely refers to a name, either of a person (Shouguo) and their art style (rock painting - Yanhua), or a studio name.\n\n<<<寿国岩画>>>"
