    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and key terms.**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily visible difference between the sporophytes of two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n*   **Sporophyte:** The spore-producing stage in a moss's life cycle. It consists of three main parts: a foot (anchoring it to the parent plant), a seta (stalk), and a capsule (where spores are produced).\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This implies a macroscopic feature that doesn't require microscopic examination. The orientation, shape, and length of the sporophyte parts are key candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   **Image Analysis:** The provided image shows moss capsules that are immersed or emergent, meaning they are nestled among the upper leaves rather than being held high above them. They sit upright on what appears to be a very short, straight stalk.\n*   **Botanical Description:** Botanical references confirm that *Grimmia montana* is characterized by sporophytes with a **short, straight seta**. This results in the capsule being held erect and either immersed within the perichaetial leaves (the leaves at the base of the seta) or just barely emerging from them.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   **Etymology:** The name *curviseta* provides a significant clue. \"Curvi-\" is Latin for \"curved,\" and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. The name literally means \"curved stalk.\"\n*   **Botanical Description:** *Grimmia curviseta* is distinguished by its sporophyte having a **long and distinctly curved or hooked seta** (often described as cygneous, like a swan's neck). This prominent curve causes the capsule to be exserted (held well above the leaves) and to hang or nod downwards.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two species and identify the main difference.**\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Seta is **short and straight**. The capsule is **erect** and **immersed or emergent**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Seta is **long and strongly curved**. The capsule is **nodding or pendulous** and **exserted**.\n\n**Conclusion: List the careful points.**\n1.  The primary distinguishing feature lies in the **seta (stalk)** of the sporophyte.\n2.  The shape and length of the seta directly determine the orientation and position of the capsule relative to the leafy gametophyte.\n3.  In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, keeping the capsule upright and nestled in the leaves.\n4.  In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and sharply curved, causing the capsule to be held away from the leaves and hang downwards. This is the most obvious difference for field identification when sporophytes are present.\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta**. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect and immersed capsule. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive **long, strongly curved (cygneous) seta**, which causes its capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved or hooked, causing the capsule to be held out and nod downwards.>>>"
