The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved or hooked, causing the capsule to be held out and nod downwards.
