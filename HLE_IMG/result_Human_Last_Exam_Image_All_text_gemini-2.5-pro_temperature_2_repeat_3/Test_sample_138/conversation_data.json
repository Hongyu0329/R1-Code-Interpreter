    "This question requires identifying the biological sex of six insects, presented in three pairs (A, B, and C). The insects are described as pollinators from taxa where scopae (pollen-carrying hairs on the legs) are absent, and both sexes feed on nectar. We need to use key morphological features, known as sexual dimorphism, to determine the sex of each individual.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis for each pair:\n\n**General principles for sexing Hymenoptera (bees and wasps):**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some groups, male antennae are conspicuously long or curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen:** The tip of the abdomen differs. Females have an ovipositor (egg-laying organ), which is modified into a stinger in many species, often making the abdomen appear pointed. Males have claspers for mating, and their abdomen often appears more rounded or blunt at the tip. The number of visible abdominal segments can also differ (often 7 in males vs. 6 in females).\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (especially the clypeus, or \"upper lip\"), which are absent or reduced in females.\n*   **Scopae:** Non-parasitic female bees have specialized pollen-carrying hairs (scopae) on their hind legs or abdomen. Males lack these. The question states the taxa shown lack scopae, which points towards wasps, cuckoo bees (cleptoparasites), or male bees.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This is a cuckoo bee from the genus *Coelioxys*. These are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bees, so they lack scopae. The most prominent feature is the abdomen, which tapers to a sharp, conical point. This pointed abdomen is a specialized ovipositor used by the female to pierce the host's nest. This is a **Female**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This is also a cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. These also lack scopae. While the tip is not perfectly in focus, the abdomen is broad and appears blunt at the end, contrasting sharply with the pointed abdomen of the female on the left. This blunt abdominal tip is characteristic of males in this group. This is a **Male**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Insect B (Left):** This is a paper wasp (*Polistes*). Wasps do not have scopae. The most telling feature here is the antennae, which are long and distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of a male wasp. This is a **Male**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This is also a wasp. In contrast to the insect on the left, its antennae are shorter, thicker, and straight (not curled). This is typical of a female wasp (a queen or worker). The abdomen also tapers towards a point where the stinger is concealed. This is a **Female**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n---\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee belongs to the long-horned bee group (tribe Eucerini). Two features are definitive: 1) The antennae are extremely long, giving the group its common name. 2) The clypeus (face plate) is pale yellow. Both are textbook characteristics of a male in this group. This is a **Male**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This is also a long-horned bee. It exhibits features opposite to the male on the left: the antennae are much shorter, and the face is dark. These are characteristic traits of a female. (Note: Although the question states the taxa lack scopae, this individual clearly has very hairy hind legs that function as scopae for collecting pollen. This might be a confusing element in the question's premise. However, the other dimorphic traits—antennae length and face color—are unambiguous and provide a reliable basis for sex identification). This is a **Female**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n---\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Female, Male (F, M) -> Index 4\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4,3,3>>>"
