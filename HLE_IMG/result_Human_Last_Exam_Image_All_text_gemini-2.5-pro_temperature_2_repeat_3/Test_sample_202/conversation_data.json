    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis Goal:** The objective is to identify the four rock specimens (H, I, J, K) by observing their key geological features such as texture (crystal size, presence of pores, fragments), color, and implied mineral composition.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, or vesicular, texture. The holes (vesicles) were formed by gas bubbles trapped in the lava as it cooled. The rock itself is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The vesicular and aphanitic texture indicates that it is an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it cooled quickly on the Earth's surface from lava. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron.\n    *   **Identification:** These characteristics are classic for **Scoria**. It is sometimes called volcanic cinder.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of various rock fragments (clasts) of different sizes and colors, which are cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix. The fragments appear somewhat angular.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This texture is known as pyroclastic. It forms from material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption that later becomes consolidated and lithified (turned into rock). The fine-grained matrix is likely compacted volcanic ash.\n    *   **Identification:** A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments is known as **Tuff** or volcanic breccia. \"Tuff\" is a common and appropriate name for this specimen.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color (white to light gray) and is extremely vesicular. It has a porous, almost frothy appearance. The rock matrix is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n    *   **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is an extrusive igneous rock that cooled very rapidly from a gas-rich lava. Its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. The extreme vesicularity results in very low density.\n    *   **Identification:** These are the defining features of **Pumice**. Pumice is so porous that many samples can float in water.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of very large, interlocked mineral crystals that are easily visible. This texture is called phaneritic (coarse-grained). We can see large, light-colored, blocky crystals (likely feldspar) and some darker minerals.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly from magma, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This allows large crystals time to grow. This is an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   **Identification:** An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (typically over 1 cm) is called a **Pegmatite**. This specimen's very coarse grain size is its most distinctive feature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **H** is **Scoria**.\n*   **I** is **Tuff** (or Volcanic Breccia).\n*   **J** is **Pumice**.\n*   **K** is **Pegmatite**.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
