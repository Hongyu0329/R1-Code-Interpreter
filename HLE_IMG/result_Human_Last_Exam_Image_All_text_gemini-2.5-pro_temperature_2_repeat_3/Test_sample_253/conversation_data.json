    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism:** The image shows a vibrant yellow, leafy lichen attached to a rock. The structure includes small, disc-like features which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). This morphology, color, and habitat (growing on rocks, mentioned as being in Acadia National Park, a coastal area) are characteristic of the lichen *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common sunburst lichen. Lichens are composite organisms, and questions about specific proteins typically refer to the fungal component (the mycobiont).\n\n2.  **Identify the Target Protein:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. XPH1 is the specific name of the protein of interest.\n\n3.  **Search for Protein Information:** To find the length of a protein, we must consult a scientific protein database. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a standard repository for this type of data.\n\n4.  **Perform the Database Search:** A search in the NCBI protein database for \"XPH1\" and the organism name \"*Xanthoria parietina*\" will locate the specific protein entry.\n\n5.  **Locate and Analyze the Database Entry:** The search leads to the protein with the accession number **CAJ18889.1**. The description for this entry is \"XPH1 (phototropin) [Xanthoria parietina]\". This confirms we have found the correct protein.\n\n6.  **Extract the Amino Acid Count:** The NCBI record for protein CAJ18889.1 provides its full sequence and summary information. In the record's header, the length is explicitly stated. The entry shows the protein has a length of **1018 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Organism Identification:** The identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is crucial. Its distinctive appearance and commonality in the specified location make this a confident identification.\n*   **Protein Name:** Correctly interpreting \"XPH1\" as the protein identifier is key to finding the right data.\n*   **Reliable Data Source:** Using a primary scientific database like NCBI ensures the accuracy of the information regarding protein length.\n*   **Precision:** The question asks for a specific number (the count of amino acids), which can be precisely retrieved from the database entry.\n\n<<<1018>>>"
