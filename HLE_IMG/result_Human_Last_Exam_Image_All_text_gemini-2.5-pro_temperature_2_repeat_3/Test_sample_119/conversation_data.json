    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** The MW is an odd number (135), which indicates that the molecule contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms (most commonly one).\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:** Assuming the presence of C, H, and one N atom, we can deduce a plausible molecular formula. A combination that fits the MW and is chemically reasonable is C9H13N.\n    *   MW(C9H13N) = (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This formula is consistent with the molecular weight.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For a formula of C9H13N, the DoU is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The base peak at m/z = 30 is a very common fragment for primary amines, [CH2=NH2]+. This suggests the presence of an ethylamine-like fragment undergoing alpha-cleavage.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two distinct, sharp peaks are observed. This is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** Sharp absorptions in this region indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons, confirming the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic groups).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this area are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Absence of Carbonyl:** There is no strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹, ruling out the presence of a C=O group (ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~7.1-7.3 ppm (Multiplet, 5H):** This signal corresponds to five protons in the aromatic region, which is the signature pattern for a monosubstituted benzene ring (C6H5-).\n*   **~2.8 ppm (Multiplet, ~2H):** Integration shows 1.96, corresponding to 2 protons. This signal is from a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **~2.7 ppm (Multiplet, ~1H):** Integration shows 0.97, corresponding to 1 proton. This signal is from a methine (-CH-) group.\n*   **~1.2 ppm (Doublet, ~3H):** Integration shows 3.24, corresponding to 3 protons. A 3H doublet indicates a methyl (-CH3) group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   **-NH₂ Protons:** The two protons of the primary amine group are exchangeable and often appear as a broad singlet or may not be clearly visible/integrated. The total proton count from the signals (5+2+1+3 = 11H) plus the two amine protons gives 13H, matching the proposed formula C9H13N.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Signals:** Seven distinct signals are listed:\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 4 types of carbons: 1 ipso-C, 2 ortho-C, 2 meta-C, 1 para-C; the ortho and meta carbons are equivalent, leading to 4 signals). The signal at 145.1 ppm is a quaternary carbon (C-ipso) and will be absent in DEPT spectra.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm. This corresponds to the three carbons of the C3H6 side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Information:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   **Negative signal (1):** DEPT-135 shows CH₂ groups as negative signals. This confirms the presence of one -CH₂- group.\n    *   **Positive signals (5):** DEPT-135 shows CH and CH₃ groups as positive signals. The three signals from the aromatic CH groups (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) account for 3 of the positive signals. The remaining two positive signals must come from the aliphatic chain, confirming the presence of one -CH- group and one -CH₃ group.\n\n**5. HSQC Spectroscopy Analysis**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates directly bonded protons and carbons.\n*   **H(~1.2 ppm) correlates with C(19.2 ppm):** This connects the 3H doublet proton signal with the most upfield carbon signal, confirming the -CH₃ group assignment.\n*   **H(~2.7 ppm) correlates with C(~43 ppm):** This connects the 1H methine proton signal with the carbon at 43.5 ppm. Therefore, δC = 43.5 ppm is the -CH- carbon.\n*   **H(~2.8-2.9 ppm) correlates with C(~50 ppm):** This connects the 2H methylene proton signal with the carbon at 49.6 ppm. Therefore, δC = 49.6 ppm is the -CH₂- carbon.\n\n**Structure Elucidation**\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   We have a monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n*   We have a C3H8N side chain containing a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The side chain consists of a -CH₃, a -CH-, and a -CH₂- group.\n*   From ¹H NMR splitting, the -CH₃ (doublet) is next to the -CH- group. The -CH₂- group must be attached to the other side of the -CH- group and to the phenyl ring.\n\nThis leads to the following structure:\nPhenyl - CH₂ - CH(NH₂) - CH₃\n\nThis structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. All spectral data are consistent with this structure.\n\n**IUPAC Naming**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. Numbering from the methyl-end gives the amine at position 2.\n    CH₃ (C3) - CH(NH₂) (C2) - CH₂- (C1)\n*   There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 1.\n*   The IUPAC name is therefore **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n>>>1-phenylpropan-2-amine"
