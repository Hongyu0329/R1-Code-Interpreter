    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by changing from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share composition.\n\n**Concept:**\nTotal Car VMT is the sum of the miles traveled by all cars. To calculate this, we need to consider trips of different lengths. The overall VMT can be calculated as a weighted average. The formula for the total VMT (or a proportional index since we don't have the absolute number of trips) is:\n`VMT Index = Σ [ (Share of Total Trips in distance category_i) × (Share of Car Trips in category_i) × (Average Trip Distance for category_i) ]`\nWe need to calculate this VMT Index for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage difference. \"Car trips\" include both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT Index for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe will calculate the VMT contribution for each distance category and then sum them up.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Share of car trips (1 occupant + >2 occupants): 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Share of car trips: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Share of car trips: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **For 10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Share of car trips: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT Index for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Share of car trips: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Share of car trips: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Share of car trips: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **For 10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Share of car trips: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`Percentage Reduction = ( (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline ) × 100%`\n\n*   `Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   `Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.52194 × 100%`\n*   `Percentage Reduction ≈ 52.2%`\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share from the Baseline to the Proposed scenario, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
