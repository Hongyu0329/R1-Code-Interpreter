    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends graph to determine the country.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Request**\nThe task is to identify a single country where three different historic events occurred, based on a Google Trends graph. The graph shows the relative search interest for these three events (represented by the red, yellow, and blue lines) over a period from late 2019 to late 2023. The key is that the events are recurring and significant enough to generate noticeable annual spikes in search traffic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Graph Data Points**\nThe graph shows three distinct, annually repeating patterns of search interest spikes.\n\n*   **The Red Line:** This line shows a significant spike every year around late December. The peak occurs just before the new year mark (e.g., just after \"Dec 1, 2019\" and similarly in subsequent years). This timing is characteristic of Christmas, a major cultural and federal holiday in many countries. The spike is broad, suggesting interest builds over a few weeks, which aligns with the Christmas holiday season.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line:** This line shows a very sharp and high peak every year in late November. It occurs just before the \"Dec 1\" mark for each year on the x-axis. A major holiday celebrated in late November is a very strong indicator of Thanksgiving in the United States, which falls on the fourth Thursday of November. Canadian Thanksgiving, by contrast, is in October.\n\n*   **The Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller but very distinct peak every year in early July. Looking at the x-axis, these spikes happen roughly halfway between the beginning of the year and the August marker. This timing perfectly corresponds to the United States' Independence Day, which is celebrated on July 4th. Canada Day on July 1st is another possibility, but the other clues will help us narrow it down.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Country**\nWe need to find a single country where all three annual events are celebrated.\n\n1.  **Late November Event (Yellow Line):** This strongly points to Thanksgiving in the **United States**.\n2.  **Early July Event (Blue Line):** This points to Independence Day (July 4th) in the **United States**.\n3.  **Late December Event (Red Line):** This points to Christmas, a major holiday in the **United States**.\n\nAll three patterns converge on a single country. The combination of a major late-November holiday (Thanksgiving), a major early-July holiday (Independence Day), and a major late-December holiday (Christmas) is a unique cultural and historical fingerprint of the United States. A historian would readily identify this combination of national observances.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe recurring search interest spikes for events in late November, early July, and late December align perfectly with the American holidays of Thanksgiving, Independence Day, and Christmas, respectively.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
