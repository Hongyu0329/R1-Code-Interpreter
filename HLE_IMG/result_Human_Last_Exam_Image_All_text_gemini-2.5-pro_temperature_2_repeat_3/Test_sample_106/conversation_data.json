    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction**\nThe reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 Â°C) will protonate the alcohol (-OH), turning it into a good leaving group (-OH2+). Departure of water will form a carbocation, which then undergoes a series of rearrangements known as a Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement, ultimately leading to a more stable alkene product. This specific transformation is a classic example of a Friedelane-Oleanane rearrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade**\nWe will follow the movement of the positive charge, which triggers a series of [1,2] shifts of neighboring hydride (H:-) or methanide (CH3:-) groups. The driving force is the formation of more stable carbocations (secondary -> tertiary) and the relief of ring strain. We will use the standard numbering for the triterpenoid skeleton to track the changes.\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The alcohol at C-3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **1st Shift:** To form a more stable tertiary carbocation, a methyl group (`CH3`) from the neighboring quaternary C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge is now at C-4. (This is a [1,2]-methanide shift).\n3.  **2nd Shift:** A hydrogen atom (`H`) from C-5 migrates to the C-4 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-5. (This is a [1,2]-hydride shift).\n4.  **3rd Shift:** The methyl group (`CH3`) from C-10 migrates to the C-5 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-10. ([1,2]-methanide shift).\n5.  **4th Shift:** A hydrogen atom (`H`) from C-9 migrates to the C-10 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-9. ([1,2]-hydride shift).\n6.  **5th Shift:** The methyl group (`CH3`) from C-8 migrates to the C-9 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-8. ([1,2]-methanide shift).\n7.  **6th Shift:** The methyl group (`CH3`) from C-14 migrates to the C-8 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-14. ([1,2]-methanide shift).\n8.  **7th Shift:** A hydrogen atom (`H`) from C-13 migrates to the C-14 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-13. ([1,2]-hydride shift).\n9.  **Elimination:** To form the final stable alkene, a proton is eliminated from an adjacent carbon. The removal of a proton from C-18 forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, as shown in the product.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Substituents**\nNow we determine what group (H or CH3) is at each of the numbered positions in the final product based on the cascade of shifts.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** C-4 starts with two methyl groups. The `beta-CH3` (wedge) migrates away to C-3. The `alpha-CH3` (dash) remains. A `beta-H` migrates in from C-5. The label '1' points to the substituent in the alpha position, which is the original methyl group that did not migrate.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** C-10 starts with a `beta-CH3`. This methyl group migrates to C-5. A `beta-H` from C-9 migrates to C-10 to take its place. The label '2' points to this new substituent.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (at C-5):** C-5 starts with a `beta-H`. This hydrogen migrates to C-4. The `beta-CH3` from C-10 then migrates to C-5. So the single substituent on C-5 is now a methyl group. (Note: The diagram misleadingly uses a dashed bond for the label, suggesting an alpha substituent on a carbon that becomes tertiary. This is a common ambiguity in such problems; the label points to the carbon atom C-5, and we identify its only substituent).\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** C-8 starts with a `beta-CH3`. This methyl group migrates to C-9. A `beta-CH3` from C-14 migrates to C-8 to replace it. The label '4' points to this new methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 5 (at C-9):** C-9 starts with a `beta-H`. This hydrogen migrates to C-10. The `beta-CH3` from C-8 migrates to C-9. So the substituent on C-9 is now a methyl group. (Similar to position 3, the dashed line for the label is likely a graphical error).\n    *   **5 = CH3**\n\nFinal result based on the analysis:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
