The protein S100B has a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its over-expression directly activates pathways (JNK/JUN, NFκβ) leading to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, which are hallmarks of disease progression. Therefore, its levels can predict the severity and future course of the neurological disorder.
