    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the cutoff frequency at node `a₀`. In an RC circuit, the cutoff frequency (`ω_c` in radians/second or `f_c` in Hertz) is determined by the time constant `τ = R_th * C`, where `R_th` is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor `C`. The cutoff angular frequency is given by `ω_c = 1/τ = 1/(R_th * C)`.\n\n2.  **Circuit Interpretation:**\n    *   The circuit is an infinite resistive ladder network. This type of network is often used to model transmission lines or interconnects.\n    *   The ladder has a top rail with nodes `c₀, c₁, c₂, ...` and a bottom rail with nodes `a₀, d₁, d₂, ...`. Let's establish a consistent naming convention where `c_k` and `d_k` represent the nodes at the k-th stage. The problem labels the input node on the top rail as `g`, which we'll call `c₀`. The node where the capacitor is connected on the bottom rail is `a₀`, which we'll call `d₀`.\n    *   The input signal `V_in` is applied at node `c₀` with respect to ground. The capacitor `C` is connected between node `a₀` (`d₀`) and ground.\n    *   The ladder consists of repeating sections. For any `k ≥ 0`, there is a series resistor `r` connecting `c_k` to `c_{k+1}` and another series resistor `r` connecting `d_k` to `d_{k+1}`.\n    *   For `k ≥ 1`, there is a shunt resistor `r` connecting `c_k` to `d_k`.\n    *   Crucially, based on the provided diagram, there is no shunt resistor connecting the initial nodes `c₀` and `d₀`. This makes the first section of the network asymmetric compared to the rest of the ladder.\n\n3.  **Thevenin Resistance Calculation (`R_th`):**\n    *   To find the cutoff frequency, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance `R_th` \"seen\" by the capacitor `C`. This is the resistance between node `a₀` (`d₀`) and ground.\n    *   To calculate `R_th`, we must turn off all independent sources. The input voltage source `V_in` at `c₀` is a voltage source, so we set it to zero, which means node `c₀` is connected to ground.\n    *   So, `R_th` is the equivalent resistance between `d₀` and ground, with `c₀` also at ground potential.\n\n4.  **Solving the Infinite Ladder (Modal Analysis):**\n    *   The infinite nature of the ladder suggests using propagation modes. We can write the KCL equations for the voltages `V_{ck}` and `V_{dk}` at any arbitrary node `k` (`k ≥ 1`) of the ladder.\n    *   KCL at node `c_k`: `(V_{ck} - V_{ck-1})/r + (V_{ck} - V_{ck+1})/r + (V_{ck} - V_{dk})/r = 0`\n    *   KCL at node `d_k`: `(V_{dk} - V_{dk-1})/r + (V_{dk} - V_{dk+1})/r + (V_{dk} - V_{ck})/r = 0`\n    *   These difference equations have solutions in the form of `V_k = V_0 * e^{-kγ}`. There are two fundamental modes of propagation:\n        1.  **Common Mode:** `V_{ck} = V_{dk}`. In this mode, `γ = 0` (no attenuation).\n        2.  **Differential Mode:** `V_{ck} = -V_{dk}`. Solving the equations for this mode yields a characteristic equation `cosh(γ) = 2`.\n    *   The propagation constant `γ` for the differential mode is found from `e^γ + e^{-γ} = 4`. Solving for `e^γ` gives `e^γ = 2 ± √3`. For a signal propagating into an infinite ladder, the amplitude must decay, so we choose the solution `e^γ = 2 + √3`. This means the decay factor per section is `e^{-γ} = 1 / (2 + √3) = 2 - √3`.\n    *   Any voltage distribution on the ladder can be represented as a superposition of these two modes.\n        `V_{ck} = V_{common,0} + V_{diff,0} * e^{-kγ}`\n        `V_{dk} = V_{common,0} - V_{diff,0} * e^{-kγ}`\n\n5.  **Applying Boundary Conditions to Find `R_th`:**\n    *   To find `R_th`, we apply a test voltage `V_T` at node `d₀` and find the current `I_T` drawn from the source. The other boundary condition is `V_{c0} = 0`.\n    *   At `k=0`:\n        `V_{c0} = V_{common,0} + V_{diff,0} = 0`\n        `V_{d0} = V_{common,0} - V_{diff,0} = V_T`\n    *   Solving this system for the mode amplitudes gives:\n        `V_{common,0} = V_T / 2`\n        `V_{diff,0} = -V_T / 2`\n    *   The current `I_T` flowing from the test source at `d₀` goes into the resistor between `d₀` and `d₁`.\n        `I_T = (V_{d0} - V_{d1}) / r`\n    *   We need to find `V_{d1}`. We use the propagation formulas for `k=1`:\n        `V_{d1} = V_{common,0} - V_{diff,0} * e^{-γ}`\n        `V_{d1} = (V_T / 2) - (-V_T / 2) * (2 - √3)`\n        `V_{d1} = (V_T / 2) * [1 + (2 - √3)] = (V_T / 2) * (3 - √3)`\n    *   Now substitute `V_{d1}` into the expression for `I_T`:\n        `I_T = (V_T - (V_T / 2) * (3 - √3)) / r`\n        `I_T = (V_T / r) * [1 - (3 - √3) / 2] = (V_T / r) * [(2 - 3 + √3) / 2]`\n        `I_T = (V_T / r) * ( (√3 - 1) / 2 )`\n    *   The Thevenin resistance is `R_th = V_T / I_T`:\n        `R_{th} = r / ( (√3 - 1) / 2 ) = 2r / (√3 - 1)`\n        To rationalize the denominator, multiply by `(√3 + 1) / (√3 + 1)`:\n        `R_{th} = 2r(√3 + 1) / (3 - 1) = 2r(√3 + 1) / 2 = r(1 + √3)`\n\n6.  **Final Cutoff Frequency Calculation:**\n    *   The cutoff frequency (in radians per second) is `ω_c = 1 / (R_{th} * C)`.\n    *   Substituting the calculated value of `R_th`:\n        `ω_c = 1 / (r(1 + √3) * C)`\n    *   The cutoff frequency in Hertz would be `f_c = ω_c / (2π) = 1 / (2π * r * C * (1 + √3))`. The question does not specify units, so we provide the standard angular frequency expression.\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node `a_0` is `ω_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}`."
