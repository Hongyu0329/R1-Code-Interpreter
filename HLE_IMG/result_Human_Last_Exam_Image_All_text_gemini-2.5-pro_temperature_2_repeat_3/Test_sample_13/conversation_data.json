    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Labeling the Grid and Identifying Clues**\n\nFirst, let's label the unknown white squares for easier reference. The question asks for the values in the two top squares, which we'll call `A` and `B`.\n\n```\n      A  B\n   C  D  E  F\n   G  H [BS] I  J\n      K  L\n      M\n```\nHere, `[BS]` is the internal black square containing its own clues.\n\nKakuro puzzles have two types of clues:\n*   **Horizontal (Across):** The clue number is the sum of the digits in the white squares in a line to its right.\n*   **Vertical (Down):** The clue number is the sum of the digits in the white squares in a line below it.\n\nA key rule is that within any single sum (block), all digits must be unique (1-9).\n\nLet's identify the most plausible clues from the diagram:\n*   **Across clue for Row 1:** The number `10` to the left of square A, with its line pointing to the right, indicates a horizontal sum. This block contains `A` and `B`. So, `A + B = 10`.\n*   **Across clue for Row 3 (left part):** The `6` on the far left of the third row applies to the block of squares `G` and `H`. The block is terminated by the internal black square `[BS]`. So, `G + H = 6`.\n*   **Vertical clue for Column 1:** The `10` at the top of the first visible column applies to the squares `C` and `G`. So, `C + G = 10`.\n*   **Vertical clue for Column 2:** The `22` at the top of the second column applies to the squares `A`, `D`, and `H`. The block seems to terminate at the black square `[BS]`. The sum of three unique digits for `22` is possible (e.g., 9+8+5=22). So, `A + D + H = 22`.\n*   **Clues from the internal black square `[BS]`:** This square has two clues.\n    *   `\\6` (vertical): The sum of the squares below `[BS]` is 6. This block contains `K` and `M`. So, `K + M = 6`.\n    *   `/15` (horizontal): The sum of the squares to the right of `[BS]` is 15. This block contains `I` and `J`. So, `I + J = 15`.\n\n*Note: Some clues in the diagram, like the vertical sum `29` for a 2-cell column and the horizontal sum `28` for a 2-cell row, are impossible since the maximum sum of two unique digits is 9+8=17. This suggests errors in the puzzle's creation, but we can proceed with the solvable parts.*\n\n**2. Solving Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's use the clues we've identified to find the values of the cells.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the sum for 22.**\n    The clue `A + D + H = 22` is very restrictive. To get a sum of 22 with three unique digits from 1-9, the only possible combination is `{9, 8, 5}`. So, the cells `A`, `D`, and `H` must contain the numbers 9, 8, and 5 in some order.\n\n*   **Step 2: Use clues for G and H to find H.**\n    We know `G + H = 6`. The digits must be unique. We also know `H` must be one of `{9, 8, 5}` from Step 1.\n    *   If `H = 9`, then `G = 6 - 9 = -3` (Impossible).\n    *   If `H = 8`, then `G = 6 - 8 = -2` (Impossible).\n    *   If `H = 5`, then `G = 6 - 5 = 1`. This is a valid solution.\n    Therefore, we can conclude that **`H = 5`** and **`G = 1`**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Find the value of C.**\n    We have the clue `C + G = 10`. Since we just found that `G = 1`, we can calculate `C`: `C + 1 = 10`, which means **`C = 9`**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the values of A and D.**\n    From Step 1, we know `{A, D, H} = {9, 8, 5}`. We found `H = 5`, so this leaves `{A, D} = {9, 8}`.\n    Now we must use another constraint. `C` and `D` are in the same horizontal block (the second row). Therefore, their values must be unique. We found `C = 9`. This means `D` cannot be 9.\n    Since `{A, D} = {9, 8}` and `D` is not 9, **`D` must be 8**.\n    This leaves **`A = 9`**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the value of B.**\n    The first clue we identified was for the top row: `A + B = 10`. Now that we know `A = 9`, we can find `B`.\n    `9 + B = 10`, which means **`B = 1`**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe two numbers in the two top white squares (`A` and `B`) are 9 and 1. We can verify these numbers are unique within their block, which they are.\n\nThe question asks for the two numbers that would be present in the two top white squares. The values are 1 and 9.\n\nFinal Answer Formatting: The two numbers are 1 and 9. We list them separated by a comma.\n\n>>> 1,9"
