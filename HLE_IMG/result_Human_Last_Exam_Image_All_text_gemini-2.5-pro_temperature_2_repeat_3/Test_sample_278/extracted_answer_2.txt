**Morphology:** The micrograph shows a dimorphic fungus. There are two distinct morphological forms present:
1.  **Budding Yeast Cells (Blastoconidia):** Small, oval-shaped cells, some of which are clearly in the process of budding.
2.  **Pseudohyphae:** Elongated, filamentous structures formed from chains of yeast cells that have failed to detach after budding. These are characterized by constrictions at the points of cell-to-cell attachment.

**Type of Microorganism:** The observed features are characteristic of a **fungus**, specifically a **yeast from the genus *Candida*** (e.g., *Candida albicans*). This appearance is typical of a *Candida* infection (candidiasis) in tissue, as seen with a Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain.
