    "*   **Step 1: Identify the visual elements of the cuneiform sign.**\n    The image provided is a line drawing of an early cuneiform sign. We can break down its components:\n    *   A rectangular base structure with vertical and horizontal lines inside.\n    *   A triangular or gabled shape on top, representing a roof.\n    *   Small protrusions on the sides and top.\n    This overall structure strongly resembles a building, such as a house or a hut.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the context of the question.**\n    The question asks for the meaning of this sign in its \"third-millennium form\". This refers to the Early Dynastic period of Sumer (c. 2900â€“2350 BC) or the Ur III period (c. 2112â€“2004 BC). During this era, cuneiform signs were still highly pictographic, meaning they often visually represented the object or concept they stood for. The sign in the image is a classic example of this pictographic style.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the pictographic meaning.**\n    Given that the sign looks like a building, its most logical meaning would be related to a structure where people live or worship. It clearly depicts a house or a similar edifice with walls and a roof.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Signs for tools would typically look like a plow (APIN), a sickle, or an axe. This sign does not resemble a tool.\n    *   **B. Guard:** A guard would likely be represented by a sign for a person (LU), perhaps combined with a sign for a weapon or a gate. This is a sign for a building, not a person.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA) typically looked like a ration bowl or a specific loaf shape. This sign is not it.\n    *   **D. Home:** This choice aligns perfectly with the pictographic evidence. The sign is a drawing of a house, which is synonymous with \"home\". This sign is known to scholars as Ã‰ (or E2), the Sumerian logogram for \"house\" or \"temple\".\n    *   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity or god (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­). The sign in the image is completely different.\n    *   **F. Beard:** Signs related to body parts would be drawn differently. For example, the sign for head is SAG (ð’Š•), which is a pictograph of a human head. This sign is not a body part.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    The sign is a pictograph of a house. In Sumerian cuneiform from the third millennium BC, this sign (Ã‰) represents \"house,\" \"temple,\" or \"home.\" Therefore, \"Home\" is the correct meaning among the choices provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
