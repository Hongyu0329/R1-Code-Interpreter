    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n1.  **Work 1 (Top Left):** This is a modern Chinese ink and color figure painting depicting women from the Yi ethnic group. The style features delicate, realistic rendering of the faces combined with expressive brushwork for the clothing. This particular style and subject matter are characteristic of the contemporary artist **Tang Yongli (唐勇力)**. The painting is titled \"Listening to the Spring Rain\" (听春雨).\n\n2.  **Work 2 (Top Middle):** This is a Chinese ink landscape painting with a modern, abstract feel. It depicts buildings and trees using bold, geometric black ink forms and lines. This style, which deconstructs landscapes into linear and block-like structures, is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a master who famously blended Chinese artistic traditions with Western modernism.\n\n3.  **Work 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy written in a very dynamic and wild cursive script (草书). This highly personal and powerful calligraphic style is immediately recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n\n4.  **Work 4 (Middle Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, this time in an elegant, flowing, semi-cursive script. The characters are well-structured yet fluid, with a distinctive slender and \"wiry\" quality. This is the celebrated \"Qi Style\" (启体), the unique and widely admired calligraphy of **Qi Gong (启功)**.\n\n5.  **Work 5 (Middle Center):** This is a highly realistic oil painting portraying a young woman with short hair in a white T-shirt, holding a paintbrush. This is an iconic work of Chinese Realism from the 1980s. The artist is **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, and this painting is one of his most famous masterpieces.\n\n6.  **Work 6 (Middle Right):** This painting in ink and color shows a woman in stylized ethnic attire with an elaborate headdress, surrounded by sparrows. The vibrant colors, decorative quality, and stylized treatment of the figure and animals are hallmarks of the contemporary artist **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, who is also famous for designing the Fuwa mascots for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n7.  **Work 7 (Bottom Left):** This is a colorful painting depicting a rural courtyard with loofahs hanging from a vine, laundry on a line, and a chicken in a basket. The composition, the use of bright colors to complement ink work, and the idyllic rural subject matter are all characteristic elements of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**'s later work.\n\n8.  **Work 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a monumental landscape painting (山水画). It depicts a dramatic gorge with a fleet of red-sailed boats. The use of heavy, layered ink washes to build up the dark, solid forms of the mountains, contrasted with a small but vibrant touch of red, is the signature style of the modern master **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n\n9.  **Work 9 (Bottom Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The artwork is characterized by its minimalist composition and masterful, economical brushstrokes that brilliantly capture the creature's form, texture, and vitality. This subject and style are quintessentially that of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, who was particularly famous for his lively depictions of shrimp, crabs, and other small animals.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The identification relies on recognizing the distinct and often unique styles of these famous 20th-century and contemporary Chinese artists.\n*   For calligraphy, the specific brushwork is key. Mao Zedong's style is powerful and unrestrained, while Qi Gong's is scholarly and elegant.\n*   For landscape painting, Wu Guanzhong is recognized by his blend of abstraction and Chinese aesthetics, often with bright colors and linear forms, while Li Keran is known for his monumental, layered-ink style.\n*   For figure painting, artists like Tang Yongli, Chen Yifei, and Han Meilin each have highly individual approaches to form, color, and medium.\n*   Iconic subjects, such as the lobster for Qi Baishi, are strong indicators of the artist's identity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the list of authors from left to right, top to bottom is as follows:\n\nTang Yongli, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong\nQi Gong, Chen Yifei, Han Meilin\nWu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Tang Yongli, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Qi Gong, Chen Yifei, Han Meilin, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
