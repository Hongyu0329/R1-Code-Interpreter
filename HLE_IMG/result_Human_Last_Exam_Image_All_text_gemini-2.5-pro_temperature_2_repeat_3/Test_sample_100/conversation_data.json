    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product:**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic compound containing several functional groups. Let's identify the structure and count the atoms.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. Let's determine the formula of this parent core first: It consists of 6 carbon atoms, 7 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom (C6H7NO).\n*   The nitrogen atom is substituted with a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The formula of the PMB group is C8H9O (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3). In attaching this group to the nitrogen, one hydrogen atom from the parent core's -NH- group is replaced.\n*   The double bond is substituted with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group. The formula of the CF3 group is CF3. In attaching this group to the double bond, one hydrogen atom from the parent core's C=CH bond is replaced.\n*   Now, let's calculate the total molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   Start with the parent core C6H7NO.\n    *   Add the PMB group (C8H9O) and remove one H (from N-H): C6H7NO + C8H9O - H = C14H15NO2.\n    *   Add the CF3 group (CF3) and remove one H (from C=CH): C14H15NO2 + CF3 - H = C14H14NO2CF3.\n    *   Expanding this into a standard molecular formula:\n        *   Carbons (C): 14 + 1 (from CF3) = 15\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 14\n        *   Fluorines (F): 3\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 1\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   The first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n*   CAN is a well-known reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB protecting groups from alcohols and amines.\n*   This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n*   The change in molecular formula involves subtracting the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and adding one hydrogen atom.\n*   Starting from C15H14F3NO2:\n    *   Subtract C8H9O: C(15-8)H(14-9)F3N1O(2-1) = C7H5F3NO.\n    *   Add one H: C7H(5+1)F3NO = C7H6F3NO.\n*   Alternatively, net change is (-C8H9O + H) = -C8H8O.\n*   C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   The second reaction involves treating Intermediate 1 with Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It selectively reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C).\n*   Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) carbonyl and the trifluoromethyl group are resistant to these conditions.\n*   The hydrogenation of a C=C bond adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n*   Starting from Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO):\n    *   Add H2: C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n*   Intermediate 2 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   The third reaction involves heating Intermediate 2 with aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 N HCl, 70 °C).\n*   These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or, in this case, a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   The hydrolysis reaction breaks the C-N amide bond and consumes one molecule of water (H2O).\n*   The carbonyl group is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom is converted to an amine (-NH2). In the acidic conditions, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+), but for determining the molecular formula of the neutral compound, we consider it as -NH2.\n*   The reaction effectively adds the elements of water (H2O) to the molecule.\n*   Starting from Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO):\n    *   Add H2O: C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n*   The bicyclic structure of Intermediate 2 opens up to form a substituted cyclopentane amino acid.\n\n**Summary of atom changes:**\n\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (Deprotection): -C8H8O  → Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (Hydrogenation): +H2 → Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (Hydrolysis): +H2O → Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
