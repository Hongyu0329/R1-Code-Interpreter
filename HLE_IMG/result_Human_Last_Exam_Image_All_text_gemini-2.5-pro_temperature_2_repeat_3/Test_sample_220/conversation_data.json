    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the Crystal Structure and Viewing Direction:** The question asks to identify the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   **FCC Structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the 8 corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the 6 faces. The positions can be represented by coordinates (in units of the lattice constant `a`) like (0,0,0) for a corner, and (1/2, 1/2, 0) for a face center. A complete set of basis atoms is at (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1/2,0,1/2), and (0,1/2,1/2). All other atoms can be generated by integer translations from these.\n    *   **[110] Viewing Direction:** This direction corresponds to a face diagonal of the cube, for instance, the diagonal on the base of the cube connecting the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a,a,0). Viewing along this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n2.  **Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    *   To find the projected pattern, we can set up a new coordinate system where one axis is along the viewing direction [110]. The other two axes will span the projection plane. A convenient choice for these two orthogonal axes that are also perpendicular to [110] are the [001] and [1-10] directions.\n    *   When the 3D positions of the FCC atoms are projected onto this plane, they form a periodic 2D pattern.\n    *   A key feature of the FCC lattice is that planes of atoms perpendicular to the [110] direction are stacked in a repeating ABAB... sequence.\n        *   Plane 'A' consists of atoms forming a rectangular grid.\n        *   Plane 'B' also consists of atoms forming an identical rectangular grid, but it is shifted relative to plane 'A'.\n    *   When both layers are projected onto a single plane, the resulting pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   The conventional unit cell for this 2D projected lattice is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom in the exact center of the rectangle.\n    *   The ratio of the side lengths of this rectangle is `a√2 / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Options:** Now we will examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. We must account for possible distortions in the drawings, so the topology of the arrangement is more important than precise scaled measurements from the image.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows six atoms within a rectangular box. Four atoms form a rectangle `(e.g., at (x,z)≈(2, 6.5), (4.5, 6.5), (2, 12.5), (4.5, 12.5))`. The other two atoms `(≈(2,9), (4.5,9))` lie on the vertical edges of this rectangle, not at the center of the rectangle's face. This is sometimes called a side-centered or base-centered pattern, but it is not the body-centered rectangular pattern we expect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms in this image appear irregularly placed. It is difficult to discern a clear, repeating rectangular pattern. The use of different sphere sizes suggests different depths, but the arrangement in each layer and the overall projection does not clearly form a centered rectangle.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This image contains a very distinct group of five atoms that perfectly match the topology of a centered rectangle. There are four atoms forming the corners of a rectangle, and a fifth atom is located precisely in the center of this rectangle. The other atoms shown outside this central group likely belong to adjacent unit cells, illustrating the repeating nature of the lattice. While the aspect ratio of the rectangle in the drawing might not be exactly √2, the topological pattern is correct.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image displays a pattern of atoms on a square grid with an atom in the center of each square. This is a **centered square** pattern. A centered square is the known projection of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction. It is not the expected pattern for an FCC [110] view.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the topological analysis, Image C is the only one that displays the characteristic centered rectangular pattern that results from projecting an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
