    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from a South Italian (Apulian) red-figure vase dating to the 4th century BCE. The scene depicted is a complex mythological narrative. We can identify several figures and elements:\n    *   A chariot drawn by at least one white horse (visible on the left).\n    *   A female figure driving the chariot. She wears a distinctive patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap, an Eastern-style headdress often used in Greek art to denote a \"barbarian\" or foreign origin. She holds the reins and a goad or wand.\n    *   A second figure inside the chariot, next to the driver. This figure is draped in cloth and is depicted in a dynamic, unstable pose, falling backward as if swooning or being thrown from the chariot. This is the figure the question asks about.\n    *   A muscular, nude male figure on the ground, contorted in a pose suggesting death or collapse. His body is positioned in front of the chariot wheel.\n    *   A large white wing is visible above the chariot, belonging to a flying figure.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological context.**\n    The combination of these elements, particularly the sorceress-like figure in the Phrygian cap (a common attribute of the Colchian princess Medea) and the collapsing giant, points strongly to the myth of the Death of Talos. Talos was a giant automaton made of bronze who guarded the island of Crete. During the voyage of the Argonauts, Medea used her magical powers to defeat him, causing him to collapse and die by removing the single pin on his ankle that sealed in his lifeblood (ichor). The figure on the ground is therefore Talos.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the figures in the chariot.**\n    *   The female driver in the Phrygian cap is **Medea**.\n    *   Medea was accompanied on her adventures by the Argonauts. The other figures in the scene would be her fellow Argonauts. On this specific vase (an Apulian hydria in the Princeton University Art Museum, y1986-71), scholars have identified the heroes accompanying her as the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux (Polydeuces). The partial figure on horseback to the far left is likely Castor, which means the figure in the chariot with Medea is his twin brother, **Pollux (Polydeuces)**. The winged figure above is likely one of the Boreads (Zetes or Calais), also Argonauts.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This refers to the figure next to Medea who is falling backward. Based on the identification of the myth, this figure is the Argonaut hero **Pollux (Polydeuces)**. His dramatic pose, \"leaving\" the chariot by swooning, is interpreted as a reaction of shock and horror at the sight of the giant Talos being destroyed by Medea's potent magic.\n\n<<<Pollux (Polydeuces)>>>"
