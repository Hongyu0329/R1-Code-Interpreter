    "Answering this question requires analyzing the chemical stability of the four iridium complexes, as stability is directly correlated with the operational lifetime in a light-emitting device. A shorter lifetime implies faster degradation of the complex.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Variable Components:** All four structures are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺`.\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n    *   The `(N^N)` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Its role is relatively constant across the series.\n    *   The `(C^N)` ligands are cyclometalating ligands of the phenylpyridine type. This is the part that varies between the four complexes. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond formed by this ligand.\n    *   The counterion is hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Different (C^N) Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two** strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. It has **no** substituents on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position (position 2) of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom at the *para*-position (position 4) of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability and Lifetime:**\n    *   The primary degradation pathway for these types of complexes often involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond. The strength of this bond is a key indicator of the complex's stability and, thus, its operational lifetime.\n    *   Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups through the inductive effect.\n    *   By withdrawing electron density from the phenyl ring, the fluorine atoms make the carbon atom that is bonded to the iridium more electrophilic. This increases the covalent character and strength of the Ir-C bond.\n    *   A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more resistant to degradation, leading to a longer lifetime.\n\n4.  **Compare the Complexes Based on Fluorine Substitution:**\n    *   **Complex 2 (no fluorine):** Lacks any stabilizing effect from fluorine atoms. Therefore, it has the weakest Ir-C bond among the four. It is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 1 (two fluorines):** Benefits from the electron-withdrawing effect of two fluorine atoms per ligand. This leads to the strongest Ir-C bond. It is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n    *   **Complexes 3 and 4 (one fluorine):** These have an intermediate level of stabilization. They should be more stable than Complex 2 but less stable than Complex 1.\n\n5.  **Differentiate Between Complex 3 (ortho-F) and Complex 4 (para-F):**\n    *   While both complexes have one fluorine atom, its position is crucial.\n    *   In **Complex 4**, the *para*-fluorine provides a clean, purely electronic stabilization without introducing steric hindrance.\n    *   In **Complex 3**, the *ortho*-fluorine, being very close to the metal coordination site, can introduce steric strain between the fluorine atom and the hydrogen on the adjacent pyridine ring. This steric clash can slightly weaken the overall ligand coordination. Furthermore, the proximity of the C-F bond to the reactive metal center might introduce unique degradation pathways not present in the para-isomer.\n    *   For these reasons, the *ortho*-substituted Complex 3 is generally expected to be less stable than the *para*-substituted Complex 4.\n\n6.  **Final Ranking and Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, we can rank the complexes in order of decreasing stability (and thus decreasing lifetime):\n        **Complex 1 > Complex 4 > Complex 3 > Complex 2**\n    *   The question asks for the complexes that are expected to show **shorter lifetimes**. This corresponds to the least stable complexes in our ranking.\n    *   The two complexes with the shortest expected lifetimes are **Complex 2** and **Complex 3**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer includes both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n<<<H>>>"
