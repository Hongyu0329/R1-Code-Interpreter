    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its century of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Medallion's Features**\nThe object in the image is a circular medallion with a connecting piece at the top, likely for suspension as part of a necklace or for attachment as a brooch. It depicts two figures in relief, shown as busts in profile, facing each other. The style is not strictly classical but shows its influence.\n\n**Step 2: Iconographic Analysis**\nThe most important diagnostic feature is on the figure to the left. A large, curved ram's horn is clearly visible around his ear. In classical and post-classical art, a figure with ram's horns typically represents Zeus-Ammon (Jupiter-Ammon in Roman context) or a ruler portrayed with divine attributes, most famously Alexander the Great, who was declared the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Oracle of Siwa. This motif continued to be used in the Late Roman period.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Artifact and its Context**\nThis particular piece is a well-known artifact among archaeologists. It is a plaster cast of one of the medallions that decorated a large, now lost, gold collar from the **Pietroasa Treasure**. This famous hoard, also known as the \"Hen with the Golden Chicks,\" was discovered in Romania in 1837. The original gold collar was cut up by the finder, and some parts were lost forever. This cast preserves the appearance of the original medallion.\n\n**Step 4: Dating the Pietroasa Treasure**\nThe Pietroasa Treasure is firmly associated with the Goths, a Germanic people who lived north of the Danube in the 4th century. The collection of gold objects shows a mix of influences—Late Roman, Sassanian (Persian), and Germanic—which is characteristic of the elite art of the Migration Period. Based on stylistic comparisons, associated finds, and the historical context of the Gothic kingdoms and their ultimate disruption by the Hunnic invasions around 376 A.D., archaeologists have dated the creation and burial of the Pietroasa Treasure.\n\n**Step 5: Concluding the Century**\nScholarly consensus places the creation of the Pietroasa Treasure in the second half of the **4th century A.D.** The treasure was likely buried for safekeeping around the turn of the century (c. 380-410 A.D.) in the face of the Hunnic threat. Therefore, the medallion itself is ascribed by archaeologists to the 4th century A.D.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to recognize that the image shows a plaster cast, not the original gold item.\n*   The key identifier is the ram's horn, a specific iconographic motif linking to Late Roman traditions.\n*   Connecting the medallion to the specific and well-dated Pietroasa Treasure is crucial.\n*   The dating is based on the archaeological context of the entire hoard, not just this one piece in isolation.\n*   The time frame is the Migration Period, which explains the mix of artistic styles.\n*   While the period of use might extend into the very early 5th century, the period of manufacture is firmly placed in the 4th century.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
