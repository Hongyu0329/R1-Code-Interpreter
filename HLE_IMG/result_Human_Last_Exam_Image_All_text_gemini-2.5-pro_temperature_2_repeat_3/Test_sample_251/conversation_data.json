    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Paper Calibration:**\n    *   The top left corner of the ECG indicates the paper speed is **25 mm/sec**.\n    *   The standard ECG grid has small squares of 1 mm and large squares of 5 mm.\n    *   With a speed of 25 mm/sec, we can calculate the time duration represented by each square:\n        *   Time for 1 small square (1 mm) = 1 sec / 25 mm = **0.04 seconds**.\n        *   Time for 1 large square (5 mm) = 5 mm * (1 sec / 25 mm) = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n2.  **Identify the R-R Interval:**\n    *   The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R waves (the prominent upward spikes in the QRS complex).\n    *   The question asks for the *longest* R-R interval. This requires a visual inspection of the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R waves.\n\n3.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:**\n    *   Scanning the ECG, the rhythm is mostly regular, but there is a very noticeable pause in the fourth row of the tracing, which begins near the timestamp **0:06:08**.\n    *   This pause is visibly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip. This is our area of interest.\n\n4.  **Measure the Longest R-R Interval:**\n    *   We will now measure the distance between the two R wave peaks surrounding this pause by counting the number of grid squares. For accuracy, it is best to count the small squares.\n    *   Let's find the peak of the first R wave just before the long pause. It falls on a vertical grid line.\n    *   Now let's find the peak of the second R wave just after the pause.\n    *   Counting the squares between these two peaks:\n        *   There are exactly **5 full large squares** between the two peaks.\n        *   Let's verify by counting the small squares. Since one large square contains 5 small squares horizontally, 5 large squares equal 5 * 5 = **25 small squares**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:**\n    *   Now, we convert the measurement from grid squares to time in seconds.\n    *   Using the large square measurement: 5 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square = **1.0 second**.\n    *   Using the small square measurement: 25 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = **1.0 second**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe longest R-R interval is the pause located in the fourth row of the strip. The duration of this pause is exactly 5 large squares, which corresponds to 1.0 second.\n\n<<<1.0>>>"
