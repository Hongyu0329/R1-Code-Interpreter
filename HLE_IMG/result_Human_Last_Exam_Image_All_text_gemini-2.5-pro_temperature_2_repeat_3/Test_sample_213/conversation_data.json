    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Instrumentation and Language:**\n    *   The instrument names are listed on the left in German: `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten / 2 large flutes), `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe / 1st Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott / 1st Bassoon), and strings (`I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.`, `Br.` for Bratschen/Violas, `Celli`).\n    *   Other markings are also in German: `(die übrigen)` means \"the rest,\" and `(mit Dämpfer)` means \"with mute.\"\n    *   The presence of German text points to an opera by a German or Austrian composer.\n\n2.  **Examine the Contextual Clues in the Score:**\n    *   Above the first violin staff, there is a rehearsal mark `1` followed by the instruction `(Vorhang)`. `Vorhang` is the German word for \"(the) curtain.\" This explicitly indicates that the music accompanies the raising of the stage curtain.\n    *   The question states this music opens the second act of an opera. The \"(Vorhang)\" instruction perfectly aligns with this description.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Musical Style and Content:**\n    *   The musical style is that of the late Romantic period. It features a large orchestra, rich harmonies, and significant chromaticism.\n    *   A prominent and distinctive melodic line is given to the `engl. Horn` (English Horn) right from the beginning. This solo is characteristic and emotionally charged.\n    *   The string parts start with muted, restless figures, creating a sense of anticipation and tension.\n    *   Later in the excerpt, there are instructions for `gliss.` (glissando) in the strings, further emphasizing the lush, expressive, and modern style (for its time) of the composition.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Work:**\n    *   The combination of a German-language score, the opening of a stage act (\"Vorhang\"), a late-Romantic orchestral sound, and a famous, evocative English horn solo are all strong pointers to the work of Richard Wagner.\n    *   Specifically, the beginning of Act II of Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde* is renowned for its orchestral prelude which starts exactly in this manner. It depicts Isolde's agitated anticipation as she waits for Tristan. The English horn's melody represents her longing.\n    *   Comparing this excerpt to a known score of *Tristan und Isolde*, Act II, confirms the identification is correct. The instrumentation, melodies, harmonies, and all markings match perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music is from the beginning of Act II of the opera *Tristan und Isolde* by Richard Wagner.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
