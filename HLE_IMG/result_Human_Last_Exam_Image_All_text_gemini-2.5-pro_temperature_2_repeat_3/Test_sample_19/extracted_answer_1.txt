1. The music modulates to the key of **B major**. This is established by the `iv – vii°7 – I` cadence within measure 11. The B minor chord at the beginning of measure 12 is an instance of modal mixture, using the tonic chord from the parallel minor for expressive color.
2. The home key is C-sharp minor. In a minor-key sonata, a modulation to the relative major (E major, the III) is expected. B major is the **dominant of E major**. Therefore, the modulation is to the **dominant of the relative major (V/III)**. This is an innovative harmonic choice that prolongs harmonic tension by tonicizing the dominant of the expected key rather than the key itself.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is E minor. It functions as the subdominant (iv) in the new key of B major. Since the key of B major is V/III in the home key of C-sharp minor, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the E minor chord is **iv of V/III**.
