    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Key, Time, and Form:**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   **Starting and Ending Chords:** The piece begins and ends on an F minor chord (notated as F-). This strongly suggests the key is F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** There is a 'C' symbol after the clef and key signature, which stands for \"Common Time,\" or 4/4 time.\n*   **Form:** The structure appears to be a 32-bar AABA form, which is very common in jazz standards. We can see an initial 8-bar section (A), which repeats with first and second endings. This is followed by a different 8-bar section (the Bridge, or B section), and then the initial A section returns for the final 8 bars.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Chord Progression:**\n*   **A Section (Bars 1-8):** The progression starts with | Fm | Eø7 (E-♮b5) | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |. This descending chromatic line from F (in Fm) to E (in Eø7) to E♭ (in E♭-6) to D♭ (in D♭maj7) is a very distinctive and famous harmonic feature.\n*   **B Section (Bridge, Bars 11-18):** The bridge begins with | Dø7 (D-7b5) | G7 |. This is a ii-V progression leading to C minor. It continues to modulate through C7, F7, and a ii-V-I in A♭ major (B♭m7 - E♭7 - A♭), before a turnaround (G - C7) leads back to the home key of F minor. This complex but logical modulation is another identifying characteristic.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Melody:**\n*   **A Section:** The melody in the first four bars outlines the harmony beautifully. It starts on C (the 5th of F minor), then G over the Eø7, F over the E♭-6, and C over the D♭maj7. The melodic contour is descending, mirroring the harmonic descent.\n*   **Bar 5:** The melody over the C7 chord is a chromatic line walking down from C to A (C, B♮, B♭, A), a classic bebop-era way to embellish a dominant chord.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Identification:**\n*   The combination of these elements—the F minor key, the AABA form, the signature chromatic descending chord progression in the A section, and the specific melodic shape—unmistakably identifies this tune.\n*   This song is the well-known jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n*   The music for \"Yesterdays\" was composed by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, for the 1933 musical *Roberta*.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
