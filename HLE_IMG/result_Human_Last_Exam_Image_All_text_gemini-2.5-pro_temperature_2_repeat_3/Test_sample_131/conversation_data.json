    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the functional groups and overall structure type:** The molecule is a complex, polycyclic organic compound. The presence of nitrogen atoms within the ring system indicates it is a heterocyclic compound. The combination of its natural origin (implied by the request to name an \"alkaloid\") and its structure identifies it as an alkaloid. Specifically, we can see two nitrogen atoms incorporated into the framework and a carbonyl group (C=O). The carbonyl group is adjacent to one of the nitrogen atoms, forming a cyclic amide, which is called a lactam.\n    2.  **Analyze the ring system:** The structure is tetracyclic, meaning it is composed of four fused rings. All four rings are six-membered. Such a skeleton built from fused piperidine rings is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids.\n    3.  **Identify the parent skeleton:** The core skeleton, if the carbonyl group were reduced to a CH₂, is known as sparteine. Sparteine is a well-known tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid with the formula C₁₅H₂₆N₂. The compound in the question is an oxo-derivative of sparteine.\n    4.  **Identify the specific compound:** The presence of the lactam at this particular position on the sparteine framework defines the compound. This specific alkaloid is called **lupanine**. The formula for lupanine is C₁₅H₂₄N₂O. The structure shown, including the specific stereochemistry (indicated by wedged and dashed bonds at the chiral centers), corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer of lupanine, which is (+)-lupanine.\n    5.  **List careful points for identification:**\n        *   Recognize the polycyclic system with nitrogen atoms (alkaloid characteristic).\n        *   Count the rings: four fused rings (tetracyclic).\n        *   Identify the lactam functional group (-N-C=O in a ring).\n        *   Relate the tetracyclic diamine skeleton to sparteine, a common reference point for lupin alkaloids.\n        *   The specific placement of the carbonyl oxygen makes it an oxo-sparteine, and this particular isomer is known as lupanine. The stereochemistry shown is critical and corresponds to the compound commonly referred to as lupanine.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    Based on the analysis of the functional groups and the specific tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton with a lactam group, the compound is identified as the lupin alkaloid lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
