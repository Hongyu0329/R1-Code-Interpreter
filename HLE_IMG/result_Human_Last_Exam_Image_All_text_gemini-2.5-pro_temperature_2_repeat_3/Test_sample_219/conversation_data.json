    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph and identify synchronized bursts**\nThe graph is a raster plot showing the firing activity of 128 electrodes over a period of 50 seconds.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time in seconds (s).\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number.\n*   Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing event (a spike).\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons (electrodes) fire at approximately the same time. These are visible as dense vertical columns of dots on the plot.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the timestamps of each synchronized burst**\nWe will estimate the time for each burst by identifying the center of the dense vertical column of firing activity.\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The second burst is located between 10 s and 20 s, centered at approximately **t₂ = 14 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered between 20 s and 30 s, at approximately **t₃ = 26 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** The fourth, very prominent burst, is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The fifth burst is centered just before the 50 s mark, at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between consecutive bursts. We calculate the time difference between the timestamps identified in the previous step. There are four intervals between the five bursts.\n*   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and 2):** t₂ - t₁ = 14 s - 2 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and 3):** t₃ - t₂ = 26 s - 14 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and 4):** t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 26 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI₄ (between Burst 4 and 5):** t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals (4).\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 12 s + 12 s + 10 s + 12 s = **46 s**\n*   **Average IBI:** 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to two significant figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.5. The digits 1 and 1 are the first two significant figures. The third digit is 5.\n*   Following standard rounding rules, if the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, we round up the preceding digit.\n*   Rounding 11.5 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The timestamps are estimated visually. While there may be slight variations in estimation, the calculated average is robust. For example, estimating the bursts at 1.5 s, 13.5 s, 25.5 s, 36.0 s, and 48.0 s results in an average IBI of 11.625 s, which also rounds to 12 s.\n*   We focus on the five most prominent and clearly synchronized network bursts. Ignoring smaller, less synchronized events is a standard approach in this type of analysis.\n*   Adhering to the specified number of significant figures (two) is crucial for the final answer.\n\nThe final calculated average inter-burst interval, rounded to two significant figures, is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
