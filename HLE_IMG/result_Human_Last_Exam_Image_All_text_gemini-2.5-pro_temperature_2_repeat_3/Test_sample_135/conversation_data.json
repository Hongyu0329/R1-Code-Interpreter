    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's features:**\n    *   The image displays a relief sculpture, which is a sculptural technique where the sculpted elements remain attached to a solid background of the same material.\n    *   The relief is circular, a format known as a *tondo* or medallion. It is enclosed within a highly decorative, square frame.\n    *   The style of the figures, with their classical poses, flowing drapery, and idealized features, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century.\n    *   The subject matter is religious. It shows a priest administering a wafer (the Host) to a group of kneeling individuals, including a child. This depicts the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist or Holy Communion.\n    *   At the bottom of the circular relief, there is a small banner or cartouche with an inscription.\n\n2.  **Examine the inscription:**\n    *   The crops, particularly the third and fourth, provide a clearer view of the text. It reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be translated from a mix of Latin and Old French/Italian as \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which explicitly confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artwork and artist:**\n    *   The combination of subject (Seven Sacraments, specifically the Eucharist), medium (relief sculpture, likely glazed terracotta or marble), and style (Florentine Renaissance) strongly points towards the work of **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400 â€“ 1482) or his workshop. Luca della Robbia was renowned for his glazed terracotta reliefs.\n    *   A search for \"Luca della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar relief\" or \"Sacramenti de l'autel\" leads to the identification of this piece. This tondo is a detail from the **Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament** (in Italian, *Tabernacolo del Sacramento* or *Tabernacolo di Peretola*).\n    *   This tabernacle was commissioned in 1441 and created by Luca della Robbia. It features reliefs depicting the Seven Sacraments. The one shown in the image is specifically the relief representing the **Eucharist**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The artwork is the *Eucharist* relief from the *Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament*. The author of this masterpiece of the early Italian Renaissance is the Florentine sculptor Luca della Robbia.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   Recognize the medium as relief sculpture and the format as a tondo.\n*   Correctly identify the style as Italian Renaissance.\n*   Decipher the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" and understand its meaning.\n*   Connect the style and subject matter to the known works of prominent Florentine sculptors of the era.\n*   Confirm the specific work as a detail from a larger altarpiece (the Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament) to accurately attribute it to its creator.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
