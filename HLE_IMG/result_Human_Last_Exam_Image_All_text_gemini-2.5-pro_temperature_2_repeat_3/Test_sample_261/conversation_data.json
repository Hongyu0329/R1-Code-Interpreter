    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the cover fragment.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Image Examination:** The image fragment displays a partial illustration from a book cover. We can clearly see two main elements:\n    *   On the left, there is a creature that is white, glowing, and has a blurred, ghost-like appearance suggesting rapid motion. It has the distinct shape of a horse with a single horn on its head, identifying it as a unicorn. The horn appears to be golden or emitting a yellow light. The background behind the unicorn is dark, possibly representing a forest at night.\n    *   On the right, there is a portion of a stone pillar or the edge of an archway. It is detailed and colored in warm tones of yellow, orange, and brown, suggesting ornate architecture.\n\n2.  **Identifying Key Clues and Art Style:**\n    *   **The Unicorn:** Unicorns are a common motif in fantasy literature. The specific depiction here—ethereal and swift—is a strong clue.\n    *   **The Architecture:** The combination of a magical creature like a unicorn with classical or ornate architecture points towards a high-fantasy setting.\n    *   **The Art Style:** The illustration style is painterly and realistic yet fantastical. This specific style is strongly associated with the artist Mary GrandPré, who is famous for illustrating the covers of the original American editions of the *Harry Potter* series.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues to a Specific Book:**\n    *   The combination of a unicorn, a magical setting, and the art style of Mary GrandPré strongly suggests the book is part of the *Harry Potter* series.\n    *   Unicorns play a significant role in the first book of the series, where one is found slain in the Forbidden Forest. This makes the first book a prime suspect.\n    *   Let's examine the cover of the first book, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (known as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* in the UK). The original US cover by Mary GrandPré depicts Harry Potter on his broomstick flying through a series of archways.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   Upon close inspection of the US cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, we can find the exact scene from the fragment.\n    *   On the left side of the cover, through one of the arches, a white unicorn is depicted running.\n    *   The unicorn in the cover matches the one in the fragment in every detail: its glowing white form, the motion blur, the golden horn, and its position against a dark background.\n    *   The ornate pillar from the fragment is the left side of the archway through which the unicorn is viewed on the full cover. The color and design match perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The fragment is a zoomed-in section from the original US cover art for the book *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
