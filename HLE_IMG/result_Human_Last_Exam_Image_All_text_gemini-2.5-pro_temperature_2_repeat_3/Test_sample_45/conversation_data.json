    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a pattern looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation around a specific point. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which typically refers to the highest order of symmetry present in the entire repeating pattern.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of the Tiling:** The pattern is constructed from several repeating geometric shapes (tiles):\n    *   **Blue Tiles:** These are regular hexagons (6-sided).\n    *   **Beige Tiles:** These are squares (4-sided).\n    *   **Orange Tiles:** These are rhombi (4-sided parallelograms with equal side lengths).\n\n3.  **Search for Centers of Rotation:** A center of rotation is a point around which the pattern can be rotated to map perfectly onto itself. We can test potential centers by looking at points of high symmetry within the pattern, such as the center of a regular polygon.\n\n4.  **Test the Center of a Blue Hexagon:**\n    *   Select the center point of any of the blue hexagons. A regular hexagon by itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°).\n    *   Now, let's consider the entire tiling. If we rotate the whole pattern by 60° (which is 360° / 6) around the center of a blue hexagon, we need to check if the tiling looks unchanged.\n    *   Upon a 60° rotation, the central blue hexagon rotates into itself.\n    *   Each of the six beige squares surrounding it moves into the exact position previously occupied by the next beige square.\n    *   Similarly, each of the six orange rhombi that touch the vertices of the squares moves into the position of its neighbor.\n    *   This rotation also maps the surrounding blue hexagons onto each other.\n    *   Because the entire pattern maps onto itself after a 60° rotation, the center of each blue hexagon is a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Check for Other Symmetry Centers (for completeness):**\n    *   **3-fold symmetry:** If you look at a point located in the center of the region formed by three squares and three rhombi, situated between three hexagons, you will find a center of 3-fold rotation (120°).\n    *   **2-fold symmetry:** If you look at the midpoint of the line segment connecting two adjacent beige squares, you will find a center of 2-fold rotation (180°).\n\n6.  **Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry:** The tiling contains centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, we identify the highest order present. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
