    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musical Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together).\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which points to the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The piece strongly centers around C minor chords and its dominant, G major, confirming the key as C minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, also known as common time.\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking of ♩ = 80 is given, which is a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Structural and Stylistic Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2 (Introduction):** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano) with a simple, melancholic melody in the right hand (G-C-E♭-D-C-G) over sparse chords in the left hand (G octave and a C minor chord). This sets a somber and contemplative mood.\n    *   **Measure 3 (Sudden Shift):** There is an abrupt and dramatic change in character. The dynamic marking changes to *f* (forte - loud). The texture becomes thick and virtuosic.\n    *   **Right Hand (from measure 3):** The right hand plays rapid, continuous 16th-note arpeggios and scale passages. This requires considerable technical skill. It starts with a rising G major arpeggio.\n    *   **Left Hand (from measure 3):** The left hand plays a powerful accompaniment pattern of a low bass note on the beat followed by repeated, pulsing chords (e.g., G octave followed by G major chords). This creates a driving, powerful, and stormy feel.\n    *   **Harmony:** The harmony is very dramatic and romantic, using powerful chord progressions, chromaticism, and diminished seventh chords (e.g., the D♯ diminished 7th arpeggio in the right hand of measure 4).\n    *   **Climax (Measures 11-12):** The passage builds towards a climax, culminating in a written-out trill-like figure followed by a dramatic downward chromatic glissando (`gliss.`) in measure 12. This is a highly virtuosic and expressive device.\n\n3.  **Process of Elimination and Identification:**\n    *   The stormy character in C minor might suggest famous classical pieces like Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata (No. 8) or Chopin's \"Revolutionary\" Étude (Op. 10, No. 12).\n    *   However, the specific notes and musical figures do not match either of these works. The \"Pathétique\" has different themes, and in the \"Revolutionary\" Étude, the rapid 16th-note passages are primarily in the left hand, not the right.\n    *   The combination of the specific opening melody, the virtuosic right-hand arpeggios, and the powerful left-hand chords is very distinctive. The style, while resembling late Romantic piano music, is also characteristic of modern compositions found in media like video games.\n    *   The crucial clue is the opening melodic theme (G-C-E♭-D...). This melody is the main theme of a well-known piece from the music rhythm game *Deemo*.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the distinct melodic theme, the virtuosic piano writing, and the overall structure, the piece is \"The Day You Vanished with the Stars\". Its original Japanese title is \"星の消えた日に\" (Hoshi no Kieta Hi ni). The composer is Isao Tsukamoto, who goes by the artist name \"xi\".\n\n<<<The Day You Vanished with the Stars (Hoshi no Kieta Hi ni) by xi>>>"
