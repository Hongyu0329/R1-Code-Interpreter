    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image displays an emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is created when a chemical element is energized (for example, by heating it or passing an electric current through it), causing it to emit light. The light does not form a continuous rainbow but rather a series of discrete, bright lines of specific colors. Each element has a unique pattern of these spectral lines, which acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The spectrum in the image shows colors ranging from red on the right to blue and violet on the left, corresponding to the visible light spectrum from longer to shorter wavelengths.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we must carefully observe the pattern of the lines: their colors (wavelengths), their positions relative to each other, and their relative brightness.\n\n*   **Red Region (right side):** There are several lines in the red portion of the spectrum.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very distinct and bright line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n*   **Green Region:** There are multiple lines in the green and cyan (blue-green) region. At least one of these lines is very prominent.\n*   **Blue and Violet Region (left side):** There are numerous lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n\nThe overall spectrum is quite complex, with many lines, indicating it's not the simplest element, hydrogen, which has only four prominent lines in its visible spectrum (the Balmer series).\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Spectra of Common Elements**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen consists of a red line (H-alpha), a cyan line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is much richer and more complex than that of hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium is famous for producing a very strong, dominant pair of yellow lines (a doublet) at about 589 nm. While the given spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The sodium spectrum is not this complex.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** Mercury has prominent lines in the violet, blue, green, and yellow-orange regions. However, the exact pattern and relative intensities are different. Mercury's most prominent line is typically a very bright green one.\n*   **Helium (He):** Let's examine the known prominent spectral lines for Helium in the visible range:\n    *   A strong red line (at 667.8 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (at 587.6 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (at 501.6 nm)\n    *   A cyan line (at 492.2 nm)\n    *   A blue-violet line (at 471.3 nm)\n    *   A bright violet line (at 447.1 nm)\n\n**Step 4: Match the Observed Spectrum with a Known Spectrum**\nComparing the features noted in Step 2 with the known lines of Helium shows an excellent match. The spectrum in the image contains:\n*   Red lines on the right.\n*   A standout bright yellow line.\n*   Prominent green/cyan lines.\n*   Several blue and violet lines to the left.\n\nThis pattern precisely matches the well-documented emission spectrum of Helium. The image provided is a standard graphical representation of Helium's visible light emission spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the unique pattern of colored lines, including a strong yellow line, prominent green and cyan lines, and multiple red and blue lines, the spectrum is identified as that of the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
