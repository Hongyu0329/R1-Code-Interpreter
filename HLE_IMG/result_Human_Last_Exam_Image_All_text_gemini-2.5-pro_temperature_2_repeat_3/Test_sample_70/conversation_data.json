    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   The starting material is *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene. It consists of an eight-membered ring fused to a four-membered ring (a cyclobutene). The fusion is *cis*, as indicated by the stereochemistry of the two bridgehead hydrogens (both shown with wedge bonds, meaning they are on the same side of the ring system).\n    *   The product is *trans*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene. This molecule consists of two fused six-membered rings. The fusion is *trans*, as indicated by the stereochemistry of the hydrogens at the ring junction (one shown with a wedge bond, one with a dash bond, meaning they are on opposite sides).\n    *   The reaction is promoted by heat (Δ), which is characteristic of many pericyclic reactions.\n    *   The overall transformation involves a change in the ring structure, from a [6.2.0] bicyclic system to a [4.4.0] bicyclic system. This significant change in connectivity suggests a sequence of rearrangements, rather than a single step.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction:**\n    *   The starting material contains a strained four-membered ring, a cyclobutene. Cyclobutene rings are known to undergo electrocyclic ring opening upon heating to form a 1,3-butadiene system.\n    *   This is an electrocyclic reaction involving 4 π-electrons (one π-bond from the double bond and two electrons from the σ-bond that breaks).\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, a 4n π-electron system (where n=1, so 4π) undergoes a **conrotatory** ring opening.\n    *   In this specific case, the C1-C8 sigma bond of the bicyclic system breaks, and the π-bond at C9-C10 rearranges. This opens up the four-membered ring and expands the eight-membered ring into a ten-membered ring, which is an isomer of [10]annulene (cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene).\n    *   Therefore, the first pericyclic reaction is a **4π electrocyclic ring opening**. The conrotatory nature of this opening, starting from a *cis*-fused ring, dictates the specific stereoisomer of the [10]annulene intermediate formed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction:**\n    *   The intermediate, a cyclodecapentaene, is typically unstable and can undergo further pericyclic reactions. The transformation from this 10-membered ring to the final product, a fused 6,6-ring system (*trans*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene), involves the formation of a new sigma bond.\n    *   This new sigma bond is formed by cyclizing a 1,3,5-hexatriene portion within the 10-membered ring.\n    *   The cyclization of a 1,3,5-hexatriene to a 1,3-cyclohexadiene is an electrocyclic reaction involving 6 π-electrons.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, a (4n+2) π-electron system (where n=1, so 6π) undergoes a **disrotatory** ring closure.\n    *   Therefore, the second pericyclic reaction is a **6π electrocyclic ring closure**. The disrotatory nature of this step, starting from the specific [10]annulene isomer formed in step 1, leads to the observed *trans* stereochemistry in the final product.\n\n*   **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   Recognize that the transformation is not a single reaction but a sequence of two reactions.\n    *   Identify the reacting parts of the molecule in each step: the cyclobutene ring in the first step and a hexatriene segment of the intermediate in the second step.\n    *   Apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal electrocyclic reactions to determine the reaction type (electrocyclic) and mechanism (conrotatory for 4π systems, disrotatory for 6π systems).\n    *   Distinguish between ring opening (first step) and ring closure (second step).\n    *   Note the number of π-electrons involved in each pericyclic process (4π and 6π, respectively).\n    *   The change in stereochemistry from *cis* in the reactant to *trans* in the product is a key clue that is explained by the combination of conrotatory and disrotatory processes.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  A **4π electrocyclic ring opening** of the cyclobutene part of the starting material.\n2.  A **6π electrocyclic ring closure** of a hexatriene subunit within the resulting cyclodecapentaene intermediate.\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclic ring opening followed by a 6π electrocyclic ring closure."
