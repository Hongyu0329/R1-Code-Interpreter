    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows a plant with dark green, oblong-to-lanceolate leaves. The most striking characteristic is the prominent, reticulated (net-like) pattern of creamy-white or light green veins covering the entire surface of the leaves. The leaves are arranged around the stem, appearing somewhat whorled or clustered at the terminal ends. The overall appearance is that of an evergreen shrub.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant:** Based on the unique net-veined pattern, the plant can be identified as *Pittosporum daphniphylloides var. reticulatum*. The species name *daphniphylloides* indicates a resemblance to *Daphniphyllum*, and the variety name *reticulatum* specifically refers to its netted venation. While other plants, like some species of *Helwingia*, have similar patterns, the leaf shape, texture, and growth habit in the image are most consistent with this particular *Pittosporum*.\n\n3.  **Determine the plant's origin:** The question asks for the island to which this plant was endemic. \"Endemic\" means a species or variety is native to a single defined geographic location, such as an island, and is found nowhere else in the wild.\n\n4.  **Research the native range:** Researching the native habitat of *Pittosporum daphniphylloides var. reticulatum* reveals that while the broader species (*Pittosporum daphniphylloides*) is found in parts of mainland China, the specific variety *reticulatum*, known for this ornamental net-veining, is native to the island of Taiwan. It is a well-known example of flora from that region.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The island to which *Pittosporum daphniphylloides var. reticulatum* is endemic is Taiwan.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
