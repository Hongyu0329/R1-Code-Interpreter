    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The key signature at the beginning of the staves shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of E-flat major or C minor. The \"Pathétique\" sonata's first movement is in C minor.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The measure numbers are provided in the score. Measure 30 is the second measure on the second system of the page, which is circled in the provided image.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:** The measure is composed of a rapid ascending passage. We must analyze the harmony beat by beat.\n    *   **Beat 1:** The left hand plays a C octave. The right hand plays an arpeggio of E-natural, G, B-natural, and D. Together, the notes are C-E♮-G-B♮-D, which form a C major 9th chord (Cmaj9).\n    *   **Beat 2:** The left hand plays a D octave. The right hand plays an arpeggio of F-sharp, A, C-natural, and E-natural. Together, these notes (D-F♯-A-C♮-E♮) form a D dominant 9th chord (D9).\n    *   **Beat 3:** The left hand plays an E octave. The right hand plays an arpeggio of G-sharp, B-natural, D, and F-sharp. These notes (E-G♯-B-D-F♯) form an altered E dominant 7th chord (E7). The G#dim7 arpeggio (G#-B-D-F) is commonly associated with the dominant function of E7.\n    *   **Beat 4:** The left hand plays an F octave. The right hand plays an arpeggio of A, C-natural, E-natural, and G. Together, these notes (F-A-C-E-G) form an F major 9th chord (Fmaj9).\n\n4.  **Determine the Harmonic Function in C minor:** The measure contains a sequence of four distinct chords. To assign a single Roman numeral, we must understand the measure's overall function within the musical context. This passage is part of the transition section, which builds tension to prepare for a new thematic area, typically by strongly establishing the new key's dominant. In this movement, the primary goal is to arrive at the dominant chord of C minor, which is G major (V).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Roman Numerals of the Chords:**\n    *   **Beat 2 (D9 chord):** The dominant of C minor is G (the V chord). The D9 chord is the dominant of G. Therefore, it functions as the \"dominant of the dominant.\" In Roman numeral analysis, this is called a secondary dominant (or applied dominant) and is written as **V9/V**. This is a very powerful harmonic device used to tonicize the dominant. The F# and C-natural are chromatic alterations necessary to form this chord in the key of C minor.\n    *   **Beat 1 (Cmaj9 chord):** This chord precedes the V9/V. In the key of the dominant (G major), C major is the subdominant (IV) chord. Therefore, the Cmaj9 chord functions as the \"subdominant of the dominant,\" notated as **IVmaj9/V**. A IV-V progression is a fundamental harmonic motion, and here it is being applied to the dominant.\n    *   **Beats 3 & 4:** These chords (E7alt and Fmaj9) continue the rising sequential pattern, moving to V7/vi (dominant of the submediant) and a chromatic IV chord.\n\n6.  **Select the Most Representative Roman Numeral:** The question asks for a single Roman numeral for the entire measure. When a measure contains a clear functional progression, analysts often choose the numeral that best represents the passage's primary goal. The entire measure is dedicated to dominant preparation. The progression from IV/V to V/V in the first half of the bar is the core of this preparation. The V/V chord is the most direct and potent chord that drives the harmony towards the upcoming V chord (G major). Therefore, **V/V** is the most accurate and functionally significant label for this measure.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A single measure can contain multiple chords, especially in fast passages.\n*   Roman numeral analysis is not just about identifying notes but understanding their function within the key.\n*   Secondary dominants (like V/V) are crucial concepts in tonal music and are a common way to add color and drive towards harmonic goals.\n*   While the measure starts with a Cmaj9 chord (IV/V), the resolution to the D9 chord (V/V) within the same measure makes V/V the climactic and defining harmony of this specific dominant-preparing gesture.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Key: C minor\n- Goal of the passage: Prepare the dominant (V), which is G major.\n- Chord that functions as the dominant of G is D major (D7, D9, etc.).\n- This is called the dominant of the dominant, or V/V.\n- The D9 chord on beat 2 is a perfect example of V9/V.\n- This is the most important functional event in the measure.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral is V/V.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
