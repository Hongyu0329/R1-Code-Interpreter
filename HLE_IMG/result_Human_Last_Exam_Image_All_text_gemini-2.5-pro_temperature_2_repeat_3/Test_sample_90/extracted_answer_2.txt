            (pyrrolizine fused ring system)
```
[A's structure is a dihydropyrrolizine with a methyl group at C7, a methyl carboxylate group at C6, and the amidine-containing substituent on the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolizine core.]

**Product B:** A tricyclic lactam derivative formed from a [4+2] cycloaddition followed by elimination of methanol. A plausible structure is a fused pyrrolo-azepino-indolone skeleton, containing a cis-double bond from the alkyne precursor.

      (Tricyclic lactam system)
```
[B's structure is a complex tricyclic lactam. The core features are three fused rings and a cis-disubstituted C=C double bond.]

**Product C:** A mixed anhydride, specifically acetic (1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl) anhydride.
```

   //     //
(SM core)-C-O-C-CH3
```
[C's structure is the starting material where the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted to a mixed anhydride with acetic acid (-CO-O-CO-CH3).]
