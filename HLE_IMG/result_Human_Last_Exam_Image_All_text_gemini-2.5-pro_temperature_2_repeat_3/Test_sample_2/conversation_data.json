    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Structure\nThe provided code is for a recursive function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its execution flow when `n > 1`:\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first calls itself to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements, i.e., `a[0...n-2]`.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, the largest of these is at `a[n-2]`. This line compares the last element of the original array, `a[n-1]`, with the largest element of the sorted subarray.\n3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition in step 2 is true, it means `a[n-1]` needs to be moved into the sorted subarray. The swap operation is a first step towards this. For example, if the array was `[3, 5, 2]`, after `sort(a, 2)`, it becomes `[3, 5, 2]`. The `if` condition `2 < 5` is true, so we swap `a[2]` and `a[1]` to get `[3, 2, 5]`.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a critical step. After the swap in the previous step, the prefix `a[0...n-2]` might no longer be sorted (in our example, it's now `[3, 2]`). This second recursive call is made to re-sort the prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, `O(1)`. So, `T(1) = c_1` for some constant `c_1`.\n\n*   **Recursive Step (n > 1):** The function performs:\n    *   One recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   A comparison and possibly a swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)` or `c_2`.\n    *   In the worst case, the `if` condition is true, and a second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is made, which also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nTo find the worst-case time complexity, we assume the `if` condition is always met, leading to the second recursive call. This gives us the following recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c_2`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\nWe have the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = c_1`. We can solve this by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n - 2) + c] + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2^2 * [2 * T(n - 3) + c] + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is a geometric series which equals `(2^k - 1)/(2-1) = 2^k - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\nWe expand until we hit the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c_1 + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (c_1 + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Time Complexity\nThe time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored, so the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points & Final Check\n*   **Worst-Case Scenario:** Does a worst case exist that always triggers the second call? Yes. An array sorted in reverse order (e.g., `[4, 3, 2, 1]`) will cause the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition to be true at every level of the main recursion, ensuring the `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` behavior.\n*   **Termination:** The recursive call is on `n-1`. Since `n` decreases by 1 in each step of recursion, it will eventually reach the base case `n <= 1`. Therefore, the algorithm always terminates.\n*   **Comparison with standard algorithms:** This recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)` is similar to that for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which is famously known to have an exponential `O(2^n)` complexity. It's drastically different from efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort (`T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) -> O(n log n)`) or even inefficient ones like Bubble Sort (`O(n^2)`).\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is exponential.\n\nFinal Answer Choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
