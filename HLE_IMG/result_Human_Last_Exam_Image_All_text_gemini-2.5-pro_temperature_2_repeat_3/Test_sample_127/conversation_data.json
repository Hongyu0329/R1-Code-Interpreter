    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) in the given cation can rotate freely around the single bond connecting them to the main ligand framework. Free rotation implies that there is no significant steric hindrance from neighboring groups.\n\n2.  **Principle of Rotational Hindrance:** The rotation of a group around a single bond is considered \"hindered\" or \"restricted\" if there are bulky groups close enough to clash with it as it rotates. For a phenyl ring substituent, hindrance is typically greatest when there are other bulky groups on the atoms *ortho* (adjacent) to the point of attachment.\n\n3.  **Analyze Ring H:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of ring A.\n    *   The adjacent carbon on ring A, C3, is attached to ring B.\n    *   Because ring B is a bulky group positioned *ortho* to ring H, the ortho hydrogens of ring H would clash with ring B upon rotation.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring **H** is sterically hindered.\n\n4.  **Analyze Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to carbon C2 of ring C.\n    *   The adjacent carbon on ring C, C3, is attached to ring D.\n    *   Similar to ring H, ring G is positioned *ortho* to the bulky ring D.\n    *   The drawing also visually depicts ring G tucked into the space between ring C and ring D.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring **G** is sterically hindered.\n\n5.  **Analyze Rings K and L:**\n    *   The exact attachment point of rings K and L is not perfectly clear, but they are shown as part of a substituent located in the very center of the complex, near the iridium (Ir) metal center and seemingly attached to C5 of ring A.\n    *   This position (C5) is *ortho* to the carbon C6, which is involved in bonding to the very large Iridium atom and its associated ligands.\n    *   This is an extremely crowded region of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of rings **K** and **L** would be severely hindered.\n\n6.  **Analyze Ring J:**\n    *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of ring C.\n    *   The neighboring carbons on ring C are C3 and C5. C3 is attached to ring D, while C5 appears to be unsubstituted (only bonded to a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Although ring J is technically *ortho* to the bulky group on C3 (ring D), it is visually depicted on the periphery of the molecule, sticking out into the solution rather than being crowded between other parts of the complex.\n    *   Compared to G and H, which are both wedged between two rings of their respective backbones, and K/L, which are near the metallic center, J is in the most sterically unencumbered position. It is reasonable to conclude that it is the most likely ring to exhibit free or relatively free rotation. Problems of this type often use visual depiction to guide the interpretation of relative steric environments.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, rings G, H, K, and L are all significantly restricted in their rotation. Ring J is located in the least crowded environment and is the only ring that can be considered to rotate freely.\n\n8.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The conclusion that only ring J can rotate freely corresponds to answer choice L.\n\n<<<L>>>"
