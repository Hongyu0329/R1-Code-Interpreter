    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in formal suits on a stage, suggesting an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   The recipient of the award is a man with a beard and dark hair. A reverse image search or a search for major award ceremonies on that date identifies the event as the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place in Las Vegas on June 19, 2019 (the date in the clue is very close).\n*   The person receiving the award is identified as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   On that night, Kucherov had a remarkable achievement, winning three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   In sports, achieving three significant feats is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\". Therefore, Nikita Kucherov accomplished a \"hat trick\" of awards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical industrial process. Mercury salts, specifically mercury(II) nitrate, were once widely used in the production of felt for hats.\n*   The process, called \"carroting,\" involved treating animal fur with mercury solution to make the fibers matte together more easily.\n*   The workers in this trade, known as **hatters**, were frequently exposed to mercury vapors. This exposure led to a severe neurological disorder with symptoms like tremors, confusion, and emotional instability, which gave rise to the idiom \"mad as a hatter\".\n*   Due to the discovery of mercury's high toxicity, this process has been abandoned.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a single term (\"X Y\") that connects Nikita Kucherov's \"hat trick\" with the mercury-using hat makers.\n*   The first clue describes a person who achieved a \"hat trick\".\n*   The second clue describes the profession of a \"hatter\".\n*   The puzzle creates a link through a pun: a person who performs a \"hat trick\" can be metaphorically called a \"hatter\".\n*   Therefore, \"X Y\" is **Hatter**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the solution.**\n*   Does \"Hatter\" fit the first clue? \"Hatter is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" Yes, the person pictured (Nikita Kucherov) is the metaphorical \"hatter\" due to his hat trick of awards.\n*   Does \"Hatter\" fit the second clue? \"Another Hatter has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" Yes, the historical profession of a hatter using mercury is now obsolete.\n*   The term \"Hatter\" successfully links both distinct clues.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
