    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to determine which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, J, L, K, and H, can rotate freely around the single bond connecting them to the main molecular framework.\n\n2.  **Understand the Concept of Free Rotation:** \"Free rotation\" refers to the ability of a chemical group to turn or rotate around a single bond with a low energy barrier. In solution at room temperature, rotations with barriers below approximately 15-20 kcal/mol are typically considered fast or \"free\". The primary factor that prevents free rotation is steric hindrance, which occurs when bulky groups are positioned close to each other, causing repulsive interactions as one group tries to rotate past the other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir) in a cationic complex, likely with an octahedral coordination geometry.\n    *   There are three main ligands attached to the Iridium.\n        *   Two identical cyclometalating ligands, which are highly substituted phenylpyridines. The first consists of phenyl ring A and pyridyl ring B. The second consists of phenyl ring C and pyridyl ring D. In each, the phenyl ring is bonded to Ir via a carbon atom (C6) and the pyridine ring is bonded via its nitrogen atom.\n        *   One bipyridine ligand, consisting of pyridyl rings E and F, both bonded to Ir through their nitrogen atoms.\n    *   The phenyl rings in question (G, H, J, K, L) are substituents on these main ligands. We need to identify their attachment points and analyze their local steric environment.\n\n4.  **Examine Each Phenyl Ring for Rotational Freedom:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A. To rotate, the ortho-hydrogens of ring H must pass by the groups attached to the adjacent positions on ring A, which are C3 and C5.\n        *   At C3 of ring A is the bulky pyridyl ring B.\n        *   At C5 of ring A is the bulky phenyl ring K.\n        *   Ring H is \"sandwiched\" between two large groups. This creates severe steric hindrance, which will prevent free rotation. Ring H is sterically locked.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C. This environment is chemically identical to that of ring H.\n        *   At C3 of ring C is the bulky pyridyl ring D.\n        *   At C5 of ring C is the bulky phenyl ring L.\n        *   Similar to ring H, ring J is sterically locked between two large groups and cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring A. To rotate, its ortho-hydrogens must pass the groups at C4 and C6 of ring A.\n        *   At C4 of ring A is the bulky phenyl ring H.\n        *   Position C6 of ring A is the site of cyclometalation, meaning it is bonded directly to the large Iridium atom and is part of the rigid coordination sphere.\n        *   Ring K is flanked by the bulky phenyl ring H on one side and the congested coordination environment at C6 on the other. This severe steric hindrance will prevent free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring C. This environment is chemically identical to that of ring K.\n        *   At C4 of ring C is the bulky phenyl ring J.\n        *   Position C6 of ring C is the cyclometalated carbon bonded to Iridium.\n        *   Similar to ring K, ring L is sterically locked and cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Careful inspection of the drawing shows that ring G is attached to position C6 of one of the pyridyl rings. The line points most clearly to C6 of ring F (part of the bipyridine ligand), although attaching it to C6 of ring D would lead to the same conclusion. Let's assume it's attached to C6 of ring F. To rotate, its ortho-hydrogens must pass the groups at the adjacent positions on ring F.\n        *   One adjacent position is the nitrogen atom of ring F, which is coordinated to the Iridium. This represents a point of steric bulk.\n        *   The other adjacent position is C5 of ring F. This position is unsubstituted, meaning it only has a small hydrogen atom attached.\n        *   Unlike rings H, J, K, and L which are sterically blocked on *both* sides by large groups, ring G is only significantly blocked on one side (by the ring nitrogen). The other side (C5-H) presents a much smaller steric barrier. The rotation of a phenyl group past a hydrogen atom (as in biphenyl) is generally considered free at room temperature. Therefore, ring G is the only one among the five with a low enough barrier to rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, rings H, J, K, and L are all in highly congested environments that will prevent free rotation. Ring G is in a significantly less hindered environment and is the only ring that can be expected to rotate freely in solution.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The conclusion that only ring G can rotate freely corresponds to choice K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
