**Product A** is the N-acetylated derivative of the rearranged [3+2] cycloadduct formed from the reaction of the azomethine ylide (generated via decarboxylation of the starting material's mixed anhydride) with methyl propiolate. Its molecular formula is C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃.

**Product B** is a tricyclic pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidinone derivative. It is formed from the Michael addition of the enamine tautomer of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and elimination of methanol. Its molecular formula is C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃.

**Product C** is the mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material, (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline, with acetic anhydride. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃.
