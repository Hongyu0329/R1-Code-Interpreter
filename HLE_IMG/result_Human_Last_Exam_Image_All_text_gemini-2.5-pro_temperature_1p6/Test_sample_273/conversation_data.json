    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecular structure:**\n    *   The drawing shows a molecule with a backbone of three chiral centers connected in a line.\n    *   Let's identify the groups attached to each chiral carbon, moving from left to right in the drawing.\n        *   **Leftmost Carbon (LC):** Attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), an implied hydrogen (-H), and the rest of the molecule to the right.\n        *   **Middle Carbon (MC):** Attached to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), an implied hydrogen (-H), the LC group, and the group to the right.\n        *   **Rightmost Carbon (RC):** Attached to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), an implied hydrogen (-H), and the MC group.\n    *   Based on this connectivity, we can determine the full structure: It is `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2`.\n    *   To systematically assign configurations, we need the IUPAC name to number the carbons correctly. The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2), which has higher priority than the alcohol (-OH).\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon attached to the -NH2 group (C1). The longest chain is a pentan-1-amine chain: `NH2-C1H2-C2(CH3)-C3(CH(OH)CH3)-C4H2-C5H3`.\n    *   The molecule is named **3-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n    *   The chiral centers are C2, C3, and the carbon in the hydroxyethyl side chain (let's call it C1').\n\n2.  **Map the drawn centers to IUPAC numbers:**\n    *   The rightmost center (RC) in the drawing is C2 of the IUPAC name.\n    *   The middle center (MC) is C3 of the IUPAC name.\n    *   The leftmost center (LC) is C1' of the hydroxyethyl side chain.\n\n3.  **Determine the absolute configuration for each chiral center:**\n\n    *   **Center C2 (Rightmost in drawing):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog):**\n            1.  `-CH2NH2` (connected to Nitrogen)\n            2.  `-C3H(side chain)(ethyl)` (connected to two carbons)\n            3.  `-CH3` (connected to three hydrogens)\n            4.  `-H`\n        *   **3D Arrangement:** Priority 1 (`-CH2NH2`) is wedged (forward). Priority 3 (`-CH3`) is dashed (back). Priority 2 and 4 are in the plane.\n        *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (P4, -H) is in the plane. We use the swap method: swap P4(-H) with the group on the dash, P3(-CH3). Now H is in the back. The order of the remaining groups P1 -> P2 -> P3 is `(wedged -CH2NH2) -> (planar -C3) -> (planar -CH3)`. This describes a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle. Since we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite, which is clockwise (CW). Therefore, C2 is **(R)**.\n\n    *   **Center C3 (Middle in drawing):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities:**\n            1.  `-CH(OH)CH3` (hydroxyethyl side chain; C is attached to O)\n            2.  `-C2H(CH3)(CH2NH2)` (group to the right; C is attached to N via another C)\n            3.  `-CH2CH3` (ethyl group; C is attached to C)\n            4.  `-H`\n        *   **3D Arrangement:** Priority 3 (`-CH2CH3`) is wedged (forward). The implied H (Priority 4) must be dashed (back).\n        *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (P4, -H) is in the back. We can directly read the configuration. The order P1 -> P2 -> P3 is `(planar -C1') -> (planar -C2) -> (wedged -Et)`. This describes a clockwise (CW) turn. Therefore, C3 is **(R)**.\n\n    *   **Center C1' (Leftmost in drawing):**\n        *   **Groups & Priorities:**\n            1.  `-OH` (Oxygen)\n            2.  `-C3H(...)` (rest of the molecule)\n            3.  `-CH3` (methyl group)\n            4.  `-H`\n        *   **3D Arrangement:** The drawing shows both the `-OH` group (P1) and the `-CH3` group (P3) with dashed bonds. This is a non-standard and geometrically impossible representation for a tetrahedral carbon if the main chain is in the plane.\n        *   **Resolving ambiguity:** A common interpretation for such a drawing is that there is a typo, or it's a 3D perspective view.\n            *   **Typo Assumption:** Assuming the drawing meant to show one wedged and one dashed bond to maintain a pattern with the other centers. Since `-OH` is explicitly dashed, we assume `-CH3` should be wedged.\n            *   **Perspective Assumption:** Another interpretation is that this is a perspective drawing where both groups are on the \"back\" side of the molecule, meaning the implied -H is on the \"front\" side (wedged).\n            *   Both interpretations lead to the same result. Let's use the perspective view logic: The implied `-H` (P4) is wedged (forward).\n        *   **Assignment:** Since the lowest priority group (P4, -H) is forward, we determine the direction of P1 -> P2 -> P3 and reverse the result. The path from P1(-OH, back) -> P2(-C3, back-right) -> P3(-CH3, back-left) is clockwise (CW). Because P4 is forward, we reverse the assignment. Therefore, C1' is **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The absolute configurations of the chiral centers are:\n        *   C1' (leftmost): **S**\n        *   C3 (middle): **R**\n        *   C2 (rightmost): **R**\n    *   Listed in order from left to right as they appear in the image, the configuration is S, R, R.\n    *   Listed by IUPAC numbering, the configuration is (2R, 3R, S at C1' of the side chain on C3). The full name is (2R,3R)-3-((1S)-1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylpentan-1-amine.\n\nThe final answer should specify the configuration of all three centers. Ordering them as they appear from left to right in the drawing is unambiguous.\n\nLeftmost Center: S\nMiddle Center: R\nRightmost Center: R\n\nSo, the overall absolute configuration is (S, R, R) when read from left to right on the provided image.\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
