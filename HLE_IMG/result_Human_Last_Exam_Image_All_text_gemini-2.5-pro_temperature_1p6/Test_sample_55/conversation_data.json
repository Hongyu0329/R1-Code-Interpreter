    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes.\n\n**1. Identify the Musical Context**\n*   **Piece:** The score is from Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature is one flat (B♭). Combined with the title, the piece is in the key of **D minor**.\n*   **Measure and Beat:** The circled notes are in measure 8, beginning on beat 3. This is part of a cadenza-like, virtuosic passage.\n\n**2. Identify the Notes in the Chord**\n*   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** On beat 3, the left hand plays a **C♯**. This note is held over from the chord on beats 1 and 2 (A7/C♯).\n*   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The right hand plays a fast, arpeggiated figure. The notes are **E♭, G, B♭, and D♭**.\n*   **Combined Notes:** The core harmonic notes on beat 3 are therefore **C♯, E♭, G, and B♭**. The D♭ is a very fast passing note within the arpeggio, though it completes an E♭7 chord sound. However, classical analysis often focuses on the main structural tones and spelling.\n\n**3. Analyze the Harmonic Function of the Chord**\n*   Standard chords in D minor (like the dominant A7 or leading-tone C♯°7) do not contain this specific combination of notes. For instance, the leading-tone diminished seventh chord (vii°7) would be C♯-E♮-G-B♭. The presence of E♭ instead of E♮ is the key feature.\n*   This specific combination of notes (a major triad on the flat supertonic, plus the raised fourth degree) points to a special category of chords known as **Augmented Sixth Chords**. These are intensely chromatic chords used to lead to the dominant.\n*   Let's analyze the circled notes as an augmented sixth chord. These chords are typically built on the lowered sixth scale degree (♭6) of the key they are resolving to. They are characterized by the interval of an augmented sixth between this ♭6 and the raised fourth degree (♯4). This interval resolves outward to an octave on the dominant note.\n*   Let's test the key of **G minor**, which is the subdominant (iv) of our home key, D minor.\n    *   The dominant of G minor is D.\n    *   The ♭6 scale degree of G minor is E♭.\n    *   The ♯4 scale degree of G minor is C♯.\n    *   The interval between E♭ (in the right hand) and C♯ (in the left hand) is an augmented sixth.\n    *   The notes of a **German Augmented Sixth Chord (Ger+6)** in G minor are: ♭6 (E♭), tonic (G), ♭3 (B♭), and ♯4 (C♯).\n*   Our notes—**C♯, E♭, G, B♭**—are a perfect match for the **German augmented sixth chord of G minor**.\n\n**4. Check the Resolution**\n*   An augmented sixth chord in G minor is expected to resolve to the dominant of G minor, which is a D major or D dominant 7th chord.\n*   Looking at the music, the bass note in measure 9 is a sustained **D**. The C♯ in the bass of our chord resolves up to this D, and the implied E♭ in the melody resolves down to D, which is the characteristic outward resolution of the augmented sixth interval.\n*   Therefore, the chord functions as a preparation for the D chord that follows, confirming its identity.\n\n**5. Determine the Roman Numeral**\n*   The chord is a German augmented sixth chord.\n*   It is functioning in the key of G minor.\n*   G minor is the subdominant (iv) of the main key, D minor.\n*   The proper Roman numeral analysis describes both the chord type and its relationship to the home key. The notation is **Ger+6/iv**, which means \"German augmented sixth chord of the subdominant\".\n\n<<<Ger+6/iv>>>"
