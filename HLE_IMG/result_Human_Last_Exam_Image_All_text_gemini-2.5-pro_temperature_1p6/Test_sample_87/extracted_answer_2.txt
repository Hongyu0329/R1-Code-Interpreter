The structures of the three products are:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole derivative formed from the cycloaddition of the azomethine ylide and methyl 4-oxopent-2-ynoate. It has a dihydropyrrole ring fused to a pyrrolidine ring. The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with a 4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl group. The dihydropyrrole ring contains a C=C double bond, with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) attached to the carbons of the double bond.

*Structure sketch of A showing connectivity. The Pyrrolinyl group is the C4H6N substituent. The main core is a bicyclo[3.3.0] system.*
 

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
An aromatic pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole derivative formed from the cycloaddition of the azomethine ylide and methyl propiolate, followed by oxidation. The core is a planar, aromatic pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole. There is a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) on the pyrrole ring. The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with a pyrrolidin-2-on-1-yl group (a lactam ring).
