    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Context:**\n*   **Piece:** Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 (\"Pathetique\"), first movement (Grave – Allegro di molto e con brio).\n*   **Location:** The analysis is for measure 30 of the Allegro section.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), indicating the home key of C minor.\n*   **Harmonic Goal:** To understand the function of measure 30, we must look at where it is going. Measure 31 begins with a strong G major chord (notes G-B-D in the right hand, G octaves in the left). In the key of C minor, a G major chord is the dominant chord, represented by the Roman numeral **V**. Therefore, measure 30 must contain a chord (or chords) that prepares or leads to the dominant (V).\n\n**2. Locate and Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   The circled measure is indeed measure 30.\n*   The measure has two distinct harmonies, one on beat 1 and one on beat 2.\n*   **Beat 1 (first half of the measure):**\n    *   Left Hand: A two-note chord on the downbeat, consisting of **E♮** and **B♭**. The bass note is E♮.\n    *   Right Hand: A descending arpeggio of sixteenth notes: **F♯ - E♮ - B♭ - G**.\n    *   The combined pitch collection for beat 1 is: **E♮, G, B♭, F♯**.\n*   **Beat 2 (second half of the measure):**\n    *   Left Hand: A two-note chord, consisting of **D** and **A♭**. The bass note is D.\n    *   Right Hand: A descending arpeggio of sixteenth notes: **F♯ - D - B♭ - G**.\n    *   The combined pitch collection for beat 2 is: **D, G, A♭, B♭, F♯**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Function of the Harmony:**\n*   The primary function of measure 30 is to build tension that resolves to the G major chord (V) in measure 31. This means the harmony in measure 30 is a **secondary dominant** or a related chord that points towards V. The Roman numeral for such a function is written in relation to V (e.g., V/V, vii°/V, etc.).\n*   The most important notes for determining this function are the **leading tone** to the goal chord and the **root** of its dominant.\n    *   The goal chord is G major.\n    *   The leading tone to G is **F♯**. The F♯ is prominently featured in the right hand throughout measure 30.\n    *   The dominant of G is a D major chord. The root of this chord is **D**. The note D appears as the bass note on beat 2 of measure 30.\n*   The presence of both the leading tone (F♯) and the root of the dominant-of-the-dominant (D) makes a very strong case that the harmony is functionally a **dominant of the dominant**.\n\n**4. Determine the Specific Roman Numeral:**\n*   The Roman numeral for the dominant of the dominant is **V/V**.\n*   Let's check the chord quality and inversion. The chord of the dominant of G is D major (D-F♯-A). The D in the bass on beat 2 confirms it is in **root position** at that point. The F♯ in the melody confirms its major quality.\n*   The other notes (G, A♭, B♭, E♮) are chromatic alterations and non-chord tones that Beethoven uses to create immense tension and drive. For example:\n    *   A♭ can be seen as a lowered 5th (b5) of a D7 chord.\n    *   B♭ can be seen as a lowered 13th (b13).\n    *   G can be seen as a pedal tone or suspension from the previous harmony.\n*   Despite this complexity, the fundamental root and function of the harmony, especially in the second half of the measure, is a D dominant chord.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the specific notes create a highly dissonant and complex surface, the underlying function is clear. The chord's job is to lead to the dominant (V). It does so by using the primary elements of the dominant's own dominant (V/V). Therefore, the correct Roman numeral analysis for measure 30 is V/V.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
