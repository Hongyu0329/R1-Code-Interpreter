    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify Reactants, Reagents, and Product:**\n    *   Reactant 1: Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound.\n    *   Reactant 2: Cyclobutene. The drawing shows a four-membered ring with one double bond. The two hydrogens are shown on the saturated carbons with `cis` stereochemistry. The chemical formula is C₄H₆.\n    *   Reagent: `hv` (light), indicating a photochemical reaction.\n    *   Product: A tricyclic compound consisting of three four-membered rings fused linearly. The substituents (F and H atoms) are distributed across this skeleton. The overall reaction is C₆F₆ + C₄H₆ → C₁₀F₆H₆.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The question states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation.\" This is a critical clue, suggesting a two-step mechanism, where each step is a pericyclic reaction allowed under photochemical conditions.\n\n3.  **Propose a plausible reaction mechanism:** There are two main possibilities for a two-step sequence:\n    *   **Path A:** Intramolecular reaction of one reactant first, followed by an intermolecular reaction.\n    *   **Path B:** Intermolecular reaction between the two reactants first, followed by an intramolecular reaction.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Path A:**\n    *   Step 1: Hexafluorobenzene undergoes photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a known photochemical pericyclic reaction, which can be described as a 6π-electron electrocyclization.\n    *   Step 2: The hexafluoro-Dewar benzene would then react with cyclobutene. Typical reactions like [2+2] or [4+2] cycloadditions would lead to complex, bridged, polycyclic cage compounds, not the linearly fused tricyclic structure shown in the product. Therefore, this path is unlikely to form the observed product skeleton.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Path B:** This pathway appears more plausible as it correctly predicts the carbon skeleton of the product.\n    *   **Step 1: Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition.** The first step is a photochemical cycloaddition between one of the π-bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the π-bond of cyclobutene. A [2π+2π] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed (specifically, a [π2s + π2s] mode). This reaction forms an intermediate with a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene skeleton. In this intermediate, the original six-membered aromatic ring has been converted into a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring, which is fused to a cyclobutane ring (from the original cyclobutene). This is the first photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction: a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   **Step 2: Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclization.** The intermediate formed in Step 1 contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene system, which is a 4π-electron conjugated system. Under photochemical conditions, 4π-electron systems can undergo an electrocyclic ring closure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this reaction is photochemically allowed and proceeds with a conrotatory stereochemical course. This electrocyclization converts the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane structure. The overall result of this second step is the formation of a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]decane skeleton, which consists of three four-membered rings fused in a linear fashion. This perfectly matches the carbon skeleton of the final product. This is the second photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction: a **4π electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation proceeds via a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The first is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, and the second is an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic reaction.\n\nTherefore, the two types of pericyclic reactions are a **cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
