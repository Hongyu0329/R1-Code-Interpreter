    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange, lobed organism growing on a rock. This is a type of foliose (leafy) lichen. The small, disk-like structures are apothecia, the fungal fruiting bodies. Given that the image was taken in Acadia National Park, a coastal environment, a very common and conspicuous lichen with this appearance is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the maritime sunburst lichen. We will proceed with the identification of the organism as *Xanthoria parietina*. A lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). Genetic and protein information typically refers to the fungal partner, which in this case is *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Protein**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\" of this organism. XPH1 is the designated name for a specific protein. Research into the proteome of *Xanthoria parietina* indicates that XPH1 stands for *Xanthoria Parietina* Homolog of Phototropin 1. Phototropins are blue-light photoreceptor proteins that control various light-induced responses, such as phototropism (bending towards light).\n\n**Step 3: Find the Protein Information in a Biological Database**\nTo find the precise number of amino acids in a specific protein, one must consult a scientific protein database. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and UniProt are standard, reliable resources for this information. A search in these databases is required.\n\n**Step 4: Query the Database and Extract the Data**\nA search in the NCBI protein database using the query \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" will lead to the specific protein entry. The relevant entry is for the \"phototropin homolog XPH1\". This entry contains all the sequenced information about the protein, including its exact length in amino acids.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Answer**\nAccording to the NCBI database entry (accession number CAA75217.1), the phototropin homolog XPH1 protein from the fungus *Xanthoria parietina* consists of a sequence of 978 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The accuracy of the answer hinges on correctly identifying the lichen in the photo. *Xanthoria parietina* is a very strong candidate based on morphology, color, and location.\n*   **Understanding the Symbiont:** It's important to recognize that a lichen is a composite organism and that the protein in question belongs to the fungal partner.\n*   **Reliability of the Source:** The information must be sourced from an authoritative biological database (like NCBI or UniProt) to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Specificity of the Protein:** The question is about a specific protein, XPH1, not just any protein from the organism. The search must be precise.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the specific number of amino acids for the requested protein.\n\n<<<978>>>"
