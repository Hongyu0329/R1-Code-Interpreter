    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the given tiling. Rotational symmetry describes how many times an object looks identical to its original position when rotated through a full 360 degrees around a central point. The number of times it matches is called the \"order\" of the symmetry. For a periodic tiling, we are looking for the highest order of rotational symmetry present anywhere in the pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential centers of rotation.**\nTo find the order of rotational symmetry, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate it and have it match up with its original form. Let's examine different key points in the tiling:\n\n*   **Center of a blue hexagon:** Let's pick the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as our potential center of rotation. A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold symmetry. We need to check if the entire surrounding pattern also shares this symmetry.\n    *   If we rotate the image by 60° (which is 360°/6), the central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n    *   Observe the shapes surrounding the hexagon: there are 6 light-yellow squares and 6 orange rhombuses attached to its vertices.\n    *   A 60° rotation will move each square to the position of the next square, and each rhombus to the position of the next rhombus.\n    *   Looking further out, the entire pattern of surrounding hexagons, squares, and rhombuses also shifts perfectly into the place of their neighbors.\n    *   Since the pattern matches itself after a 60° rotation, and will do so 6 times in a full 360° turn, this point is a center of 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Center of a light-yellow square:** Let's pick the center of a square. A square has 4-fold symmetry.\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 90° (360°/4) around the center of a square, the square maps onto itself.\n    *   Each square is surrounded by four orange rhombuses and four blue hexagons at its corners.\n    *   A 90° rotation maps each surrounding shape onto an identical shape. The whole pattern aligns.\n    *   Therefore, the center of each square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Center of a \"star\" formed by orange rhombuses:** There are points where the sharp corners of six orange rhombuses meet.\n    *   If we choose this meeting point as a center, rotating by 60° (360°/6) moves each rhombus into the position of its neighbor.\n    *   The entire surrounding pattern also aligns with this rotation.\n    *   This is another center of 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall symmetry of the tiling.**\nA periodic tiling can have multiple types of rotational symmetry centers. The symmetry of the entire tiling is defined by the highest order of rotational symmetry found.\n*   We have found centers of 4-fold symmetry.\n*   We have found centers of 6-fold symmetry.\n\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern is 6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe tiling exhibits 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6>>>"
