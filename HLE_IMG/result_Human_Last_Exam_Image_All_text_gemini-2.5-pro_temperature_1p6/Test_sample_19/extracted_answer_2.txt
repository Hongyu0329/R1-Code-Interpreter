1. The music modulates to the key of E minor.
2. The original key is C# minor. The note E is the mediant (the 3rd scale degree) of C#. A modulation to the mediant is common, but typically it would be to the relative major key, E major. Beethoven instead chromatically alters the destination key to E minor (by changing G# to G natural). This is an example of mode mixture, where the modulation is to the minor mediant (iii) rather than the diatonic major mediant (III), creating a darker, more poignant effect.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral for the chord on the first beat of measure 11 is v/iii (the minor dominant of the minor mediant).
