    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the location shown in the image. The building has very distinct architectural features:\n    *   A prominent red brick facade with a herringbone pattern.\n    *   A large, curved roofline over a tan stucco section.\n    *   A decorative quatrefoil (four-lobed) relief design on the stucco wall.\n    *   A white, crisscross railing on an upper-level balcony or opening.\n    *   The large tour truck parked outside strongly suggests this is a concert or event venue.\n\n2.  **Search for the Venue:** Using these architectural details, a reverse image search or a descriptive search (e.g., \"red brick theater with herringbone pattern and quatrefoil\") identifies the building as the **Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox**, located in Spokane, Washington.\n\n3.  **Find the Venue's Event History:** The question asks for the performer on a specific date, October 12, 2023. The next step is to look up the event calendar or schedule for the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox for that date.\n\n4.  **Identify the Performer:** By searching the venue's official website, ticketing sites, or concert archives for events on October 12, 2023, we can find the performer for that evening. The event listed for Thursday, October 12, 2023, at the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox was the **Goo Goo Dolls** with special guests Fitz and the Tantrums, as part of \"The Big Night Out Tour\".\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The musical artist that played at this venue on the specified date was the headliner, Goo Goo Dolls.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Correct Venue Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the building first. The unique combination of brickwork, stucco, and decorative elements is key to a positive ID.\n*   **Exact Date:** The query is for a very specific date (Oct 12, 2023). It's important to find the event for that day and not a day before or after.\n*   **Distinguishing Artists:** On some tour dates, there are opening acts and headliners. The most accurate answer refers to the main act, which in this case was the Goo Goo Dolls.\n*   **Image Date vs. Question Date:** The information that the image was taken in 2024 is noted, but the question is about a past event in 2023, which is the crucial part of the query. The truck's presence in 2024 doesn't necessarily mean the same artist was there; it's just a picture of the venue. The primary task is to identify the venue and then look up its historical schedule.\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
