    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure of the Complexes:**\n    All four molecules are cationic iridium(III) coordination complexes. They share a common structural motif: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ PF6-`.\n    *   `Ir`: Iridium(III) is the central metal ion.\n    *   `C^N`: This represents a bidentate cyclometalating ligand, which binds to iridium through one carbon-iridium bond and one nitrogen-iridium bond. In all four complexes, this is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand.\n    *   `(C^N)2`: There are two identical cyclometalating ligands in each complex (homoleptic in terms of the C^N ligands).\n    *   `N^N`: This represents a neutral bidentate ligand that binds through two nitrogen atoms. In all four complexes, this is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). The bulky tert-butyl groups are often added to improve solubility and prevent aggregation.\n    *   `PF6-`: This is the counter-ion.\n    *   The overall structure is a pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry around the Ir(III) center.\n\n2.  **Identify the Differences Between the Complexes:**\n    The four complexes are identical except for the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating `C^N` ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the ortho (2') and para (4') positions relative to the C-C bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a single fluorine atom at the para (4') position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a single fluorine atom at the ortho (2') position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2',3',4'-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the ortho (2'), meta (3'), and para (4') positions.\n\n3.  **Relate Molecular Structure to Lifetime in LECs:**\n    The question asks which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes. In the context of light-emitting devices like LECs or OLEDs, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the operational lifetime, which is determined by the chemical stability of the emitter molecule under operating conditions (electrical bias, current flow, redox cycling). A shorter lifetime implies faster degradation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Key Factors Affecting Stability:**\n    A major degradation pathway for this class of iridium complexes involves the stability of the ligands, particularly the cyclometalating C^N ligand and its bond to the iridium center. The Ir-C bond is crucial for the photophysical properties but can also be a point of chemical weakness.\n\n5.  **Consider the Effect of Fluorine Substitution:**\n    *   **General Inductive Effect:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Its electron-withdrawing nature strengthens the Ir-C bond. A stronger bond generally leads to a more stable complex and a longer operational lifetime. Based on this effect alone, all fluorinated complexes might be expected to be more stable than the non-fluorinated parent complex (which is not shown).\n    *   **Positional Effect (The Crucial Point):** The position of the fluorine atom is critical. A fluorine atom located at the *ortho* position (the C2' position, adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to iridium) introduces a specific and well-documented degradation pathway.\n    *   **Ortho-Fluorine Instability:** When a fluorine atom is in the ortho position, it is sterically close to the iridium metal center. During the operation of an LEC, the iridium complex can be temporarily reduced (e.g., from Ir(III) to Ir(II)). In this reduced, more electron-rich state, the iridium center can nucleophilically attack the adjacent C-F bond. This leads to the cleavage of the very strong C-F bond, destroying the ligand and the complex. This intramolecular C-F bond activation is a major cause of rapid degradation and shorter device lifetimes.\n\n6.  **Apply the Stability Principle to Each Complex:**\n    We need to check which complexes have a fluorine atom at the ortho (2') position on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has a fluorine at the 2' position. **Expected to have a shorter lifetime.**\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has a fluorine only at the 4' position. There is no ortho-fluorine. This complex is not susceptible to the C-F activation degradation pathway and is expected to be relatively stable. **Expected to have a longer lifetime.**\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has a fluorine at the 2' position. **Expected to have a shorter lifetime.**\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has fluorines at the 2', 3', and 4' positions. The presence of the 2'-fluorine makes it susceptible to degradation. **Expected to have a shorter lifetime.**\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Complexes [1], [3], and [4] all contain the structural feature (an ortho-fluorine on the cyclometalating ligand) that makes them prone to a specific, rapid degradation mechanism. Complex [2] lacks this feature. Therefore, complexes [1], [3], and [4] are expected to exhibit shorter operational lifetimes compared to complex [2]. The question asks which ones are expected to show shorter lifetimes. This group is {1, 3, 4}.\n\n8.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    The combination of complexes [1], [3], and [4] corresponds to answer choice M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
