The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain (Variable immunoglobulin-like domain) of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. Given that S100B actively drives pathological processes shown in the diagram, such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, its levels can be used to predict the severity and future course of the disease. Therefore, it can be used as a **prognostic marker**, not solely as an adjunct marker.
