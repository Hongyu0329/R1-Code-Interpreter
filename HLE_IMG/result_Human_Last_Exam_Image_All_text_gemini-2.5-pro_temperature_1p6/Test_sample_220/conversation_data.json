    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure**\nAn FCC lattice consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The key is to understand how these atoms are arranged in space.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe direction [110] in a cubic system corresponds to a vector along the diagonal of a face of the unit cube, starting from the origin (e.g., from (0,0,0) to (a,a,0), where 'a' is the lattice constant). Viewing the crystal along this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this face diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, a specific 2D pattern emerges. This pattern is a **centered rectangle**.\n*   The atoms are arranged in planes perpendicular to the [110] direction.\n*   The atoms within one plane form a simple rectangular grid. Let's call this Layer A. The rectangle has side lengths of 'a' and 'aâˆš2'.\n*   The atoms in the next plane (Layer B) are situated exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms in Layer A.\n*   When projected onto a single 2D plane, the atoms from both Layer A and Layer B are seen together. This creates a pattern of rectangles with an atom at each corner and one atom in the very center of each rectangle.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Patterns in the Given Images**\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows two simple rectangular grids of atoms, stacked and offset from each other. If you project all atoms onto one plane, you do not get a centered rectangular pattern. The basic repeating unit is a simple rectangle. This pattern is not characteristic of FCC [110].\n\n*   **Image B:** This image displays a pattern where one can identify a repeating parallelogram-shaped unit cell. There are atoms at the four corners of this parallelogram and one atom located in its center. A rectangle viewed in perspective appears as a parallelogram. This arrangement perfectly matches the topological description of a **centered rectangle**, which is the signature pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction. The dashed lines outline a unit cell of this pattern, clearly showing atoms at the corners and in the center of the faces of the depicted volume.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms in this image are arranged in a distinct **hexagonal** pattern. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC crystal viewed along the [111] direction (the space diagonal of the cube) or a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal viewed along its c-axis [0001]. This is not the [110] view.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image shows a **centered square** pattern. There are atoms at the corners of a square and one atom in the center. This is the characteristic projection of a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal when viewed along the [100] direction (along a cube edge).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, Image B is the only one that exhibits the centered rectangular pattern (shown as a centered parallelogram due to perspective) that is the correct projection of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
