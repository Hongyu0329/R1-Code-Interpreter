    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the full name of the artist.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Signature**\nThe first step is to examine the painting to find the artist's signature. Looking at the bottom right corner of the original image and the corresponding cropped image, a signature is clearly visible.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the Signature and Inscription**\nThe signature consists of a name and an inscription below it.\n*   The name is written in a stylized script and reads \"Manzù\".\n*   Below the name, the words \"Praiano 50\" are written. This likely indicates the location where the painting was made (Praiano, a town on the Amalfi Coast in Italy) and the year (1950).\n\n**Step 3: Research the Artist's Name**\nBased on the signature \"Manzù\", a search for an artist with this name is conducted. This leads to a prominent 20th-century Italian artist.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Artist's Full Name**\nThe artist known professionally as Manzù is Giacomo Manzù.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Attribution**\nTo confirm this is the correct artist, we can check for consistency.\n*   **Artist:** Giacomo Manzù (1908–1991) was a famous Italian sculptor who also produced a significant body of work as a painter and printmaker, particularly in watercolor.\n*   **Style:** The loose, expressive style of this watercolor landscape is consistent with other known watercolors by Giacomo Manzù.\n*   **Context:** The inscription \"Praiano 50\" aligns with the artist's life and work, as he was active in Italy during this period.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Signature Analysis:** It is crucial to carefully inspect the signature. The provided crops are helpful in isolating and clarifying the writing.\n*   **Contextual Clues:** The location and date (\"Praiano 50\") are vital supporting details that help confirm the artist's identity beyond just the name.\n*   **Artist Verification:** One should not rely solely on a name match. Verifying the artist's typical style, medium, and biographical details helps ensure the attribution is accurate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the full name of the artist is Giacomo Manzù.\n\n<<<Giacomo Manzù>>>"
