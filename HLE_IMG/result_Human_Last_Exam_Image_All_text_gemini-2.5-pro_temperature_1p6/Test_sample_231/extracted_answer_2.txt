The final structure of compound C is a complex polycyclic phenol formed by demethylation and subsequent intramolecular cyclization. It can be described as a substituted `6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran` derivative where the C6 carbon is the original central carbon of the triarylmethane system. This C6 carbon is sp3 hybridized and bonded to a `2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl` group and a `4-diethylamino-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl` group. The rest of the `6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran` skeleton is substituted with multiple hydroxyl groups originating from the demethylation of all methoxy groups. The structure is depicted below:
