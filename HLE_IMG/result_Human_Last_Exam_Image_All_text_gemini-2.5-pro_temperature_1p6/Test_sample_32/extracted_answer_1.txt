The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (the stalk)**.

1.  In **_Grimmia montana_**, the seta is very **short and straight**, which causes the capsule to be **immersed** or just barely emergent among the leaves of the gametophyte.
2.  In **_Grimmia curviseta_**, as its name implies, the seta is **distinctly curved**, often in a cygneous (swan-neck) shape. This curved seta makes the capsule hang in an arc, and it is the most reliable feature for quick identification.
