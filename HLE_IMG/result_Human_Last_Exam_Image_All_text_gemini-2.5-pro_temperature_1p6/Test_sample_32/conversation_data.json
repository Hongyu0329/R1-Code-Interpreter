    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to find the most obvious visual difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing structure) between two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. \"At a glance\" implies a macroscopic, easily observable feature.\n\n2.  **Define Sporophyte Parts:** A moss sporophyte generally consists of a capsule (which holds the spores), a seta (the stalk holding up the capsule), and a foot (which attaches to the leafy gametophyte). The appearance and arrangement of the capsule and seta are key identification features.\n\n3.  **Analyze *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   When examining descriptions and images of *Grimmia montana* (like the one provided), a key feature of its sporophyte is that the **seta is very short and straight**.\n    *   Because the seta is so short, the capsule does not rise above the main body of the moss. It is described as **immersed** (completely nestled within the leaves) or **emergent** (just peeking out from the leaves).\n    *   The image provided shows several brown, cup-like capsules sitting low down among the silvery-green gametophyte leaves, consistent with the description of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n4.  **Analyze *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   The species name itself, *curviseta*, offers a major clue. It is Latin for **\"curved seta\"**.\n    *   The defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its **distinctly curved or cygneous (swan-necked) seta**.\n    *   While the seta is longer than in *G. montana*, its strong curvature brings the capsule back down in an arc, so its mouth often faces downwards or is tucked beside the stem. This curved stalk is a very clear and distinguishing feature.\n\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   *Grimmia montana*: Sporophyte has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an immersed capsule.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta*: Sporophyte has a **distinctly curved (cygneous) seta**.\n    *   Therefore, the primary difference that allows for distinguishing these two species \"at a glance\" is the **shape and length of the seta**. One is short and straight, while the other is longer and clearly curved.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Observation Conditions:** This difference is only visible when the mosses have mature sporophytes. Without sporophytes, identification would rely on microscopic features of the leaves.\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While the capsule shape might differ slightly, the most dramatic and consistent visual difference is in the seta's morphology. The position of the capsule (immersed vs. arched over) is a direct result of the seta's structure.\n*   **Use the Name as a Clue:** The scientific name *Grimmia curviseta* directly points to its most notable feature, which is a very helpful mnemonic for identification.\n\nBy comparing these features, the clear and immediate difference lies in the stalk supporting the capsule.\n\n<<<The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (the stalk)**.\n\n1.  In **_Grimmia montana_**, the seta is very **short and straight**, which causes the capsule to be **immersed** or just barely emergent among the leaves of the gametophyte.\n2.  In **_Grimmia curviseta_**, as its name implies, the seta is **distinctly curved**, often in a cygneous (swan-neck) shape. This curved seta makes the capsule hang in an arc, and it is the most reliable feature for quick identification."
