    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image shows a raster plot of neuronal activity.\n    *   The **x-axis** represents **Time** in seconds (s).\n    *   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, from 0 to 128.\n    *   Each **black dot** represents a firing event (an action potential or \"spike\") from a specific neuron at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** \"Synchronized bursts\" are periods where many neurons across different electrodes fire in a coordinated manner, appearing as dense vertical columns of dots in the plot. We need to identify these events and their approximate start times.\n\n3.  **List the Timestamps of the Bursts:** By visually inspecting the graph and reading the corresponding values from the x-axis, we can estimate the start time of each synchronized burst.\n    *   **Burst 1 (B1):** Starts at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2 (B2):** Starts at approximately **t₂ = 11 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3 (B3):** Starts at approximately **t₃ = 17 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4 (B4):** Starts at approximately **t₄ = 24 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5 (B5):** Starts at approximately **t₅ = 35 s**.\n    *   **Burst 6 (B6):** Starts at approximately **t₆ = 46 s**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the start of one burst and the start of the next. We calculate this for each consecutive pair of bursts identified.\n    *   **IBI₁ (B1 to B2):** t₂ - t₁ = 11 s - 2 s = **9 s**.\n    *   **IBI₂ (B2 to B3):** t₃ - t₂ = 17 s - 11 s = **6 s**.\n    *   **IBI₃ (B3 to B4):** t₄ - t₃ = 24 s - 17 s = **7 s**.\n    *   **IBI₄ (B4 to B5):** t₅ - t₄ = 35 s - 24 s = **11 s**.\n    *   **IBI₅ (B5 to B6):** t₆ - t₅ = 46 s - 35 s = **11 s**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** We find the average of the calculated intervals.\n    *   Sum of all IBIs = 9 s + 6 s + 7 s + 11 s + 11 s = 44 s.\n    *   Number of intervals = 5.\n    *   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 44 s / 5 = **8.8 s**.\n\n6.  **Adhere to Significant Figures:** The question asks for the answer to be given to two significant figures. Our calculated average, 8.8 s, is already expressed with two significant figures.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Identified Burst Timestamps: 2 s, 11 s, 17 s, 24 s, 35 s, 46 s.\n*   Calculated Inter-Burst Intervals: 9 s, 6 s, 7 s, 11 s, 11 s.\n*   Average Interval: (9 + 6 + 7 + 11 + 11) / 5 = 44 / 5 = 8.8 s.\n\n<<<8.8>>>"
