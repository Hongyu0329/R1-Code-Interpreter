    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image consists of two graphs, both plotted against time (horizontal axis).\n    *   The top graph is a spectrogram. It visualizes the frequency content of a sound over time. We can see a strong horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the graph, this line is broken and replaced by a short, vertical blur. This vertical blur indicates a sound with a wide range of frequencies, characteristic of noise. After the burst of noise, the pure tone resumes.\n    *   The bottom graph is a waveform, showing the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, it shows a regular, periodic sine wave, which is the waveform of a pure tone. In the middle, the sine wave stops and is replaced by a more complex, irregular waveform (corresponding to the noise). Then, on the right, the sine wave reappears.\n    *   In summary, the image physically depicts a pure tone that is interrupted and replaced by a short burst of noise.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the name of a perceptual phenomenon associated with this stimulus. Key clues are provided:\n    *   It is an **illusion**.\n    *   It is similar to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets a 2D drawing as a 3D cube, and the perceived orientation can flip back and forth. This suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain actively interpreting or \"filling in\" ambiguous sensory information to create a stable perception.\n    *   It reveals a **common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability**. This means it's a process our brains do automatically to make sense of the world, often without our awareness.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:** We have a stimulus (a tone interrupted by noise) and a description of the resulting perception (an illusion involving the brain \"filling in\" information). When a person listens to this sound, they typically do not perceive a tone, then noise, then the tone again. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* through the noise. The brain \"restores\" the missing portion of the tone, creating the illusion of continuity. This is an unconscious ability that helps us understand speech and other sounds in noisy environments, by assuming that a sound source continues to exist even when it is briefly masked by another sound.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon:** This well-known auditory illusion is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** (or sometimes temporal induction). The phonemic restoration effect is a specific example of this illusion involving speech sounds, but the more general term covering non-speech sounds like tones is the Auditory Continuity Illusion. This matches all the clues: it's an illusion, it involves the brain filling in missing information to resolve ambiguity (similar to the Necker Cube), and it's a fundamental, automatic process of our perceptual system.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
