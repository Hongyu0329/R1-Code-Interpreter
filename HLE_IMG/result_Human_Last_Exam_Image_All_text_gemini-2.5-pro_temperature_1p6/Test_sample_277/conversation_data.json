    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the provided information:** The user has provided an image and a multiple-choice question. The image is completely black. There are no drawings of molecules, chemical structures, or names of compounds present in the image.\n\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". This question requires the analysis of at least two molecules to determine their relationship (e.g., if they have the same formula, the same connectivity, etc.).\n\n3.  **Identify the discrepancy:** The question refers to \"molecules mentioned above,\" but there are no molecules shown or mentioned in the provided image. There is a fundamental lack of information required to answer the question.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options based on the available information:**\n    *   **(a) Conformers isomers:** To determine if molecules are conformers, we would need to see their structures and see if they are interconvertible by single bond rotation. We cannot do this without the structures.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** To determine if molecules are constitutional isomers, we would need to know their molecular formulas (which must be identical) and their connectivity (which must be different). We cannot do this without the structures.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if molecules are identical, we would need to compare their structures. We cannot do this.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** To determine if molecules are stereoisomers, we would need to know their molecular formulas and connectivity (which must be identical) and see that their spatial arrangement of atoms is different. We cannot do this.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** Since none of the classifications (a, b, c, d) can be applied due to the complete absence of the molecules in question, this option is the only logical choice. The question is unanswerable with the given information, so the relationship cannot be described by any of the specific options.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the image does not provide any molecules to analyze, it is impossible to determine the isomeric relationship between them. Therefore, none of the specific isomer types listed in options (a) through (d) can be selected. The correct option is (e).\n\n<<<E>>>"
