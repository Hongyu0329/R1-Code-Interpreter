**Structure Drawings:**

**A: Pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide**
A pyrrolidine ring with a -C(=O)NHâ‚‚ group attached to the carbon adjacent to the ring nitrogen.
(Chemical structure: A 5-membered saturated ring containing one nitrogen atom. At the carbon atom alpha to the nitrogen, a primary amide group is attached.)

**B: 1,2,5,6,7,7a-Hexahydro-3H-pyrrolizin-3-one**
A fused bicyclic compound made of two 5-membered rings. The rings are fused along a C-N bond. There is a ketone group on one of the rings.
(Chemical structure: Bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton with a nitrogen at the bridgehead position 4 and a ketone at position 3.)

**C: N-acetyl-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (N-acetylpyroglutamic acid)**
A 5-membered lactam (pyrrolidin-2-one) structure which is N-acetylated and also has
