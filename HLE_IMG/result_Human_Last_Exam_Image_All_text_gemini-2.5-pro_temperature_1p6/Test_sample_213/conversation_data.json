    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information on the score.**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score lists parts for a large orchestra. We can see:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (Zwei große Flöten - Two Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (Erste Oboe - First Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (Englischhorn - English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (Erstes Fagott - First Bassoon)\n    *   `I. Viol.` (Erste Violinen - First Violins), divided into multiple desks (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen` - the rest)\n    *   `II. Viol.` (Zweite Violinen - Second Violins)\n    *   `Solo Br.` (Solo Bratsche - Solo Viola) and `(die übrigen) Br.` (the rest of the violas)\n    *   `Celli` (Cellos), also divided.\n*   **Language and Markings:** The instrument names and performance instructions are in German. Key instructions include:\n    *   `(Vorhang)`: This is German for \"curtain\". Placed at rehearsal mark `1`, it indicates that the curtain rises at this point. This strongly suggests the music is from a staged work like an opera or ballet. The question confirms it's an opera.\n    *   `(mit Dämpfer)`: This means \"with mute\". This instruction is given to the viola and cello sections, which creates a specific hushed, silvery sound quality.\n    *   `dim. pp`: Diminuendo to pianissimo (very soft).\n    *   `gliss.`: Glissando, a slide between notes.\n*   **Musical Style:** The music is highly chromatic, with many accidentals (sharps and flats) that are not part of a simple key signature. The harmony is complex and dense. The texture is created by many independent lines (polyphony) and layered sounds (divisi strings). This musical language is characteristic of the late-Romantic, Expressionist, or early 20th-century periods.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues.**\n*   We are looking for a German-language opera.\n*   The music is the very beginning of the second act (\"opens the second act\").\n*   The orchestral forces are large and the writing is sophisticated.\n*   The musical style is atonal or highly chromatic, pointing towards composers like Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, or Alban Berg.\n*   The atmosphere created by the muted strings and quiet dynamics is eerie, shimmering, and introspective.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific piece.**\n*   The combination of German expressionist style, specific instrumentation, and the \"Vorhang\" marking at the beginning of Act II points strongly to Alban Berg's opera **Wozzeck**.\n*   A check against the score of *Wozzeck* confirms this. The music shown is the very beginning of Act II. This introduction leads into the first scene, where Marie is in her room, admiring the earrings the Drum Major has given her. The shimmering, unsettled music perfectly reflects her conflicting feelings of fascination and guilt. The melodic fragment in the first violins is a key part of the scene's musical material.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music is the orchestral prelude to the second act of Alban Berg's opera *Wozzeck*. All the details—the instrumentation, the German markings like \"(Vorhang)\" and \"(mit Dämpfer)\", and the specific musical notes and style—match this work precisely.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
