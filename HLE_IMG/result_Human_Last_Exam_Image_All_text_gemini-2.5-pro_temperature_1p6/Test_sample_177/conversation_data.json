    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the Baseline scenario (Table 1) with the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled):** This is the total miles traveled by vehicles. To calculate this, we need to know the number of vehicle trips and the distance of each trip.\n*   **Calculation Approach:** We will calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario and the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario. Then, we will find the percentage difference.\n*   **Formula for VMT:** For each segment (distance category), VMT is calculated as: `(Total Trips in Segment) × (Average Trip Distance)`.\n*   **Total Trips in Segment:** This is found by multiplying the total number of trips (let's assume a base of `T` total trips for the entire system) by the `share of total trips` for that segment, and then by the `mode share` for cars within that segment.\n*   **Car Modes:** The car modes are \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We must sum their shares to get the total share of car trips.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nLet `T` be the total number of trips across all modes and distances. We calculate a \"VMT factor\" which is VMT divided by `T`.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48%\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (carpool) = 53%\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT factor = 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22%\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14%\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16%\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Factor:**\n    *   Sum = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation with the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48%\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT factor = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22%\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14%\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16%\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT factor = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Factor:**\n    *   Sum = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nUse the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100%\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.52195 * 100%\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
