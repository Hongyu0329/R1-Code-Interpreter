    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine artworks, proceeding from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n**Artwork 1: Top-Left**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** The artwork depicts four fish with a cartoonish and playful aesthetic. The outlines are simple and bold, and the colors are applied as washes, characteristic of modern Chinese ink painting. The fish have exaggerated human-like facial expressions.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** This distinctive style of depicting animals with a modern, decorative, and often whimsical feel is the signature of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, a prominent contemporary Chinese artist known for his paintings and sculptures of animals.\n*   **Careful Point:** While other artists like Huang Yongyu also work in a modern ink style, the specific form and expression of these fish are unmistakably Han Meilin's.\n\n**Artwork 2: Top-Center**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums and rocks. The brushwork is elegant and confident, showing mastery of the medium.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** In the upper right corner, there is a signature and a red artist's seal. Both the cursive signature and the seal characters can be identified as \"启功\" (Qi Gong).\n*   **Careful Point:** The signature and seal are the most direct evidence. The painting style is also consistent with the known works of **Qi Gong (启功)**, who was a master of both calligraphy and painting.\n\n**Artwork 3: Top-Right**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a realistic portrait of a woman, likely from an ethnic minority in China, judging by her clothing. The work is executed with fine detail and great psychological depth.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** The medium is ink and color on paper, not oil painting. This style of monumental, realistic figure painting using traditional Chinese materials is the hallmark of **Jiang Zhaohe (蒋兆和)**, a master of 20th-century Chinese art. This is one of his well-known portraits.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to distinguish the medium correctly. While the realism is comparable to Western oil portraiture, the brushwork and paper texture confirm it as a work of Chinese painting (国画).\n\n**Artwork 4: Middle-Left**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a fluid and dynamic cursive script (草书). The characters flow into one another, creating a strong sense of rhythm.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** This is a famous masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy. The style is that of the Song dynasty poet and official, **Su Shi (苏轼)**, also known as Su Dongpo. The fragment is from his most celebrated work, the \"Cold Food Observance\" scroll (《寒食帖》).\n*   **Careful Point:** Recognizing this specific famous artwork or Su Shi's unique calligraphic style is key to the identification.\n\n**Artwork 5: Middle-Center**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a modern painting that combines abstract elements with a landscape. It features a large red circle and an orange semi-circle (representing suns or moons) above a simplified, ink-wash-style horizon.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** The fusion of geometric shapes, bold colors (elements of Western modernism), and the spirit and brushwork of traditional Chinese painting is the highly recognizable style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a pivotal figure in modern Chinese art.\n*   **Careful Point:** Wu Guanzhong is famous for \"Sinicizing\" oil painting and modernizing Chinese ink painting; this work is a prime example of his unique artistic language.\n\n**Artwork 6: Middle-Right**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a piece of calligraphy in a strong, stable, and well-structured regular script (楷书). The text appears to be a colophon or scholarly notes on a historical artwork.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** The text discusses the Tang dynasty calligrapher Chu Suiliang, but the style of writing is not his. It belongs to a later period. This powerful and scholarly style is characteristic of **Weng Tonghe (翁同龢)**, a prominent scholar-official and calligrapher of the late Qing Dynasty.\n*   **Careful Point:** It's important to differentiate between the subject of the text (Chu Suiliang) and the author of the calligraphy itself (Weng Tonghe).\n\n**Artwork 7: Bottom-Left**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is another example of highly energetic cursive script calligraphy (草书). The brushstrokes are bold, sweeping, and powerful.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** While the immense energy can be reminiscent of Mao Zedong's calligraphy, the character structures show a deep grounding in ancient inscriptions and a refined control. This is the \"Standard Cursive\" (标准草书) style pioneered by the 20th-century master **Yu Youren (于右任)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Distinguishing between the powerful cursive scripts of different modern masters like Yu Youren and Mao Zedong requires attention to the specific formation of characters and the overall structure.\n\n**Artwork 8: Bottom-Center**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a realistic oil painting portrait of a young woman with dark hair, set against a dark, leafy background. The work has a romantic, soft-focus quality and a contemplative mood.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** This is one of the most iconic works of contemporary Chinese oil painting. The style of \"Romantic Realism\" and the subject matter are trademarks of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**. This specific painting is famously known as \"Youth\" (《青春》) or \"Young Female Singer\".\n*   **Careful Point:** Chen Yifei's work is distinct for its blend of academic realism with a poetic and atmospheric sensibility.\n\n**Artwork 9: Bottom-Right**\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the style.** This is a figure painting of a woman in an elegant dancer's costume. The style is characterized by extremely fine and precise line-work (a modern interpretation of the traditional \"gongbi\" technique) combined with subtle, harmonious color washes.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the artist.** This exquisite blend of traditional meticulousness with modern realism and aesthetic sensibility is the signature style of **He Jiaying (何家英)**, a leading figure in contemporary Chinese \"gongbi\" painting. This famous work is titled \"Ghazal\" (《迦萨》).\n*   **Careful Point:** The artist combines classical elegance with a contemporary feel, setting his work apart from both purely traditional gongbi and purely realist painting.\n\n<<<Han Meilin, Qi Gong, Jiang Zhaohe, Su Shi, Wu Guanzhong, Weng Tonghe, Yu Youren, Chen Yifei, He Jiaying>>>"
