    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit is composed of an infinite resistive ladder network connected to an input source (\"IN\" at node $g_0$) and loaded by a capacitor $C$ at node $a_0$. This configuration forms a low-pass RC filter. The output voltage is the voltage at node $a_0$.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, of an RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen from the terminals of the capacitor $C$ (i.e., between nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$, which is ground).\n\n**2. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the network looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. Turning off the input voltage source means grounding the input terminal $g_0$.\n\nWe can find $R_{th}$ by injecting a test current, $I_{test}$, into node $a_0$ and calculating the resulting voltage, $V_{a0}$. Then, $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_{test}$.\n\n**3. Setting up the Nodal Analysis Equations**\nLet's denote the voltage at nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ as $V_{c,k}$ and $V_{d,k}$ respectively. The node indices $k$ start from 1. The input node is $g_0$ and the output node is $a_0$. We have the following connections:\n- Resistor $r$ between $g_0$ and $c_1$.\n- Resistor $r$ between $a_0$ and $d_1$.\n- For $k \\ge 1$: resistors $r$ between $c_k$ and $c_{k+1}$, $d_k$ and $d_{k+1}$, and $c_k$ and $d_k$.\n\nWith $g_0$ grounded ($V_{g0}=0$) and a current $I_{test}$ injected at $a_0$, we can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations at various nodes.\n\n- **KCL at node $a_0$:**\n  The current $I_{test}$ flows into the resistor between $a_0$ and $d_1$.\n  $I_{test} = \\frac{V_{a0} - V_{d1}}{r} \\implies V_{a0} = V_{d1} + r I_{test}$.\n\n- **KCL for nodes $c_k, d_k$ for $k \\ge 2$ (the general recurrence relations):**\n  At node $c_k$: $\\frac{V_{c,k}-V_{c,k-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c,k}-V_{c,k+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c,k}-V_{d,k}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{c,k-1}+V_{c,k+1}+V_{d,k}-3V_{c,k}=0$.\n  At node $d_k$: $\\frac{V_{d,k}-V_{d,k-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d,k}-V_{d,k+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d,k}-V_{c,k}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{d,k-1}+V_{d,k+1}+V_{c,k}-3V_{d,k}=0$.\n\n- **KCL for the boundary nodes ($k=1$):**\n  At node $d_1$: The current from node $a_0$ is $-I_{test}$.\n  $\\frac{V_{d1}-V_{a0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} = 0 \\implies -I_{test} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} = 0$.\n  This simplifies to $2V_{d1} - V_{d2} - V_{c1} = r I_{test}$.\n  At node $c_1$: It's connected to the grounded node $g_0$.\n  $\\frac{V_{c1}-V_{g0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{d1}}{r} = 0$. Since $V_{g0}=0$, this becomes $3V_{c1} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$.\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\nThe general solution for the voltages in the infinite ladder that is physically bounded (currents and voltages don't diverge at infinity) is a superposition of a constant symmetric mode and a decaying antisymmetric mode.\nLet the solution be of the form:\n$V_{d,k} = A_{sym} + A_{anti} x^k$\n$V_{c,k} = A_{sym} - A_{anti} x^k$\nwhere $x$ is the decay factor for the antisymmetric mode. Substituting this into the general recurrence relations for $k\\ge2$ gives the characteristic equation for $x$: $x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$. The decaying solution is $x = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we use the boundary equations for $k=1$ to find the coefficients $A_{sym}$ and $A_{anti}$.\nSubstitute the general solution form into the KCL equation at $c_1$:\n$3(A_{sym}-A_{anti}x) - (A_{sym}-A_{anti}x^2) - (A_{sym}+A_{anti}x) = 0$\n$A_{sym}(3-1-1) + A_{anti}(-3x+x^2-x) = 0$\n$A_{sym} + A_{anti}(x^2-4x) = 0$\nSince $x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$, we have $x^2 - 4x = -1$.\nSo, $A_{sym} - A_{anti} = 0 \\implies A_{sym} = A_{anti}$.\n\nNext, substitute into the KCL equation at $d_1$:\n$2(A_{sym}+A_{anti}x) - (A_{sym}+A_{anti}x^2) - (A_{sym}-A_{anti}x) = r I_{test}$\n$A_{sym}(2-1-1) + A_{anti}(2x-x^2+x) = r I_{test}$\n$A_{anti}(3x-x^2) = r I_{test}$\nUsing $x^2 = 4x-1$:\n$A_{anti}(3x - (4x-1)) = A_{anti}(1-x) = r I_{test}$.\nSo, $A_{anti} = \\frac{r I_{test}}{1-x}$. Since $A_{sym}=A_{anti}$, we have found both coefficients.\n\n**5. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nNow we calculate $V_{a0}$ to find $R_{th}$.\n$V_{a0} = V_{d1} + r I_{test}$\n$V_{d1} = A_{sym} + A_{anti}x = A_{anti}(1+x)$\n$V_{a0} = A_{anti}(1+x) + r I_{test} = \\frac{r I_{test}}{1-x}(1+x) + r I_{test}$\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{a0}}{I_{test}}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r(1+x)}{1-x} + r = r \\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} + 1 \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{1+x+1-x}{1-x} \\right) = \\frac{2r}{1-x}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $x=2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we substitute the calculated $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which is typically the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ in such problems."
