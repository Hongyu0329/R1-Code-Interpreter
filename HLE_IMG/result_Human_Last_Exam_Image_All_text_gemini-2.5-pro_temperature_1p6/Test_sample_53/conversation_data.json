    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the visual elements:** The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase painting, specifically in the red-figure style where figures are reserved in the red clay color against a black background. The scene depicts a dramatic event involving a chariot.\n    2.  **Identify the figures:** There are three main human figures.\n        *   A figure on the ground, a muscular, naked man who appears to have been run over by the chariot. He seems dead or dying.\n        *   A figure driving the chariot, wearing a patterned sleeve and a distinctive headdress (a Phrygian cap), holding the reins and a goad.\n        *   A figure next to the driver, dressed in flowing white robes, who is positioned as if stepping out of or leaning dramatically from the chariot. This is the \"figure leaving the chariot\" mentioned in the question.\n        *   Additionally, a large white wing is visible above the chariot, suggesting the presence of a supernatural being like a Fury (Erinys) or a personification of madness (Lyssa), overseeing the impious act.\n    3.  **Identify the narrative:** The scene is one of extreme violence and sacrilege: a chariot is being driven over a human body. This specific iconography is not common in mainstream Greek mythology but corresponds very closely to a famous Roman foundation legend.\n    4.  **Connect to mythology:** The scene depicts the story of **Tullia Minor**, the last queen of Rome. According to the Roman historian Livy, Tullia conspired with her lover, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, to overthrow and murder her own father, King Servius Tullius. After he was assassinated and his body left in the street, Tullia, in a display of shocking impiety, ordered her charioteer to drive her chariot directly over her father's corpse. The street was thereafter known as the *Vicus Sceleratus* (\"Street of Crime\").\n    5.  **Identify the specific figure:** In this scene, the man on the ground is King Servius Tullius. The figure driving is Tullia's charioteer. The woman in the white robes, leaning out and gesturing imperiously, is Tullia Minor herself, compelling the driver to commit the heinous act. Her dynamic pose, leaning far out of the chariot, is what the question describes as \"leaving the chariot.\"\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The vase is an Apulian (South Italian) volute-krater from around 330 BCE, a region where Greek and early Roman cultures were in contact, explaining the depiction of a Roman legend on a Greek-style vase.\n    *   The \"oriental\" or Phrygian dress of the charioteer is a common artistic convention in South Italian vase painting for various non-Greek characters, and here it simply denotes him as a servant or foreigner.\n    *   The question identifies the figure by her action (\"leaving the chariot\"). This points specifically to the robed female figure due to her dramatic posture, which implies motion and command.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    The figure leaving (or, more accurately, leaning dramatically out of) the chariot is the Roman queen Tullia Minor.\n\n<<<Tullia>>>"
