    "This is an analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the musical piece.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations (Key, Tempo, Time Signature):**\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time (common time), indicated by the 'C' symbol.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature. This suggests the key of D major or its relative minor, B minor. Looking at the first measure, the left-hand chord is a B minor chord (B-D-F#), and the piece consistently uses chords and melodic fragments from the B minor scale. This strongly indicates the key is B minor.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (â™©= 80), which is a moderately slow tempo (Andante/Moderato).\n\n2.  **Melodic and Harmonic Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2 (The Opening):** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano). The left hand plays a low B minor chord. The right hand plays a very distinct and memorable four-note rising melody: F#, G, A, B. This melody is a crucial identifying feature. In measure 2, this theme is echoed an octave lower in the left hand. This quiet, ominous opening is very characteristic.\n    *   **Measure 3 (The Shift):** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic changes abruptly to *f* (forte). The texture becomes dense and fast, with both hands playing sixteenth-note patterns. This creates a feeling of high energy and tension, a stark contrast to the opening.\n    *   **Subsequent Measures (Development):** The rest of the excerpt continues this high-energy, virtuosic style.\n        *   The right hand plays fast, descending arpeggios and scale fragments.\n        *   The left hand plays powerful, driving broken chords, often outlining a B minor harmony.\n        *   The combination of rapid notes, dense chords, and loud dynamics suggests a powerful, climactic section of music. The style is reminiscent of a rock-infused orchestral piece arranged for a solo, virtuosic piano.\n\n3.  **Putting it Together (Identification):**\n    *   The quiet, chanting-like opening in B minor (F#-G-A-B) is extremely iconic.\n    *   The immediate transition to a loud, fast, rock-opera style section is the other major clue.\n    *   These musical elements are the defining characteristics of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the famous final boss theme from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*.\n    *   The opening four notes correspond to the \"Se-phi-roth!\" chant heard in the original orchestral version. The subsequent energetic section is a piano arrangement of the main, fast-paced part of the theme.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Genre:** Video game music, specifically a piano arrangement of an orchestral/rock piece.\n*   **Composer:** Nobuo Uematsu.\n*   **Source Game:** *Final Fantasy VII*.\n*   **Key Identifying Feature:** The F#-G-A-B melodic motif over a B minor chord.\n*   **Structural Feature:** The extreme dynamic contrast between the quiet opening and the loud, fast main section.\n*   **Instrument:** This is clearly a solo piano arrangement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe musical evidence overwhelmingly points to a single, well-known piece. The key signature, opening melody, and dramatic structural shift are all unmistakable trademarks of \"One-Winged Angel.\"\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
