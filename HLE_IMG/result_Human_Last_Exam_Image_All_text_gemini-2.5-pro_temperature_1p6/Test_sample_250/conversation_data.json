    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Key and Meter**\n    *   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or F minor.\n    *   The first chord is an F minor chord (F-), strongly suggesting the piece is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The time signature is handwritten but appears to be 4/4 common time.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Melody and Chord Progression (A Section)**\n    *   The piece begins with a pickup. The first full measure starts with the notes C, C, E♭, D over an F minor chord.\n    *   The melodic line in the first eight bars is very distinctive: C, C, E♭, D | D♭, D♭... | C, C... | B♭... | B...| C... This sequence of notes, especially the chromatic movement and rhythm, is a strong identifier.\n    *   The chord progression in the A section is: | F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 | G7 | C7 | F- | C7 |. While some of these chord spellings might be from a specific arrangement and differ from the most common versions (e.g., E-7♭5, E♭-6), the overall harmonic movement points to a specific tune.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Melody and Chord Progression (B Section)**\n    *   The B section begins after the first ending. The chord progression is a series of \"ii-V\" patterns: | D-7♭5 G7 | C7 F7 | B♭-7 E♭7 | A♭ ...|.\n    *   The melody in this section also follows a recognizable pattern, moving through the changes of the new key centers implied by the ii-V progressions. This structure of a Latin-feel A section followed by a swinging B section built on ii-V's is characteristic of the piece in question.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the Tune and Composer**\n    *   Based on the highly recognizable melody in both the A and B sections, the overall AABA-like structure, and the characteristic shift from a Latin feel to a swing feel between sections, the piece is identifiable as the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\".\n    *   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the renowned jazz pianist and composer Horace Silver.\n\n<<<The title is \"Nica's Dream\" and the composer is Horace Silver.>>>"
