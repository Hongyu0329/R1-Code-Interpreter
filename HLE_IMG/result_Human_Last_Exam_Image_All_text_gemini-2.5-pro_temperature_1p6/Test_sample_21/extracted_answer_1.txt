The fiscal expansion will have no impact on the country's current account balance. The current account balance is defined as national saving minus investment (CA = S - I). A debt-financed fiscal expansion reduces government saving. However, the problem explicitly states that this decrease in government saving is completely offset by an increase in private saving. As a result, total national saving (private + government) remains unchanged. With no change in national saving and assuming no change in investment, the current account balance will also remain unchanged.
