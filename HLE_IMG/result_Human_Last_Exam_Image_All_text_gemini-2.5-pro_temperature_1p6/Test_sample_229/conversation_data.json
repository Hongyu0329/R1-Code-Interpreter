    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song:\n\n**1. Analysis of Musical Notation:**\n\n*   **Time Signature:** 4/4, indicating four beats per measure.\n*   **Key Signature:** No sharps or flats are present in the key signature. The piece starts and ends with a C major chord, strongly suggesting the key is C major.\n*   **Tempo:** \"Mod.\" is written at the top, an abbreviation for \"Moderato,\" meaning a moderate tempo. A metronome marking of \"J=128\" (or quarter note = 128 beats per minute) is also provided, indicating a lively, upbeat pace.\n*   **Melody:** The melody is characterized by syncopation (rhythms that emphasize off-beats) and frequent use of eighth notes. The opening melodic phrase in the first two measures is very distinct: E-E G-G F-E-D-C. This energetic and syncopated melody is a key identifier.\n*   **Harmony (Chords):** The chord progression includes standard major and minor chords, as well as several seventh chords (E7, G7, C7) and a diminished chord (F#dim). The progression, such as C moving to E7, is characteristic of certain popular and jazz-influenced styles. For example, E7 acts as a secondary dominant, leading to the A minor chord seen later in the piece.\n*   **Structure:** The sheet music includes instructions like \"D.S. al Coda\" (indicated by the \"To Go Out - Take D.S. To Coda\" and the segno symbol 𝄋) and a \"CODA\" section. This indicates a standard song form with repeats and a special ending.\n\n**2. Identification Process:**\n\n*   **Melody Recognition:** The opening melody is extremely famous. It is the signature theme of the song \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\".\n*   **Style Identification:** The combination of a fast tempo, syncopated rhythm, and a particular harmonic flavor (mixing major key tonality with chromatic chords like E7 in the key of C) is the hallmark of the **Choro** musical style. Choro is a lively, instrumental Brazilian genre that predates Samba and Bossa Nova. It is often described as \"Brazilian ragtime\" due to its syncopation.\n*   **Origin:** Knowing the title \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" leads directly to its origin. The song was composed in 1917 by the Brazilian composer Zequinha de Abreu. Therefore, the country of origin is **Brazil**.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and tempo markings, the piece of music is identified as follows:\n\n*   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n*   **Musical Style:** Choro\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fubá\nMusical Style: Choro\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
