    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The provided pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its operation for an input array `a` and size `n`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the subarray is considered sorted, and the function does nothing and returns.\n    *   **Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The function first calls itself to sort the prefix of the array, i.e., the first `n-1` elements `a[0...n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the prefix is sorted, it compares the last element of the current subarray, `a[n-1]`, with the new last element of the sorted prefix, `a[n-2]`.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it means it's out of place, so it's swapped with `a[n-2]`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial step. If a swap was made, the element that was originally at `a[n-1]` is now at position `n-2`. This might disrupt the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. Therefore, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n-1)` *again* to re-sort the entire prefix.\n\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The worst-case time complexity occurs when the maximum amount of work is done at each step. In this algorithm, the work is maximized when the `if` condition (`a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`) is true for every recursive call where `n > 1`. This forces the second call to `sort(a, n - 1)` to execute every time.\n    This scenario happens when the array is sorted in reverse (descending) order. For example, `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. When `sort(a, 5)` is called, `sort(a, 4)` will be called. It will eventually sort `a[0...3]` to be `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, with the original `1` at `a[4]`. Then `a[4] < a[3]` (`1 < 5`) will be true, a swap will occur, and `sort(a, 4)` will be called again on a prefix that now contains the `1`. This pattern will repeat down the line.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation for the Worst Case:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the swap happens, and the second call `sort(a, n - 1)` is made, which also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let's expand the relation to find the pattern:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   After `k` expansions: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    We can solve this by expanding all the way down to the base case `T(1)`. Let `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3) + ... + 1)`\n\n    The sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series that equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `d`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    `T(n) = d*2^(n-1) + c*2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (d+c)*2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    As `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `(d+c)*2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, we ignore constants and lower-order terms.\n    Therefore, `T(n) = O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm always calls itself on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), so it is guaranteed to eventually reach the base case (`n <= 1`) and terminate. Thus, option F is incorrect.\n*   **Best Case vs. Worst Case:** It's important not to confuse the best case with the worst case. In the best case (an already sorted array), the second recursive call is never made. The recurrence becomes `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)`, which results in `O(n)` complexity. The question explicitly asks for the *worst case*.\n*   **Meaning of `T(n-1)`:** The expression `T(n-1)` represents the entire cost of sorting a problem of size `n-1`, not just a single step. The algorithm's inefficiency comes from having to *completely re-sort* the prefix if a single swap is made, which is what the second `T(n-1)` term represents.\n*   **Comparison to Other Sorts:** This algorithm is far less efficient than common `O(n^2)` sorts like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort. The \"start over from scratch\" nature of the recursion leads to an exponential explosion in the number of operations.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nThe worst-case behavior is modeled by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)`. This is a classic recurrence relation whose solution is of exponential order, specifically `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
