    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and Goal:**\n    The circuit contains a voltage source V2 and five resistors: R1, R2, R3, R7, and R8.\n    *   Voltage Source V2 = 1 V\n    *   Resistor R1 = 3 Ω\n    *   Resistor R2 = 7 Ω\n    *   Resistor R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   Resistor R7 = 100 Ω\n    *   Resistor R8 = 100 Ω\n    The goal is to find the total current supplied by the voltage source V2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Topology:**\n    We need to understand how the components are connected. Let's define the top wire connected to the positive terminal of V2 as Node A (at +1 V) and the bottom wire connected to the negative terminal (ground) as Node B (at 0 V).\n    *   The resistors R1, R2, and R3 appear to be in series.\n    *   The resistors R7 and R8 are in series.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** There are additional connecting wires that significantly alter the circuit.\n        *   There is a wire connecting the point between R1 and R2 directly to Node A (the top wire). A component is \"short-circuited\" or \"shorted\" when a wire provides a path of zero resistance across it. Since both terminals of R1 are connected to Node A, the voltage across R1 is zero. Therefore, R1 is short-circuited and can be removed from the analysis.\n        *   Similarly, there is a wire connecting the point between R2 and R3 directly to Node B (the bottom ground wire). This short-circuits R3, as both of its terminals are connected to Node B. The voltage across R3 is zero, and it can also be removed from the analysis.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Circuit:**\n    With R1 and R3 shorted out, the circuit simplifies as follows:\n    *   **Left Branch:** The top of resistor R2 is connected to Node A, and its bottom is connected to Node B. Thus, R2 is directly in parallel with the voltage source V2.\n    *   **Right Branch:** Resistors R7 and R8 are in series. This series combination is connected with its top end (top of R8) to Node A and its bottom end (bottom of R7) to Node B. So, this branch is also in parallel with the voltage source V2.\n    *   The simplified circuit consists of two parallel branches connected to the 1V source.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Current in Each Parallel Branch:**\n    We can calculate the current flowing through each branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n    *   **Branch 1 (with R2):**\n        *   The voltage across this branch is V = 1 V.\n        *   The resistance is R_branch1 = R2 = 7 Ω.\n        *   The current through this branch is I1 = V / R_branch1 = 1 V / 7 Ω.\n    *   **Branch 2 (with R7 and R8):**\n        *   First, calculate the total resistance of this series branch: R_branch2 = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n        *   The voltage across this branch is V = 1 V.\n        *   The current through this branch is I2 = V / R_branch2 = 1 V / 200 Ω.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Current:**\n    The total current flowing from the source V2 is the sum of the currents in the two parallel branches (according to Kirchhoff's Current Law).\n    *   I_total = I1 + I2\n    *   I_total = (1/7) A + (1/200) A\n    *   To add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 7 * 200 = 1400.\n    *   I_total = (200/1400) A + (7/1400) A\n    *   I_total = 207 / 1400 A\n\n6.  **Acquire the Final Numerical Answer:**\n    *   Convert the fraction to a decimal: I_total = 207 ÷ 1400 A ≈ 0.147857 A.\n    *   Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.148 A.\n\n<<<0.148 A>>>"
