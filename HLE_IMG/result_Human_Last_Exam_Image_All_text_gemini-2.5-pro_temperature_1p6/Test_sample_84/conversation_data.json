    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the corresponding city's coat of arms.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruction of the Coat of Arms**\nThe first step is to carefully analyze the key heraldic elements presented in the image:\n\n*   **The Shield (Escutcheon):** This is the central and most important element.\n    *   **Division:** The shield is divided horizontally into two equal parts. In heraldic terms, this is called \"per fess\".\n    *   **Colors (Tinctures):** The top half is blue (*azure*), and the bottom half is gold/yellow (*or*).\n    *   **Symbols (Charges):**\n        *   In the top blue section, there is a golden crescent moon. Its horns are pointing to the viewer's left (heraldic dexter).\n        *   In the bottom gold section, there is a prominent black crab (*sable*).\n\n*   **The Crown:** Above the shield is a decorative crown, which appears to be a mix between a mural crown (often used for cities) and a more regal crown. It is silver with gold accents.\n\n*   **The Wreath/Supporters:** The shield is flanked by two branches that cross at the bottom.\n    *   On the left (from the viewer's perspective), there is an olive branch with black olives.\n    *   On the right, there is an oak branch with acorns.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Key Search Terms**\nThe most unique and identifying features are the contents of the shield: the horizontal blue and gold division, the crescent moon, and the crab. The crown and branches are often decorative additions that can vary between depictions. The core search query would focus on \"coat of arms\", \"crab\", \"crescent moon\", and the colors \"blue and gold\".\n\n**Step 3: Research and Comparison**\nA search for a coat of arms featuring a crescent moon over a crab on a blue and gold shield leads to a specific city.\n\n*   The coat of arms of **Biograd na Moru**, a city in Croatia, perfectly matches the description of the shield.\n*   The official coat of arms of Biograd na Moru is blazoned (formally described) as: \"Per fess Azure and Or, in chief a crescent Argent and in base a crab Sable\".\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Shield:** The shield in the image is a direct match for the shield of Biograd na Moru (blue over gold).\n    *   **Charges:** A crescent moon is on the blue field, and a black crab is on the gold field, just as in the Biograd na Moru arms. (Note: The official version often has a silver/argent crescent, but yellow/or is a common variation, and the image uses gold).\n    *   **External Ornaments:** The official modern version of the city's arms uses a silver mural crown (a crown shaped like city walls) and is sometimes flanked by an olive and a grapevine branch. The image shows an olive and an oak branch, and a more generic crown. These are stylistic variations, but the core identity of the shield remains the same.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe heraldic design on the shield in the provided image is fundamentally identical to the coat of arms of the city of Biograd na Moru in Croatia. The variations in the crown and the specific branches used for the wreath are artistic interpretations, but the core elements that define the coat of arms point unequivocally to this city.\n\n<<<Biograd na Moru>>>"
