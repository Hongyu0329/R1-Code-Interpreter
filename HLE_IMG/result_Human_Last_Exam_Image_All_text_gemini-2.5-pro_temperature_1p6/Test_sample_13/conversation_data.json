    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Identify the Target Squares and Immediate Clues**\n*   Let the two top white squares be designated as `A` (left) and `B` (right).\n*   The clue to the left of these squares is `10`. This is a horizontal sum. Thus, `A + B = 10`.\n*   The numbers must be unique digits from 1 to 9. The possible pairs for (A, B) are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6) and their reverses.\n\n**2. Analyze the Columns for A and B**\n*   **Column with A:** The clue directly above square `A` is `17`. This is a vertical sum. The block of white squares under this clue continues until it hits the next black square. Looking at the grid, this column consists of square `A` and the square directly below it (let's call it `C`). So, `A + C = 17`.\n    *   For two unique digits to sum to 17, the only possible pair is `{8, 9}`.\n    *   Therefore, the pair of cells `{A, C}` must be `{8, 9}`.\n*   **Column with B:** The clue directly above square `B` is `29`. This is a vertical sum. This column consists of square `B` and the square directly below it (let's call it `D`). So, `B + D = 29`.\n    *   The maximum possible sum for two unique digits from 1-9 is `9 + 8 = 17`.\n    *   A sum of 29 for two cells is impossible under standard Kakuro rules. This indicates a flaw or typo in the puzzle's clues. The same issue exists with other clues like the horizontal sum of `27` for two cells and `28` for three cells.\n\n**3. Combine Valid Clues to Reduce Possibilities**\nSince the puzzle has flaws, we must proceed by using the clues that are logically possible and see if they constrain the solution. We will use the valid equations derived so far:\n1.  `A + B = 10`\n2.  `A + C = 17`\n\nFrom `A + C = 17`, we know that `A` must be either 8 or 9. We can use this to determine the possible values for `A` and `B`.\n\n*   **Case 1:** If `A = 8`.\n    *   From `A + C = 17`, `C` must be `9`.\n    *   From `A + B = 10`, `B` must be `2`.\n    *   In this scenario, the top squares `{A, B}` would be `{8, 2}`.\n\n*   **Case 2:** If `A = 9`.\n    *   From `A + C = 17`, `C` must be `8`.\n    *   From `A + B = 10`, `B` must be `1`.\n    *   In this scenario, the top squares `{A, B}` would be `{9, 1}`.\n\nSo far, we have two possible pairs for the top squares: `{8, 2}` or `{9, 1}`.\n\n**4. Use the Next Row to Resolve the Ambiguity**\nLet's analyze the row below `A` and `B`.\n*   This row contains cells `C`, `D`, and another cell to the right, `E`.\n*   The clue for this row is `22`. So, `C + D + E = 22`.\n\nLet's test our two cases against this equation:\n\n*   **Testing Case 1 (`A=8, B=2, C=9`)**:\n    *   We substitute `C=9` into the equation: `9 + D + E = 22`, which simplifies to `D + E = 13`.\n    *   The digits in this row sum (`C,D,E`) must be unique. `C` is 9, so `D` and `E` cannot be 9.\n    *   Possible pairs for `{D,E}` summing to 13 (without using 9) are `{5, 8}` and `{6, 7}`.\n    *   This leaves two possibilities for the pair `{D,E}`, so this case remains ambiguous.\n\n*   **Testing Case 2 (`A=9, B=1, C=8`)**:\n    *   We substitute `C=8` into the equation: `8 + D + E = 22`, which simplifies to `D + E = 14`.\n    *   The digits `C,D,E` must be unique. `C` is 8, so `D` and `E` cannot be 8.\n    *   The possible pairs of unique digits that sum to 14 are `{5, 9}` and `{6, 8}`.\n    *   Since `D` and `E` cannot be 8, the pair `{6, 8}` is invalid.\n    *   This leaves only one possibility: the pair `{D, E}` must be `{5, 9}`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that only Case 2 (`A=9, B=1`) leads to a single, unambiguous solution for the cells in the second row. Assuming the puzzle is designed to have a unique logical path, this is the correct scenario. The fact that the puzzle contains impossible clues suggests that we should follow the path that resolves ambiguity where possible.\n\nTherefore, the numbers in the two top white squares are 9 and 1.\n\nThe two numbers are 9 and 1."
