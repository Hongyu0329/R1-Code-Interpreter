No. The framework defines salience through four components: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity. According to the text, these components are characteristics of the simulation's design and the information presented within it (e.g., physical availability of information, audiovisual cues, complexity of data). The provided text and diagram do not mention or show any dependency on the learner's individual differences, such as prior knowledge or cognitive abilities, as a factor that shapes salience within this specific framework.
