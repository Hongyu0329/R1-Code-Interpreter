    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae than females. In some groups, the male antennae are noticeably hooked or curled at the tip. Males typically have 13 antennal segments, while females have 12.\n*   **Abdomen:** Males have 7 visible abdominal segments, while females have 6. The tip of the abdomen is also a key indicator. Females have a stinger (a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying tube), which can make the abdomen tip look pointed. Males lack a stinger, and their abdomen tip may be rounded, blunt, or adorned with spines or claspers for mating.\n*   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (especially the clypeus, the plate above the mandibles), while females have dark or black faces.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** In non-parasitic bees, females have specialized hairs for collecting pollen, usually on the hind legs or the underside of the abdomen. Males lack these structures. The question specifies that the images are from taxa without scopae on their legs, guiding us to look at groups like wasps, cuckoo bees, or bees that collect pollen on their abdomen (ventral scopa).\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites (they lay eggs in the nests of other bees) and thus, females do not have pollen-collecting scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Left Insect (A-left):** The abdomen is strongly tapered to a sharp point. This elongated, cone-shaped abdomen is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*. She uses this pointed abdomen to pierce the cell walls of her host's nest to lay an egg.\n*   **Right Insect (A-right):** The abdomen is truncated and ends in multiple prominent spines or teeth. This is the characteristic abdominal structure of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, and both sexes visit flowers for nectar, fitting the description.\n*   **Left Insect (B-left):** The antennae are relatively short and straight. The tip of the abdomen is pointed, consistent with a female's stinger.\n*   **Right Insect (B-right):** The antennae are visibly longer than the female's and, most tellingly, are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps. The tip of his abdomen is also blunter than the female's.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). This group is famous for its extreme sexual dimorphism.\n*   **Left Insect (C-left):** The most striking feature is the extremely long antennae, which are longer than the insect's head and thorax combined. The face also has a prominent yellow patch (the clypeus). These are classic features of a male long-horned bee. Males lack scopae.\n*   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee has much shorter, \"normal\"-length antennae. The face appears to be dark. These features are characteristic of a female long-horned bee. While females of this group typically have very large scopae on their hind legs (which contradicts the prompt), the sexual dimorphism in antenna length and face color is unambiguous. We prioritize these clear visual cues.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Pair A is (Female, Male), which is index **4**.\n*   Pair B is (Female, Male), which is index **4**.\n*   Pair C is (Male, Female), which is index **3**.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
