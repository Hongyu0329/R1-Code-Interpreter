    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms in the image:** The photograph displays a community of marine invertebrates on a dark, wet rock, characteristic of a rocky intertidal zone. The visible organisms include:\n    *   Numerous acorn barnacles, which are sessile crustaceans.\n    *   Several species of marine snails (gastropods). Notably, there is a large snail with a brownish, striped shell, another large snail with a plain, whitish shell, and several smaller, darker snails.\n\n2.  **Analyze the question's requirement:** The goal is to find a single species whose presence *definitively* places the location on an Atlantic coast rather than a Pacific coast. This requires identifying a species from the photo that has a specific geographic distribution limited to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential candidate species based on their appearance and known distributions:**\n    *   **Acorn Barnacles:** The barnacles resemble the common Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. However, this species is found on rocky shores in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific. Therefore, it cannot be used to distinguish between the two oceans.\n    *   **Whitish Snail:** This snail could be a Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This species is indeed native to the North Atlantic coasts of both North America and Europe. While it has been introduced to a few locations on the Pacific coast, it is primarily an Atlantic species. It is a strong candidate.\n    *   **Striped Snail:** The most distinct snail has a robust, conical-globose shell with fine, brownish spiral stripes on a lighter background. This morphology is a classic match for the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   **Small Dark Snails:** These are likely other periwinkle species, such as the Rough Periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*), which is also found in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific, making it an unsuitable indicator.\n\n4.  **Select the most definitive indicator species:** Let's compare the best candidates, the Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*) and the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*).\n    *   *Nucella lapillus* is a good indicator, but it has established some small populations on the Pacific coast.\n    *   *Littorina littorea* is native to the coasts of Western Europe. It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and has since become one of the most abundant and widespread intertidal snails there. Crucially, it is not established on the Pacific coast of North America, with only a few very small, isolated, and non-breeding populations ever recorded (e.g., in San Francisco Bay).\n    *   Therefore, the presence of a healthy-looking *Littorina littorea* as part of a typical intertidal community is considered a definitive sign that the location is on an Atlantic coast (either European or North American).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The snail with the prominent stripes is identifiable as the Common Periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*. Its geographic range makes it the species that definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Many intertidal species are \"amphi-oceanic,\" meaning they exist in both the Atlantic and Pacific, so careful identification is needed.\n*   The possibility of introduced (invasive) species must be considered. In this case, the key indicator species (*Littorina littorea*) is itself an invasive species on the North American Atlantic coast, which solidifies its use as an indicator for that region.\n*   Visual identification must be certain enough to distinguish between similar-looking species with different geographic ranges. The shell shape and striped pattern of the snail in the photo are highly characteristic of *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
