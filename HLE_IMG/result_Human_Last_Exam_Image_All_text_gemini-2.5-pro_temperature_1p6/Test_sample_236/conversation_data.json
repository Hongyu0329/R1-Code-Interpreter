    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image shows a close-up of an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the primary subject, positioned in the center. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, indicating a natural, outdoor setting, likely a meadow or garden. The yellow flowers appear to be Goldenrod (*Solidago*), a common plant visited by many insects.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Animal's Features**\nThe animal is an insect, identifiable by its six legs, segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and a pair of antennae. Let's examine its specific characteristics:\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking pattern of black and reddish-orange.\n*   **Head:** The head is predominantly black, with large compound eyes. The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n*   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax just behind the head (the pronotum) is reddish-orange with a prominent black shape in the center.\n*   **Wings:** The wings are folded over the back. They are primarily reddish-orange with distinct black markings. There is a black triangular shape (the scutellum) visible at the base of the wings, and a wide black band running horizontally across the middle of the wings. This pattern of hardened forewings covering membranous hind wings is characteristic of \"true bugs\" (Order: Hemiptera).\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Comparing Features to Known Insect Species**\nThe combination of these features—the \"true bug\" body plan and the specific red/orange and black pattern—points towards the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. Several species in this family share this warning coloration (aposematism).\n\n*   One common candidate is the **Boxelder Bug** (*Boisea trivittata*), but its markings are different. Boxelder bugs have red lines on their thorax and wing edges, lacking the broad black band seen in the photo.\n*   Another candidate is the **Large Milkweed Bug** (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), which also has an orange and black pattern. However, the Large Milkweed Bug typically has a solid black band across its back and two black spots on the posterior end of its wings, a different pattern from the one pictured.\n*   The markings in the photograph—specifically the orange pronotum with a black central mark and the distinctive black band/X-shape across the wings—are the definitive field marks for the **Small Milkweed Bug**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming the Identification and Finding the Scientific Name**\nThe insect in the image is clearly identifiable as a Small Milkweed Bug. Consulting entomological resources confirms that the scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*. Although they are called \"milkweed bugs\" because their host plants are milkweeds (*Asclepias*), adults are also frequently found on other flowers, such as goldenrod, where they feed on nectar.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the visual evidence and comparison with known species, the animal depicted in the center of the image is a Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
