    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern:\n\n1.  **Identify the words of the poem.** An erasure poem is created by selecting words from a source text to form a new piece. In this visual collage poem, the poet has selected words by pasting them onto a background image, but has also left some of the original page's text visible and prominent. A comprehensive reading should consider all the key textual elements that form the new composition. These are:\n    *   The title from the original page: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n    *   The page number: \"35\"\n    *   The pasted words: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\".\n\n2.  **Arrange the words into a coherent sentence.** The \"American sentence\" form requires the poem to be a single sentence. We can arrange the identified words and numbers into a plausible poetic sentence:\n    *   \"The first step: thirty-five rules and lines work an intricate spider's web.\"\n    *   This sentence is grammatically viable in a poetic context, with \"thirty-five rules and lines\" acting as the subject and \"work\" as the verb.\n\n3.  **Count the syllables in the sentence.** To check if it fits the \"American sentence\" pattern, we must count the total number of syllables.\n    *   \"The first step\": The (1) + first (1) + step (1) = 3 syllables.\n    *   \"thirty-five\": thir- (1) + -ty (1) + five (1) = 3 syllables.\n    *   \"rules\": 1 syllable.\n    *   \"and\": 1 syllable.\n    *   \"lines\": 1 syllable.\n    *   \"work\": 1 syllable.\n    *   \"an intricate spider's web\": an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) = 7 syllables.\n    *   **Total syllables** = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = **17 syllables**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the findings.**\n    *   **A. free verse:** While the poem does not have a traditional repeating meter like iambic pentameter, it does adhere to a specific structural rule (a 17-syllable sentence), making \"free verse\" (which implies a lack of such rules) a less precise description.\n    *   **B. iambic pentameter:** Requires 10 syllables. Incorrect.\n    *   **C. alexandrine:** Requires 12 syllables. Incorrect.\n    *   **D. sapphic:** A complex stanzaic form; does not fit. Incorrect.\n    *   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** Requires about 6 syllables per line. Incorrect.\n    *   **F. american sentence:** This poetic form, created by Allen Ginsberg, is defined as a single, complete sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long. Our constructed sentence from the poem's visible text perfectly matches this definition.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** By interpreting the poem as a combination of the pasted words and the prominent text from the original page (\"THE FIRST STEP\" and \"35\"), we arrive at a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This precisely matches the metric pattern of an \"American sentence\".\n\n<<<F>>>"
