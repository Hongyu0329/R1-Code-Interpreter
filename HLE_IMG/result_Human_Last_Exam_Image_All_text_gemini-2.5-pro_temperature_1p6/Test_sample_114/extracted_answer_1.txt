The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of the münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. This rigidity prevents the intermediate from undergoing the reversible dimerization and substituent scrambling that is possible for the more flexible, acyclic münchnone in Reactions 1 and 2. The results from Reaction 2 prove that this scrambling process occurs for the acyclic intermediate. The result from Reaction 1 shows that the cycloaddition step itself is inherently regioselective. Therefore, in Reaction 3, a single, structurally "locked" intermediate reacts via an inherently selective pathway, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B).
