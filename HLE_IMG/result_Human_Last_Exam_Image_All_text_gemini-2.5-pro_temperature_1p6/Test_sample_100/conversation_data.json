    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's break it down into its constituent parts to count the atoms.\n*   **The Bicyclic Lactam Core:** This is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system substituted with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group.\n    *   Let's identify the atoms in the core structure without the PMB and CF3 groups first: It is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This has a skeleton of 6 carbons, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen, and several hydrogens.\n    *   Now let's count from the given structure which includes the CF3 group:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbons in the bicyclic skeleton (the two bridgeheads, one C=O, one CH2, and two C=C of the double bond). There is also one carbon in the CF3 group. Total = 7 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** One bridgehead CH, another bridgehead CH, one H on the double bond (C=CH), and a CH2 group. Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hydrogens.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 1 nitrogen atom in the ring.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 oxygen atom in the carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Fluorine (F):** 3 fluorine atoms in the CF3 group.\n    *   So, the formula for the core moiety (with CF3, but without the N-substituent) is C7H5F3NO.\n*   **The PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) Group:** This is a protecting group on the nitrogen atom. Its structure is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from CH2) + 6 (from the benzene ring) + 1 (from OCH3) = 8 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (from CH2) + 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from CH3) = 9 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 oxygen atom in the methoxy group.\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    *   C: 7 + 8 = 15\n    *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from nitrogen atoms. The PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in atoms:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Net change in C: -8\n    *   Net change in H: -9 + 1 = -8\n    *   Net change in F: 0\n    *   Net change in N: 0\n    *   Net change in O: -1\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C) by adding a molecule of hydrogen (H2). The lactam (amide) carbonyl group is typically not reduced under these conditions.\n*   **Change in atoms:** We add one molecule of H2.\n    *   Net change in C, F, N, O: 0\n    *   Net change in H: +2\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are conditions for the hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond within the ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the ring to form an amino acid (a molecule containing both an amine group and a carboxylic acid group).\n*   **Change in atoms:** We add one molecule of H2O.\n    *   Net change in C, F, N: 0\n    *   Net change in H: +2\n    *   Net change in O: +1\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**."
