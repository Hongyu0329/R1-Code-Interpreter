    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the artwork.**\n*   **Medium:** The image displays a high-relief sculpture. The smooth, somewhat glossy surface, typical for this kind of work, suggests it is made of glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata). This was a hallmark technique of a specific famous Florentine workshop.\n*   **Style:** The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school. The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and idealized beauty. The composition is balanced and harmonious, contained within a circular frame (a tondo).\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene is religious. A priest is administering a sacrament, which appears to be Holy Communion (the Eucharist), to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This is confirmed by the inscription on the cartouche at the bottom.\n*   **Inscription:** The inscription reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is a vernacular (likely an older form of Italian or French-influenced Italian) rendering of the Latin \"Sacramentum Altaris,\" which means \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This reinforces that the scene depicts the Eucharist.\n*   **Frame:** The central tondo is surrounded by a decorative border of fruit and leaves, another common feature of this type of Renaissance art.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the characteristics to a specific artist or workshop.**\n*   The technique of glazed terracotta relief is most famously associated with the **della Robbia family** workshop in Florence, active from the 15th to the 16th century.\n*   The founder, **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1400–1482), pioneered the technique. His style is known for its classicism and serenity.\n*   His nephew, **Andrea della Robbia** (1435–1525), inherited the workshop and developed the style further. His works are often more complex, with sweeter, more emotionally expressive figures, and he produced numerous altarpieces and tabernacles.\n*   Andrea's son, **Giovanni della Robbia** (1469–c. 1529), continued the workshop, often using more vibrant colors and moving towards a more crowded, Mannerist style.\n*   Comparing the style of the relief in the image to the known works of the della Robbia artists, the refined grace, sweet expressions of the figures, and the sophisticated composition strongly point to **Andrea della Robbia**. It is more complex and emotionally nuanced than Luca's work but lacks the occasional extravagance of Giovanni's later pieces.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the specific artwork and attribution.**\n*   This specific panel is a known detail from an altarpiece or tabernacle dedicated to the Sacraments. Andrea della Robbia and his workshop created several such works.\n*   This particular tondo depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" is widely attributed by art historians to Andrea della Robbia. It showcases his mature style and his mastery of the glazed terracotta medium. It is part of a larger altarpiece structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinctive medium (glazed terracotta), the High Renaissance style, the subject matter, and the specific artistic handling of the figures, the author of this altarpiece detail is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
