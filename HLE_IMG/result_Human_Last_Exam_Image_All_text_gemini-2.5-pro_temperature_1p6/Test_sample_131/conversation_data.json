    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the class of compound:** The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms within a complex, polycyclic ring system. This is characteristic of an alkaloid, a class of naturally occurring organic compounds that usually contain basic nitrogen atoms.\n2.  **Analyze the core skeleton:** The structure consists of four fused six-membered rings. This specific tetracyclic framework containing two nitrogen atoms is known as the quinolizidine alkaloid skeleton. More specifically, it is related to the parent compound sparteine.\n3.  **Identify functional groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in one of the rings. This ring also contains a nitrogen atom adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, which makes this functional group a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n4.  **Determine the specific compound:** The presence of the lactam group on the sparteine skeleton points towards a specific derivative. The compound where a methylene group (-CH2-) of sparteine is oxidized to a carbonyl group (-C=O) is known as an oxosparteine.\n5.  **Locate the position of the carbonyl group:** In the standard numbering for this class of alkaloids (lupin alkaloids), the carbonyl group is located at the C2 position. The sparteine derivative with an oxo group at the C2 position is called **lupanine**.\n6.  **Consider the stereochemistry:** Natural products like alkaloids are chiral and exist as specific stereoisomers. The stereochemistry shown in the diagram, with the specific arrangement of bonds (wedges and dashes) at the chiral centers, corresponds to the exact structure of the well-known alkaloid, lupanine. Specifically, it represents (-)-lupanine, the most common natural enantiomer.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing from similar alkaloids:** It's important to distinguish this structure from other related lupin alkaloids.\n    *   **Sparteine:** The parent compound, which lacks the oxygen atom.\n    *   **Î±-Isolupanine:** A stereoisomer (epimer) of lupanine, differing in the configuration at the C11 position.\n    *   **Matrine:** Another tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid, but with a different ring fusion pattern.\n*   **Common vs. Systematic Name:** While a complex systematic IUPAC name exists for this molecule, its universally recognized and common name in chemistry and pharmacology is lupanine. For natural products, the common name is almost always preferred.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton, the presence and position of the lactam functional group, and the specific stereochemistry, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
