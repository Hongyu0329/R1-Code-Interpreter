    # Step 1: Analyze the evidence for the number of genes in D. willistoni.
    # The text states that RNA-Seq density and tissue-specific expression differ
    # between the left and right elements. This pattern of differential regulation
    # is strong evidence that the two elements are not part of a single gene but are
    # in fact separate transcriptional units (i.e., separate genes).
    conclusion1 = "The two elements in D. willistoni are likely separate genes."

    # Step 2: Determine the ortholog/paralog relationship.
    # A gene duplication event occurred in the D. willistoni lineage. One of the resulting
    # genes is the ortholog of D. melanogaster's CG14879, and the other is a paralog.
    # We use the principle of parsimony (simplest evolutionary explanation) to decide.
    # The best candidate for the ortholog is the gene that most resembles the ancestral form.
    conclusion2_premise = "The ortholog should have a structure that is most similar (parsimonious) to CG14879 in D. melanogaster."

    # Step 3: Compare the structure of the D. willistoni elements to D. melanogaster's CG14879.
    # D. melanogaster's CG14879 most commonly has 2 CDSs.
    # The 'Right Element' in D. willistoni has well-supported predicted isoforms with 2 CDSs.
    # The possibility of a 3-CDS isoform in the Right Element is considered but dismissed due to a lack of strong evidence (e.g., poor alignment, no valid splice sites without modification).
    # Therefore, the Right Element's structure is a good match for CG14879.
    conclusion3 = "The Right Element's 2-CDS structure is parsimonious with D. melanogaster's CG14879."

    # Step 4: Formulate the final conclusion.
    # Based on the structural similarity, the Right Element is the best candidate for the ortholog.
    # Consequently, the Left Element is the paralog.
    final_conclusion = "The Right Element is the likely ortholog, and the Left Element is the likely paralog."

    # Step 5: Select the best answer choice that encapsulates these findings.
    # Answer P states: "The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely a ortholog of CG14879,
    # because of the number of CDSs is more parsimonious between species for the right element.
    # The elements are likely part of separate genes."
    # This choice correctly identifies the ortholog/paralog relationship, provides the correct reasoning (parsimony of CDS count),
    # and includes the initial conclusion that the elements are separate genes.
