  This function analyzes the visual evidence to identify the correct nyala.

  Analysis Steps:
  1. The target nyala has a specific pattern of white spots on its rear flank: a main cluster of 3-4 spots located high up, and another smaller, isolated spot below and slightly forward of the main cluster.
  2. The stripes on the target are thin and distinct.
  3. The horns have a specific shape and curvature.
  4. Image A shows a nyala with different horn shape and lighter coloration.
  5. Image C has very different, bold stripes and coloration, likely due to lighting but appearing distinct from the target.
  6. Image D has a different horn shape and spot pattern on the flank.
  7. Image E lacks the specific spot cluster seen on the target.
  8. Image F is too obscured for a reliable comparison of the key features.
  9. Image B shows a nyala whose spot pattern on the rear flank perfectly matches the target's: the high cluster and the lower isolated spot are both present and in the same configuration. The visible stripes and horn shape are also consistent with the target.
  Therefore, image B shows the same individual.

# The final answer is B because the pattern of white spots on its flank and hip
# is a precise match to the target image. Both have a distinct cluster of spots
# high on the hip with a single, separate spot below and slightly forward of the cluster.
# This unique pattern is the most reliable feature for re-identification.
