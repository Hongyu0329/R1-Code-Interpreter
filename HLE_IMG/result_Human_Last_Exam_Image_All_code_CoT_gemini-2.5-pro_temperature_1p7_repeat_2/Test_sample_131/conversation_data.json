    "This task requires me to identify the chemical compound from the provided image and then present the name using a Python script, as per the instructions.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Chemical Structure:** I will examine the provided image, which shows the skeletal structure of an organic molecule. I'll note the key features:\n    *   It's a polycyclic system (four fused rings).\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms, making it an amine and likely an alkaloid.\n    *   It has a carbonyl group (C=O) as part of an amide bond within a ring (a lactam).\n    *   I will recognize the specific ring system and stereochemistry.\n2.  **Identify the Compound:** Based on these features, I can identify the common name of this well-known alkaloid. The structure is that of lupanine, an alkaloid found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n3.  **Create Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of the compound in a variable and then prints it to the console. This fulfills the requirement of providing a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the alkaloid compound from the provided image and prints its name.\n    \n    The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid containing a lactam moiety.\n    This specific compound is known as Lupanine.\n    Chemical Formula: C15H24N2O\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
