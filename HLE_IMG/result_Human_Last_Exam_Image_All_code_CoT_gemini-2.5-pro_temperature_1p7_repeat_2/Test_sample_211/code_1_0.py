# The user wants me to identify the bird from the image.
# Based on a detailed visual comparison of the feather patterns,
# especially the unique scalloped design on the back and wings,
# and subtle irregularities, the correct match is identified.

# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the distinct feather pattern of the 'Target' bird.
# 2. Systematically compare this pattern with each of the options (A-I).
# 3. Identify the option with the identical pattern, posture, and subtle markings.
# 4. The bird in image 'E' has a pattern that is an exact match to the target.

correct_option = 'E'

print(f"The image that shows the same bird as the target is: {correct_option}")
