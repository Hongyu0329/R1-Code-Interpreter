    "The stability and, consequently, the lifetime of iridium complexes in devices like LECs are highly dependent on their molecular structure. A key factor is the nature and position of substituents on the ligands.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four complexes share the same core structure: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `(N^N)` is the 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand and `(C^N)` is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand. The only difference between them is the fluorine substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the `(C^N)` ligand.\n2.  **Apply Chemical Principles:** The lifetime of these emitters is related to their stability against degradation.\n    *   Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing, which generally strengthens the Carbon-Iridium (C-Ir) bond and makes the complex more resistant to oxidation. This leads to *longer* lifetimes.\n    *   However, there is a well-documented exception: when a fluorine atom is placed at the position *ortho* to the C-Ir bond (the C3' position on the phenyl ring), it often leads to steric or electronic strain that can open up new degradation pathways. This specific substitution pattern is known to decrease the operational stability and result in *shorter* lifetimes.\n3.  **Identify Unstable Complexes:** We will inspect each complex to see if it contains this destabilizing ortho-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 1 & 2:** Have fluorine atoms at meta and/or para positions. They lack the ortho-fluorine and are expected to be relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 3 & 4:** Both contain a fluorine atom at the ortho-position (C3'). Therefore, they are expected to be less stable and exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n4.  **Code Execution:** The following Python script will systematically apply this rule to identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef find_shorter_lifetime_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies iridium complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes based on\n    the position of fluorine substituents.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data representing the fluorine atom positions on the phenyl ring for each complex.\n    # The C-Ir bond is at position C2'. The critical 'ortho' position is C3'.\n    # A list of numbers represents the positions of the fluorine atoms.\n    complex_structures = {\n        '1': [4, 5],  # No ortho-fluorine\n        '2': [4],     # No ortho-fluorine\n        '3': [3],     # Contains an ortho-fluorine\n        '4': [3, 4, 5] # Contains an ortho-fluorine\n    }\n\n    destabilizing_position = 3\n    shorter_lifetime_list = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing complexes based on the rule: Fluorine at the ortho-position (C3') shortens lifetime.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Sort keys to ensure consistent output order\n    for complex_id in sorted(complex_structures.keys()):\n        positions = complex_structures[complex_id]\n        if destabilizing_position in positions:\n            shorter_lifetime_list.append(int(complex_id))\n            print(f\"Complex {complex_id}: Found a destabilizing fluorine at position {destabilizing_position}. -> Shorter lifetime expected.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Complex {complex_id}: No fluorine at position {destabilizing_position}. -> Longer lifetime expected.\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Conclusion: The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are:\")\n    # Using print to show the final equation/list as requested.\n    # We output each number in the final selection.\n    print(f\"Final List = [{', '.join(map(str, shorter_lifetime_list))}]\")\n\n\nfind_shorter_lifetime_complexes()\n```\n<<<J>>>"
