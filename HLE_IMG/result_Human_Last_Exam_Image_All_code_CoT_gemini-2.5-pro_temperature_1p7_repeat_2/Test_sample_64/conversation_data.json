    "Based on my analysis of the image, the three panels (L, M, N) show a time-lapse sequence of a biological process. My plan is to describe what is happening in each panel and then identify the overall process. I will then create a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel L:** This panel shows a straight, multicellular filament, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga. An arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall separating two cells.\n2.  **Analyze Panel M:** This panel shows the same filament at a later time. A new outgrowth or bulge has appeared on the side of the cell just below the septum that was indicated in panel L. The arrowhead in this panel points directly to this initial bulge.\n3.  **Analyze Panel N:** In this final panel, the bulge has grown significantly, forming a new, distinct side branch. The main filament appears to be bending at the point where the new branch emerged.\n4.  **Synthesize the Process:** The sequence L -> M -> N clearly illustrates the formation of a new branch from a pre-existing filament. In mycology (the study of fungi), this process is known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to grow and expand their network (mycelium).\n5.  **Create Python Code:** I will now write a Python script that prints this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef describe_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function analyzes the provided image sequence and prints a description of the biological process being depicted.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal Branching\"\n  description = (\n      \"The process depicted in the image sequence (L, M, N) is Hyphal Branching.\\n\\n\"\n      \"This is a common growth process in filamentous fungi. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\\n\"\n      \"- Image L: Shows a mature hyphal filament. The arrowhead points to a location on the filament before branching begins.\\n\"\n      \"- Image M: A new point of growth has been established, and a small bulge, the incipient branch, emerges from the side of the parent hypha. The arrowhead highlights this initial outgrowth.\\n\"\n      \"- Image N: The new branch has elongated, becoming a distinct side branch off the main filament.\"\n  )\n  \n  print(f\"The process is: {process_name}\\n\")\n  print(\"Explanation:\")\n  print(description)\n\ndescribe_biological_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
