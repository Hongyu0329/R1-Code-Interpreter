        "Based on the provided diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for "
        "the V-domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). The arrow "
        "originating from S100B points directly to the 'V' immunoglobulin-like domain, which is "
        "the most distal part of the RAGE receptor's extracellular portion."

    marker_explanation = (
        "Regarding its clinical utility, S100B is best characterized as a prognostic marker "

    reasoning_points = [
        "1. Lack of Diagnostic Specificity: The text notes that S100B is over-expressed in "
        "multiple distinct conditions, including Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and "
        "even cardiovascular disease. Since elevated levels are not unique to a single illness, "
        "S100B is not a specific diagnostic marker.",
        
        "2. Correlation with Disease Progression and Severity: The signaling pathway clearly shows "
        "that S100B activation leads directly to critical pathological outcomes such as "
        "neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Consequently, the concentration "
        "of S100B is expected to correlate directly with the severity of this damage. A marker that "
        "provides information about the likely course or outcome of a disease is, by definition, "
        "a prognostic marker. By measuring S100B, a researcher can forecast the progression and "
        "severity of the neurological pathology."
