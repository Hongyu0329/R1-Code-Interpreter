    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction.
    # The reaction is the sulfonation of the Pr-DAOTA cation using concentrated sulfuric acid.
    # This introduces sulfonic acid (-SO3H) groups onto the aromatic rings,
    # which is consistent with the product being water-soluble.

    # Step 2: Identify the most deshielded proton.
    # The most deshielded proton in the molecule is the one on the central, electron-deficient
    # pyridinium-like ring. Let's call it H_A. Its position within a cationic system makes it
    # extremely electron-poor and thus highly deshielded. The addition of two strongly
    # electron-withdrawing -SO3H groups to the outer rings further deshields H_A.

    # Step 3: Determine the integration of this proton's signal.
    # There is only one such proton (H_A) in the entire molecular structure.
    integration = 1

    # Step 4: Determine the splitting pattern of this proton's signal.
    # The splitting pattern is determined by the number of adjacent protons (n).
    # The H_A proton has no protons on its neighboring carbon atoms; its neighbors
    # are quaternary carbons involved in ring fusions.
    # Therefore, n = 0.
    # According to the n+1 rule, the splitting pattern is n + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 peak, which is a singlet.
    splitting_pattern = "Singlet"
