    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Figure:** The image shows a large circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex (let's call it O). The sector is defined by a radius R=34. The total angle of the sector is divided into four equal angles, each labeled θ. So, the total angle is 4θ. There are two shaded regions, one blue and one red. The question asks for the total area of these shaded regions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Blue Shaded Region:**\n    *   The blue region is associated with the leftmost part of the sector, corresponding to an angle of 2θ. Let the leftmost point on the arc be P₀ and the point separating the blue and red parts be P₂. The blue region is constructed within the sector OP₀P₂.\n    *   The diagram shows a right angle formed by a line segment drawn from P₂ perpendicular to the radius OP₀. Let's call the intersection point H.\n    *   The blue shaded region is the area bounded by the arc P₀P₂, the line segment P₂H, and the line segment HP₀. This area can be calculated as the area of the sector OP₀P₂ minus the area of the right-angled triangle OHP₂.\n    *   A length of 17 is given for the segment HP₀.\n\n3.  **Determine the angle θ:**\n    *   In the right-angled triangle OHP₂, the hypotenuse is the radius OP₂ = R = 34.\n    *   The angle ∠HOP₂ is the angle of the sector OP₀P₂, which is 2θ.\n    *   The side OH is adjacent to the angle 2θ, so OH = OP₂ * cos(2θ) = 34 * cos(2θ).\n    *   We are given that the length of HP₀ is 17. We also know that HP₀ = OP₀ - OH.\n    *   Substituting the known values: 17 = 34 - 34 * cos(2θ).\n    *   Rearranging the equation: 34 * cos(2θ) = 34 - 17 = 17.\n    *   cos(2θ) = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\n    *   From the diagram, 2θ is an acute angle, so 2θ = arccos(1/2) = 60° or π/3 radians.\n    *   Therefore, θ = 30° or π/6 radians.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Blue Region:**\n    *   Area(Blue) = Area(Sector OP₀P₂) - Area(Triangle OHP₂).\n    *   Area(Sector OP₀P₂) = (1/2) * R² * (2θ) = (1/2) * 34² * (π/3) = (1/2) * 1156 * (π/3) = 578π/3.\n    *   Area(Triangle OHP₂) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OH * HP₂.\n        *   OH = 34 * cos(π/3) = 34 * (1/2) = 17.\n        *   HP₂ = 34 * sin(π/3) = 34 * (√3 / 2) = 17√3.\n        *   Area(Triangle OHP₂) = (1/2) * 17 * (17√3) = 289√3 / 2.\n    *   Area(Blue) = 578π/3 - 289√3 / 2.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Red Shaded Region:**\n    *   The red region is constructed symmetrically in the adjacent sector OP₂P₄, which also has an angle of 2θ.\n    *   The construction shows a line from P₂ perpendicular to the radius OP₄. Let the intersection be K.\n    *   The red shaded region is the area of the sector OP₂P₄ minus the area of the right-angled triangle OKP₂.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the construction (same angle 2θ, same radius R), the area of the red region is identical to the area of the blue region.\n    *   Area(Red) = Area(Sector OP₂P₄) - Area(Triangle OKP₂) = 578π/3 - 289√3 / 2.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Area:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total area of the shaded regions\". This implies the sum of the individual areas: Total Area = Area(Blue) + Area(Red).\n    *   The note about the overlap is likely a clarification to ensure we sum the areas rather than calculating the area of their union, or it is a distraction. Based on the geometric construction derived from the markings, the regions only touch at point P₂, so there is no overlap area to consider anyway. We proceed by summing the calculated areas.\n    *   Total Area = (578π/3 - 289√3 / 2) + (578π/3 - 289√3 / 2).\n    *   Total Area = 2 * (578π/3 - 289√3 / 2).\n    *   Total Area = 1156π/3 - 289√3.\n\n7.  **Simplify the Final Answer:**\n    *   We can factor out the common term 289 (since 1156 = 4 * 289).\n    *   Total Area = (4 * 289π / 3) - 289√3.\n    *   Total Area = 289 * (4π/3 - √3).\n\nThis is the exact final answer in its simplified symbolic form.\n\n<<<1156*pi/3 - 289*sqrt(3)>>>"
