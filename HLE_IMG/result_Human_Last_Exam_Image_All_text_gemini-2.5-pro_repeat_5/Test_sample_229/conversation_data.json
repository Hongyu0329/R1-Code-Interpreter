    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Examination:**\n    *   **Instrumentation and Format:** The music is presented as a \"lead sheet,\" featuring a single melodic line on a treble clef staff with chord symbols written above. This format is common for jazz and popular music, serving as a guide for improvisation and accompaniment.\n    *   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4 (\"common time\"). A partially visible tempo marking at the top appears to be \"Mod.\" (Moderato) with a metronome marking around ♩=128, indicating a moderately fast tempo.\n    *   **Key Signature and Tonality:** There is no key signature, suggesting the key of C Major or its relative, A minor. The consistent use of C Major as a tonic chord (especially at the beginning, end, and in the Coda) confirms the key is C Major.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression is characteristic of a specific style. It uses standard diatonic chords (C, F, G7, Dm, Am) but also features a prominent secondary dominant (E7, which typically leads to Am) and a diminished chord (Gdim). This harmonic vocabulary is common in jazz.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Musical Style:**\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly virtuosic, featuring rapid runs of eighth and sixteenth notes, extensive use of arpeggios that outline the chords, and significant syncopation. The use of grace notes and chromatic passing tones (like the D# in the second measure over an E7 chord, and the F# over a C chord) adds to the expressive and technically demanding nature of the piece.\n    *   **Genre Identification:** These characteristics—the fast tempo, the swing rhythm (implied), the specific chord progressions (e.g., C -> E7), and the virtuosic, arpeggio-heavy melodic lines—are all hallmarks of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as \"Jazz Manouche\" or \"Sinti Swing\"). This style was popularized by guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Song Title:**\n    *   By analyzing the opening melodic phrase, the song can be identified. The first full measure starts with a distinct pattern over a C major chord: E-F-G-G-G-G.\n    *   This melody, combined with the overall structure and style, is the signature theme of the Gypsy Jazz standard **\"Tchavolo Swing\"**. The piece was composed by the French Manouche guitarist Tchavolo Schmitt, a renowned modern performer in this genre.\n\n4.  **Determining the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The musical style, Gypsy Jazz, originated in **France** in the 1930s. Its primary architects were the Belgian-born Romani guitarist Django Reinhardt and the French violinist Stéphane Grappelli, who formed the Quintette du Hot Club de France in Paris.\n    *   The composer of this specific piece, Tchavolo Schmitt, is also French. Therefore, both the genre and the song itself have their roots in France.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n*   Recognize the format as a jazz lead sheet.\n*   Analyze the key (C Major) and the specific chord choices (e.g., the use of E7 as a secondary dominant).\n*   Identify the stylistic markers: virtuosic arpeggiated melody, syncopation, and swing feel, which point strongly to Gypsy Jazz.\n*   Use the unique opening melodic line to pinpoint the exact title, \"Tchavolo Swing,\" rather than other tunes in the same style.\n*   Connect the identified genre (Gypsy Jazz) and composer (Tchavolo Schmitt) to their country of origin (France).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Title:** Tchavolo Swing\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<Title: Tchavolo Swing, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz, Country of Origin: France>>>"
