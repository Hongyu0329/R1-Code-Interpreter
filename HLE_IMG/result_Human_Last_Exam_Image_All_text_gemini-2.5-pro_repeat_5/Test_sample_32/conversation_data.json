    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the *main difference* in the *sporophyte* that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* \"at a glance\". This implies a very obvious, macroscopic feature. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the capsule (which contains spores), the seta (the stalk), and the foot (which anchors it to the leafy gametophyte).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Botanical Names:** The scientific names of plants often provide clues to their characteristics.\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: \"Montana\" refers to mountains, indicating its typical habitat.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: This name is highly informative. \"Curvi-\" is Latin for \"curved,\" and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name itself means \"Grimmia with a curved seta.\"\n\n3.  **Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***:\n    *   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short (typically 0.5-1.5 mm) and, crucially, it is **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is described as \"immersed\" or \"emergent.\" This means it sits low down among the leaves of the main plant body (gametophyte) and is held in an upright (erect) position. The image provided, showing capsules nestled within the moss cushion without visible stalks, is characteristic of a species like *G. montana*.\n\n4.  **Examine the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***:\n    *   **Seta:** As its name suggests, the defining feature of *Grimmia curviseta* is its seta, which is relatively long and **strongly curved** (arcuate or cygneous, meaning swan-necked).\n    *   **Capsule Position:** This long, curved seta holds the capsule well above the leaves (a condition known as \"exserted\") and causes it to be nodding, cernuous, or pendent (hanging downwards).\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Main Difference:**\n    *   The most significant and easily observed difference lies in the **seta (stalk)**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **short and straight**, resulting in an **upright, immersed capsule**.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is **long and curved**, resulting in a **nodding, exserted capsule**.\n    *   This difference in the length and curvature of the seta, and the resulting position and orientation of the capsule, is the primary character used to distinguish the two species when sporophytes are present and is easily seen at a glance.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Identification relies on the presence of mature sporophytes. Without them, distinguishing these species requires microscopic examination of leaf cells and cross-sections.\n*   The term \"at a glance\" points to a macroscopic feature, which in this case is the overall appearance of the sporophyte (stalk and capsule) relative to the leafy plant.\n*   The provided image shows immersed, erect capsules, which is consistent with *Grimmia montana* (or a closely related species with similar sporophytes), but not *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be upright and immersed or emergent among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long, strongly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be held well above the leaves (exserted) and to be nodding or hanging."
