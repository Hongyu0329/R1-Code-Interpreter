The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be upright and immersed or emergent among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its long, strongly curved seta, which causes the capsule to be held well above the leaves (exserted) and to be nodding or hanging.
