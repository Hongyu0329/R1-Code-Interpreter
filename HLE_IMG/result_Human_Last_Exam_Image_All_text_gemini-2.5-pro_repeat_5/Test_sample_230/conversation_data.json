    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a prominent windmill as its central subject. The sky is dark and dramatic, with heavy, swirling clouds, suggesting a storm has just passed or is approaching. A patch of blue sky is visible, creating a strong contrast. The windmill itself appears weathered and possibly damaged. To the right, in the background, there is a visible fire with smoke and bright orange flames engulfing a building. The overall mood of the painting is turbulent and dramatic, which is characteristic of the Romanticism movement in art. The brushwork is expressive and focuses on light and shadow to create this dramatic effect.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the style and subject matter.**\nThe subject (a windmill) is common in Dutch art, but the highly dramatic, emotional style points towards the 19th-century Romantic period, as specified in the question. The fire is a significant narrative element, suggesting an event or a story is being depicted, not just a simple landscape. This narrows the search to Romantic painters who specialized in historical or dramatic scenes.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct research to identify the artist and painting.**\nBased on the key elements—windmill, storm, fire, 19th-century Romantic style—a search can be initiated.\n- A reverse image search is a very effective tool for this task. It quickly matches the fragment to a full painting.\n- The results consistently point to the Polish painter January Suchodolski (1797–1875). He was an army officer and a painter known for his historical and battle scenes, often filled with dramatic action.\n- The specific painting is identified as \"Pożar młyna\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the finding.**\n- **Artist:** January Suchodolski. His life dates (1797–1875) confirm he was a 19th-century artist.\n- **Title:** \"Pożar młyna\" is Polish for \"The Burning of the Mill\" or \"Fire in a Mill\".\n- **Comparison:** Comparing the provided image fragment with complete images of \"Pożar młyna\" confirms a perfect match. The structure of the windmill, the shape of the sails, the stormy sky, and the location of the fire in the background are identical.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe fragment is from the painting \"Pożar młyna\" by the 19th-century Polish artist January Suchodolski. The English title is \"The Burning of the Mill\".\n\n<<<The Burning of the Mill>>>"
