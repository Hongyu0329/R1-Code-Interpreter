    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ECG Paper Calibration**\n*   The calibration information is provided at the top left of the ECG: `25 mm/sec`.\n*   This means the paper moves at a speed of 25 millimeters (mm) per second.\n*   The ECG grid is composed of small squares (1 mm x 1 mm) and large squares (5 mm x 5 mm).\n*   To find the time duration of one small square, we calculate: 1 second / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds per small square.\n*   The time duration of one large square is: 5 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = 0.20 seconds per large square.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the R-waves and R-R Intervals**\n*   The R-waves are the prominent, sharp upward deflections of the QRS complex.\n*   The R-R interval is the time duration between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves.\n*   We need to scan the entire rhythm strip to find the visually longest space between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Longest R-R Interval**\n*   By visually inspecting the entire ECG strip, we can see that most of the R-R intervals are relatively regular.\n*   However, there is a significant pause visible on the fourth line of the tracing (the line starting near the `0:06:08` time marker). This interval is clearly the longest on the entire strip.\n*   This longest interval is between the 3rd and 4th QRS complexes on that specific line.\n\n**Step 4: Measure the Longest R-R Interval on the Grid**\n*   We will now measure the distance between the peak of the 3rd R-wave and the peak of the 4th R-wave on that line by counting the grid squares.\n*   The peak of the 3rd R-wave conveniently falls on a thick vertical line. We can use this as our starting point (0).\n*   From this starting point, we count the number of small squares to the peak of the 4th R-wave.\n*   Let's count the large squares first for easier measurement: There are 7 full large squares between the two R-waves. This accounts for 7 * 5 = 35 small squares.\n*   After the 7th large square, we count the remaining small squares to the peak of the next R-wave. There are 4 additional small squares.\n*   Total number of small squares = 35 + 4 = 39 small squares.\n*   (Alternative check: The 4th R-wave peak is one small square to the left of the 8th thick vertical line from the start. This gives a count of (8 * 5) - 1 = 39 small squares, confirming the measurement).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Time in Seconds**\n*   Now, we convert the measured grid distance into time using the calibration from Step 1.\n*   Longest R-R interval = (Total number of small squares) × (Time per small square)\n*   Longest R-R interval = 39 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square\n*   Longest R-R interval = 1.56 seconds.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Always confirm the paper speed (e.g., 25 mm/sec or 50 mm/sec) as this is critical for accurate time calculation.\n*   Be precise when identifying the peak of the R-wave.\n*   When counting squares, using the large squares as a guide can reduce counting errors, but a final count of small squares is more accurate.\n*   It's good practice to scan the entire strip, as there might be more than one pause, and you need to identify the absolute longest one. In this case, another smaller pause exists on the bottom strip, but it is visibly shorter than the one measured.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe longest interval spans 39 small squares.\n39 squares * 0.04 seconds/square = 1.56 seconds.\n\n<<<1.56>>>"
