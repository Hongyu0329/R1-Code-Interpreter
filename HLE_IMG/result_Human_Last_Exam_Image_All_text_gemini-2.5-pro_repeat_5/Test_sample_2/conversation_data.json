    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Logic:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive algorithm that intends to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    -   **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the array (of size 1 or 0) is already considered sorted, and the function does nothing.\n    -   **Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first recursively calls itself to sort the first `n - 1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n - 1` elements are sorted, it compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the last element of the sorted subarray (`a[n-2]`). `a[n-2]` is the largest among the first `n-1` elements.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it is swapped with the `(n-1)`-th element.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the critical part. If a swap occurred, the order of the first `n - 1` elements might be disrupted. For example, the newly swapped element (originally `a[n-1]`) might not be in its correct sorted position. The algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again* to re-sort the entire subarray of the first `n - 1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n    -   The work done inside the function, excluding the recursive calls, consists of a comparison and a potential swap. This takes constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n    -   The function makes one recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n    -   In the worst-case scenario, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, triggering the swap and the second recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n    -   Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n        `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   The base case is `T(1) = O(1)` or some constant `d`.\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n - 2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 3c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^2 * [2 * T(n - 3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 7c`\n    -   We can see a pattern emerging: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n    -   To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting this back into the formula:\n        `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    -   Since `T(1)` is a constant `d`, the equation becomes:\n        `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + 2^(n-1) * c - c`\n        `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    -   The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition is met at every level of recursion. An example of such an input is a reverse-sorted array, like `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`. For this input, the smallest element is always at the end of the subarray being considered, which will always trigger the swap and the second recursive call.\n\n### Careful Points\n-   **Distinguishing from other sorts:** The structure might look like Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort, but the second recursive call `sort(a, n-1)` makes it fundamentally different and much less efficient. A recursive Bubble Sort would have a recurrence like `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)`, leading to `O(n^2)`.\n-   **The cost of the second call:** The key is recognizing that the second `sort(a, n - 1)` is not a small operation; it's a full recursive call on a problem of size `n-1`, leading to the `2 * T(n-1)` term.\n-   **Termination:** The algorithm does terminate. The recursion is always on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), and there's a base case (`n <= 1`), so it will eventually stop.\n-   **Complexity Class:** The `O(2^n)` complexity is exponential, which is very slow and generally considered impractical for all but the smallest input sizes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`. Solving this recurrence gives a time complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\nFinal Answer is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
