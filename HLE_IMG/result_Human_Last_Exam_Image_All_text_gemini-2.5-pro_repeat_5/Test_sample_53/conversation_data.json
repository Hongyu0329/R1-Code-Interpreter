    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the scene.**\n    The image on the vase depicts a dramatic scene involving a chariot. We see a two-wheeled chariot, part of a horse, and three main human figures. Two figures are in the chariot: a driver wearing a patterned sleeve and an elaborate headdress, and a passenger draped in cloth. A third figure, a nude male, is depicted on the ground behind the chariot wheel, in a contorted pose that suggests he is falling or has been thrown violently from the vehicle. There is also a large wing visible above the scene, possibly belonging to Nike (Victory) or another divine being. The artistic style is ancient Greek red-figure vase painting.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the action taking place.**\n    The central action is a chariot scene, but not a calm procession. The figure on the ground is clearly in distress, indicating a crash, a defeat, or a fatal accident. The question asks to identify the figure \"leaving the chariot,\" which in this context refers to the one being thrown from it.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the scene to Greek mythology.**\n    This depiction is a classic representation of a famous Greek myth: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    *   **The myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa feared a prophecy that he would be killed by his son-in-law. To prevent his daughter, Hippodamia, from marrying, he challenged all her suitors to a chariot race. Possessing divine horses from his father, Ares, he always won and killed the losers. Pelops, a new suitor, conspired with Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot by replacing the bronze lynchpins with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels came off, and King Oenomaus was thrown from his chariot and killed. Pelops won the race and married Hippodamia.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the figures based on the myth.**\n    *   The couple in the chariot can be identified as the victors, **Pelops** (the driver) and **Hippodamia** (his prize and future wife).\n    *   The nude male figure being thrown from the chariot is the defeated king, **Oenomaus**. His dramatic fall and implied death are the climax of the story. The vase painter captures the moment of Oenomaus's demise while showing the triumphant couple.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the identity of the specified figure.**\n    Based on the mythological context, the figure leaving the chariot by being thrown to his death is King Oenomaus.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
