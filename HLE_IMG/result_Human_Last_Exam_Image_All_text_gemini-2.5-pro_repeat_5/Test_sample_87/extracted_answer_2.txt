**Product A:**
A pyrrolizidine derivative with the following structure: A 5/5 fused ring system with a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. The nitrogen is substituted with an N-acetyl-pyrrolidin-2-yl group. A methyl ester (-COOCH3) group is attached to the pyrrolizidine ring that was formed during the cycloaddition.

**Product B:**
A pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole derivative (an aromatic pyrrole ring fused to a pyrrolidine ring). The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with a nitrone group (a 1-oxido-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-ylium group). A methyl ester (-COOCH3) group is attached to the aromatic pyrrole ring.

**Product C:**
The mixed anhydride of the starting material. The structure is 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride. The carboxylic acid's -OH is replaced by -O-CO-CH3.
