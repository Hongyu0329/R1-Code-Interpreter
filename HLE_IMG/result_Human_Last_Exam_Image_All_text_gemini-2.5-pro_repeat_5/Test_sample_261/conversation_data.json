    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the provided image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\nThe image displays a fragment of an illustration.\n*   **Subject:** The central figure is a unicorn. It is depicted as a white, almost translucent or ghostly creature. It appears to be in motion, galloping or running. It has a visible horn.\n*   **Setting:** The background is dark, suggesting a forest at night, which is a common setting for unicorns in fantasy lore.\n*   **Composition:** The unicorn is partially obscured by a pillar or frame on the right side. This frame has warm, golden, and reddish tones.\n*   **Art Style:** The illustration is rendered in a painterly, somewhat realistic fantasy style, common for book covers of the fantasy genre, particularly from the late 1990s and 2000s.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to a specific story or series.**\nThe image of a unicorn in a dark forest is a powerful and specific scene in a very well-known book series.\n*   The scene is highly reminiscent of Harry Potter's encounter in the Forbidden Forest in the first book of the series. In that scene, Harry sees a mysterious cloaked figure drinking the blood of a slain unicorn. The unicorn is described as being pure white and beautiful.\n*   The art style is recognizable as that of Mary GrandPré, the celebrated illustrator of the American editions of the Harry Potter series.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific book and cover edition.**\n*   A search for \"Mary GrandPré Harry Potter unicorn\" confirms that this illustration is indeed hers.\n*   This specific image is a detail from the artwork for the first book, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (the title used in the United States).\n*   Specifically, this fragment of the unicorn running is found on the back cover of the original US hardcover edition of the book, as part of a collage of scenes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the title of the book.**\nBased on the identification of the scene and the specific artwork by Mary GrandPré for the US edition, the book is the first installment in the Harry Potter series.\n*   The US title is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n*   The original UK title is *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.\n\nBoth titles refer to the same book, but since the artwork is from the US edition, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* is the most direct answer associated with this specific image.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
