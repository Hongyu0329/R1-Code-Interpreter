    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT from the Baseline scenario to the Proposed scenario.\n\n**Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = [ (Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT ] * 100\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles traveled by the car itself, not the total miles traveled by all passengers. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) are not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Two Levels of Percentages:** The tables use two types of percentages that must be multiplied:\n    *   `share of total trips`: This is the percentage of all trips that fall into a specific distance category.\n    *   `mode share by distance`: For the trips within a specific distance category, this is the percentage that uses a particular mode of transport.\n3.  **Car VMT Calculation:** Car VMT includes both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We must sum the mode shares for these two categories to get the total car mode share for each distance bracket.\n4.  **Weighted Average:** To find the total VMT, we will calculate the VMT for each distance category and then sum them up. Since we don't have the total number of trips, we can work with a proportional value (a weighted VMT) by assuming a total of 100 trips or by simply using the percentages as decimals. The formula for the weighted VMT for a single category is:\n    `Weighted VMT = (Share of total trips) * (Total car mode share) * (Average trip distance)`\n\n---\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT (proportional value)**\n\nWe will calculate the weighted VMT for each distance category and sum them.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT (proportional)** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT (proportional value)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   Weighted VMT = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT (proportional)** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nNow, we use the total VMT values from Step 1 and Step 2 in our reduction formula.\n\n*   VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = 0.52195... * 100 â‰ˆ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
