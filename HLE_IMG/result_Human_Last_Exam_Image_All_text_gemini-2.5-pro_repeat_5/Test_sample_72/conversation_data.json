    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the photochemical transformation:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:** We have two reactants:\n    1.  Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆): An aromatic, cyclic compound with a 6π electron system. It can be considered a cyclic triene.\n    2.  Cyclobutene: A cyclic alkene with one π bond (2π electrons).\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is promoted by light (hν), indicating that it is a photochemical process. This is a crucial clue, as the rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) are different for thermal and photochemical conditions.\n*   **Question:** The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur and asks to identify their types. Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n**Step 2: Propose and Analyze Plausible Reaction Pathways**\nThere are two logical sequences for the two reactions to occur:\n1.  **Pathway 1:** An initial intramolecular reaction of hexafluorobenzene, followed by an intermolecular reaction with cyclobutene.\n2.  **Pathway 2:** An initial intermolecular reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, followed by an intramolecular rearrangement of the adduct.\n\nLet's analyze both pathways.\n\n**Analysis of Pathway 1**\n*   **First Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical reaction on its own. A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is valence isomerization to Dewar benzene.\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   Let's classify this reaction. It involves the formation of a sigma bond between two non-adjacent atoms of a π system (the para C1 and C4 atoms). This can be viewed as an electrocyclic reaction of a 1,3-diene fragment within the benzene ring. The reaction involves 4π electrons (from two double bonds in a Kekulé structure) forming one new σ bond and one new π bond.\n    *   This is a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. For a 4π electron system, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict a disrotatory closure for a photochemical reaction. This mode is geometrically possible for the formation of Dewar benzene.\n*   **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, now reacts with cyclobutene. Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene has two isolated C=C double bonds (each is a 2π system). Cyclobutene has one C=C double bond (a 2π system).\n    *   The reaction between two alkene-like π systems to form a four-membered ring is a cycloaddition.\n    *   This is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict that this reaction is allowed photochemically (via a [π2s + π2s] suprafacial approach).\n\n**Analysis of Pathway 2**\n*   **First Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene reacts directly with cyclobutene in an intermolecular reaction.\n    *   One π bond of benzene (2π electrons) reacts with the π bond of cyclobutene (2π electrons) to form a four-membered ring.\n    *   This is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. As mentioned, this is photochemically allowed. The product is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene.\n*   **Second Reaction:** The adduct formed in the first step contains a conjugated 1,3-diene system in the six-membered ring.\n    *   Under photochemical conditions, this 1,3-diene can undergo a ring-closing reaction. This reaction involves 4π electrons and forms a new σ bond between the ends of the diene system.\n    *   This is a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. For a 4π system, the photochemical reaction is allowed via a conrotatory closure.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Types of Reactions Involved**\nBoth plausible pathways (Pathway 1 and Pathway 2) involve the same two types of pericyclic reactions, although in a different order:\n1.  A **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n2.  A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the precise sequence of events, these are the two types of photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in the transformation.\n\n(Note: While the reaction of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar benzene is sometimes broadly termed a \"valence isomerization\" or an \"intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition,\" classifying it as a [4π] electrocyclic reaction is a more specific and mechanistically descriptive classification under the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.)\n\nFinal Answer: The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are a [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[4π] electrocyclic reaction and [2π+2π] cycloaddition>>>"
