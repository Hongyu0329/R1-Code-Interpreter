The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. S100B can be used as a prognostic marker. This is because it is not merely a bystander or a result of the disease; it is an active driver of the pathology. As shown in the signaling pathway, S100B binding to RAGE initiates cascades (via NF-ÎºB and JNK/JUN) that directly lead to neuroinflammation, apoptosis, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression can predict the future course and severity of the disease, which is the defining function of a prognostic marker, rather than simply aiding in diagnosis as an adjunct marker would.
