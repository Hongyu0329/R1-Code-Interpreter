    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image consists of two plots, both representing a sound over time. Time flows from left to right.\n    *   The top plot is a **spectrogram**, which shows the intensity of different frequencies over time. We can see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone at a constant frequency. This tone is present at the beginning and the end of the sound clip. In the middle, this tone is absent, and instead, there is a short, vertical band covering a wide range of frequencies. This vertical band represents a burst of broadband noise (like static).\n    *   The bottom plot is a **waveform**, showing the amplitude of the sound over time. It starts as a regular, smooth sine wave (representing the pure tone). This is interrupted by a complex, irregular waveform (representing the noise). After the noise, the sine wave resumes.\n    *   **Conclusion from the image:** The physical stimulus presented is a pure tone, followed by a burst of noise, followed by the same pure tone. The tone is *not* physically present during the noise.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"Illusion\":** This tells us that the perception of the sound is different from its physical reality.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in one of two 3D orientations. The brain flips between these two stable perceptions. This clue suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous signal, likely settling on one interpretation over another. The ambiguity here is: Did the tone stop, or was it just masked by the noise?\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This points to a fundamental brain mechanism for processing sensory input. It's something our brains do automatically to create a coherent understanding of the world, even with incomplete information.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   We have a physical sound where a tone is interrupted by noise.\n    *   We are told this creates an illusion where our perception differs from this reality.\n    *   The most logical illusion is that we perceive the tone as *continuing* through the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the gap, assuming it's more likely that a continuous tone was temporarily masked than that it stopped precisely when the noise began and restarted precisely when it ended.\n    *   This \"filling in\" is a common, unconscious perceptual ability that helps us perceive continuous sounds (like speech) in noisy environments.\n    *   The analogy to the Necker Cube fits: the brain is presented with a stimulus (Tone-Noise-Tone) and resolves the ambiguity by creating a more plausible, continuous perception (Tone-through-Noise).\n\n4.  **Identify the Name:**\n    *   This specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuing through a period when it is masked by another sound, is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is also sometimes referred to as temporal induction. When the sound being filled in is speech, it is known as the phonemic restoration effect, which is a specific example of this broader illusion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguishing Perception from Reality:** The key is to understand that the image shows the *physical* stimulus, while the question asks about the *perceptual* phenomenon, which is an illusion.\n*   **Understanding the Analogy:** The Necker Cube analogy isn't about the stimulus looking like a cube; it's about the principle of bistable or ambiguous perception, where the brain resolves ambiguity to form a coherent whole.\n*   **Generality of the Term:** While \"phonemic restoration\" is a related and famous example, \"auditory continuity illusion\" is the more general and accurate term for this stimulus (a pure tone, not speech).\n\nBy combining the analysis of the visual representation of the sound with the descriptive clues in the text, we can confidently identify the phenomenon.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
