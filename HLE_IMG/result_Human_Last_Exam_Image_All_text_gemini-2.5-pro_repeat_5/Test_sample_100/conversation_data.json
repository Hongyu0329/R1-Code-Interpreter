    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam. It is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group attached to the double bond.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n        *   The core bicyclic structure without the PMB and CF3 groups, but with a hydrogen on the double bond and on the nitrogen, is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its formula is C6H7NO.\n        *   Replacing one H on the double bond with a CF3 group: Remove H, add CF3. The change is +CF3 -H. Formula becomes C7H6F3NO.\n        *   Replacing the H on the nitrogen with a PMB group (-C8H9O): Remove H, add C8H9O. Formula becomes C(7+8)H(6-1+9)F3N(1)O(1+1) = C15H14F3NO2.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagent is Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n    *   CAN is a specific reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines.\n    *   This reaction removes the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The transformation is: R-N-PMB → R-NH.\n    *   To find the formula of **Intermediate 1**, we subtract the atoms of the PMB group and add one hydrogen atom to the formula of the starting material. The PMB group is C8H9O.\n    *   Change in formula = - (C8H9O) + H = -C8, -H8, -O1.\n    *   Formula of Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N(1) O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 5-(Trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The C=C bond in the bicyclic ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   Other functional groups like the amide (lactam) carbonyl (C=O) and the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) are stable under these conditions.\n    *   The hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n    *   To find the formula of **Intermediate 2**, we add two hydrogen atoms to the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is 5-(Trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N HCl at 70 °C.\n    *   These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. Intermediate 2 is a cyclic amide (a lactam).\n    *   Hydrolysis of the amide bond (C-N bond within the ring) involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   R-CO-NH-R' + H2O → R-COOH + R'-NH2.\n    *   The reaction opens the bicyclic ring structure to form an amino acid. The product is a cyclopentane ring substituted with an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and a trifluoromethyl group.\n    *   To find the formula of the **final product**, we add the atoms of one water molecule (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n    *   Formula of Final Product: C7H(8+2)F3N(1)O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of molecular formula changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   After Step 1 (-C8H8O): Intermediate 1 is C7H6F3NO\n*   After Step 2 (+H2): Intermediate 2 is C7H8F3NO\n*   After Step 3 (+H2O): Final Product is C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
