    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times a pattern or object looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation around a central point. If a pattern looks the same after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees, it has n-fold rotational symmetry. We are looking for the highest value of 'n' that applies to the given tiling.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Repeating Units and Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe tiling is constructed from several repeating geometric shapes:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombi (diamond shapes).\n*   Light yellow non-convex hexagons (often called \"bow-ties\" or chevrons).\n\nThe most likely centers for rotational symmetry are the centers of the most regular shapes, or specific vertices where multiple shapes meet. Let's examine the most prominent shapes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetry of the Hexagonal Centers**\nLet's choose the center of one of the dark blue regular hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n*   A regular hexagon, by itself, has 6-fold rotational symmetry. This means it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°.\n*   Now, we must check if the entire pattern surrounding the hexagon also has this symmetry.\n*   Observe the shapes directly attached to the hexagon. Each of the six sides of the hexagon is adjacent to a light yellow square. Each of the six vertices is adjacent to a corner of a more complex star-like motif.\n*   If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° (360°/6) around the center of the blue hexagon, the hexagon itself is mapped onto its original position.\n*   Simultaneously, each of the six surrounding squares is rotated into the exact position and orientation of the next square.\n*   Similarly, each of the six surrounding star-like motifs is rotated into the position of the next one.\n*   Since the entire pattern is indistinguishable from the original after a 60° rotation, the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry** around the center of each blue hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Other Potential Centers (for completeness)**\n*   **Center of the squares:** If you pick the center of a light yellow square as the rotation point, you'll find that the pattern has 4-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, 270°).\n*   **Other points:** The tiling also has points of 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry. For example, the point where the tips of three orange rhombi meet is a center of 3-fold rotation.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nWhen asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a periodic tiling, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry that exists anywhere in the pattern. We have identified centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest of these is 6-fold.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
