    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends chart to determine the country in question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Chart's Structure**\nThe chart displays Google search interest over time for three different topics, represented by red, blue, and yellow lines. The time frame is from December 1, 2019, to late 2023. The y-axis represents relative search interest, with 100 being the peak popularity. The key to solving this is to identify the annual patterns of the peaks for each color and associate them with recurring national holidays or anniversaries of significant historical events in a single country.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Blue Line**\nThe blue line shows consistent, moderately sized peaks that occur once a year.\n*   There is a peak around late May/early June 2020.\n*   There is another peak around late May/early June 2021.\n*   This pattern repeats in 2022 and 2023.\nThis annual late-May peak strongly suggests a recurring holiday or commemoration. In the United States, **Memorial Day** is a federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor and mourn the U.S. military personnel who have died in the line of duty. This fits the timing of the blue peaks perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Yellow Line**\nThe yellow line is characterized by very sharp, high peaks that also occur annually.\n*   Looking closely at the x-axis, these peaks appear towards the end of each calendar year. There's a peak near the end of 2020, 2021, 2022, and a very large one in late 2023.\n*   This points to an anniversary of a major historical event in December. A prominent event in United States history is the attack on **Pearl Harbor** on December 7, 1941. The anniversary of this event reliably generates a spike in public interest and searches every year in early December. This aligns with the pattern of the yellow line.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Red Line**\nThe red line displays the most complex pattern: two distinct peaks each year.\n*   One peak occurs in the winter, around January/February.\n*   A second, typically larger peak, occurs in the summer, around June/July.\n*   This biannual pattern suggests a topic that receives national attention at two different times of the year. In the United States, this pattern corresponds perfectly to search interest in topics related to Black history.\n    *   The winter peak (Jan/Feb) aligns with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day** (third Monday of January) and **Black History Month** (all of February).\n    *   The summer peak (June/July) aligns with **Juneteenth** (June 19th), a holiday commemorating the end of slavery. The massive increase in the size of the summer peak from 2020 onwards reflects the growing national recognition of Juneteenth, which became a federal holiday in 2021.\nThe \"historic event\" in this case is the broad, foundational history of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., which are commemorated at these specific times.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Findings**\n*   **Blue Line:** Memorial Day (late May)\n*   **Yellow Line:** Pearl Harbor anniversary (early December)\n*   **Red Line:** Black History commemorations (MLK Day/Black History Month in Jan/Feb and Juneteenth in June)\n\nAll three of these historical events and commemorations are central to the history and national identity of the **United States**. The specific and repeating patterns shown in the Google Trends data align perfectly with the calendar of these U.S.-centric events.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
