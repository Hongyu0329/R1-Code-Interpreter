    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reading Order:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, starting with the rightmost column and moving to the left. So, the reading order for this 2x2 seal is:\n    *   Top right character\n    *   Bottom right character\n    *   Top left character\n    *   Bottom left character\n\n2.  **Character Identification (from seal script to modern Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Top Right Character:** This character is a stylized form of **壽** (shòu). It is a very common character on seals, meaning longevity or long life.\n    *   **Bottom Right Character:** This character has the '山' (shān, mountain) radical at the top. The structure below corresponds to the seal script for **岡** (gāng), which means ridge or hill.\n    *   **Top Left Character:** This character is composed of a '足' (zú, foot) radical on the left and a '齊' (qí) component on the right. This is the character **躋** (jī), which means to ascend or rise.\n    *   **Bottom Left Character:** This is a complex character with a '雨' (yǔ, rain) radical on top. Below it are components representing a shaman or wizard praying for rain. This is an ancient form of the character **靈** (líng), meaning spirit or divine.\n\n3.  **Combining the Characters:** Reading in the correct order, the four characters are **壽岡躋靈** (shòu gāng jī líng).\n\n4.  **Meaning of the Phrase:** This is a classical and auspicious phrase. \"壽岡\" (Shòu Gāng) is the name of a hill believed to be the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor, a legendary Chinese sovereign. \"躋靈\" (jī líng) means \"to ascend to the divine/spiritual realm.\" Therefore, the full phrase alludes to the Yellow Emperor's ascension to immortality and carries a powerful wish for longevity and spiritual attainment.\n\n5.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   壽 becomes **寿**\n    *   岡 becomes **冈**\n    *   躋 becomes **跻**\n    *   靈 becomes **灵**\n\nSo, the content on the seal in simplified Chinese is **寿冈跻灵**.\n\n<<<寿冈跻灵>>>"
