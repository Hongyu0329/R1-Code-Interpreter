    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers and Determine the IUPAC Naming and Numbering**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the connectivity of the molecule and identify all the chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The drawing uses a zig-zag convention for the carbon backbone with stereochemistry indicated by wedged and dashed bonds.\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** The structure can be interpreted as a substituted pentanamine chain. Let's trace the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon attached to the principal functional group (the amine, -NH2).\n    *   The principal functional group is the amino group (-NH2), so the carbon chain is numbered to give the carbon bearing the amino group the lowest possible number. This group is on a -CH2- unit, so this will be C1.\n    *   Following the chain from C1 (the carbon in -CH2NH2), we find two possible longest chains of 5 carbons each.\n        *   Chain A: C1-C2-C3-C4-C5 (following the zig-zag to the top-left methyl group).\n        *   Chain B: C1-C2-C3-and then through the ethyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, when two chains have equal length, we choose the one with the most substituents. Chain A has substituents at C2, C3, and C4. Chain B has substituents at C2 and C3. Therefore, Chain A is the parent chain.\n    *   The molecule is a pentan-1-amine. The substituents are a methyl group at C2, an ethyl group at C3, and a hydroxyl group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\n2.  **Chiral Centers:** We identify the carbons with four different substituents.\n    *   **C2:** Bonded to -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2 (C1), and the rest of the chain (-C3...). These are four different groups, so C2 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C3:** Bonded to -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -C2..., and -C4.... These are four different groups, so C3 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C4:** Bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3 (C5), and -C3.... These are four different groups, so C4 is a chiral center.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C4**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The groups attached to C4 are -OH, -C3H(Et)..., -C5H3 (a methyl group), and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)C2... (Carbon attached to two other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -C5H3 (Carbon attached to three hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n\n2.  **Determine R/S:**\n    *   The drawing shows the -OH group (Priority 1) on a dashed bond (pointing away) and implies the -H atom (Priority 4) is on a wedged bond (pointing towards the viewer). The C4-C5 and C4-C3 bonds are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   When the lowest priority group (#4) points towards the viewer, we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   The path from -OH (1, away) to -C3 (2, down-right) to -C5 (3, up-left) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   Since the #4 group is in front, we reverse the result: CCW becomes R.\n    *   **The configuration at C4 is (R).**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C3**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The groups attached to C3 are -C4H(OH)..., -C2H(Me)..., -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -C4H(OH)C5H3 (The carbon C4 is bonded to an Oxygen).\n    *   Priority 2: -C2H(Me)C1H2NH2 (The carbon C2 is bonded to C, C, and H).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (The first carbon of the ethyl group is bonded to C, H, and H).\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n    *   (Comparison: C4 has an O atom, making it #1. C2 is attached to two carbons, while the ethyl's C is attached to one, making C2 #2 and ethyl #3).\n\n2.  **Determine R/S:**\n    *   The drawing shows the ethyl group (Priority 3) on a wedged bond (pointing towards the viewer) and implies the -H atom (Priority 4) is on a dashed bond (pointing away).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (#4) points away, we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 directly.\n    *   The path from -C4 (1, up-left) to -C2 (2, down-right) to the ethyl group (3, front) is clockwise (CW).\n    *   **The configuration at C3 is (R).**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C2**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The groups attached to C2 are -CH2NH2 (C1), -C3H(Et)..., -CH3, and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (The C1 is attached to Nitrogen, Z=7).\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)C4... (The C3 is attached to C, C, H).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (The methyl carbon is attached to H, H, H).\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n    *   (Comparison: N beats C, so -CH2NH2 is #1. C3 beats the methyl C, so it's #2).\n\n2.  **Determine R/S:**\n    *   The drawing shows the -CH2NH2 group (Priority 1) on a wedged bond and the -CH3 group (Priority 3) on a dashed bond. This implies the C2-C3 and C2-H bonds are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   The lowest priority group, -H (#4), is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can mentally rotate the molecule or use the swapping method. Let's swap the group in the back (-CH3, #3) with the H atom (#4).\n    *   After swapping, H is on a dashed bond (away), and -CH3 is in the plane. We now determine the configuration of this new, imaginary molecule.\n    *   The path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is: -CH2NH2 (1, wedge) -> -C3 (2, plane, up-left) -> -CH3 (3, plane, where H was). This path is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   So, the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   **The configuration at C2 is (R).**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are C2=(R), C3=(R), and C4=(R). The full designation for the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
