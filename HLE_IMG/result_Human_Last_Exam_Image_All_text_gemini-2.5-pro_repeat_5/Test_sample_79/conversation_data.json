    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the structure in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The request asks for two things: the identity of a \"square ancient structure\" shown in an aerial image and whether it is a historic landmark. Crucially, specific geographic coordinates are provided: 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W.\n\n2.  **Examine the Image:** The image is an aerial photograph of a dry, arid landscape, likely a desert. A paved road cuts across the bottom right, and several unpaved tracks are visible. The vegetation consists of sparse shrubs and bushes. Centered slightly to the right, there is a faint but discernible square outline on the ground. This appears to be the remnants of building foundations or low walls, which matches the description of a \"square structure\".\n\n3.  **Use the Coordinates for Geolocation:** The provided coordinates are the most critical piece of information. By inputting 29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W into a mapping service like Google Maps or Google Earth, we can pinpoint the exact location. This location is in Brewster County, Texas, USA, just off U.S. Highway 385, south of the town of Marathon.\n\n4.  **Research the Identified Location:** Now that the location is known, we can search for any historical or archaeological sites at or very near these coordinates. A search for \"ruins Brewster County Texas,\" \"fort near Marathon Texas,\" or searching the coordinates directly reveals a specific historical site.\n\n5.  **Identify the Structure:** The coordinates and the visual evidence of a square ruin correspond precisely to the location of **Fort Peña Colorada**. This was a United States Army post established in 1879 to protect settlers and travelers from raids. The fort's buildings were constructed from local stone and adobe, which explains the appearance of the ruins today. The square shape is characteristic of the fort's parade ground and surrounding structures.\n\n6.  **Determine if it is a Historic Landmark:** The final step is to verify its historical status. Researching \"Fort Peña Colorada historic landmark\" confirms that the site is highly significant.\n    *   It is listed on the **National Register of Historic Places** (added in 1975).\n    *   It is designated as a **Texas State Antiquities Landmark**.\n    *   There is an official **Texas Historical Marker** at the site.\n    These designations officially confirm that it is a historic landmark.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure is the ruin of a 19th-century military fort, and it is officially recognized as a historic landmark.\n\n<<<The square structure shown in the image is the ruins of Fort Peña Colorada, a United States Army outpost established in 1879. Yes, it is a significant historic landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a Texas State Antiquities Landmark.>>>"
