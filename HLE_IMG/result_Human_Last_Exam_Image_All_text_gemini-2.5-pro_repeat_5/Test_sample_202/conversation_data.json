    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n### **Analysis Methodology**\n\nTo identify these rocks, we will observe their key physical characteristics, primarily texture and color, which provide clues about their composition and formation environment.\n\n1.  **Texture:** This refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or particles in the rock.\n    *   **Crystalline vs. Clastic:** Are the grains interlocking crystals (typical of igneous/metamorphic rocks) or are they fragments of other rocks cemented together (clastic, typical of sedimentary/pyroclastic rocks)?\n    *   **Grain Size:** Are the crystals/grains large and visible (phaneritic/coarse-grained) or too small to see (aphanitic/fine-grained)? Very coarse grains suggest a specific formation.\n    *   **Vesicles:** Are there holes or pores (vesicles) from trapped gas bubbles? This indicates a volcanic (extrusive igneous) origin.\n\n2.  **Color/Composition:** The overall color and the colors of individual minerals can help determine the rock's chemical composition (e.g., light-colored felsic vs. dark-colored mafic).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Identification**\n\n**Specimen H:**\n\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, \"bubbly\" appearance. The holes (vesicles) are abundant. The solid material between the vesicles appears fine-grained (aphanitic), with no visible crystals.\n*   **Careful Points:** The key features are the vesicular texture and the reddish color. The vesicular texture indicates it's a volcanic rock that cooled rapidly from lava containing a lot of trapped gas. The reddish-brown color is often due to the oxidation of iron.\n*   **Identification:** A highly vesicular, mafic to intermediate volcanic rock that is typically red, brown, or black is called **Scoria**. It is denser than pumice.\n\n**Specimen J:**\n\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is light-colored (white to light grey) and, like H, is full of small vesicles, giving it a frothy texture. It appears to be low-density.\n*   **Careful Points:** The combination of a very light color and a highly vesicular texture is characteristic. The light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica). Volcanic rocks with this frothy, lightweight, and felsic nature are formed during explosive eruptions.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. It's a type of volcanic glass so filled with gas bubbles that it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous, angular to sub-angular fragments (clasts) of various sizes and colors (grey, reddish, dark). These fragments are cemented together in a fine-grained, light-grey matrix.\n*   **Careful Points:** The texture is clastic (fragmental). The fragments are angular and poorly sorted, suggesting they were not transported far before being deposited. The context of the other volcanic rocks (H and J) suggests a volcanic origin for these fragments.\n*   **Identification:** A rock formed from the consolidation of angular volcanic fragments (like ash, lapilli, and rock pieces) ejected during an explosive eruption is a pyroclastic rock. This specimen can be identified as a **Volcanic Breccia** or **Tuff** (specifically, a lapilli tuff or tuff breccia, given the mix of ash-sized matrix and larger fragments).\n\n**Specimen K:**\n\n*   **Observation:** This rock is made entirely of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals are of different colors, including large, blocky, light-colored (white/pinkish) ones and smaller, dark (greenish-black) ones.\n*   **Careful Points:** The texture is phaneritic (coarse-grained), which indicates slow cooling deep underground (an intrusive igneous rock). The key feature here is the *extremely* large size of the crystals.\n*   **Identification:** An igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (often several centimeters in size) is known as a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are typically granitic in composition, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica, which matches the visible light and dark minerals.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia (or Tuff), J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
