    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question.**\n    The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around the single bond that connects them to the main ligand structure. Free rotation depends on the steric hindrance from neighboring groups.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the overall molecular structure.**\n    The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. The Ir(III) center is coordinated to three ligands in an octahedral geometry.\n    1.  A bipyridine ligand (rings E and F), which acts as a neutral bidentate N,N-donor ligand.\n    2.  A substituted phenylpyridine ligand (rings C, D, G, J), which acts as a monoanionic bidentate C,N-donor ligand. This is a cyclometalating ligand.\n    3.  Another substituted phenylpyridine ligand (rings A, B, H, K, L), which also acts as a monoanionic bidentate C,N-donor ligand.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define the condition for free rotation.**\n    Rotation around a single bond is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier to rotation is low enough to be overcome by thermal energy at room temperature. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance, which occurs when bulky groups must pass by each other during rotation. In aromatic systems, this most commonly occurs with bulky ortho-substituents.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze each phenyl ring individually for steric hindrance.**\n    We will assume the most common connectivity for phenylpyridine ligands, where the phenyl and pyridine rings are directly bonded (e.g., at C1 of the phenyl and C2 of the pyridine), and cyclometalation occurs at an ortho-position of the phenyl ring (C6).\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. The adjacent positions on ring C are 3 and 5. The diagram does not show any substituents at positions 3 and 5, so we assume they are hydrogen atoms. For ring J to rotate, its ortho hydrogens (at J2 and J6) must pass by the hydrogens at C3 and C5. The steric hindrance between hydrogen atoms is very small. Therefore, the rotation of ring J is expected to be free.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to position 2 of the phenyl ring C. The adjacent positions on ring C are 1 and 3. Position 1 is bonded to the bulky pyridine ring D. Position 3 is a hydrogen. For ring G to rotate, its ortho hydrogens must pass by the bulky pyridine ring D. Since ring D is large and held rigidly in place by coordination to the iridium center, it will cause significant steric clash with ring G. Therefore, the rotation of ring G is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A. The adjacent positions on ring A are 3 and 5. Position 5 is substituted with another phenyl ring, K. For ring H to rotate, its ortho hydrogens must pass by the bulky phenyl ring K. Two adjacent phenyl groups on a central ring cause severe steric hindrance. Therefore, the rotation of ring H is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to position 5 of the phenyl ring A. The adjacent positions on ring A are 4 and 6. Position 4 is substituted with the phenyl ring H. Position 6 is the site of cyclometalation, meaning it's bonded to the large Iridium atom and its surrounding ligands. For ring K to rotate, its ortho hydrogens must pass by the bulky phenyl ring H on one side and the extremely bulky iridium coordination sphere on the other side. Therefore, the rotation of ring K is highly restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** The diagram shows ring L attached to position 6 of ring A, which is also the site of the bond to the iridium atom. This represents a 5-coordinate carbon, which is chemically impossible in this context. This is likely a drawing error. However, if we assume L is placed at any other available position on ring A (like position 3), it would be ortho to either the pyridine ring B or the phenyl ring H, leading to restricted rotation. Given the pattern of heavy substitution on the ligands, it is extremely unlikely that L would be in a position to rotate freely. Therefore, we can conclude its rotation is also restricted.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consolidate the results.**\n    *   Ring G: Restricted rotation.\n    *   Ring H: Restricted rotation.\n    *   Ring J: Free rotation.\n    *   Ring K: Restricted rotation.\n    *   Ring L: Restricted rotation (based on correcting the likely drawing error).\n\n    Based on this analysis, only phenyl ring J can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Step 6: Select the correct answer choice.**\n    The analysis concludes that only ring J can rotate freely. This corresponds to answer choice L.\n\n<<<L>>>"
