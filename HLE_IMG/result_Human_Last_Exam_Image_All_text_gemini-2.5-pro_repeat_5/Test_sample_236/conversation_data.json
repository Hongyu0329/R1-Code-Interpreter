    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the animal.**\nThe image shows an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is primarily black with prominent orange or reddish-orange markings.\n*   **Body Shape:** It has a flattened, elongated oval body, typical of a true bug (order Hemiptera).\n*   **Head:** The head is black with orange lines. The eyes are prominent and reddish. It has long, multi-segmented black antennae.\n*   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The area directly behind the head (the pronotum) is black with a distinct orange border.\n*   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings, which cover most of the abdomen, appear mostly black with orange-red edges.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n*   **Size:** While exact size is hard to determine without a scale, its size relative to the small individual flowers of what appears to be goldenrod suggests it is a medium-sized bug.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the insect based on its features.**\nThe combination of the black and orange/red coloration, the specific patterns (especially the orange-bordered pronotum), and the overall \"true bug\" morphology strongly points towards the **Boxelder Bug**. These bugs are well-known for their striking appearance and their habit of congregating in large numbers, especially in the fall.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the plant.**\nThe insect is on a plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of **goldenrod** (*Solidago* species), a common plant in North America that blooms in late summer and fall. Boxelder bugs are often found on various plants, including goldenrod, where they may feed.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the identification and find the scientific name.**\nA search for \"black and orange bug on goldenrod\" or \"boxelder bug\" confirms the visual identification. The Boxelder Bug is a common North American insect. The scientific name for the Boxelder Bug is composed of a genus and a species name.\n*   **Genus:** *Boisea*\n*   **Species:** *trivittata*\nThe species name *trivittata* translates to \"three-striped,\" referring to the three red stripes on the pronotum of the adult, although the central stripe can sometimes be faint or absent. The insect in the photo clearly shows the orange-red marginal stripes on the pronotum.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation.**\nThe question asks for the scientific name of the animal. Based on the detailed analysis of its physical characteristics, the insect is identified as a Boxelder Bug. Its scientific name is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
