The image displays a fungus characterized by a dimorphic morphology. Specifically, it shows ovoid, budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated yeast cells with characteristic constrictions at the septa. This morphology is classic for an infection by a *Candida* species, most notably *Candida albicans*.
