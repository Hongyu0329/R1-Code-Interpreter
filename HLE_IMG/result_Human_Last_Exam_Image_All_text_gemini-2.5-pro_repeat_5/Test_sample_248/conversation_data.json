    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the image to identify the different species present.** The photo displays a typical rocky intertidal zone community. We can clearly see several types of marine invertebrates:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, cone-shaped crustaceans are attached to the rock. These are a common sight on rocky shores worldwide.\n    *   **Snails:** There are at least two distinct types of snails (gastropods).\n        *   Two large snails in the center. One has a worn, whitish shell. The other has a more intact shell with visible brownish spiral stripes on a lighter background.\n        *   Several smaller, darker snails with pronounced ridges on their shells.\n\n2.  **Analyze the question's requirement.** The question asks for the scientific name of a species that *definitively* indicates the location is the Atlantic Coast, not the Pacific Coast. This means we need to find a species in the photo that is native to or widespread in the Atlantic but absent or not naturally widespread on the Pacific coast.\n\n3.  **Identify the species and determine their geographic distribution.**\n    *   **Barnacles:** While specific barnacle species have distinct ranges (e.g., *Semibalanus balanoides* in the Atlantic, *Balanus glandula* in the Pacific), they can be difficult to distinguish from a photograph alone without examining specific features of their shell plates. Therefore, the barnacles are not the most definitive indicator in this case.\n    *   **Snails:** The snails are more morphologically distinct.\n        *   Let's focus on the large snail with the clear spiral stripes. Its shape, size, and markings are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**.\n        *   The scientific name for the Common Periwinkle is ***Littorina littorea***.\n\n4.  **Verify the geographic range of *Littorina littorea***.\n    *   **Atlantic Coast:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now extremely common and abundant from Canada down to the Mid-Atlantic states of the U.S. It is a hallmark species of the Atlantic rocky intertidal zone.\n    *   **Pacific Coast:** *Littorina littorea* is **not** native to the Pacific Ocean. While isolated introductions have been reported in places like San Francisco Bay, it is not a naturally occurring, widespread, or common species on the Pacific coast of North America.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, in this intertidal community is a very strong and definitive indicator that the photograph was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Pacific Ocean. The other visible species, like the barnacles and the smaller snails (which could be other Atlantic species like *Littorina saxatilis*), are either harder to identify with certainty or have more complex distributions, making *Littorina littorea* the best answer.\n\nThe scientific name of the species that definitively indicates an Atlantic coast location is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
