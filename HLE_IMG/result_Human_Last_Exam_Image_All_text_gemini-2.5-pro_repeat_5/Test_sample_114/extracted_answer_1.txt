The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is because it proceeds through a constrained, unsymmetrical bicyclic münchnone intermediate. The inherent electronic and steric asymmetry of this münchnone dipole dictates a single, highly preferred orientation for the [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, leading to one major product.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish that a different mechanism occurs with the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine. The isotopic labeling in Reaction 2 reveals that the atoms from the acetyl group and the alanine backbone are scrambled, which proves the reaction must proceed through a symmetrical intermediate, identified as an azomethine ylide (`CH₃-CH=N⁺(CH₃)=CH-CH₃`). This contrasts with Reaction 3, where the cyclic structure prevents the formation of such a symmetrical intermediate and forces the reaction through the unsymmetrical münchnone pathway. Thus, the difference in the structure of the intermediates (symmetrical azomethine ylide vs. unsymmetrical münchnone) is the reason for the different regiochemical outcomes.
