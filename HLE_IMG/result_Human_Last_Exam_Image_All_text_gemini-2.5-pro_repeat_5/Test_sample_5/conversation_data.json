    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musicological Analysis**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected by a brace), which is standard notation for piano music.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), meaning there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n*   **Key Signature and Tonality:** There is no key signature at the beginning, which typically indicates C major or its relative minor, A minor. The piece begins with a strong C major feel in the left hand (C-G-C chords). However, the melody in the right hand (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G) uses an F#, which suggests the Lydian mode on C, or perhaps a temporary modulation to G major. The piece uses many accidentals throughout (C#, G#, D#, F#, etc.), indicating frequent modulations and a rich, chromatic harmonic language.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate, walking pace (Andante).\n*   **Dynamics:** The piece features a wide range of dynamics, starting at *p* (piano, soft), jumping to *f* (forte, loud) in measure 3, then moving to *mp* (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) and *mf* (mezzo-forte, moderately loud). This indicates a piece with significant emotional and dramatic contrast.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Musical Content and Style**\n*   **Melody:** The opening melody in the first two measures is very distinctive and memorable: G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G. This ascending line is the primary theme.\n*   **Rhythm and Texture:** The texture changes frequently.\n    *   Measures 1-2: A simple melody in the right hand over rolled chords in the left hand.\n    *   Measures 3-6: A shift to rapid, continuous sixteenth-note arpeggios shared between both hands, creating a driving and powerful effect.\n    *   Measures 8-10: A section of thick, powerful block chords in both hands.\n    *   Measure 11: Features a fast, sweeping figure marked \"gliss.\" (glissando), a common dramatic device.\n*   **Overall Style:** The combination of a memorable melody, virtuosic passages (fast arpeggios, large chords, glissando), and dramatic dynamic shifts is characteristic of late Romantic music, and very common in epic film scores and video game music. The complex harmonies and textures suggest it's an advanced piano arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Identification**\n*   The opening melodic phrase (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G) is the most crucial clue. This is the iconic opening of the main overworld theme from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*.\n*   The subsequent musical development, including the powerful arpeggiated sections and the block chords, are all recognizable parts of various arrangements of this theme. This specific version is likely from one of the *Final Fantasy Piano Collections*.\n*   The composer of this music is Nobuo Uematsu.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the highly recognizable main melody and the stylistic elements that follow, the music is the \"Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII\".\n\n<<<Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII>>>"
