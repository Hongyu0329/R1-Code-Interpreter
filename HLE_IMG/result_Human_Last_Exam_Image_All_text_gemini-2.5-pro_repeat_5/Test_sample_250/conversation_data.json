    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key of F major or D minor.\n    *   The first chord written is F- (F minor), which suggests the piece is in F minor.\n    *   The time signature is C, which stands for common time (4/4).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody (The \"Head\"):**\n    *   Let's transcribe the notes of the first four measures, as this is often the most recognizable part of a tune.\n    *   **Measure 1 (F- chord):** The notes are C5, A4, G4. The rhythm is a half note followed by two quarter notes.\n    *   **Measure 2 (E-7♭5 chord):** The notes are E♭5, C5, B♭4. The rhythm is the same.\n    *   **Measure 3 (E♭-6 chord):** The notes are A♭5, G♭5, F5. The rhythm is the same.\n    *   **Measure 4 (D♭maj7, G7 chords):** The notes are E♭5, D5, C5. The rhythm is a half note and two quarter notes.\n    *   This opening melodic phrase, with its descending, sequential pattern (C-A-G, E♭-C-B♭, A♭-G♭-F), is very distinctive.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   The chord progression provides another strong clue.\n    *   **First A Section (first 8 bars):**\n        `F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 | C7 | F- | C7 | % ||`\n        This progression is unique, especially the descending chromatic-like motion in the bass line from F to E to E♭ to D♭.\n    *   **Bridge (middle 8 bars):**\n        `D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 ||`\n        This section consists of a series of ii-V-I progressions or turnarounds. The `D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7` moves through the cycle of fourths. The `B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭` is a clear ii-V-I in the key of A♭ major.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Tune:**\n    *   The combination of the specific melodic contour and the unique chord progression points directly to a well-known jazz standard.\n    *   The melody and harmony are characteristic of the hard bop era.\n    *   Searching for a jazz standard in F minor with this opening melody (C-A-G, E♭-C-B♭...) or this chord progression (F-, E-7♭5, E♭-6...) leads to the composition \"Ceora\".\n\n5.  **Identify the Composer:**\n    *   \"Ceora\" was composed by the acclaimed hard bop trumpeter **Lee Morgan**. It was first recorded for his 1965 album *Cornbread*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Handwritten Notation:** The sheet music is handwritten, which can sometimes be ambiguous. However, the notes and chord symbols are reasonably clear.\n*   **Chord Voicings/Extensions:** The chord symbols (e.g., -7♭5, -6, maj7) are crucial for identifying the specific harmony, which is a key feature of this tune.\n*   **Form:** The piece follows a standard 32-bar AABA form, which is confirmed by the repeat signs and the contrasting bridge section.\n*   **Harmonic Nuances:** The final A section starts on an F major chord (indicated by just \"F\" without a minus sign) instead of F minor. This is a common practice in this tune, resolving to the parallel major for the final statement of the theme.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the melody, chord progression, and form, the piece of music is unmistakably \"Ceora\" composed by Lee Morgan.\n\n<<<Title: Ceora, Composer: Lee Morgan>>>"
