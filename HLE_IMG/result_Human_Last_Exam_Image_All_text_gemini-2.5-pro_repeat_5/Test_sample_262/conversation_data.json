    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. In the context of LECs or OLEDs, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the operational stability of the device, which is primarily limited by the chemical degradation of the emitter molecule. Therefore, \"shorter lifetimes\" implies lower chemical stability.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) coordination compounds with a general formula [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻.\n*   **Central Metal Ion:** Iridium(III) is the central metal in all four complexes.\n*   **Counterion:** PF₆⁻ (hexafluorophosphate) is the counterion for all four complexes. It is a large, non-coordinating anion.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** The bidentate N,N-coordinating ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This ligand is identical for all four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily improve solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions (aggregation quenching), which generally has a positive effect on device performance. Since this ligand is the same in all complexes, it will not be the differentiating factor for their relative stabilities.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the two identical cyclometalating C,N-coordinating ligands. These are all 2-phenylpyridine ligands with varying degrees and positions of fluorine substitution on the phenyl ring. The iridium atom forms a covalent bond with a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (Ir-C) and a coordinate bond with the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring (Ir-N).\n\n**Step 3: Relate Molecular Structure to Chemical Stability and Lifetime**\nThe operational lifetime of these emitters is largely determined by their chemical stability under electrical stress. A primary degradation pathway involves the cleavage of the bonds within the complex, especially the Ir-C bond, which is often considered the weakest link in the cyclometalated framework.\n\nThe stability of the complex can be enhanced by modifying the ligands. Fluorination of the phenyl ring in phenylpyridine-type ligands is a well-established and highly effective strategy for improving the stability and lifetime of iridium emitters for several reasons:\n1.  **Bond Strengthening:** The C-F bond (bond energy ~485 kJ/mol) is significantly stronger and more kinetically inert than the C-H bond (bond energy ~413 kJ/mol). Replacing C-H bonds with C-F bonds makes the ligand more resistant to chemical attack and degradation.\n2.  **Electronic Effects:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom, making it a strong electron-withdrawing group. This inductive withdrawal of electron density from the phenyl ring lowers the energy of its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). This results in a better energy match with the iridium d-orbitals, leading to a stronger, more covalent, and more stable Ir-C bond.\n3.  **Steric Hindrance:** Fluorine atoms, particularly when placed at the ortho-position (adjacent to the Ir-C bond), can provide steric shielding, physically protecting the Ir-C bond from attack by other molecules (like water or oxygen) or from intermolecular degradation reactions.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Four Complexes**\nWe can rank the expected stability of the four complexes based on the number and position of the fluorine atoms on their cyclometalating ligands. Higher fluorination generally leads to higher stability and longer lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two** fluorine atoms per ligand, one at the ortho-position and one at the para-position. This combination provides both strong electronic stabilization and steric protection. It is expected to be quite stable.\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has only **one** fluorine atom per ligand, at the para-position. While this provides some electronic stabilization, it lacks the steric protection of an ortho-fluorine, and the ortho-C-H bonds remain as potential sites for degradation.\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom per ligand, at the ortho-position. The ortho-fluorine is particularly effective at enhancing stability due to its proximity to the Ir-C bond, providing both electronic stabilization and steric shielding. It is generally considered more stable than the para-substituted analogue (Complex 2).\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand appears to be 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **three** fluorine atoms per ligand. This is the most heavily fluorinated complex of the four. It benefits from the combined stabilizing effects of multiple fluorine atoms and is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Which Complexes Have Shorter Lifetimes**\nBased on the analysis, a clear trend emerges: stability increases with the degree of fluorination.\n*   Stability Ranking (from most stable to least stable): Complex 4 (3F) > Complex 1 (2F) > Complex 3 (1F, ortho) > Complex 2 (1F, para).\n*   Lifetime Ranking (from longest to shortest): Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2.\n\nThe question asks for the complexes with **shorter lifetimes**. This corresponds to the least stable complexes in the series. Complexes 2 and 3 are the least fluorinated, each having only one fluorine atom per ligand, in contrast to the multiple fluorines in Complexes 1 and 4. Therefore, Complexes 2 and 3 are expected to degrade more quickly and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 4.\n\nThe appropriate answer is the one that includes both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Complexes 1 and 4: Multi-fluorinated, expected to be stable with long lifetimes.\n*   Complexes 2 and 3: Mono-fluorinated, expected to be less stable with shorter lifetimes.\nThe question asks for \"shorter lifetimes\" (plural), pointing towards selecting the group of least stable compounds.\n\n<<<H>>>"
