    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image provided is a raster plot. The horizontal axis represents Time in seconds (s), and the vertical axis represents the Electrode Number (from 0 to 128). Each black dot signifies an electrical spike (firing) from a particular neuron (or group of neurons) at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A synchronized burst is a period where a large number of electrodes show high firing activity at roughly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical columns of black dots on the raster plot. We need to scan the time axis from left to right and identify the center timestamp of each of these columns.\n    *   **Burst 1:** A very clear and dense burst is visible at the beginning of the recording. Its center appears to be at approximately **t₁ = 1 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The next major synchronized event occurs before the 10 s mark. Its center can be estimated at **t₂ = 8 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** Another burst is centered between the 10 s and 20 s marks, looking closer to 20 s. A good estimate is **t₃ = 17 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** There is a burst exactly in the middle of the 20 s and 30 s marks. Its center is at **t₄ = 25 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** A very prominent burst is visible between 30 s and 40 s. Its center is estimated at **t₅ = 36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 6:** The final clear burst in the recording window occurs between 40 s and 50 s. Its center is at approximately **t₆ = 47 s**.\n\n3.  **List the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts:**\n    Based on the visual inspection, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are: 1 s, 8 s, 17 s, 25 s, 36 s, and 47 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive bursts. With 6 bursts, we can calculate 5 intervals.\n    *   IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 8 s - 1 s = 7 s\n    *   IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 17 s - 8 s = 9 s\n    *   IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 25 s - 17 s = 8 s\n    *   IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 36 s - 25 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI₅ = t₆ - t₅ = 47 s - 36 s = 11 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 7 s + 9 s + 8 s + 11 s + 11 s = 46 s\n    *   Number of IBIs = 5\n    *   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of IBIs) = 46 s / 5 = 9.2 s\n\n6.  **Apply Significant Figures:** The question asks for the answer to two significant figures. The calculated value is 9.2, which already has two significant figures (the '9' and the '2').\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Identified burst timestamps: {1, 8, 17, 25, 36, 47} s.\n*   Calculated inter-burst intervals: {7, 9, 8, 11, 11} s.\n*   Average inter-burst interval: (7 + 9 + 8 + 11 + 11) / 5 = 46 / 5 = 9.2 s.\n*   The result 9.2 is already expressed to two significant figures.\n\n<<<9.2>>>"
