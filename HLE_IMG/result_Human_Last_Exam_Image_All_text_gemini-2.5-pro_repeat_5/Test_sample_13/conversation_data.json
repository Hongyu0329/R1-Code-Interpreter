    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the two numbers that will be in the top-most two white squares of the solved puzzle.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clue for the Top Squares**\n*   The two top white squares form a horizontal \"run\".\n*   The clue for this run is located in the black square to the left. The number above the diagonal line is the sum for the run to the right.\n*   The clue for this top horizontal run is **17**.\n*   The run consists of two white squares.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Numbers Based on the Clue**\n*   According to the rules of Kakuro, we need to find two unique digits (from 1 to 9) that add up to 17.\n*   Let's list the possible pairs:\n    *   If we start with the largest possible digit, 9: `9 + x = 17` -> `x = 8`. The pair (9, 8) works, as both are unique digits from 1 to 9.\n    *   If we try the next largest digit, 8: `8 + x = 17` -> `x = 9`. This gives the same pair.\n    *   If we try 7: `7 + x = 17` -> `x = 10`. This is not a valid digit (must be 1-9).\n*   Therefore, the only possible combination of two unique digits that sum to 17 is **8** and **9**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the Rest of the Puzzle (Careful Points)**\nTo be thorough, we should see if the rest of the puzzle can be solved, which would confirm our findings and determine the specific order of the 8 and 9.\n\n*   **Contradiction 1:** Let's examine the clues on the far left.\n    *   There is a vertical clue of **27** for the run of cells in the first column. Looking at the grid, this run appears to be three cells long. The maximum sum of three unique digits is `9 + 8 + 7 = 24`. A sum of 27 is impossible for a three-cell run.\n    *   Even if we interpret the grid shape differently, another contradiction arises. The clue `27` applies to a vertical run that starts at the second row. Below it, the clue `6` applies to a vertical run starting at the third row. In a standard Kakuro, this means the run for `6` is a sub-run of the run for `27`. This would imply the first cell of the `27` run is equal to `27 - 6 = 21`, which is impossible for a single square.\n\n*   **Contradiction 2:** Let's examine the clues on the right side.\n    *   There is a horizontal run of three cells with a sum of **22**. Let's call the cells A, B, and C, so `A + B + C = 22`.\n    *   The last cell of this run, C, is also the first cell of a two-cell vertical run with a sum of **5**.\n    *   From the `sum=5` clue, cell C must be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since its partner can't be 0 or the same number).\n    *   However, if we use the `sum=22` clue, `A + B = 22 - C`.\n        *   If C=4, A+B = 18. The only way to make 18 is 9+9, which are not unique digits.\n        *   If C=3, A+B = 19. This is impossible with two unique digits (max is 9+8=17).\n        *   If C=2 or C=1, the sum is even higher and thus also impossible.\n    *   This means the clues `22` (horizontal) and `5` (vertical) are incompatible.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe puzzle contains fundamental contradictions and is unsolvable as presented. However, the initial deduction about the top two squares is independent of these errors. The clue of **17** for a two-square run can only be satisfied by the numbers **8 and 9**. The question asks for what these two numbers are, not their final positions which cannot be determined due to the puzzle's flaws.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n<<<8,9>>>"
