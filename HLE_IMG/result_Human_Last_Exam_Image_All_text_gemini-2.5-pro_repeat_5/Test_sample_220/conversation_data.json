    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice Structure**\nAn FCC unit cell consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The coordinates of the atoms in a conventional unit cell (with lattice constant 'a') can be generated from a basis of four atoms: (0, 0, 0), (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), and (0, a/2, a/2), by applying integer lattice translations.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction**\nWhen we view a crystal structure along a specific direction, we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction. For the [110] direction, the viewing plane is the (110) plane. We need to determine the arrangement of the projected atomic positions on this plane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Atomic Pattern for an FCC [110] Projection**\n1.  **Define the projection plane:** The plane perpendicular to the viewing direction [110] can be defined by two orthogonal vectors that lie within that plane. Suitable choices for these vectors are `[001]` and `[1-10]`.\n2.  **Identify the repeating unit cell in the projection:** The periodic repetition of the lattice in the projected view will form a 2D unit cell. For the FCC [110] projection, this unit cell is a rectangle.\n    *   The side parallel to the `[001]` direction has a length of `a` (the lattice constant).\n    *   The side parallel to the `[1-10]` direction has a length of `a√2`.\n    *   The aspect ratio of this rectangle is `a√2 / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n3.  **Locate the atoms within the projected unit cell:**\n    *   There are atoms projected onto the four corners of this rectangle. These atoms come from the corners of the 3D unit cell, like (0,0,0).\n    *   There is another atom projected exactly onto the center of this rectangle. This atom comes from a face-center position in the 3D unit cell, such as (a/2, a/2, a).\n    *   The FCC lattice has two distinct atomic layers (A and B) when viewed along [110]. Layer A forms a rectangular grid, and layer B forms an identical grid that is shifted to lie in the center of the rectangles of layer A. The projection shows both layers superimposed.\n4.  **Conclusion for the pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\nWe now examine each image to see if it matches the \"centered rectangular\" pattern. Due to the 3D perspective drawing, the rectangle may appear as a parallelogram, but the key feature is that there should be an atom at the center of the parallelogram formed by four other atoms.\n\n*   **Image A:** This pattern consists of two identical rectangular/parallelogram arrangements that are shifted relative to each other. If you take any four atoms to form a parallelogram, there is no atom at its center. This pattern is not a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image clearly shows a centered parallelogram pattern. We can identify sets of four atoms forming a parallelogram with a fifth atom located at its center. For example, consider the four atoms that form the corners of a parallelogram: (approx. coords.) (3, 2.5), (1, 5.5), (6, 8.5), and (8, 5.5). The center of this parallelogram is at approximately (4.5, 5.5). There is an atom located very close to this position at (5, 5.5). This arrangement perfectly matches the expected centered rectangular pattern for the FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms in this image are arranged in a way that gives a hexagonal impression. If you pick a central atom, its nearest neighbors are arranged in a distorted hexagon. This pattern is characteristic of a projection along the [111] direction for an FCC or BCC lattice, not the [110] direction.\n\n*   **Image D:** This pattern, similar to A, shows two simple rectangular grids of atoms that are displaced from one another. If we define a rectangle using four atoms from one grid (e.g., vertices at (2,6), (5,6), (5,9), (2,9)), its center is at (3.5, 7.5). There is no atom from the second grid at this center position. Therefore, it is not a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, only Image B displays the characteristic centered rectangular (or centered parallelogram due to projection) pattern that corresponds to a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
