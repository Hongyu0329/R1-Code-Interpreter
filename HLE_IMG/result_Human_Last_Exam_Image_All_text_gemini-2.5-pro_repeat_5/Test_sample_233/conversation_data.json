    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the Ingvar runestone from the image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe image displays runic inscriptions carved on a stone surface. The key features are:\n*   The runes are arranged in three distinct horizontal bands, separated by straight horizontal lines.\n*   The script is Younger Futhark, which was used during the Viking Age.\n*   The carving style, with text in bands, is known as Ringerike style (Pr 3) or Urnes style (Pr 4, Pr 5), common in the late Viking Age.\n*   There are \"x\" shaped marks and colon-like \":\" marks used as separators between words.\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate the runes in each band.**\nWe will attempt to read the runes in each of the three visible bands, from left to right. The Younger Futhark alphabet will be used for transliteration.\n\n*   **Top Band:** Reading the runes, we can identify the sequence `... ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ ᚴ ᛁ ᛚ : ᛅ ᚢ ᚴ ...`.\n    *   `ᚦ` = þ (th)\n    *   `ᚢ` = u\n    *   `ᚱ` = r\n    *   `ᚴ` = k\n    *   `ᛁ` = i\n    *   `ᛚ` = l\n    *   `:` = word separator\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `ᚢ` = u\n    *   `ᚴ` = k\n    This transliterates to `...þurkil : auk...`, which corresponds to the Old Norse names \"Þorkell\" (or Þurgils) and \"auk\" (and).\n\n*   **Middle Band:** The runes appear as `... ᛅ : ᛋ ᛏ ᛅ ᛁ ᚾ : ᚦ ...`.\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `:` = word separator\n    *   `ᛋ` = s\n    *   `ᛏ` = t\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `ᛁ` = i\n    *   `ᚾ` = n\n    *   `:` = word separator\n    *   `ᚦ` = þ (th)\n    This transliterates to `...a : stain : þ...`. The word `stain` means \"stone\" and is very common in runic inscriptions. The following `þ...` likely begins the word `þansi` (\"this\").\n\n*   **Bottom Band:** The runes here are `... : ᚦ ᛁ ᛅ ᚴ ᚾ ᛅ : ᛋ ...`.\n    *   `:` = word separator\n    *   `ᚦ` = þ (th)\n    *   `ᛁ` = i\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `ᚴ` = k\n    *   `ᚾ` = n\n    *   `ᛅ` = a\n    *   `:` = word separator\n    *   `ᛋ` = s\n    This transliterates to `...: þiakna : s...`. The word `þiakna` (or `þiagna`) is the accusative plural of `þegn`, meaning \"thegns\". The following `s...` likely begins the word `sina` (\"his\").\n\n**Step 3: Use the transliterated text to identify the specific Ingvar runestone.**\nThe question states this is an Ingvar runestone. These are a well-defined group of about 26 runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition. We need to find an Ingvar stone that:\n1.  Is carved in horizontal bands.\n2.  Contains the names/words `Þurkil`, `stain`, and `þiakna`.\n\nWe can search the database of runic inscriptions (like Rundata) for an Ingvar stone matching these criteria.\n*   The famous Gripsholm Runestone (**Sö 179**) is an Ingvar stone with horizontal bands, but its inscription does not contain the name `Þurkil` or the word `þiakna`.\n*   A search reveals that the runestone **Sö 279**, located in Strängnäs Cathedral, is an Ingvar runestone that fits all the criteria.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the match with Sö 279.**\nThe accepted inscription of Sö 279 is:\n*   *Old Norse:* ... ræisa stæin þannsi at Þorkel ok Tofa, þiagna sina. ÞæiR [foru með Ingva]rs...\n*   *English:* ... had this stone raised in memory of Þorkell and Tófi, his thegns. They [travelled with Ingvarr's host]...\n\nLet's compare the fragments from our image to the full inscription of Sö 279:\n*   `...þurkil : auk...` matches \"...**Þorkel ok**...\" (Þurkil is a variant of Þorkell, and auk is a variant of ok).\n*   `...a : stain : þ...` matches \"...ræis**a stæin þ**annsi...\"\n*   `...: þiakna : s...` matches \"...**þiagna s**ina...\"\n\nThe textual evidence is a clear match. The style of carving in horizontal bands also matches Sö 279. Therefore, the runestone depicted in the fragment is Sö 279.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Rune identification:** Some runes can be similar (e.g., `ᚢ` u, `ᚬ` o; `ᚴ` k, `ᚾ` n). Careful examination is needed.\n*   **Spelling variations:** Old Norse spelling was not standardized. `auk`/`ok`, `þurkil`/`þorkil`, `stain`/`stæin` are expected variations.\n*   **Image composition:** A subtle point is that the vertical order of the bands in the photograph does not match the actual order on the stone (the middle band in the image is the top band on the stone). This suggests the photo might be a composite or of a re-arranged rubbing, but it does not change the fact that all depicted fragments originate from the same stone, Sö 279. The identification relies on the unique combination of the text and style, which points conclusively to one specific monument.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe ID of the Ingvar runestone is its designation in the *Sveriges runinskrifter* catalog, which is Sö 279.\n\n<<<Sö 279>>>"
