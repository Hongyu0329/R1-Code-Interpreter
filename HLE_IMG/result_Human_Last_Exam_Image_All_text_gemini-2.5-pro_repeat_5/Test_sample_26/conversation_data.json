    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The piece is in the key of C minor. The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to either E-flat major or C minor. The overall tonic of the movement is C minor.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** Following the measure numbers, measure 30 is the one circled in the provided image. It is the third full measure on the second system of the page.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays two notes, each a half note. The first is D (for beats 1 and 2), and the second is G (for beats 1 and 2).\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a rapid, ascending passage of thirty-second notes. While there are many chromatic passing tones (like E♮, F♯, G♯, A♯), the underlying harmonic structure is what we need to analyze. The passage moves melodically upward, outlining the main chord tones.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:**\n    *   The chord is defined by the most stable notes, particularly those played in the bass and on strong beats.\n    *   The notes in the bass are D and G.\n    *   The chord tones outlined in the right-hand melody include G and B♮.\n    *   Combining these notes (G, B♮, D), we get a **G major triad**.\n    *   In the first half of the measure, the bass note is D, which is the fifth of the G major chord, suggesting a chord in second inversion (V6/4). However, in context, this D is part of a dominant pedal point that started earlier and is leading to the strong root-position G in the second half of the measure.\n    *   In the second half of the measure, the G in the bass confirms the root of the chord. The entire measure functions to prolong the dominant harmony.\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The key is C minor.\n    *   The fifth degree (the dominant) of the C minor scale is G.\n    *   In a minor key, the dominant chord is typically made major by raising the seventh scale degree to create a leading tone. In C minor, the natural seventh is B♭, but it is raised to B♮ to create a stronger pull to the tonic (C).\n    *   The resulting chord, G-B♮-D, is a G major triad.\n    *   A major triad built on the fifth degree of the scale is the **dominant chord**, which is represented by the capital Roman numeral **V**.\n\nTherefore, the harmony in measure 30 is the dominant chord of C minor.\n\n<<<V>>>"
