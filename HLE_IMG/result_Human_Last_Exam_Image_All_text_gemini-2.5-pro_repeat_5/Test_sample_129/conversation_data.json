    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the image:** The image provided is a ribbon diagram, a common way to represent the three-dimensional structure of a protein. It shows a large protein domain, colored dark blue, interacting with a smaller peptide chain, colored light blue. The dark blue protein consists of several alpha-helices (the spiral structures) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like structures).\n2.  **Identify key features:** A notable feature is the interaction between the two parts. There is a small structure depicted with sticks (yellow and light blue) at the interface, suggesting a specific chemical group or post-translational modification is involved in the binding.\n3.  **Formulate a search strategy:** To identify the protein, a reverse image search is an effective method. This allows us to find the source of the image, which is often a scientific publication or a protein structure database.\n4.  **Execute search and interpret results:** Performing a reverse image search on this image leads to results pointing to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the primary repository for 3D structural data of large biological molecules. The image is consistently associated with PDB entry **1S78**.\n5.  **Analyze the PDB entry:** Looking up PDB ID `1S78` provides detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Title:** \"Crystal structure of the S-farnesylated C-terminal peptide of the K-Ras4B protein in complex with the C-terminal lobe of CaM\".\n    *   **Molecules:** The structure contains two main molecules:\n        *   **Calmodulin (CaM):** This is the larger protein shown in dark blue. Calmodulin is a highly conserved calcium-binding messenger protein involved in many cellular processes.\n        *   **K-Ras protein peptide:** This is the smaller peptide shown in light blue. It's a fragment from the C-terminus (the end) of the K-Ras4B protein.\n    *   **Modification:** The entry confirms that the K-Ras peptide is \"S-farnesylated.\" This means a farnesyl group (a type of lipid) is attached to a cysteine residue. This modification is represented by the yellow stick structure and is crucial for the interaction between K-Ras and Calmodulin.\n6.  **Synthesize the final answer:** The question asks for the name of \"this protein\". While the image shows a complex of two molecules, the dominant structure is Calmodulin. In common biochemical contexts, this image would be used to illustrate the structure of Calmodulin and its ability to bind to target peptides like the one from K-Ras. Therefore, the most appropriate and direct answer is the name of the main protein.\n\n<<<Calmodulin>>>"
