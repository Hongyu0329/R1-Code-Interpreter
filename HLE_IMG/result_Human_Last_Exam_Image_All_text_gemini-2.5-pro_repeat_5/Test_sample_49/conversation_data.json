    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. Node $a_0$ is connected to a capacitor $C$ which goes to ground. This configuration forms a low-pass RC filter. The resistance part of this filter is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder network as seen from node $a_0$.\n\n**2. Formulating the Problem**\nThe cutoff frequency of a first-order RC low-pass filter is the frequency at which the signal amplitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is given by:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$\nTo find the cutoff frequency, we first need to determine the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen at node $a_0$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo calculate $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to turn off all independent sources in the network. The input `IN` is a voltage source connected at node $c_0$. Turning it off means connecting node $c_0$ to ground. The node $b_0$ is already connected to ground. Therefore, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also grounded.\n\nBased on the diagram, node $a_0$ is identical to node $d_0$ in the ladder structure. So, we need to find the resistance looking into node $d_0$ of the infinite ladder, with $c_0$ grounded.\n\n**4. Using Difference Equations to Analyze the Infinite Ladder**\nWe can solve for the resistance by applying a test voltage $V_T$ at node $d_0$ and calculating the current $I_T$ that flows into the node. Then, $R_{th} = V_T / I_T$.\n\nLet $v_c(n)$ and $v_d(n)$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively.\nThe boundary conditions for our setup are:\n*   $v_d(0) = V_T$\n*   $v_c(0) = 0$ (since the input source is turned off)\n*   As $n \\to \\infty$, the voltages must go to zero, $v_c(\\infty) = 0$ and $v_d(\\infty) = 0$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at a generic node $c_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{v_c(n) - v_c(n-1)}{r} + \\frac{v_c(n) - v_c(n+1)}{r} + \\frac{v_c(n) - v_d(n)}{r} = 0$\n$3v_c(n) - v_c(n-1) - v_c(n+1) - v_d(n) = 0 \\quad (1)$\n\nApplying KCL at a generic node $d_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{v_d(n) - v_d(n-1)}{r} + \\frac{v_d(n) - v_d(n+1)}{r} + \\frac{v_d(n) - v_c(n)}{r} = 0$\n$3v_d(n) - v_d(n-1) - v_d(n+1) - v_c(n) = 0 \\quad (2)$\n\nThese are a pair of coupled linear difference equations. We seek solutions of the form $v_c(n) = A k^n$ and $v_d(n) = B k^n$. Substituting these into the equations and simplifying gives two propagation modes. For the voltages to decay to zero at infinity, we must use the modes with $|k|<1$. The valid modes are:\n*   Common mode: $k=1$, with $A=B$. This mode does not decay.\n*   Differential mode: $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$, with $A=-B$. This mode decays since $|2-\\sqrt{3}| < 1$.\n\nThe general solution is a superposition of modes. To satisfy the condition at infinity, we only use solutions that decay. A more general approach is to build the solution from the two fundamental modes:\n$v_c(n) = C_1 + C_2 k^n$\n$v_d(n) = C_1 - C_2 k^n$\nwhere $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions at $n=0$:\n$v_c(0) = C_1 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -C_2$\n$v_d(0) = C_1 - C_2 = V_T$\n\nSubstituting $C_1 = -C_2$ into the second equation:\n$-C_2 - C_2 = V_T \\implies -2C_2 = V_T \\implies C_2 = -V_T/2$.\nThen, $C_1 = V_T/2$.\n\nSo, the voltage profiles are:\n$v_c(n) = \\frac{V_T}{2}(1 - k^n)$\n$v_d(n) = \\frac{V_T}{2}(1 + k^n)$\n\n**5. Calculating the Current and Resistance**\nThe current $I_T$ flowing into node $d_0$ is the current through the resistor between $d_0$ and $d_1$:\n$I_T = \\frac{v_d(0) - v_d(1)}{r}$\nWe have $v_d(0) = V_T$ and $v_d(1) = \\frac{V_T}{2}(1 + k)$.\n$I_T = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_T - \\frac{V_T}{2}(1+k) \\right) = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{k}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_T}{2r}(1-k)$\n\nNow, we can find $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_T}{I_T} = \\frac{V_T}{\\frac{V_T}{2r}(1-k)} = \\frac{2r}{1-k}$\n\nSubstitute $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**6. Final Answer: The Cutoff Frequency**\nNow substitute this result for $R_{th}$ into the formula for the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$. The angular frequency is a common and direct way to express this.\n\nFinal Answer: The angular cutoff frequency is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\n<<<$1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
