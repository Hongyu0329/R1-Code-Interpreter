    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork:\n\n**Row 1: Top**\n\n1.  **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** This is a figure painting in Chinese ink and color, depicting women from an ethnic minority group. The style, characterized by dynamic lines, a combination of detailed rendering (for faces) and expressive brushwork (for clothing), and the specific subject matter, is a hallmark of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**. His signature often included \"邦文\" (Bāng Wén), his personal name, which appears to be visible here along with a red seal.\n2.  **Artwork 2 (Top Middle):** This is an abstract ink landscape painting. The artist uses strong, rhythmic lines to deconstruct and reconstruct the scenery (buildings, trees, mountains). This approach of abstracting landscapes into lines and dots is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, who famously integrated Western modernist principles with Chinese ink painting.\n3.  **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly dynamic and powerful cursive script (草书). The text is from the famous poem \"Qinyuanchun · Snow\" (沁园春·雪). This particular unrestrained, bold, and majestic calligraphic style is internationally recognized as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n\n**Row 2: Middle**\n\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy. The signature on the left reads \"启功书\" (Qǐ Gōng shū), identifying the artist as **Qi Gong (启功)**. His calligraphy is famous for its elegant, scholarly, and unique structure, often referred to as the \"Qi Style\" (启体).\n5.  **Artwork 5 (Middle Center):** This is a realist oil painting of a young woman standing before a mural. This is one of the most iconic works of Chinese contemporary realism, titled \"Youth\" (《青年》). It was painted by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a master of the Neoclassical style in China.\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** This is a portrait of a woman from an ethnic minority, rendered in a highly stylized manner with ink and heavy color. The elongated features, large expressive eyes, and the fusion of traditional ink techniques with a modern, almost primitive expressionism are characteristic of the artist **Shi Hu (石虎)**.\n\n**Row 3: Bottom**\n\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This is a colorful painting depicting a courtyard with hanging gourds and laundry. The artist uses vibrant colors, strong black outlines, and a composition that finds beauty in ordinary rural life. The signature \"吴冠中\" is visible on the wall to the right. This is a classic work by **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a Chinese landscape painting (山水画) depicting a river gorge with boats. The technique involves building up layers of ink to create a sense of depth, weight, and monumentality, with a small touch of color (the red sails) to add life. This \"layered ink\" technique and majestic landscape composition are signatures of **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The artist captures the creature's form and texture with masterful, minimalist, and lively brushstrokes. Painting shrimp, crabs, and other crustaceans in this manner was the most famous specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Qi Gong, Jin Shangyi, Shi Hu, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
