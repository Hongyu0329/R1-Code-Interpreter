    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the First Clue and the Image**\n\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   A search for major events on June 20, 2019, reveals that the NHL Awards ceremony took place on this date in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as hockey player Nikita Kucherov, who won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award that night. The man presenting the award is identifiable as hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.\n*   The clue \"X Y is pictured at an event\" means that something or someone called \"X Y\" was present and photographed at the 2019 NHL Awards. It does not necessarily mean that \"X Y\" is the person shown in this specific image. The image's primary purpose is to identify the event.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Second Clue**\n\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical or industrial context. The use of mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, was a key part of the process for making felt hats in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n*   Workers in this industry, known as **hatters**, often suffered from mercury poisoning. The neurological symptoms, which included tremors, irritability, and shyness, became known as \"mad hatter disease.\"\n*   This gave rise to the common English idiom \"mad as a hatter,\" popularized by the character of the **Hatter** in Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*.\n*   The profession of a hatter using mercury has indeed \"almost ceased to be used\" due to the known toxicity.\n*   This strongly suggests that \"X Y\" is **Mad Hatter**.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Two Clues**\n\n*   We have identified the event as the 2019 NHL Awards and the term \"X Y\" as \"Mad Hatter.\" Now we must find the connection between the two.\n*   We need to find a person at the 2019 NHL Awards who could be referred to as a \"Mad Hatter.\"\n*   At that ceremony, goaltender **Robin Lehner** won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his perseverance and dedication after publicly sharing his struggles with bipolar disorder and addiction.\n*   Lehner is known for his intense and passionate on-ice personality. Due to this intensity and his candidness about his mental health battles, he has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Mad Hatter\" by fans and media, connecting him to the famous character and phrase.\n*   Robin Lehner was a very prominent figure at the 2019 NHL Awards, and his emotional acceptance speech was a major highlight of the evening. Therefore, a \"Mad Hatter\" (Robin Lehner) was indeed present and \"pictured at the event.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two clues work together to identify \"X Y.\" The first clue identifies the event (2019 NHL Awards) where a person nicknamed the \"Mad Hatter\" (Robin Lehner) was a prominent award winner. The second clue refers to the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter,\" which relates to the historical use of toxic mercury salts in the hat-making industry.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
