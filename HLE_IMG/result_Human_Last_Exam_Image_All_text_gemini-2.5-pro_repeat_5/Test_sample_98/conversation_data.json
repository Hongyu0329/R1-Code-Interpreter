    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The image displays a circular metal object with a tab at the top, indicating it is a medallion or a phalera (a decorative disk, often part of a horse's harness or military decoration). It is decorated in high relief.\n\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:** The central scene shows two figures in profile, facing each other (a composition known as \"confronted busts\").\n    *   **Left Figure:** This is a male figure distinguished by prominent, curved ram's horns integrated into his headwear or hair. His hair is depicted in a stylized, curled fashion. This iconography is significant. While ram's horns were associated with Zeus-Ammon in the Hellenistic world (famously adopted by Alexander the Great), they were also a symbol of the war god Verethragna in Zoroastrianism and were incorporated into the crowns of certain Sasanian kings, notably Shapur II.\n    *   **Right Figure:** This figure is less clear but appears to be a female, likely a queen, wearing her own distinct headdress. The depiction of a royal couple was a common theme in the art of this period.\n\n3.  **Stylistic Analysis:** The artistic style is not naturalistic in the Greco-Roman sense. The features are stylized, the lines are deeply cut, and there is a strong emphasis on pattern and formal arrangement. This bold, somewhat rigid, and highly decorative style is a hallmark of art from the Sasanian Empire (224â€“651 A.D.). Sasanian metalwork, in particular, is known for these characteristics.\n\n4.  **Historical Context and Dating:**\n    *   The combination of the confronted busts of a royal couple and the specific ram's horn crown points strongly to the Sasanian dynasty of Persia.\n    *   This particular medallion is a well-known artifact. Scholars of Sasanian art, such as Prudence Oliver Harper, identify the king as Shapur II, who reigned from 309 to 379 A.D. His reign falls entirely within the 4th century A.D.\n    *   The style of the crowns, the rendering of the hair, and the overall composition are consistent with other Sasanian artworks securely dated to this period.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the distinctive Sasanian iconography (ram's horn crown of Shapur II) and artistic style, archaeologists and art historians confidently date this medallion to the reign of Shapur II. Therefore, the object belongs to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
