    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to identify and count the total number of unique mRNA splice species based on the provided RT-PCR results. RT-PCR is used to amplify specific segments of mRNA after converting it to cDNA, allowing for the detection of different splice variants. Each distinct band on the gel represents a unique PCR product, which corresponds to a specific splice species.\n\n2.  **Analysis of each PCR panel:**\n\n    *   **Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R):** This reaction shows two distinct bands, band 1 (190 bp) and band 2 (159 bp). This indicates the presence of **two** different splice species in the region between primers E1F1 and E4R.\n        *   Species 1: gives a 190 bp product.\n        *   Species 2: gives a 159 bp product.\n\n    *   **Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R):** This reaction also shows two bands, band 1 (584 bp) and band 2 (553 bp). The forward primer (E1F1) is the same as in panel B, but the reverse primer (E5R) is further downstream. The results are consistent with the two species found in panel B, just amplified as longer products. No new species are identified here.\n\n    *   **Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R):** This reaction shows one band of 551 bp. The forward primer, E1F2, is specifically designed to span the 929^3465 splice junction. Therefore, this 551 bp product represents a **new, third** splice species that specifically contains this splice.\n        *   Species 3: contains the 929^3465 splice, amplified by E1F2/E5R.\n\n    *   **Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R):** This reaction shows one band of 1,005 bp. This product results from amplifying a region from the early gene E1 to the late gene L2. This represents a **new, fourth** splice species.\n        *   Species 4: connects E1 and L2, amplified by E1F1/L2R.\n\n    *   **Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R):** This reaction shows one band of 972 bp. It uses the splice-junction primer E1F2 with the L2R reverse primer. This product is different from those identified previously and represents a **new, fifth** splice species.\n        *   Species 5: contains the 929^3465 splice and connects to L2.\n\n    *   **Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R):** This reaction shows two bands, band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp). The forward primer, E1F3, spans the 929^3506 splice junction. The presence of two products indicates that there are **two new** splice species that both contain this specific splice but differ in additional splicing events between the E1F3 and L2R primer binding sites.\n        *   Species 6: gives a 1,003 bp product, contains the 929^3506 splice.\n        *   Species 7: gives a 931 bp product, also contains the 929^3506 splice.\n\n    *   **Panel H (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This reaction shows two bands, band 1 (450 bp) and band 2 (419 bp). These products connect the E1 region to the L1 region. These represent **two new** splice species.\n        *   Species 8: gives a 450 bp product with E1F1/L1R.\n        *   Species 9: gives a 419 bp product with E1F1/L1R.\n\n    *   **Panel I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same reaction as panel H but with more amplification cycles, revealing less abundant transcripts. It shows four bands:\n        *   Band 1 (450 bp) and Band 2 (419 bp): These are the same as Species 8 and 9 identified in panel H.\n        *   Band 3 (378 bp) and Band 4 (187 bp): These are two additional, distinct products, representing **two more new** splice species.\n        *   Species 10: gives a 378 bp product with E1F1/L1R.\n        *   Species 11: gives a 187 bp product with E1F1/L1R.\n\n3.  **Tally of all unique splice species:**\n    *   From Panel B: 2 species\n    *   From Panel D: 1 new species\n    *   From Panel E: 1 new species\n    *   From Panel F: 1 new species\n    *   From Panel G: 2 new species\n    *   From Panels H and I combined: 4 new species (2 dominant, 2 less abundant)\n\n    Total number of species = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically analyzing each RT-PCR experiment, we can identify every unique product band as a distinct splice species. Summing up all the unique species found across all panels gives the total number.\n\n*   **List of identified species:**\n    1.  E1F1/E4R product (190 bp)\n    2.  E1F1/E4R product (159 bp)\n    3.  E1F2/E5R product (551 bp)\n    4.  E1F1/L2R product (1,005 bp)\n    5.  E1F2/L2R product (972 bp)\n    6.  E1F3/L2R product (1,003 bp)\n    7.  E1F3/L2R product (931 bp)\n    8.  E1F1/L1R product (450 bp)\n    9.  E1F1/L1R product (419 bp)\n    10. E1F1/L1R product (378 bp)\n    11. E1F1/L1R product (187 bp)\n\nThere are a total of 11 different splice species detected in these experiments.\n\n<<<11>>>"
