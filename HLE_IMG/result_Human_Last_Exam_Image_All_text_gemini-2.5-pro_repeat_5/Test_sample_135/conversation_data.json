    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\n*   The image displays a circular relief sculpture, known as a tondo or roundel, set within a decorative frame.\n*   The subject matter is religious. It depicts a priest administering a sacrament, specifically the Eucharist (Communion), to a group of kneeling figures, including a child.\n*   At the bottom of the roundel, there is an inscription on a cartouche that reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\". This is Old French/Italian for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject.\n*   The style of the sculpture—with its graceful, idealized figures, flowing drapery, and clear composition—is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, particularly the Florentine school of the 15th century.\n*   The material appears to be a smooth, reflective substance, consistent with glazed terracotta, a medium famously perfected and popularized by a specific family of artists.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the style and medium to a specific artist or workshop.**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta, the tondo format, the religious subject matter, and the specific figural style are hallmarks of the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence.\n*   Luca della Robbia pioneered this technique, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, continued and expanded the workshop's production with great success. Andrea's style is often characterized by its sweetness and grace, which is evident in the figures depicted.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and its creator.**\n*   Searching for \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\" leads to a specific work: the **Corpus Domini Altarpiece** (or Altarpiece of the Sacrament).\n*   This altarpiece was created for the church of Saints Jacopo and Antonio in Fucecchio, Italy.\n*   The roundel in the photograph is one of the predella panels (the base of the altarpiece) of this larger work.\n*   Art historical sources firmly attribute the Corpus Domini Altarpiece in Fucecchio, including this predella panel, to the sculptor **Andrea della Robbia**. The work is dated to the period around 1484-1490.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n*   Based on the distinctive style, the subject matter, the inscription, and the identification of the specific altarpiece from which this detail originates, the author is confirmed to be Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
