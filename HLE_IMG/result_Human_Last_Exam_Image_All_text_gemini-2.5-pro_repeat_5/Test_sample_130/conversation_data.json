    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image displays an atomic emission spectrum. When atoms of a gas are excited (for example, by passing an electric current through them), their electrons jump to higher energy levels. When these electrons fall back to lower energy levels, they emit light at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, it produces a series of bright lines on a dark background. The pattern of these lines is unique for each element.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the pattern of the spectral lines**\nWe need to observe the prominent lines and their positions within the visible light spectrum, which ranges from violet/blue (shorter wavelengths, on the left) to red (longer wavelengths, on the right).\n*   **Red Region (Right):** There is a prominent, bright red line.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct, bright yellow line.\n*   **Green Region:** There are several lines, including a couple of prominent green ones.\n*   **Blue-Green (Cyan) Region:** There is a notable bright line in the blue-green part of the spectrum.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region (Left):** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed spectrum with known elemental spectra**\nThis unique pattern of lines acts as a \"fingerprint\" for the element. We can compare this pattern to the known spectra of common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a blue-green line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is far more complex, with many more lines. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** The sodium spectrum is famous for being dominated by a very strong, closely spaced pair of lines (a doublet) in the yellow part of the spectrum. While the image shows a yellow line, it also shows many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is known for producing a large number of bright lines concentrated in the red and orange parts of the spectrum, which is why neon signs have their characteristic reddish-orange glow. The spectrum in the image has prominent lines across the entire visible range, including strong green and blue lines. Therefore, it is not neon.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of helium has several prominent lines distributed across the visible spectrum. These include a bright red line, a bright yellow line, a bright green line, a blue-green line, and several blue and violet lines. This description perfectly matches the pattern observed in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the pattern of lines in the given image with the known emission spectra of various elements, we can confidently identify the element. The specific arrangement and colors of the lines are a classic representation of the emission spectrum of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
