    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the identity of the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artwork and Mythological Scene**\nThe image is a photograph of an ancient Greek vase, specifically an Apulian red-figure pelike (a type of jar). The style is characteristic of South Italian vase painting from the 4th century BC. The scene depicted is a famous episode from Greek mythology: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus. In this myth, suitors for the hand of Princess Hippodamia had to defeat her father, Oenomaus, in a chariot race. Oenomaus had magical horses and had killed many suitors. Pelops, with the help of the gods and by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, managed to win the race, which resulted in the death of Oenomaus.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Figures**\nBased on the mythological context and artistic conventions, we can identify the figures:\n*   **The Charioteer:** The figure holding the reins and wearing a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap (a soft conical cap associated with people from the East, like Pelops who was from Lydia). This is **Pelops**, the hero and victor.\n*   **The Fallen Man:** The nude male figure on the ground, contorted as if in a violent fall, is **King Oenomaus**, the father of Hippodamia, who has just crashed his chariot. The vase painter has combined the victorious chariot of Pelops and the crash of Oenomaus into a single, dramatic scene.\n*   **The Female Passenger:** The woman standing in the chariot next to Pelops is **Hippodamia**, the princess whose hand is the prize of the race. She is looking back towards her falling father.\n*   **The Winged Figure:** The wing visible at the top left belongs to a divine being, likely Eros (the god of love, representing the love between Pelops and Hippodamia that drives the plot) or Nike (the goddess of victory).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Question and the Figures' Actions**\nThe question is \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  **Literal Interpretation:** The figure literally falling out of a chariot is King Oenomaus. He is shown mid-fall, a violent and definitive act of \"leaving the chariot\".\n2.  **Compositional/Interpretive Interpretation:** The question might refer to the dynamic pose of the female passenger, Hippodamia. She is a central figure, and her body is turned backward while the chariot moves forward. Her drapery billows dramatically, creating a strong sense of motion that could be visually described as \"leaving\" or pulling away from the main action of the chariot.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Identity**\nWhile Oenomaus is the one literally leaving a chariot via a crash, the question may be directed at the prominent passenger figure whose dramatic pose is a key focus of the composition. Hippodamia is depicted looking back at the tragedy of her father's fall. Her entire upper body is turned, and her cloak flies behind her. This strong visual dynamism, capturing her emotional and physical reaction, could be described as her \"leaving\" the forward momentum and celebratory moment of the chariot ride to look back at the past (her father). Given her prominence in the scene and her highly active pose, she is the most likely subject of the question.\n\nThe figure is the female passenger in the chariot, who is looking backward. This figure is Hippodamia.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
