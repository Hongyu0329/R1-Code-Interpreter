    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n    *   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, who has a beard, is receiving a trophy from the older man on the left.\n    *   The question states the event took place on June 20, 2019.\n    *   By identifying the man receiving the award, we can understand the context. The man is Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The man presenting the award is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n    *   The date corresponds to the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony (which was held on June 19, 2019, the date given is a very close match).\n    *   At this specific event, Nikita Kucherov had an exceptional night, winning three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (for the league's most valuable player), the Ted Lindsay Award (for the most outstanding player as voted by the players), and the Art Ross Trophy (for leading the league in points).\n    *   Winning three major awards in this fashion is often referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. This makes \"Hat trick\" a very strong candidate for \"X Y\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n    *   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This clue requires us to find a different meaning or context for \"X Y\" that connects to mercury salts.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the candidate \"Hat trick\" to the second clue.**\n    *   If \"X Y\" is \"Hat trick\", the clue refers to another kind of \"hat trick\". The term \"hat trick\" inherently contains the word \"hat\".\n    *   Historically, the process of making felt for hats (particularly fur-felt hats like top hats and fedoras) involved a technique called \"carroting\".\n    *   This process used a solution of mercuric nitrate, a highly toxic mercury salt, to treat the fur, making it easier to felt.\n    *   Workers in this industry, known as \"hatters,\" were often exposed to mercury vapors, which led to neurological damage and symptoms like tremors, slurred speech, and erratic behavior. This condition gave rise to the popular phrase \"mad as a hatter\".\n    *   Due to the severe health risks and toxicity, the use of mercury salts in hat manufacturing was eventually banned and has now almost completely ceased.\n    *   Therefore, the old \"trick\" or method of making hats using mercury has ceased to be used. This perfectly fits the description in the second clue.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   The first part of the question points to the metaphorical \"hat trick\" of awards won by Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    *   The second part of the question alludes to the historical \"trick\" (process) of making hats, which used toxic mercury salts and has been discontinued.\n    *   The term \"Hat trick\" successfully links both clues together.\n\n<<<Hat trick>>>"
