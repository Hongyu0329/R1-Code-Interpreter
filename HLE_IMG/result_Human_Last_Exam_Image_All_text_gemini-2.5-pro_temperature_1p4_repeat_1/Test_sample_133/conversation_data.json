    "An analysis of the mass spectrum leads to the determination of the unknown compound's structure.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and its Isotopic Pattern**\n\n*   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear in a cluster: m/z 260 (relative intensity I=34.8%), m/z 262 (I=29.0%), m/z 264 (I=12.9%), and m/z 266 (I=3.22%). This cluster represents the molecular ion (M⁺) and its isotopologues.\n*   The relative intensities of these peaks are approximately 100 : 83 : 37 : 9 (normalized to the m/z 260 peak). This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing three chlorine atoms. The theoretical ratio for three chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) is approximately M : M+2 : M+4 : M+6 ≈ 100 : 96 : 31 : 3. The observed pattern is a good match.\n*   The lowest mass peak of this cluster, m/z 260, corresponds to the molecule containing only the most abundant isotopes (e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl). This is the nominal molecular weight.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Base Peak and its Isotopic Pattern**\n\n*   The base peak (the peak with 100% relative intensity) is at m/z 225.\n*   This peak is part of an isotopic cluster: m/z 225 (I=100%), m/z 227 (I=66.7%), and m/z 229 (I=22.2%).\n*   The relative intensities are approximately 100 : 67 : 22. This pattern is characteristic of a fragment containing two chlorine atoms. The theoretical ratio for a two-chlorine species is M : M+2 : M+4 ≈ 100 : 65 : 10. The observed M:M+2 ratio is an excellent match, while the M+4 peak is somewhat more intense than theory predicts, which is common.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Primary Fragmentation Pathway**\n\n*   The molecular ion (M₀⁺) has m/z 260 and contains three chlorine atoms.\n*   The base peak fragment has m/z 225 and contains two chlorine atoms.\n*   The mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds exactly to the mass of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n*   This indicates that the primary fragmentation pathway is the loss of a chlorine radical from the molecular ion: M⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺. This is a common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds.\n\n**Step 4: Identify another key Fragmentation Pathway**\n\n*   There is another significant peak at m/z 143 (I=27.8%).\n*   Let's calculate the mass difference between the molecular ion and this fragment: 260 - 143 = 117 u.\n*   A mass of 117 u corresponds to a CCl₃ group (12 u for Carbon + 3 * 35 u for Chlorine = 117 u).\n*   This indicates a second important fragmentation pathway: the loss of a trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃). This suggests the molecule has a C-CCl₃ bond.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\n*   From the fragmentation pathways, we can deduce the structure is R-CCl₃.\n*   The fragmentation M⁺ → R⁺ + •CCl₃ tells us that the fragment at m/z 143 is R⁺.\n*   The mass of the R⁺ cation is 143 u. We need to determine its formula. Using the \"Rule of 13\" for hydrocarbons, 143 / 13 = 11 with a remainder of 0. This suggests a formula of C₁₁H₁₁.\n*   Thus, the parent molecule is C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃, giving a total molecular formula of C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n*   Let's verify this formula:\n    *   Molecular weight (all ³⁵Cl): 12*12 + 11*1 + 3*35 = 144 + 11 + 105 = 260. This matches the M₀⁺ peak.\n    *   Fragmentation loss of Cl: The resulting fragment would be [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺. Mass = 12*12 + 11 + 2*35 = 144 + 11 + 70 = 225. This matches the base peak.\n    *   All evidence consistently points to the molecular formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and a structure containing a C₁₁H₁₁ group attached to a CCl₃ group.\n*   The structure is likely of the form (R')(R'')CH-CCl₃. The fragment [ (R')(R'')CH ]⁺ is the ion at m/z 143 (C₁₁H₁₁⁺). The group (R')(R'') must therefore have the formula C₁₀H₁₀.\n*   A plausible and symmetric structure for a C₁₀H₁₀ group is two cyclopentadienyl rings (C₅H₅).\n*   Therefore, the structure is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopentadienyl)ethane.\n\n**Step 6: Provide the Systematic IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The longest carbon chain is two carbons (ethane).\n*   Carbon-1 has three chloro substituents (1,1,1-trichloro).\n*   Carbon-2 has two cyclopentadienyl substituents (2,2-bis...).\n*   The full name specifying the double bond positions in the rings is 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl)ethane. A commonly accepted simplification is sufficient.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for the compound is:\n1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopentadien-1-yl)ethane.\n\n<<<1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(cyclopentadien-1-yl)ethane>>>"
