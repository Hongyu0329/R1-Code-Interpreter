    "*   **Analysis of the Question:** The question asks to determine the biological sexes of three pairs of insects (labeled A, B, and C). The premise is that these are pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-carrying hairs on the legs) and that both sexes feed on nectar. The answer should be provided as a sequence of three numbers corresponding to the options for each pair.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze Pair A**\n    *   **Identification:** The insects in pair A are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees (like *Megachile*). As cleptoparasites, females do not collect pollen and thus lack scopae, which fits the question's premise.\n    *   **Sex Determination:**\n        *   **Insect A (left):** This individual has a relatively blunt abdomen tip with several small spines or prongs. This multi-pointed abdominal tip is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n        *   **Insect A (right):** This individual has a very long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This specialized shape is used by the female to pierce the host's nest to lay her egg. This is a definitive feature of a female *Coelioxys*.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Pair B**\n    *   **Identification:** The insects in pair B are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae as they typically provision their nests with prey, not pollen. They do, however, visit flowers for nectar and can act as pollinators. This also fits the question's premise.\n    *   **Sex Determination:**\n        *   **Insect B (left):** A key feature for sexing many male wasps is the shape of their antennae. This individual's antennae are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a characteristic of male *Polistes* wasps.\n        *   **Insect B (right):** This individual's antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. This is characteristic of a female *Polistes* wasp.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Pair C**\n    *   **Identification:** The insects in pair C appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*).\n    *   **Premise Contradiction:** The question states the taxa are without scopae on their legs. However, the insect on the left (C-left) has very large, dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on its hind legs, which are heavily loaded with yellow pollen. This contradicts the premise. Despite this contradiction, we must rely on the clear visual evidence to determine the sexes. The premise might be flawed or intended to be a distractor.\n    *   **Sex Determination:**\n        *   **Insect C (left):** This bee possesses prominent scopae on its hind legs and is actively carrying a large amount of pollen. Pollen collection for provisioning a nest is exclusively a female activity in bees. Therefore, this is a female.\n        *   **Insect C (right):** This bee has noticeably long antennae that curve back over its body. This is the defining characteristic of male long-horned bees. Males do not collect pollen and lack scopae.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is a female (F) and the right insect is a male (M). This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Compilation:**\n    *   Pair A: M, F → Index 3\n    *   Pair B: M, F → Index 3\n    *   Pair C: F, M → Index 4\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices separated by commas.\n\n3, 3, 4\n<<<3, 3, 4>>>"
