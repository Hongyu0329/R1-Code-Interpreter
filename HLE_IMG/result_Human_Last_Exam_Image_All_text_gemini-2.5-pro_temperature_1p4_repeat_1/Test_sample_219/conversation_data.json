    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing times of neurons detected by multiple electrodes.\n*   The **Y-axis** represents the \"Electrode Number,\" ranging from 0 to 128.\n*   The **X-axis** represents \"Time\" in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   Each black dot signifies an action potential (a \"firing\" or \"spike\").\n*   A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many electrodes show high firing activity simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands on the plot.\nThe task is to identify these bursts, find the time between them (inter-burst interval), and then calculate the average of these intervals.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nWe need to scan the graph along the time axis and note the time at which each major synchronized burst occurs. We can estimate the time by finding the center of each dense vertical band of activity.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first prominent burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major burst is clearly centered around **t₂ = 15 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Following that, another synchronized event is centered at approximately **t₃ = 26 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A very strong burst is visible centered at **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The last clear burst in the recording is centered around **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps for the five identified bursts are approximately 2 s, 15 s, 26 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between consecutive bursts. Since we identified 5 bursts, we will have 4 intervals.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 2 s = **13 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** t₃ - t₂ = 26 s - 15 s = **11 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 26 s = **10 s**\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\nThe calculated intervals are 13 s, 11 s, 10 s, and 12 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of intervals:** 13 + 11 + 10 + 12 = 46 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be reported to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.5. This number has three significant figures (1, 1, and 5).\n*   To round to two significant figures, we examine the third digit. Since it is 5, we round up the second digit.\n*   Rounding 11.5 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
