    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the numbered positions.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the overall transformation**\nThe reaction shows a complex pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol reacting under acidic conditions (catalytic HCl) and heat (110 Â°C) to form a rearranged alkene and water. This is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves a series of [1,2] shifts of hydride (H) and methyl (CH3) groups. The goal of the rearrangement is to form a more thermodynamically stable carbocation, which then eliminates a proton to form a stable alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the starting material and the product structure**\nThe starting material has a friedelane-type skeleton. Key features for the rearrangement are the substituents on the \"backbone\" of the fused ring system.\n- C4: two CH3 groups\n- C5: one H atom\n- C10: one CH3 group\n- C9: one H atom\n- C8: one H atom\n- C14: one CH3 group\n- C13: one H atom\n\nThe product has an oleanane-type skeleton with a tetrasubstituted double bond between C13 and C18. The formation of this stable alkene is the driving force for the reaction. Let's examine the substituents in the product as drawn:\n- At position 1 (on C4): a gem-dimethyl group.\n- At position 2 (on C10): a methyl group.\n- At position 3 (on the backbone): a hydrogen atom (implied, dashed bond).\n- At position 4 (on C14): a methyl group.\n- At position 5 (on the backbone): a hydrogen atom (implied, dashed bond).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction mechanism and resolve contradictions**\nA standard textbook mechanism would start with the protonation of the hydroxyl group at C3, followed by the loss of water to form a secondary carbocation at C3. A subsequent cascade of [1,2] shifts would ensue. However, if we follow this standard mechanism (starting with a methyl shift from C4 to C3), we find that it leads to a product where the substituents on the A and B rings (including at C4 and C10) are changed. This contradicts the provided product structure, which shows these parts of the molecule as being unchanged.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we must hypothesize a reaction pathway that is consistent with the provided structures. The product structure suggests that the A and B rings have not participated in the rearrangement. This implies that the rearrangement cascade did not start at C3/C4 but initiated further down the molecular backbone. Under these harsh reaction conditions, it's possible for a carbocation to be formed at another tertiary position (like C5, C8, or C9) through processes like hydride abstraction.\n\nLet's consider a mechanism that starts at C9. This would require the fewest steps while still involving \"a number of [1,2] shifts\" and producing the correct final skeleton.\n1.  **Initiation:** A carbocation is formed at C9.\n2.  **First [1,2] shift:** A hydride ion (H-) shifts from C8 to C9. This moves the positive charge to C8.\n3.  **Second [1,2] shift:** The C13-C14 bond migrates to C8. This is a skeletal rearrangement that converts the friedelane C/D/E ring system to the more stable oleanane system and places the positive charge at the tertiary carbon C13.\n4.  **Elimination:** A proton is removed from the adjacent carbon C18 to form the highly stable tetrasubstituted double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the identity of the substituents at the numbered positions**\nThis proposed mechanism leaves the A and B rings (and their substituents) untouched. The substituents at C14 are also not involved in a shift (the bond migrates, not the group). Therefore, we can determine the identity of the substituents at positions 1-5 by inspecting the starting material and tracing the few relevant shifts.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This label points to a methyl group on C4. This carbon and its substituents are not part of the rearrangement. Thus, the substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2:** This label points to the methyl group on C10. This is also on the A/B ring system and is not affected. The substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 3:** This label points to a hydrogen on the backbone (likely at C5), which is unaffected by this shorter rearrangement pathway. The substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 4:** This label points to the methyl group at C14. The group itself does not migrate in this mechanism. The substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 5:** This label points to a hydrogen on the backbone (likely at C9). In the mechanism, C9 loses its original hydrogen but gains one from C8. The net result is that the substituent at C9 is **H**.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude the identities of the substituents.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H}$."
