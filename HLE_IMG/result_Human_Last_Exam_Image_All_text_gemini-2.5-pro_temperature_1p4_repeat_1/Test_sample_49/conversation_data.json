    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This is typically the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ where the magnitude of the transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value (the -3dB point). For a first-order RC filter, the cutoff frequency is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the time constant, $C$ is the capacitance, and $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to determine the equivalent resistance seen from the terminals of the capacitor, which are node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). To do this, we deactivate any independent sources in the circuit. The input signal `IN` at node $c_0$ is an independent voltage source, so we deactivate it by replacing it with a short circuit to ground. Thus, node $c_0$ is grounded.\n\nThe capacitor $C$ is connected to node $a_0$. Looking from node $a_0$ into the ladder network, we see a resistor $r$ connected in series to node $d_1$. The rest of the network is connected from node $d_1$ onwards. Therefore, the Thevenin resistance can be expressed as:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1,gnd}$\nwhere $R_{d1,gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $d_1$ and ground (which is the potential of node $c_0$).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ to the right $(c_\\infty, d_\\infty)$ is an infinite ladder network composed of identical repeating sections. We can characterize this infinite ladder by its input resistance, known as the characteristic resistance, $R_0$. This is the resistance that would be measured between nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ for any $k \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a single section of the ladder, for instance, the section between $(c_{k-1}, d_{k-1})$ and $(c_k, d_k)$. This section consists of two series resistors of value $r$ (one on the top rail connecting $c_{k-1}$ to $c_k$, and one on the bottom rail connecting $d_{k-1}$ to $d_k$) and a shunt resistor of value $r$ connected between nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$.\n\nThe input resistance $R_{in}$ of a section, when terminated by a load resistance $R_{out}$, is given by the series resistors plus the combination of the shunt resistor and the load.\n$R_{in} = 2r + (r \\parallel R_{out}) = 2r + \\frac{r R_{out}}{r + R_{out}}$\n\nFor an infinite ladder, the input resistance of any section is the same as the input resistance of the next section, so $R_{in} = R_{out} = R_0$. This gives the equation for the characteristic resistance $R_0$:\n$R_0 = 2r + \\frac{r R_0}{r + R_0}$\n\nTo solve for $R_0$, we multiply by $(r + R_0)$:\n$R_0(r + R_0) = 2r(r + R_0) + rR_0$\n$rR_0 + R_0^2 = 2r^2 + 2rR_0 + rR_0$\n$R_0^2 - 2rR_0 - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $R_0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$R_0 = \\frac{-(-2r) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2}$\n$R_0 = \\frac{2r \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}r}{2} = r(1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive physical quantity, we take the positive root:\n$R_0 = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**4. Calculating $R_{d1,gnd}$**\nNow we can calculate the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$). We can simplify the circuit by replacing the entire infinite ladder to the right of nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ with its characteristic resistance $R_0$ connected between $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nThe resistance path from $d_1$ to ground ($c_0$) goes from $d_1$ to $c_1$ through the equivalent resistance of the ladder ($R_0$), and then from $c_1$ to $c_0$ through the resistor $r$. These two resistances are in series.\n$R_{d1,gnd} = R_0 + r$\nSubstituting the value of $R_0$:\n$R_{d1,gnd} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + r = r(1 + \\sqrt{3} + 1) = r(2 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**5. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$ and the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we substitute $R_{d1,gnd}$ back into the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1,gnd} = r + r(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = r(1 + 2 + \\sqrt{3}) = r(3 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\nFinally, we find the cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(3 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis expression can also be rationalized for a different representation:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{rC(3 + \\sqrt{3})} \\cdot \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{3 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{rC(3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{rC(9 - 3)} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{6rC}$\nBoth expressions are correct. We will provide the non-rationalized form as it more directly relates to the derived resistances.\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is related to the angular frequency by $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. So,\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(3 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, and typically in this context, the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is implied.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(3+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<\\frac{1}{(3+\\sqrt{3})rC}>>>"
