    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most obvious, visually distinct feature of the sporophyte (the spore-producing generation, which includes the stalk and capsule) that allows one to differentiate between the moss species *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The phrase \"at a glance\" suggests a macroscopic feature.\n\n2.  **Examine the Components of a Moss Sporophyte:** A typical moss sporophyte consists of a seta (the stalk) and a capsule (which contains the spores). The length and shape of the seta determine the position and orientation of the capsule relative to the leafy part of the moss (the gametophyte). These are key identification features.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   Descriptions in bryophyte floras and identification keys state that *Grimmia montana* has a sporophyte with a **short and straight seta**.\n    *   Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held erect (upright) and is typically \"emergent,\" meaning it just peeks out from among the tips of the surrounding leaves (the perichaetial leaves).\n    *   The provided image shows capsules that are upright and nestled among the plant's leafy parts, which is consistent with the characteristics of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   The species name, *curviseta*, provides a major clue. In Latin, \"curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte.\n    *   True to its name, the defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta* is its **strongly curved or arcuate seta**.\n    *   This pronounced curve causes the capsule to be bent over, appearing to nod or hang downwards (this is described as \"cernuous\"). The opening of the capsule often faces sideways or down, sometimes being hidden among the leaves.\n\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   **Grimmia montana:** Straight seta, resulting in an erect, upright capsule.\n    *   **Grimmia curviseta:** Curved seta, resulting in a nodding, bent-over capsule.\n    *   This difference in the seta's curvature and the resulting orientation of the capsule is a fundamental and easily visible feature. It is the primary characteristic used to separate these two species when they have mature sporophytes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Focus on the Sporophyte:** The question is specifically about the sporophyte, not the leaves or other gametophyte features, which can also have subtle differences.\n*   **\"At a glance\" feature:** The seta curvature is a macroscopic character that doesn't require a microscope, making it perfect for field identification \"at a glance.\"\n*   **The Name as a Clue:** The scientific name *Grimmia curviseta* directly points to its most distinguishing sporophytic feature.\n*   **Image Corroboration:** The image provided shows moss capsules that are erect on what appear to be very short, straight setae, perfectly illustrating the condition found in *Grimmia montana* and providing a visual contrast to what is expected for *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that the shape of the seta is the main distinguishing feature. For *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, making the capsule stand upright. For *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved, making the capsule nod or hang down. This is the most significant difference for quick identification.\n\n<<<The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **curvature of the seta (the stalk)**.\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is short and **straight**, causing the capsule to be held erect and upright.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, as its name implies (\"curvi-\" meaning curved), the seta is strongly **curved or arcuate**, causing the capsule to be nodding or bent over (cernuous)."
