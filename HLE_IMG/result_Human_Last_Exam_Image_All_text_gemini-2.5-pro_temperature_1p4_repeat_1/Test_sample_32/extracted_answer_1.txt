The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **curvature of the seta (the stalk)**.

*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is short and **straight**, causing the capsule to be held erect and upright.
*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, as its name implies ("curvi-" meaning curved), the seta is strongly **curved or arcuate**, causing the capsule to be nodding or bent over (cernuous).
