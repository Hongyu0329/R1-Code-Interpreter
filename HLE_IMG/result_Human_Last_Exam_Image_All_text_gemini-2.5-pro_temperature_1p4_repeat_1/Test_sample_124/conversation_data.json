    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing from the source.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the circuit's topology.**\nThe first step is to understand how the components are connected. The circuit consists of a voltage source (V2) and five resistors (R1, R2, R3, R7, R8). We need to simplify the resistor network to find the total equivalent resistance (Req) as seen by the voltage source.\n\n*   **Voltage Source:** V2 = 1 V. The total current we need to find is the current flowing out of the positive terminal of V2.\n\n*   **Right Branch Analysis:**\n    *   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series. This is because the current flows through R8 and then directly through R7 without any other path to take in between them.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of this series combination is R_78 = R7 + R8.\n    *   R_78 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n    *   This entire branch is connected across the voltage source, from the top wire (positive terminal) to the bottom wire (ground).\n\n*   **Left Branch Analysis (Crucial Point):**\n    *   Let's carefully trace the connections around R1, R2, and R3.\n    *   R1, R2, and R3 are connected in series with each other.\n    *   However, there is a wire that connects the main top wire (the one connected to the positive terminal of V2) directly to the node between resistor R2 and resistor R3.\n    *   This wire acts as a short circuit that bypasses resistors R1 and R2.\n    *   **Why?** The potential at the top of R1 is the source voltage (V+). The potential at the bottom of R2 is also V+ because of the direct connecting wire. Since the voltage potential at both ends of the series combination (R1 + R2) is the same, the potential difference across them is 0 V. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), if the voltage is zero, the current flowing through R1 and R2 is zero.\n    *   Therefore, R1 and R2 are effectively removed from the circuit for the purpose of calculating the total current.\n    *   This leaves only resistor R3 in the left branch. The top of R3 is connected to the node that is at V+ potential, and the bottom of R3 is connected to ground. So, R3 is connected directly across the voltage source.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Resistance (Req).**\nAfter simplification, the circuit consists of two components connected in parallel across the 1V source:\n1.  The left branch, which is just R3 = 9 Ω.\n2.  The right branch, which is the series combination R_78 = 200 Ω.\n\nThe total equivalent resistance (Req) for two resistors in parallel is calculated as:\n1 / Req = 1 / R3 + 1 / R_78\n1 / Req = 1 / 9 Ω + 1 / 200 Ω\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9 * 200 = 1800.\n1 / Req = 200 / 1800 + 9 / 1800\n1 / Req = 209 / 1800 Ω⁻¹\nReq = 1800 / 209 Ω ≈ 8.61 Ω\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Current (I_total).**\nUsing Ohm's Law, the total current flowing from the source is I_total = V2 / Req.\n\n*   **Method A: Using Req**\n    I_total = 1 V / (1800 / 209 Ω)\n    I_total = 209 / 1800 A\n    I_total ≈ 0.11611 A\n\n*   **Method B: Summing Branch Currents**\n    The total current is the sum of the currents in each parallel branch.\n    *   Current through the left branch (I_left) = V2 / R3 = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.11111 A\n    *   Current through the right branch (I_right) = V2 / R_78 = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n    *   I_total = I_left + I_right = (1/9) A + (1/200) A = 209/1800 A\n    *   I_total ≈ 0.11111 A + 0.005 A = 0.11611 A\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The total current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.116 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.116>>>"
