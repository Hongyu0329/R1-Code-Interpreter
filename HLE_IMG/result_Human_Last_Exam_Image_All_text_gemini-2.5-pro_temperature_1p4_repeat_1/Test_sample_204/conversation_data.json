    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identification of Specimens:** The first step is to identify each mineral specimen based on its visible physical properties such as crystal habit, color, and luster.\n    *   **Specimen C:** This specimen appears as a granular mass of olive-green crystals. This color and habit are highly characteristic of **Olivine**.\n    *   **Specimen A:** This is a dark, elongated, prismatic crystal. It exhibits vertical striations along its length and has a cross-section that appears as a rounded triangle. These features are classic identifiers for **Tourmaline**.\n    *   **Specimen B:** This specimen shows a very distinct flaky or platy habit. It consists of thin, easily separable sheets, indicating perfect basal cleavage. The color is greenish and it has a pearly luster. This is characteristic of a sheet silicate mineral, most likely from the **Mica** group (e.g., muscovite with impurities, or chlorite which is closely related).\n    *   **Specimen D:** This is a well-formed, translucent crystal with a glassy (vitreous) luster. It lacks cleavage planes and instead shows conchoidal fracture. The overall shape is a hexagonal prism. These are defining characteristics of **Quartz**. The brownish tint makes it a variety known as smoky quartz.\n\n2.  **Classification of Silicate Structures:** Each identified mineral belongs to a specific class of silicates, defined by how the fundamental silica tetrahedra ([SiO₄]⁴⁻) are linked together. The complexity of the structure increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n    *   **C (Olivine):** Olivine is a **Nesosilicate** (or island silicate). In this structure, the silica tetrahedra are isolated and not directly linked to each other. They are bonded together by metal cations. This represents the simplest silicate structure (0 shared oxygens).\n    *   **A (Tourmaline):** Tourmaline is a **Cyclosilicate** (or ring silicate). Its structure contains rings of six silica tetrahedra linked together, where each tetrahedron shares two oxygen atoms with its neighbors in the ring ([Si₆O₁₈] group).\n    *   **B (Mica):** Mica is a **Phyllosilicate** (or sheet silicate). In this structure, each tetrahedron shares three of its four oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, forming continuous two-dimensional sheets ([Si₄O₁₀]⁴⁻).\n    *   **D (Quartz):** Quartz is a **Tectosilicate** (or framework silicate). In this structure, every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional framework (SiO₂). This is the most polymerized and complex silicate structure.\n\n3.  **Ordering by Increasing Complexity:** Now we can order the specimens from the simplest to the most complex silicate structure based on the degree of polymerization (number of shared oxygens per tetrahedron).\n    *   **1st (Least Complex):** C (Olivine - Nesosilicate, 0 shared oxygens)\n    *   **2nd:** A (Tourmaline - Cyclosilicate, 2 shared oxygens)\n    *   **3rd:** B (Mica - Phyllosilicate, 3 shared oxygens)\n    *   **4th (Most Complex):** D (Quartz - Tectosilicate, 4 shared oxygens)\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe identified minerals are Olivine (C), Tourmaline (A), Mica (B), and Quartz (D). Arranged in order of increasing silicate structure complexity, the sequence is C, A, B, D.\n\n***\n\n**Identification:**\n*   **A:** Tourmaline (Cyclosilicate)\n*   **B:** Mica (Phyllosilicate)\n*   **C:** Olivine (Nesosilicate)\n*   **D:** Quartz (Tectosilicate)\n\n**Order of increasing silicate structure complexity:** C, A, B, D\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
