The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the constrained cyclic structure of the N-acetyl-proline starting material. This rigidity prevents a substituent-scrambling process that occurs with the acyclic starting material used in Reactions 1 and 2. The isotopic labeling in Reaction 2 reveals that for the acyclic substrate, an equilibrium is established prior to the cycloaddition that scrambles the N-acetyl and Cα-substituents, leading to a loss of regiochemical information from the starting material. Since the two methyl groups in Reaction 1 are identical, this scrambling is degenerate and goes unnoticed without labeling, coincidentally yielding a single product. In Reaction 3, the proline's ring structure makes this scrambling impossible. Consequently, only a single, well-defined bicyclic Münchnone intermediate is formed, which then undergoes an intrinsically regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to give a single product (Product B). Therefore, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish both the existence of the scrambling mechanism for acyclic substrates and the inherent regioselectivity of the cycloaddition step, highlighting that the lack of this scrambling pathway in Reaction 3 is the reason for its observed high regioselectivity.
