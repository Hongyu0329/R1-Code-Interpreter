    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Aromatic signals are present in the NMR spectra (see below), suggesting a benzene ring (C₆H₅, mass = 77).\n    *   Mass of one nitrogen atom = 14.\n    *   Remaining mass = 135 - 77 (for C₆H₅) - 14 (for N) = 44.\n    *   A mass of 44 can be accounted for by a C₃H₈ fragment (3 * 12 + 8 * 1 = 44).\n    *   Combining these fragments gives a plausible molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N (C₆+C₃ = C₉, H₅+H₈ = H₁₃). Let's verify the mass: (9 * 12) + (13 * 1) + (1 * 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the M+ peak.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 12/2 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring), which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two distinct peaks are visible in this region. This is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching for sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic).\n*   **~3000-2850 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching for sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹:** These bands are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR:** There are 7 unique carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 (aromatic region), and 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 (aliphatic region). This indicates 7 distinct carbon environments in the molecule.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This spectrum distinguishes carbon types based on the number of attached protons.\n    *   **Positive signals (5):** CH or CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Negative signal (1):** CH₂ group.\n    *   Since there are 7 signals in the ¹³C NMR but only 6 (5 positive + 1 negative) in the DEPT-135, one signal must correspond to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached protons).\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **δ 145.1:** This signal is in the aromatic region and absent from DEPT-135. It must be the quaternary aromatic carbon (Cq).\n    *   **δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3:** These are aromatic CH carbons.\n    *   **δ 43.5:** This is likely the CH₂ carbon (the only one giving a negative DEPT signal).\n    *   **δ 49.6:** This is an aliphatic CH or CH₃ carbon. Given its shift, it is likely a CH carbon attached to the electronegative nitrogen atom.\n    *   **δ 19.2:** This is an aliphatic CH or CH₃ carbon, typical for a methyl (CH₃) group.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **~7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This pattern is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-). The integration is not given, but the region is classic for 5 aromatic protons.\n*   **~2.8 ppm (complex signal, integration ~2H):** This corresponds to 2 protons.\n*   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, integration ~1H):** This corresponds to 1 proton. The visible splitting pattern appears to be a multiplet with at least 6 lines (a sextet), indicating it is coupled to 5 adjacent protons.\n*   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ~3H):** This corresponds to 3 protons. A doublet indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n*   **Proton count:** 5H (aromatic) + 2H + 1H + 3H = 11H. The formula C₉H₁₃N has 13 protons. The remaining 2 protons belong to the -NH₂ group confirmed by IR, which often appear as a broad, exchangeable singlet that is not always clearly integrated.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Fragments and Propose a Structure**\n*   We have a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and an aliphatic portion C₃H₆ composed of one CH₃, one CH, and one CH₂ group.\n*   Let's assemble the aliphatic chain using the ¹H NMR splitting patterns:\n    1.  The **3H signal at 1.2 ppm is a doublet**, which means the CH₃ group is next to a CH group. Fragment: **-CH(CH₃)**.\n    2.  The **1H signal at 2.7 ppm is a multiplet (sextet)**, which means the CH proton is adjacent to a total of 5 protons. It is already coupled to the CH₃ group (3H). Therefore, it must also be coupled to a CH₂ group (2H). This gives the connectivity: **-CH₂(CH)-CH₃**.\n    3.  The remaining phenyl group and amine group must be attached to this C₃ chain.\n*   This gives the skeleton: Ph - CH₂ - CH(NH₂) - CH₃.\n*   Let's check this proposed structure, **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**, against all data.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Ph-CH₂-: These are the two benzylic protons (~2.8 ppm). They are adjacent to the CH, so they should be a doublet. However, the adjacent carbon is a chiral center, making these protons diastereotopic. They are expected to show a more complex pattern (like an AB quartet or two doublets of doublets), which is consistent with the complex 2H signal observed.\n        *   -CH(NH₂)-: This is the single proton at ~2.7 ppm. It's coupled to the CH₂ group (2H) and the CH₃ group (3H), for a total of 5 neighbors. This would result in a sextet (n+1=6), matching the observation.\n        *   -CH₃: This is the 3H signal at ~1.2 ppm. It is coupled to the single CH proton, resulting in a doublet. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **¹³C NMR/DEPT:** The structure has 1 Cq, 3 types of aromatic CH, 1 CH₂, 1 CH, and 1 CH₃. Total of 7 unique carbon environments. This matches the data.\n    *   **HSQC:** The HSQC spectrum confirms the direct C-H bonds:\n        *   The protons at ~1.2 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~19 ppm (CH₃).\n        *   The proton at ~2.7 ppm correlates to the carbon at ~50 ppm (CH-NH₂).\n        *   The protons at ~2.8 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~44 ppm (benzylic CH₂).\n        *   The protons at ~7.2 ppm correlate to the carbons at ~126-129 ppm (aromatic CHs).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  The parent chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n2.  The amine group is on carbon 2. So, the parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n3.  There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 1.\n4.  Combining these parts gives the final IUPAC name.\n\nThe structure is confirmed to be 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
