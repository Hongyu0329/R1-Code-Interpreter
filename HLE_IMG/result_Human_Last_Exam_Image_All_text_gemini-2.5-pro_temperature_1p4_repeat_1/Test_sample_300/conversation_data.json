    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**1. Artwork at Top-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a figure painting done in the *gongbi* (meticulous) style, blended with some freehand (*xieyi*) elements, a technique often seen in modern Chinese art. The subject is women from an ethnic minority group. The artist's skill in capturing realistic features and textures, especially of the clothing, is prominent.\n*   **Clues:** The signature and seal in the top right corner are characteristic of the renowned contemporary artist **He Jiaying (何家英)**. He is famous for his elegant and realistic portraits, particularly of women. This work is one of his well-known pieces.\n\n**2. Artwork at Top-Middle:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ink wash painting of a landscape. The style is highly abstract and focuses on lines, shapes, and rhythmic composition rather than realistic depiction. It features buildings nestled within a landscape, reduced to their essential forms.\n*   **Clues:** This distinctive style, which deconstructs and reconstructs landscapes into a semi-abstract visual language, is the hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He was a master at blending Western modernism with Chinese ink painting traditions.\n\n**3. Artwork at Top-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in the cursive script (*caoshu*), often referred to as \"mad cursive\" for its wild, untamed energy and expressive power. The characters are almost abstract, prioritizing artistic flow over legibility.\n*   **Clues:** This extremely dynamic and fluid style is instantly recognizable as the work of the great 20th-century calligrapher **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**, who is celebrated for his mastery of the cursive script.\n\n**4. Artwork at Middle-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another work of Chinese calligraphy, also in a cursive or running script. Compared to the previous one, this style is more controlled, scholarly, and elegant. The characters have a distinct structure and rhythm, slender yet strong.\n*   **Clues:** This unique calligraphic style, known for its grace and scholarly air, is characteristic of **Qi Gong (启功)**, a revered calligrapher, painter, and scholar of the 20th century. His handwriting is one of the most famous and imitated in modern China.\n\n**5. Artwork at Middle-Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a realist oil painting. It portrays a young woman in a simple white t-shirt, holding a sketchbook and pencil, seemingly in the act of drawing. The style shows a strong influence from European classical realism.\n*   **Clues:** This is a famous work of the Chinese Neoclassical movement that emerged in the 1980s. The artist is **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, and this painting, often titled \"Youth\" or \"I Love Oil Painting\", is one of his representative masterpieces.\n\n**6. Artwork at Middle-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a color ink painting of a lady in traditional attire, surrounded by birds and foliage. The work is notable for its square format, flattened perspective, bold use of black ink, and rich color palette. The figure is stylized.\n*   **Clues:** This unique artistic language—blending the spirit of Chinese ink wash with the color and composition of Western Fauvism and Modernism—is the signature style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n\n**7. Artwork at Bottom-Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a vibrant painting depicting a rural courtyard scene with hanging loofah gourds and laundry. The work is characterized by its bright, optimistic colors, decorative patterns, and a composition that combines points, lines, and planes.\n*   **Clues:** The style and subject matter are characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)** (the same artist as the top-middle work). He frequently painted scenes of the Chinese countryside, celebrating its simple beauty with his unique blend of Eastern and Western techniques. The signature \"吴冠中\" is visible on the wall.\n\n**8. Artwork at Bottom-Middle:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (*shanshui*) depicting a majestic river gorge scene with numerous boats. The work is characterized by its dramatic composition, powerful use of layered dark ink (*jimo*), and striking red accents on the sails.\n*   **Clues:** This monumental and heroic style of landscape painting is the signature of **Li Keran (李可染)**. He revolutionized Chinese landscape painting in the 20th century, and this work is a classic example of his style.\n\n**9. Artwork at Bottom-Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The brushwork is minimal yet highly effective, capturing the form, texture, and vitality of the creature with great skill and spontaneity.\n*   **Clues:** Painting shrimps, crabs, and lobsters with such life and masterful simplicity was the specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated Chinese artists of all time. The red seal in the corner is also consistent with his works.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the authors of the nine works, from left to right and top to bottom, are:\n\n1.  He Jiaying (何家英)\n2.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n3.  Lin Sanzhi (林散之)\n4.  Qi Gong (启功)\n5.  Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)\n6.  Lin Fengmian (林风眠)\n7.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n8.  Li Keran (李可染)\n9.  Qi Baishi (齐白石)\n\n<<<He Jiaying, Wu Guanzhong, Lin Sanzhi, Qi Gong, Yang Feiyun, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
