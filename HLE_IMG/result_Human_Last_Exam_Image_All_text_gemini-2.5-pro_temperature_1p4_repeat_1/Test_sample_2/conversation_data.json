    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem.\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Algorithm:** Let's analyze the given Python-like pseudocode for the `sort(a, n)` function.\n    ```python\n    def sort(a, n):\n      if n > 1:\n        # Step 1: First recursive call\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # Step 2: Comparison and potential swap\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n          swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n          \n          # Step 3: Second recursive call (conditional)\n          sort(a, n - 1)\n    ```\n    *   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`, as an array with 0 or 1 element is already sorted. This ensures the algorithm terminates.\n    *   **Recursive Step:**\n        *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This first call sorts the prefix of the array, `a[0...n-2]`.\n        *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the prefix is sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that prefix. This line compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with this largest element.\n        *   `swap(...)` and `sort(a, n - 1)`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`. Now, the element that was just moved into the `n-2` position might be smaller than other elements in the prefix `a[0...n-3]`, making the prefix `a[0...n-2]` unsorted. The algorithm's approach to fix this is to call `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the entire prefix.\n\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The \"worst case\" for time complexity occurs when the algorithm has to do the maximum amount of work. In this code, the maximum work is done when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, because this triggers the second recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`. We need to find an input that makes this condition true as often as possible.\n    Consider an array sorted in descending order, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n    *   Let's analyze `sort(a, 4)` on `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n    *   It first calls `sort(a, 3)`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the prefix `[4, 3, 2]` into `[2, 3, 4]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n    *   Next, it checks `if a[3] < a[2]`, which is `if 1 < 4`. This is true.\n    *   It swaps them, so `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n    *   Because the swap happened, it makes the second recursive call: `sort(a, 3)` on the prefix `[2, 3, 1]`.\n    This pattern, where the smallest element starts at the end and needs to be moved to the front, consistently triggers the `if` condition and the second recursive call. Therefore, a reverse-sorted array represents the worst-case input.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation for the Worst Case:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    *   The `if` comparison and `swap` operation take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call is executed, which also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    Combining these parts, we get the recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n    The base case is `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   ...after `k` steps...\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n    The sum `(2^(k-1) + ... + 1)` is a geometric series that equals `2^k - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n - 1`:\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    *   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity is exponential.\n    `T(n) = O(2^n)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The worst-case time complexity of this sorting algorithm is `O(2^n)`. This is highly inefficient compared to standard sorting algorithms like Merge Sort `O(n log n)` or even Bubble Sort `O(n^2)`.\n\nFinal Answer choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
