    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected by a brace), which is standard notation for piano music.\n*   **Key Signature:** There are four sharps in the key signature (F#, C#, G#, D#). This indicates the key of E major or its relative minor, C# minor. The first full measure (measure 2) features a clear E major chord in the left hand (E-G#-B), strongly suggesting the piece is in E major.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), meaning there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as a quarter note = 80 (♩ = 80), which is a moderate Andante tempo.\n*   **Dynamics and Articulation:** The piece begins softly (*p*, for piano) with a lyrical melody. There is a dramatic and sudden shift to loud (*f*, for forte) in measure 3. Later markings include *mp* (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) and *mf* (mezzo-forte, moderately loud). This wide dynamic range is a key characteristic.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic and Harmonic Features**\n*   **Opening Melody (Measures 1-2):** The most prominent feature is the beautiful and memorable melody in the right hand. It begins on the last beat of measure 1 (anacrusis or pickup) and outlines a very distinctive melodic contour: B-E-D#-C#-B. This is an extremely famous theme in the classical repertoire.\n*   **Texture:** There is a significant contrast in texture. The piece opens with a clear melody-and-accompaniment texture. This is immediately followed in measure 3 by thick, powerful block chords played by both hands, creating a rich, full, and almost orchestral sound. This contrast between gentle lyricism and powerful grandeur is a major clue.\n*   **Harmony:** The harmony is lush and romantic, typical of late 19th or early 20th-century music. It starts solidly in E major, moves through powerful chord progressions, and ventures into related keys like C# minor (measure 4).\n\n**Step 3: Identification**\n*   The opening melody is the main theme from the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18.\n*   Although the concerto is in C minor, its famous second movement is in the contrasting key of E major.\n*   The sheet music provided is a solo piano transcription of the concerto. In the original orchestral version, this famous melody is first introduced by the flute and then the clarinet, accompanied by the piano's gentle arpeggios. The loud, chordal section in measure 3 of this arrangement represents the powerful swell of the full string section of the orchestra that responds to the woodwind melody.\n*   All the analyzed elements—the key of E major, the Andante tempo, the lyrical melody, the rich romantic harmony, and the dramatic shifts in dynamics and texture—perfectly match Rachmaninoff's celebrated work.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe musical excerpt is from a solo piano arrangement of the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto No. 2, 2nd Movement (Adagio sostenuto)>>>"
