    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Determine the ECG calibration:** The information at the top left of the ECG strip indicates a paper speed of **25 mm/sec**. This is the standard speed for ECG recordings. On standard ECG paper, the grid is made of small 1 mm squares and large 5 mm squares.\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 sec / 25 mm = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm * 0.04 sec/mm = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n2.  **Identify the R waves and R-R intervals:** R waves are the tall, sharp upward spikes in the QRS complex. The R-R interval is the time duration between the peaks of two consecutive R waves. The question asks for the longest such interval on the entire strip.\n\n3.  **Visually scan the ECG strip for the longest R-R interval:** By looking at the entire rhythm strip, we can see that the rhythm is irregular. There are multiple rows of the ECG trace. We need to find the largest gap between any two consecutive heartbeats. A prominent pause is clearly visible in the fourth row from the top. This pause appears significantly longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n\n4.  **Measure the longest R-R interval:** Let's focus on the long pause in the fourth row. We need to count the number of squares between the peaks of the R-waves that bound this pause.\n    *   Let's use the large squares for a quick estimate and then refine with small squares. The interval spans slightly more than 7 large squares and less than 8 large squares.\n    *   For a more precise measurement, let's count the small squares. The peak of the R-wave at the beginning of the pause aligns closely with a thick vertical grid line. The peak of the R-wave at the end of the pause falls after 7 full large squares.\n    *   Counting precisely: The interval covers 7 full large squares (which is 7 * 5 = 35 small squares) plus an additional 3 small squares.\n    *   Total number of small squares = 35 + 3 = **38 small squares**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the time in seconds:** Now, we convert the measurement from squares into seconds using the calibration from Step 1.\n    *   Longest R-R interval = (Number of small squares) × (Time per small square)\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 38 squares × 0.04 seconds/square\n    *   Longest R-R interval = **1.52 seconds**.\n\n<<<1.52>>>"
