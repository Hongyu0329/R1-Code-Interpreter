    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks to identify the image that represents the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n2.  **Characterize the FCC lattice:**\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n    *   The basis of an FCC lattice can be described by four atoms in the conventional unit cell, with fractional coordinates: (0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2). All other atom positions are generated by translating these basis atoms by integer multiples of the lattice vectors **a**=[a,0,0], **b**=[0,a,0], **c**=[0,0,a].\n\n3.  **Analyze the viewing direction [110]:**\n    *   The [110] direction corresponds to a vector along the face diagonal of the bottom (or top) face of the cubic unit cell.\n    *   Viewing along this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector. This plane is the (110) plane.\n\n4.  **Determine the projected pattern:**\n    *   We need to determine the arrangement of atoms on the projection plane.\n    *   The projection of the FCC lattice along the [110] direction is a well-known result in crystallography. The resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   Let's understand the geometry of this rectangle. The axes of the projection plane are perpendicular to the [110] direction. Two convenient orthogonal directions are [001] and [1-10].\n    *   The repeating unit cell of the projected pattern is a rectangle with side lengths corresponding to the periodicity along these two directions.\n        *   Along the [001] direction, the periodicity is simply the lattice parameter 'a'.\n        *   Along the [1-10] direction (another face diagonal), the periodicity is a√2.\n    *   Therefore, the projected unit cell is a rectangle with an aspect ratio of (a√2) / a = **√2 ≈ 1.414**.\n    *   The pattern consists of atoms at the corners of this rectangle and one atom at the geometric center of the rectangle. This is due to the stacking of atomic planes along the [110] direction. The planes are of two types (let's call them A and B), which are offset from each other, creating the centered pattern when projected.\n\n5.  **Examine the given images:** We will now evaluate each image against the two key features: (1) a centered rectangular pattern, and (2) an aspect ratio of approximately √2 (or 1/√2 ≈ 0.707).\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular (or square) grid. There is no atom at the center of the rectangles formed by the four nearest neighbors. This does not match the required centered rectangular pattern. This pattern is typical of a [100] view of a cubic lattice.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can identify a rectangle formed by four atoms, with a fifth atom located at its center. Let's check the aspect ratio from the coordinate axes.\n        *   Let's take the rectangle defined by atoms at approximate coordinates (2.5, 3), (7, 3), (2.5, 9), and (7, 9).\n        *   The center atom is at approximately (5, 6), which is the center of the rectangle ((2.5+7)/2, (3+9)/2) = (4.75, 6). The topology is correct.\n        *   The width of the rectangle is W = 7 - 2.5 = 4.5 units.\n        *   The height of the rectangle is H = 9 - 3 = 6 units.\n        *   The aspect ratio is H/W = 6 / 4.5 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33. This value is reasonably close to the theoretical value of √2 ≈ 1.414. The discrepancy (~6%) is acceptable for a schematic representation.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This image can also be interpreted as a centered rectangular pattern. For instance, consider the rectangle formed by atoms at (2.5, 7.5), (8.5, 7.5), and their counterparts at a higher y-value, e.g., (2.5, 18), (8.5, 18). There is a central atom near (5.5, 12).\n        *   The width is W = 8.5 - 2.5 = 6 units.\n        *   The height is H = 18 - 7.5 = 10.5 units.\n        *   The aspect ratio is H/W = 10.5 / 6 = 1.75. This value is very close to √3 ≈ 1.732, but it is significantly different from √2 ≈ 1.414. Therefore, this image does not represent the [110] view of an FCC lattice.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern does not show a clear centered rectangular unit cell. It appears to be two interpenetrating simple rectangular lattices, offset from each other. It does not match the required topology.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Image B is the only one that exhibits the correct topology (a centered rectangle) and a plausible aspect ratio (close to √2) for the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
