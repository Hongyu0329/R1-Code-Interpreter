    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern looks exactly the same when rotated in a full circle (360 degrees). If a pattern looks the same after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees, it has n-fold rotational symmetry. For a periodic tiling on a 2D plane (as this appears to be), the possible rotational symmetries are 1-fold (no symmetry), 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which typically means the highest order of symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we must look for points in the tiling around which a rotation leaves the entire pattern unchanged. The most obvious candidates for such centers are the centers of the prominent, repeating geometric shapes:\n*   The center of a dark blue, hexagon-like shape.\n*   The center of a light yellow, square-like shape.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Rotation Around the Center of a Blue Hexagon**\nLet's choose the center of one of the blue hexagonal shapes as a potential center of rotation.\n*   These blue shapes are arranged in a regular grid. Each blue shape is surrounded by a \"rosette\" of other shapes: six orange rhombi on its sides and six yellow squares at its vertices.\n*   Let's test for 6-fold symmetry. This would mean the pattern is unchanged by a rotation of 360/6 = 60 degrees.\n*   If we rotate the pattern by 60 degrees around the center of a blue hexagon, the hexagon itself rotates onto itself.\n*   Crucially, the surrounding pattern must also map onto itself. Observe that the arrangement of the six yellow squares and six orange rhombi is identical at each of the six corners/sides of the central hexagon.\n*   A 60-degree rotation moves each yellow square to the position of the next yellow square, and each orange rhombus to the position of the next orange rhombus. Extending this observation outwards, the entire tiling appears to map onto itself perfectly.\n*   Therefore, the center of each blue hexagon is a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Rotation Around the Center of a Yellow Square**\nNow, let's test the center of a yellow square as a potential center of rotation.\n*   Let's test for 4-fold symmetry. This would require the pattern to be unchanged by a rotation of 360/4 = 90 degrees.\n*   Rotating by 90 degrees around the center of the square will map the square onto itself.\n*   However, we must check the surrounding pattern. At the corners of the yellow square are four blue hexagons. Let's examine their orientation.\n*   The blue hexagon above the square is oriented with two of its sides being vertical.\n*   The blue hexagon to the right of the square is oriented with two of its sides being horizontal.\n*   A 90-degree rotation would need to map the \"vertical\" hexagon into the position of the \"horizontal\" hexagon. Since their orientations are different, the pattern does not map onto itself.\n*   Therefore, the center of a yellow square is **not** a center of 4-fold rotational symmetry. (A 180-degree rotation does work, so these are centers of 2-fold symmetry).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nWe have found centers of 6-fold rotational symmetry (at the center of the blue hexagons) and centers of 2-fold rotational symmetry (at the center of the yellow squares). According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, a pattern can have multiple types of rotational symmetry centers, but it is characterized by its highest order. Since we have found 6-fold symmetry, and disproven 4-fold symmetry, the highest order of rotational symmetry for this tiling is 6.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
