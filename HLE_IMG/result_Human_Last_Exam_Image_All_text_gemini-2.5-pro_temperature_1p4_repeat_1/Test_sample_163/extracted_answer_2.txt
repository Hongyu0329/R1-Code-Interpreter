The products A and B are the two regioisomers formed by the addition of a tert-butoxy group and a benzoyloxy group across the double bond of styrene. Their structures are:
**Product A:**
```
     OOCPh
     |
 Ph--CH--CH₂--O-tBu 
```
(2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate)

**Product B:**
```
     OtBu
     |
 Ph--CH--CH₂--OOCPh
```
(1-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate)
Here Ph represents a phenyl group (C₆H₅), OOCPh represents a benzoyloxy group (C₆H₅COO), and O-tBu represents a tert-butoxy group (O-C(CH₃)₃).
