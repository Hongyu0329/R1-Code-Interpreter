    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image shows a bright yellow-orange organism with a foliose (leafy) structure growing on a rock. It has small, disc-like structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). This organism is a lichen. Given its appearance and typical habitat on rocks in coastal regions like Acadia National Park, it is identifiable as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen or common orange lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the protein in question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. XPH1 is the name of a specific gene that encodes a protein. We need to find out what this protein is and its properties in *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Find information about the XPH1 protein in scientific databases.**\nTo find specific molecular data like protein length, we must consult biological databases. The standard procedure is to search a reputable database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n*   A search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1 protein\" reveals that XPH1 is a Class II photolyase. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation, which is a critical function for an organism that lives exposed to sunlight.\n*   Searching the NCBI protein database for this protein yields the entry with the accession number **AAL88185.1**.\n*   The record for AAL88185.1 is for the \"photolyase\" from \"*Xanthoria parietina*\".\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nThe database entry for the protein provides its full sequence and metadata, including its total length. According to the NCBI record for accession AAL88185.1, the full-length XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* is composed of **549** amino acids. This information is consistent across other databases like UniProt (accession Q70JA9).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Accurate Identification:** The identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is a key first step. Its distinct color, form, and habitat make this a highly probable identification.\n*   **Database Reliability:** Using authoritative scientific databases (like NCBI) is essential for obtaining accurate molecular information.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The question is very specific, asking for the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein, not any other protein or a different metric.\n*   **Protein Version:** Protein sequences in databases can be updated. We are using the current, standard reference sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and looking up its XPH1 protein sequence in the NCBI database, we can determine its length. The encoded XPH1 protein has 549 amino acids.\n\n<<<549>>>"
