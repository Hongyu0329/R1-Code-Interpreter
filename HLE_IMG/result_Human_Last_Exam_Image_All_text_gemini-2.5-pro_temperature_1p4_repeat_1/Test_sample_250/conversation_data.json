    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There is one flat (Bb) in the key signature. This indicates the key is either F Major or its relative minor, D minor.\n    *   **First Chord:** The piece begins on an F- (F minor) chord. The final chord of the piece is also F. This strongly suggests the overall key is **F minor**.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature appears to be 4/4 (common time). The rhythmic feel and measure structure are consistent with this.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression (Harmony):**\n    *   **A-Section (First 8 bars):** The piece opens with a very distinctive descending harmonic line. The root notes of the chords in the first four bars are F -> E -> Eb -> Db.\n        *   `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`\n        *   This \"line clich√©\" where a note (often in the bass or an inner voice) moves chromatically downwards is a hallmark of certain standards. The progression is very characteristic.\n    *   **B-Section (Bridge):** The section beginning on the third staff starts with a `D-7b5` chord.\n        *   `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |`\n        *   `Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n        *   This progression uses a series of ii-V and V-I patterns. `D-7b5 - G7` is a ii-V in C minor. `Bb-7 - Eb7 - Ab` is a clear ii-V-I in Ab major (the relative major of F minor). This harmonic movement is typical for the bridge of a standard AABA form tune.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The first few notes of the melody are very recognizable.\n    *   **Bar 1 (on F-):** The melody is a C held for three beats, moving to an F. This corresponds to the first two syllables of \"Yes-ter-days\".\n    *   **Bar 2 (on E-7b5):** The melody is G then C.\n    *   **Bar 3 (on Eb-6):** The melody is Ab then C.\n    *   This melodic contour, combined with the underlying harmony, is iconic.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Identify:**\n    *   The combination of the key (F minor), the unique descending chromatic progression in the A-section (`F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`, `Dbmaj7`), the melody, and the harmonic structure of the bridge all point conclusively to one famous jazz standard.\n    *   **Title:** \"Yesterdays\"\n    *   **Composer:** The music was written by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognizing non-standard chord notation like \"F-\" for F minor and \"E-7b5\" for E half-diminished.\n*   Identifying the descending chromatic line in the harmony as the primary clue.\n*   Confirming the identification by matching the melody and the bridge section's harmony.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
