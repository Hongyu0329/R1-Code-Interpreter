    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Kakuro Rules**\nThe objective is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black squares are \"clues\" representing the sum of the digits in a connected line of white squares (a \"run\"). Each digit can only appear once in any given run. The main challenge in this specific puzzle is interpreting the non-standard layout of the clues.\n\n**Step 2: Label the Grid and Identify the Target Squares**\nLet's label the white squares for easier reference. We are interested in the two squares in the top-most row.\n*   Let the left top square be `A`.\n*   Let the right top square be `B`.\n\nThe rest of the grid can be labeled as follows, using letters for cells:\n*   Row 1: `A`, `B`\n*   Row 2: `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`\n*   Row 3: `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`\n*   Row 4: `K`, `L`, `M`\n*   Row 5: `N`, `O`, `P`\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Clues and Formulate Equations**\nWe will interpret the clues based on their position, assuming a standard Kakuro logic where a clue applies to the adjacent run of white cells.\n\n*   **Vertical Column Run 2 (The one containing `A`)**:\n    *   The clue at the very top of this column is `17`. This clue applies to the entire continuous run of white cells below it. This run consists of the cells `A`, `D`, `G`, and `K`. The run stops at `K` because there is a black border between row 4 and row 5 in this column.\n    *   This gives us our first equation: `A + D + G + K = 17`.\n\n*   **Vertical Sub-Run in Column 2**:\n    *   There is a black cell between square `A` and square `D`. This cell contains two clues, `10` and `22`. The clue `10` is above the diagonal line, indicating it's a vertical sum. It applies to the run starting immediately below this clue cell. This run consists of `D`, `G`, and `K`.\n    *   This gives us our second equation: `D + G + K = 10`.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the First Number (A)**\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `A + D + G + K = 17`\n2.  `D + G + K = 10`\n\nWe can substitute the value of `(D + G + K)` from the second equation into the first equation:\n`A + (10) = 17`\n\nSolving for `A`, we find:\n`A = 17 - 10`\n`A = 7`\n\nSo, the number in the top-left white square is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Second Number (B)**\n*   **Horizontal Row Run 1 (The top row)**:\n    *   The clue to the left of the top row (containing `A` and `B`) is `10`. This clue applies to the run of white cells to its right, which consists of `A` and `B`.\n    *   This gives us our third equation: `A + B = 10`.\n\n*   Now, we substitute the value of `A` we found in the previous step (`A = 7`) into this equation:\n    `7 + B = 10`\n\n*   Solving for `B`, we find:\n    `B = 10 - 7`\n    `B = 3`\n\nSo, the number in the top-right white square is 3.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\nThe two numbers present in the two top white squares are 7 and 3.\n\n<<<7,3>>>"
