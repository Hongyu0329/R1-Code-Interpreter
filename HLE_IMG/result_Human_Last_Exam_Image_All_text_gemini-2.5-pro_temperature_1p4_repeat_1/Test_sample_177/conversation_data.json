    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the Baseline (Table 1) and Proposed (Table 2) scenarios.\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for **Car VMT** (Vehicle Miles Traveled), which measures the miles traveled by cars, regardless of how many people are inside. We should not use the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures, as those would be needed for calculating Person Miles Traveled (PMT).\n2.  **Weighted Calculation:** The VMT must be calculated for each distance category (bin) and then summed. We cannot use the \"Total\" column for mode share, as that would ignore the different trip lengths.\n3.  **Total Car Share:** For each distance category, the total share of trips made by car is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n4.  **Relative Calculation:** Since the absolute number of total trips is not provided, we can calculate a representative \"VMT Index\" for each scenario. This is done by weighting the mileage of each trip type by its frequency. The relative comparison (percentage reduction) will be accurate.\n\n---\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\nThe VMT Index for each category is calculated as:\n(Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share) × (Average Trip Distance)\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.48 (trips share) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (miles) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.22 (trips share) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (miles) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.14 (trips share) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (miles) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.16 (trips share) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (miles) = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n---\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation with the data from the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.48 (trips share) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (miles) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.22 (trips share) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (miles) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.14 (trips share) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (miles) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Index contribution = 0.16 (trips share) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (miles) = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n---\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   Baseline VMT Index = 4.7077\n*   Proposed VMT Index = 2.2505\n*   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
