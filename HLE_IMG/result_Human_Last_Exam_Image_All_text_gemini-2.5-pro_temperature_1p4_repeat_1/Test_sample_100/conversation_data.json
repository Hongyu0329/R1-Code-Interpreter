    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   First, we need to determine the molecular formula of the starting material. The structure is a bicyclic lactam with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Bicyclic lactam core with CF3 group**: The core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. Let's count the atoms systematically:\n        *   Carbons (C): There are 6 carbons in the bicyclic framework (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7) and 1 carbon in the CF3 group. Total = 7 C.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): There is 1 H at C1, 1 H at C4, 1 H at C5, and 2 H at the C7 bridge. Total = 5 H.\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1 N.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 O in the carbonyl group.\n        *   Fluorine (F): 3 F in the CF3 group.\n        *   The formula for this part is C7H5F3NO.\n    *   **p-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) group**: This group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n        *   Carbons (C): 1 (methylene) + 6 (benzene ring) + 1 (methoxy) = 8 C.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 2 (methylene) + 4 (benzene ring) + 3 (methoxy) = 9 H.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 O in the methoxy group.\n        *   The formula for the PMB group is C8H9O.\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material**: Adding the two parts together:\n    *   C: 7 + 8 = 15\n    *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: The starting material reacts with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n*   **Transformation**: CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amides. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula**: We remove the PMB group (-C8H9O) and add a hydrogen atom (+H).\n    *   Change in C: -8\n    *   Change in H: -9 + 1 = -8\n    *   Change in O: -1\n    *   Starting from C15H14F3NO2, we get:\n        *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n        *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n        *   F: 3 (no change)\n        *   N: 1 (no change)\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C7H6F3NO**. The structure is the bicyclic lactam without the PMB group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). The lactam (amide) carbonyl group is typically not reduced under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula**: The reduction of a double bond involves the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n    *   Starting from C7H6F3NO, we add H2:\n        *   C: 7 (no change)\n        *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n        *   F: 3 (no change)\n        *   N: 1 (no change)\n        *   O: 1 (no change)\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C7H8F3NO**. The structure is the corresponding saturated bicyclic lactam.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N HCl.\n*   **Transformation**: This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The strong acid and heat will hydrolyze the lactam (cyclic amide) bond. This process breaks the C-N bond within the ring by adding a molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), which would be protonated to -NH3+ under the acidic conditions.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula**: The hydrolysis of an amide adds one molecule of water (H2O) to the substrate. We calculate the formula for the neutral product molecule.\n    *   Starting from C7H8F3NO, we add H2O:\n        *   C: 7 (no change)\n        *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   F: 3 (no change)\n        *   N: 1 (no change)\n        *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C7H10F3NO2**. This product is a substituted cyclopentane-amino acid.\n\n**Summary of Formula Changes:**\n*   **Starting Material**: C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Step 1 (-PMB, +H)**: → C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\n*   **Step 2 (+H2)**: → C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\n*   **Step 3 (+H2O)**: → C7H10F3NO2 (Product)\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
