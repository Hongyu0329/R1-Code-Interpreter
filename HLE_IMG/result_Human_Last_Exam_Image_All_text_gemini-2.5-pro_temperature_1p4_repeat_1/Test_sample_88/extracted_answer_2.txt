The structures of the three products are:

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** The aldol-type adduct of the initial cycloaddition product (an enamine) and acetaldehyde.
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** The main cycloaddition product. It's the N-oxide of the aromatized [3+2] cycloadduct between the azomethine ylide derived from the starting material and methyl propiolate. Its structure is methyl 4-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-4-oxido-7,8-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-6-carboxylate (regioisomer shown).
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** The mixed anhydride formed from the reaction of the starting material's carboxylic acid group with acetic anhydride.

Here is the likely structure for the main product, B:
[Image of the chemical structure of Product B, which is methyl 4-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-4-oxido-7,8-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-6-carboxylate. It shows a pyrrolidine ring fused to a pyrrole ring. The shared nitrogen is depicted as an N-oxide. This nitrogen is also attached to a 1-pyrroline ring. The pyrrole ring has a methoxycarbonyl substituent.]
